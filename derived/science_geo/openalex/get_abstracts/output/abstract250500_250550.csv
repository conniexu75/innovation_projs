Whereas a role for HDAC1 and -2 in mediating components of the HDAC inhibitor response has been reported, the role of HDAC3 is unknown. Here we demonstrate increased protein expression of HDAC3 in human colon tumors and in duodenal adenomas from Apc1638N/+ mice. HDAC3 was also maximally expressed in proliferating crypt cells in normal intestine. Silencing of HDAC3 expression in colon cancer cell lines resulted in growth inhibition, a decrease in cell survival, and increased apoptosis. Similar effects were observed for HDAC2 and, to a lesser extent, for HDAC1. HDAC3 silencing also selectively induced expression of alkaline phosphatase, a marker of colon cell maturation. Concurrent with its effect on cell growth, overexpression of HDAC3 and other Class I HDACs inhibited basal and butyrate-induced p21 transcription in a Sp1/Sp3-dependent manner, whereas silencing of HDAC3 stimulated p21 promoter activity and expression. However, the magnitude of the effects elicited by silencing of individual Class I HDACs was significantly less than that induced by HDAC inhibitors. These findings identify HDAC3 as a gene deregulated in human colon cancer and as a novel regulator of colon cell maturation and p21 expression. These findings also demonstrate that multiple Class I HDACs are involved in repressing p21 and suggest that the growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects induced by HDAC inhibitors are probably mediated through the inhibition of multiple HDACs.

Acetylation of DNA-bound core histones and sequence-specific transcription factors is a fundamental mechanism of transcriptional regulation. Histone acetylation is typically associated with increased transcription (1Peterson C.L. Laniel M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and is regulated by two opposing classes of enzymes: histone acetyltransferases, which add acetyl groups to specific amino acids of the histone protein, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; SAHA, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; SAHA, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. which catalyze their removal. A second mechanism by which HDACs may regulate gene transcription is by regulating acetylation of DNA sequence-specific transcription factors. Examples include p53, E2F, and Sp3, where deacetylation has been linked to reduced DNA binding or transcriptional activity (2Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Through these mechanisms, HDACs are emerging as critical regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptotic programs. We and others have demonstrated that inhibitors of HDACs, such as sodium butyrate, trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and valproic acid, induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines in vitro (5Mariadason J.M.

These observations suggest a physiological role for transcriptional repression mediated by HDACs in maintaining cell proliferation and survival and inhibiting differentiation. Correspondingly, the deregulation of HDAC-mediated transcriptional repression has been linked to tumorigenesis. The up-regulated expression of HDAC1 and -2 has been demonstrated in human cancers (11Huang B.H. Laban M. Leung C.H. Lee L. Lee C.K. Salto-Tellez M. Raju G.C. Hooi S.C.

Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The potential of HDAC inhibitors as anti-cancer agents has been recognized for some time (13Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), and several, such as depsipeptide, SAHA, MS-275, and valproic acid, are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of hemopoietic and solid tumors (14Mei S. Ho A.D. Mahlknecht U. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 1509-1519PubMed Google Scholar). Eighteen mammalian histone deacetylases have been identified to date and have been classified based upon their homology to a prototypical HDAC found in yeast. Class I HDACs (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8) show homology to the yeast HDAC, Rpd3; class II HDACs have a high degree of homology to Hda-1 (15Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); and class III HDACs are homologous to the yeast Sir2 HDAC (16Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelley W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitors that have been utilized in the in vivo and in vitro studies described above are, in general, nonspecific inhibitors of Class I and II HDACs. Consistent with the ability of HDAC inhibitors to induce intestinal cell maturation in colon cancer cell lines, the class I HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC2, are up-regulated in expression in colon tumors (11Huang B.H. Laban M. Leung C.H. Lee L. Lee C.K. Salto-Tellez M. Raju G.C. Hooi S.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), repress p21 expression, promote cell proliferation and survival in vitro (11Huang B.H. Laban M. Leung C.H. Lee L.

Commun. 2003; 310: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and are important mediators of intestinal development and differentiation in vivo (19Tou L. Liu Q. Shivdasani R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3132-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The overlapping functions of HDAC1 and -2 may be a consequence of their co-existence within the same co-repressor complexes (Sin3A, NuRD). The role of other class I and II HDACs in regulating colon cell proliferation is unknown. Although structurally related to HDAC1 and -2, HDAC3 is a component of the NCoR-SMRT co-repressor complex, which is distinct from co-repressor complexes that typically contain HDAC1 and -2. Whether inhibition of HDAC3 is a component of the HDAC inhibitor response and whether it plays a role in regulating intestinal cell proliferation and maturation is presently unknown. Here we show that, like for HDAC1 and -2, expression of HDAC3 is up-regulated in colon tumors and down-regulated during normal epithelial cell maturation along the small intestinal crypt-villus and colonic crypt axes in vivo. Silencing of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference induced a G2/M growth arrest and stimulated p21 promoter activity and protein expression. Silencing of HDAC1 and HDAC2 also induced p21. The stimulatory effects on p21 expression and suppression of cell growth elicited by silencing of individual class I HDACs, however, was significantly less than that induced by HDAC inhibitors. These studies therefore identify a novel role for HDAC3 in repressing p21 and demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors probably exert their effects on intestinal cell proliferation by inhibition of multiple HDACs. Cell Culture—The HCT116 and Caco-2 colon cancer cell lines and the FHs normal human small intestinal cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All were maintained by serial passage at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B), 100 μm nonessential amino acids, and 10 mm HEPES buffer solution (all from Invitrogen). The following HDAC inhibitors were utilized. The sodium salt of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and TSA were purchased from Sigma, and SAHA was from Biovision Inc. (Mountain View, CA). Microarrays—All cDNA microarrays used in these studies were generated by the microarray facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and experiments were performed as previously described (20Mariadason J.M. Nicholas C. L'Italien K.E. Zhuang M. Smartt H.J.M. Heerdt B.G. Yang W. Corner G.A. Wilson A.J. Klampfer L. Arango D. Augenlicht L.H. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Paired Human Tumor and Normal Colon Samples—Ten human colorectal tumors with paired adjacent normal tissue were collected following surgical resection at Montefiore Medical Center through an institutional review board-approved protocol and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Changes in Gene Expression along the Intestinal Crypt-Villus Axis— Enterocytes were sequentially isolated along the mouse small intestinal crypt-villus axis as previously described (20Mariadason J.M. Nicholas C. L'Italien K.E. Zhuang M. Smartt H.J.M. Heerdt B.G. Yang W. Corner G.A. Wilson A.J. Klampfer L. Arango D. Augenlicht L.H.

Diamond J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G1047-G1059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment was performed on four independent occasions, each time using a single adult male C57BL/6 mouse, 13 weeks of age. Ten fractions of cells were collected, with fraction 1 highly enriched for cells from the villus tip and fraction 10 enriched for cells from the crypts. Total RNA was extracted from enterocytes isolated from each fraction using the Rneasy RNA isolation kit from Qiagen (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Linear amplification of 5 μg of total RNA was then performed using T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription (KIT 0201; Arcturus), and 5 μg of the amplified product was used for probe labeling for microarray analysis. For the microarray experiments, gene expression changes in 6 of the 10 fractions were determined (Fractions 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). In each case, 5 μg of poly(U) RNA from fraction 10 (crypt cells) served as the control and was labeled with Cy3 dUTP. 5 μg of RNA from Fractions 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively, were labeled with Cy5 dUTP and served as the experimental condition. Labeled probes were combined and hybridized to 27,000 element mouse cDNA arrays. Methods utilized for data normalization and identifying differentially expressed sequences have been previously described (20Mariadason J.M. Nicholas C. L'Italien K.E. Zhuang M. Smartt H.J.M.

Immunohistochemistry—A detailed protocol has been previously described (24Velcich A. Yang W. Heyer J. Fragale A. Nicholas C. Viani S. Kucherlapati R. Lipkin M. Yang K. Augenlicht L. Science. 2002; 295: 1726-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Briefly, duodenal and distal colonic tissue from C57BL/6 mice and duodenal adenomas from Apc1638N/+ mice were formalin-fixed and then paraffin-embedded and stored at 4 °C. The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, quenched with 1.5% H2O2 and then blocked with 10% normal goat serum. The following primary antibodies were added to the tissue sections for an overnight exposure at 4 °C: rabbit anti-HDAC1 (1:25 dilution) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-HDAC2 (1:50) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-HDAC3 (1:25) from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), mouse anti-PCNA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (1:100 dilution), and mouse anti-villin from Novocastra Laboratories (1:50; Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). To detect HDAC1 and HDAC3, an additional epitope retrieval step was added; slides were immersed in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min and then washed in distilled water before proceeding with quenching. Detection of primary signal was with either the anti-rabbit or anti-mouse ImmPRESS reagent (Vector Laboratories), followed by incubation with 3′,5′-diaminobenzidine substrate (Vector Laboratories) and hematoxylin counterstaining. Western Blotting—Protein isolation, Western blotting, and signal detection were performed as previously described (25Mariadason J.M. Bordonaro M. Aslam F. Shi L. Kuraguchi M. Velcich A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3465-3471PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-HDAC1 (1:500) was from Imgenex (San Diego, CA), rabbit anti-HDAC2 (1:2000) was from Santa Cruz, and rabbit anti-HDAC3 (1:2000) was from Novus Biologicals. A 3-h incubation was used for all HDAC primary antibodies. Additional antibodies used were mouse anti-PCNA (1:500 dilution), mouse anti-β-actin (1:4000; Sigma), rabbit anti-p21 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-villin (1:2000, Novocastra Laboratories), and rabbit anti-alkaline phosphatase (1:500; Novus Biologicals). Peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG (Roche Applied Science) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution). Transient Transfection Assays—HCT116 and Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 and 5 × 104 cells/well, respectively. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with a series of luciferase-linked p21 promoter reporter constructs (see supplemental Fig. 3A) using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These constructs, along with the Sp1-Luc, mtSp1-Luc, GAL4, GAL4-Sp3, and GAL-DNSp3 constructs also utilized, have been previously described (26Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa S. Nakano K. Mizuno T.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4266-4270PubMed Google Scholar). Also utilized were expression vectors for HDAC1 (pBJ5-FLAG-HDAC1) and a mutant lacking histone deacetylase activity (pBJ5-FLAG-HDAC1–141A) (28Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), HDAC2 (pME18S-FLAG-HDAC2) (29Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), and HDAC3 (pCMV-FLAG-HDAC3) (30Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In experiments involving butyrate, untreated and treated cells were transfected identically and compared by relative fold induction by the drug after correction for total cellular protein. Luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates using the luciferase or dual luciferase assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency was controlled by co-transfection with TK-Renilla. siRNA Experiments—Expression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 was selectively silenced by utilizing a pool of four predesigned siRNAs (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Two different nontargeting control siRNAs were used, NT1 and NT2. HCT116 or Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with 100 nm siRNA for 24–120 h, using the Profection (calcium phosphate) transient transfection system (Promega, Madison WI). Validation of silencing of protein expression was performed by Western blot. The sense strands of the individual HDAC siRNA sequences utilized were as follows: HDAC1, CUAAUGAGCUUCCAUACAAUUGAAAGUCUGUUACUACUACUUGGAGGAAAGUCUGUUACUAUUGGACAUCGCUGUGAAUUGGUU; HDAC2, CCAAUGAGUUGCCAUAUAAUUGAAGAAAUGUGGCUGAUCAUUGUAAGCAGAUGCAUAUAUUUUGCAAAGAAAGCUAGAAUUGUU; HDAC3, GGAAAGCGAUGUGGAGAUUUUAAAGCGAUGUGGAGAUUUAUUGCAUUGAUGACCAGAGUUAUUGGAAUGCGUUGAAUAUGUAUU. Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle analyses, HCT116 cells were seeded in triplicate in 6-well plates at a density of 250,000 cells/well. After overnight culture, cells were transfected with NT1 or Class I HDAC siRNA for 24 h. After this time, medium was changed, and the cells were cultured for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h, with medium replaced every 24 h. In parallel, cells treated with the HDAC inhibitors butyrate (2 mm) and SAHA (2 μm) were also cultured. Original cell density was chosen such that the control (NT1) cells reached ∼80% confluence at the 96 h time point. Cells were trypsinized, counted for other assays (see below), and resuspended in 50 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were stained overnight and analyzed for DNA content utilizing a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer. The percentages of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were quantified using ModFit LT for Win32 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Cell Viability Assays—Viability of HCT116 cells following a 24–96-h treatment with Class I HDAC siRNAs or HDAC inhibitors, as described above, was assessed in three ways. First, adherent cell number was counted in a Coulter Counter following trypsinization. Second, a clonogenic assay was employed. Briefly, after a 72-h treatment with Class I HDAC or NT1 siRNA, cells were trypsinized and reseeded in triplicate into 6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. Following culture for 7 days, individual colonies were scored after 1% crystal violet staining utilizing Total Lab 1.1 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC), as previously described (31Mariadason J.M. Arango D. Shi Q. Wilson A.J. Corner G.A. Nicholas C. Aranes M.J. Lesser M. Schwartz E.L. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8791-8812PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, apoptosis was measured as subdiploid DNA content following propidium iodide staining, as previously described (31Mariadason J.M. Arango D. Shi Q. Wilson A.J. Corner G.A. Nicholas C. Aranes M.J. Lesser M. Schwartz E.L. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8791-8812PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in separate experiments performed in 96-well plates, cell viability following 24–96-h treatment with Class I HDAC siRNAs or HDAC inhibitors was measured by incorporation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) (Sigma), as previously described (32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45867) Google Scholar). Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Assay—Caco-2 cells were transfected with NT1 or Class I HDAC siRNAs for 120 h and harvested, and ALP activity assays were performed as previously described (6Mariadason J.M. Rickard K.L. Barkla D.H. Augenlicht L.H. Gibson P.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Validation of silencing of protein expression was performed by Western blot. HDAC3 Expression Is Up-regulated in Human Colon Tumors—We first examined Class I HDAC expression during colorectal tumorigenesis, utilizing 10 paired colon tumor/normal samples obtained from patients who had undergone surgical resection of a colon tumor. Western blot analysis demonstrated that protein expression of HDAC3 was increased by 2.8-fold in the tumor samples compared with adjacent normal tissue (Fig. 1, A and B, p = 0.003). The tumor content of the samples was confirmed by probing for the known colon tumor marker, carcinoembryonic antigen, which was up-regulated in the tumor in 9 of the 10 tissue pairs. Similar to HDAC3, and consistent with the findings of two reports published during the course of these studies (11Huang B.H. Laban M. Leung C.H. Lee L. Lee C.K. Salto-Tellez M. Raju G.C. Hooi S.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Zhu P. Martin E. Mengwasser J. Schlag P. Janssen K.P. Gottlicher M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression was also significantly up-regulated in human colon tumors compared with adjacent normal mucosa (supplemental Fig. 1). HDAC3 was also robustly expressed by each cell line of a panel of 10 established colon cancer cell lines, markedly higher than the expression of HDAC3 observed in a normal small intestinal cell line and in three normal samples from the tissue pairs described above (Fig. 1C). HDAC3 Expression Is Restricted to the Proliferative Compartment of Normal Mouse Small Intestine and Colon and Is Robustly Expressed in Mouse Intestinal Adenomas—We next examined HDAC3 expression by immunohistochemistry in normal mouse intestine and in adenomas derived from Apc1638N/+ mice. These mice harbor an inactivating mutation of APC and develop multiple adenomas in the small intestine (33Yang W.C. Mathew J. Velcich A. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Lipkin M. Yang K. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 565-569PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, HDAC3 expression was nuclear and localized to the proliferative compartment of duodenal crypts (arrows). Duodenal or jejunal tumors from five Apc1638N/+ mice were examined in parallel for HDAC3 expression. Staining was also exclusively nuclear in the epithelial cells from the tumor samples (Fig. 2C). However, ∼90% of cells in each of the tumors examined were positive for HDAC3, markedly higher than the percentage of cells positive in normal duodenal tissue. Maximal expression of HDAC3 in the proliferative crypt compartment in normal small intestine was further confirmed at the mRNA and protein level. Examination of HDAC3 expression along the mouse small intestinal crypt-villus axis, utilizing a cDNA microarray data base previously generated in this laboratory (20Mariadason J.M. Nicholas C. L'Italien K.E. Zhuang M. Smartt H.J.M. Heerdt B.G. Yang W. Corner G.A. Wilson A.J. Klampfer L. Arango D. Augenlicht L.H. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), demonstrated that steady state mRNA levels of HDAC3 were maximal in crypt cells and significantly reduced in cells at the villus tip (Fig. 2D). A similar down-regulation of HDAC3 protein level was observed (Fig. 2E). Similarly to HDAC3, HDAC2 was also robustly down-regulated in villus cells at both the mRNA and protein level, whereas less pronounced changes were observed for HDAC1 (Fig. 2, D–E). Validating the fractionation procedure, mRNA and protein expression of the marker of cell proliferation, PCNA, was maximal in crypt cells, whereas expression of the differentiation marker, villin, was maximal in villus cells (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. 2A). Finally, we examined expression of HDAC3 and other Class I HDACs in normal mouse distal colon by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2, F–J). Similar to our findings in the small intestine, HDAC3 staining was predominantly nuclear, with the highest expression observed at the base of colonic crypts (Fig. 2I). We also extended these findings to examine expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Like HDAC3, expression of HDAC2 was markedly decreased in the differentiated cells of the upper third of the crypt axis (Fig. 2H), although a less pronounced change was observed for HDAC1 (Fig. 2G). We also performed immunohistochemical staining for cells positive for PCNA to validate our results. As expected, PCNA-positive cells were largely confined to the crypt base (Fig. 2J). These changes were confirmed by quantifying cells positive for Class I HDAC or PCNA staining in the lower, middle, and upper third of the crypt (supplemental Fig. 2B). Role of Class I HDACs in Colon Cell Growth, Apoptosis, and Differentiation in Vitro—The confinement of expression of Class I HDACs to the proliferative compartment of normal small intestinal and colonic epithelium suggests that a physiological function of class I HDACs may be to maintain cell proliferation. Consistent with this role, pharmacological inhibition of HDACs in colon cancer cells results in cell cycle arrest and up-regulation of expression of a key regulator of the cell cycle, the Cdk inhibitor p21 (34Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We determined whether these effects of HDAC inhibitors could be mimicked by silencing of individual Class I HDACs to directly test the role of HDAC1 to -3. We first confirmed selective and robust silencing of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 expression, as shown in Fig. 3A. A 72-h treatment with 100 nm siRNA duplexes down-regulated protein levels of the target HDAC by ∼90% in HCT116 cells, whereas two nontargeting control duplexes, NT1 and NT2, had no effect. Similar selective down-regulation of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 mRNA following treatment with the relevant siRNA was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). Cell Growth—Representative histograms showing the effects of Class I HDAC silencing on cell cycle indices in asynchronous HCT116 cells following fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis are presented in Fig. 3B. Silencing of HDAC2 and HDAC3 both induced a significant reduction of the percentage of cells in S phase, whereas HDAC1 induced a more modest reduction. A time course of the effects of Class I HDAC silencing on S phase is shown in Fig. 3C. These data indicate proproliferative roles for these Class I HDACs. The mechanism of growth arrest appeared to differ between HDAC2 and HDAC3 silencing, since HDAC2 silencing induced both a modest increase in the G0/G1 (data not shown) and G2/M cell populations, whereas HDAC3 silencing exclusively induced a G2/M arrest (Fig. 3C). These changes in cell cycle indices were consistent with those induced by HDAC inhibitors (Fig. 3B), but were of a considerably lesser magnitude. We also determined the effects of Class I HDAC silenc"

Assembly of TRPC multimers is incompletely understood. In particular, heteromeric assembly of distantly related TRPC isoforms is still a controversial issue. Because we have previously suggested TRPC proteins as the basis of the redox-activated cation conductance of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs), we set out to analyze the TRPC subunit composition of endogenous endothelial TRPC channels and report here on a redox-sensitive TRPC3-TRPC4 channel complex. The ability of TRPC3 and TRPC4 proteins to associate and to form a cation-conducting pore complex was supported by four lines of evidence as follows: 1) Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in PAECs and in HEK293 cells demonstrated the association of TRPC3 and TRPC4 in the same complex. 2) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated TRPC3-TRPC4 association, involving close proximity between the N terminus of TRPC4 and the C terminus of TRPC3 subunits. 3) Co-expression of TRPC3 and TRPC4 in HEK293 cells generated a channel that displayed distinct biophysical and regulatory properties. 4) Expression of dominant-negative TRPC4 proteins suppressed TRPC3-related channel activity in the HEK293 expression system and in native endothelial cells. Specifically, an extracellularly hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TRPC4 mutant, which is sensitive to blockage by anti-HA-antibody, was found to transfer anti-HA sensitivity to both TRPC3-related currents in the HEK293 expression system and the redox-sensitive cation conductance of PAECs. We propose TRPC3 and TRPC4 as subunits of native endothelial cation channels that are governed by the cellular redox state.

These TRPC proteins assemble to form multimeric pore structures, which enable cation transport across the plasma membrane (6Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Aziz O. Trebak M. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Multimerization of TRPC species has emerged as a complex issue, because both homo- and heteromeric assemblies appear possible and up to three isoforms may contribute to formation of native pore complexes (7Strubing C.

TRPC channel activation was found to be triggered by a variety of stimuli, most prominently phospholipase C-derived signals, including classic Ca2+ store depletion as well as mechanical forces and redox processes (8Hofmann T.

Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 231-225, 263-266): 222-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that TRPC3 is involved in a cation conductance that is activated in response to oxidative stress in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) (14Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TRPC channels may sense redox stress due to oxidation-induced changes in the membrane lipid composition that has been recognized as an important regulator of TRPC channel function (16Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we identified cholesterol oxidase-induced modification of membrane lipid composition and lipid raft structure, as an effective trigger for activation of TRPC3 channels in HEK293 cells (15Groschner K. Rosker C. Lukas M. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 231-225, 263-266): 222-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a TRPC isoform may exist as a homo- and heteromeric channel complex in a given cell type, and multimeric assembly of TRPC complexes may depend on cellular localization and on the availability of specific interacting protein partners (17Schaefer M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and FRET microscopy studies suggested that TRPC3 may form not only homomeric channels but also heteromultimeric pore structures with its close relatives, TRPC6 und TRPC7 (18Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although these investigations excluded heteromers that consist of distant relatives of the TRPC family, other studies provided evidence for heteromerization of TRPC3 with its more distant relative TRPC1 (19Lintschinger B.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Moreover, even the presence of a heteromer consisting of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC5 has been proposed (7Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39014-39019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). For the vascular endothelium the exact subunit composition of native TRPC channels is so far elusive. Here we report evidence for the existence of an endothelial cation channel that represents a TRPC3/C4 heteromer and is sensitive to oxidative modification of plasma membrane cholesterol. Cell Culture and Transfections—Endothelial cells were isolated from porcine aorta as described previously (14Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Only the first passage of cells was used for experiments. Cells were grown to ∼80% confluency in either 100-mm Petri dishes (6 × 106 cells/dish), for biotinylation and immunoblotting experiments, or in 6-well plates (∼106 cells/well) for measurement of membrane currents. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing C-terminal HA-tagged human TRPC3 or the wild-type mouse TRPC4α, designated as T3-9 or T4 - 60 cells (22Zhang Z. Tang Y. Zhu M.X. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 717-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, were established and maintained as previously described (13Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). An extracellularly HA-tagged TRPC3 (exoHA-TRPC3) construct was made by inserting a sequence encoding YPYDVPD before the codons for Y524A525 of human TRPC3, thus creating a complete HA epitope YPYDVPDYA in the putative second extracellular loop of the channel subunit. Similarly, an exoHA-TRPC4α construct was created by inserting codons for PYDVPDYA after that of Tyr-458 of the wild-type TRPC4α. The N-terminal fragment N292-TRPC4, including two ankyrin-like repeats and the coiled-coil region of the mouse TRPC4β isoform, was obtained by internal restriction site RsaI and the multicloning site KpnI. This fragment was subcloned in pTracer-CMV-II for electrophysiology and in pEY/CFP-C1 for both electrophysiology and FRET measurements. T3-9 cells were transiently co-transfected with exoHA-TRPC3 or exoHA-TRPC4 and YFP with Transfast™ Transfection Reagent (Promega Corp., Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some experiments were performed with wild-type HEK293 cells, which were cultured in the absence of Geneticin. PAECs were transiently co-transfected with exoHA-tagged TRPC species and YFP as a transfection marker using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For FRET and competition FRET experiments, CFP and YFP fusions of TRPC proteins were transiently co-transfected into wild-type HEK293 cells or in cells stably expressing TRPC3 or TRPC4 (T3-9 or T4-60 cells), respectively. Biotinylation of Cell-surface Membrane Proteins—PAECs were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm CaCl2 (DPBS, pH 8) and incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in DPBS. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by washing the cells three times with ice-cold DPBS containing 100 mm glycine. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off from the dishes in PBS, and centrifuged at 4 °C. The pellets were re-suspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland)) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by adding cleared cell lysate (500 μg) to 60 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) in a total volume of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. The samples were gently rotated end over end overnight at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,000 × g, and the pellets (representing surface proteins) were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The biotinylated cell-surface proteins were eluted from the streptavidin-agarose beads in 60 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, incubated at 60 °C for 30 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—The cell lysates from PAECs and T3-9 transiently transfected with YFP-TRPC4, obtained as described above, were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by preincubation of supernatants (500 μg) with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and subsequent gently rotated for 1 h at 4°C. Precleared supernatants were incubated with 3 μg of antibody either against TRPC3, against TRPC4, or against HA overnight at 4 °C under rotation. Subsequently, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to the immune complex for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μlof2× Laemmli buffer, and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates, biotinylated samples, and immunocomplexes were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with PBS containing 5% Bio-Rad blocking reagent overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with polyclonal antibodies against TRPC4 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), against TRPC3 (produced in our laboratory), or against GFP (1:1,000, Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5,000, 1 h). Membranes were detected via the Chemi Glow™ West detection system and developed using a Herolab RH-5.2 Darkroom Hood, equipped with an E.A.S.Y. 1.3 HC camera (Herolab GmbH, Wiesloch, Germany). Measurement of Membrane Currents—Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark, Electromedical Instruments, Reading, England) and had a resistance of either 3-5 MΩ (whole cell recording) or 8-10 MΩ (single channel recording). Pipettes were filled either with a solution containing 120 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA for whole cell experiments or 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES for cell-attached recording experiments. In whole cell recordings, cells were perfused with a solution containing either 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl (nominally Ca2+ free) or a buffer, additionally including 2 mm CaCl2 (plus Ca2+). In single channel (cell-attached) experiments, the bath solution contained 145 mm potassium gluconate, 5.3 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 15 mm HEPES. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.4. Cells were stimulated with either 200 μm carbachol (CCh), 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) or 0.5 unit/ml cholesterol oxidase. For some experiments cells were incubated with a HA-antibody (for 1 h, 1:200 in bath solution). Currents were recorded using a List EPC7 patch clamp amplifier (List-Medical-Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany). Single channel currents were filtered at 1 kHz (low pass, -3 dB), digitized at a sampling rate of 5 kHz, and analyzed with pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Voltage clamp protocols (voltage ramps from -80 to +50 mV or -100 to +80 mV/0.6 V/s, 0.2 Hz, holding potential -70 mV) were controlled by pClamp9 software. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—Transfected HEK293 cells grown on coverslips for 2 days were transferred to an extracellular solution identical to the bath solution used in functional experiments (see above). A MultiSpec Imager (Visitron Systems Gmbh, Puchheim, Germany) was used for separating FRET images and was connected to a Photometrics CoolSNAP fx-HQ monochrome camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). This system was attached to an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) in conjunction with a VisiChrome high speed polychromator (Visitron Systems). Used filter sets (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) included a 485 cyan emission filter set (MultiSpec) and a 535 yellow emission filter set. MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA) was used to acquire images and to control the system. Images were analyzed using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) The FRET image must be corrected due to cross-talk from one channel to other. For this, the corrected FRET image (nFRET) was calculated after background subtraction using the sensitized emission correction method according to nFRET = rawFRET - corrD*Idonor - corrA*Iacceptor. The calibration factors, representing relative cross-talk fluorescence between the donor and acceptor channels, were obtained from experiments where only CFP or YFP was expressed (corrD = 0.4, corrA = 0.1). For statistical analysis, the mean cellular nFRET intensity in 5-10 cells was determined after background correction. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean value ± S.E. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 using Student's t test for unpaired values. Oxidative Stress Activates a Voltage-insensitive, Non-selective Cation Channel in PAECs and in T3-9 Cells—TRPC3 was previously found to contribute to the oxidative stress-induced conductance of PAECs (14Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As a further step to analyze the role of TRPC3 as a redox sensor, we compared responses of PAECs and HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPC3 (T3-9) to oxidative stress. Plasma membrane-delimited redox stress was introduced by incubation with cholesterol oxidase (0.5 unit/ml, 45 min). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), both cell types displayed a large increase in the membrane conductance in response to cholesterol oxidase. Fairly linear current to voltage relations and reversal potentials of ∼-25 mV and -10 mV were recorded in PAECs and T3-9 cells, respectively. The observed ability of TRPC3 to generate a redox-sensitive cation conductance upon overexpression supported the view of TRPC3 as a major component of the native redox-sensitive cation channel. A comparison of the redox sensitivity determined for wild-type HEK293 cells and T3-9 cells, using both the membrane permeable oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) and cholesterol oxidase to introduce redox stress, is illustrated in Fig. 1C. The results demonstrate that TRPC3-overexpressing cells (T3-9) displayed an oxidant stress-induced membrane conductance that was virtually lacking in wild-type cells, suggesting that cation channels formed by TRPC3 in HEK293 cells, which are sensitive to oxidative stress. Notably, the TRPC3-dependent redox-activated membrane conductances displayed a strikingly linear current to voltage relation, which is not perfectly in line with the typical characteristics of classic phospholipase C-regulated TRPC3 conductance observed in HEK293 cells. Endogenous TRPC3 and TRPC4 Associate in PAECs to Form a Plasma Membrane-targeted Complex—To further analyze the composition of native, redox-sensitive TRPC channels in PAECs, we performed biotinylation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments to screen for plasma membrane-expressed TRPC species and for possible heteromerization. In initial immunoblotting experiments immunoreactivity of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 and, albeit at a low level, of TRPC6 was detected in PAEC homogenates (data not shown). However, in cell-surface biotinylation experiments only TRPC3 and TRPC4 were detectable as plasma membrane-targeted TRPC species (Fig. 2A). The presence of both TRPC3 and TRPC4 in the plasma membrane of PAECs prompted us to investigate a possible heteromeric assembly of these TRPC species by immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 2B, TRPC4 was detectable in anti-TRPC3 precipitates and vice versa. These data suggest the existence of a TRPC3-TRPC4 heteromer, representing a potential redox-sensitive channel complex in PAECs. Association of TRPC3 and TRPC4 Proteins in the HEK293 Expression System—As a next step to test the ability of TRPC3 and TRPC4 proteins to interact physically, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with T3-9 cells that were additionally transfected to express YFP-tagged TRPC4. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitation of the C-terminally HA-tagged TRPC3 from T3-9 homogenates using anti-HA clearly recovered YFP immunoreactivity, displaying the expected size for the YFP-TRPC4 fusion (∼130 kDa). Similarly, anti-TRPC3 immunoprecipitates derived from T3-9 cells transfected to express TRPC4 recovered significant TRPC4 immunoreactivity (data not shown), whereas the anti-TRPC3 failed to pull down TRPC4 in the T4 - 60 cell line, which lacks significant TRPC3 expression (not shown). Controls for specificity of the anti-TRPC4 antibody were performed in both HEK293 wild-type and T3-9 cells and confirmed that proteins with a molecular mass corresponding to that of TRPC4 are not detectable with these antibodies in the HEK293 system (not shown). In an attempt to further test and analyze TRPC3-TRPC4 association, we used expression of CFP and YFP fusion proteins of TRPC3 and TRPC4 proteins to perform FRET analysis of this interaction. Because a previous study, which tested for TRPC3-TRPC4 interactions, did not detect any FRET signal using C-terminal fusion proteins (17Schaefer M. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we tested whether C-N type interactions are detectable. Fig. 3B illustrates the results of FRET microscopy in cells that expressed CFP/YFP fusion proteins in which the fluorophors were linked to the N and C termini of the species, respectively, as outlined in the scheme shown below the micrographs. We observed a significant FRET signal that was localized in the plasma membrane region of the cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Moreover, competition FRET experiments were performed to test for the ability of TRPC4 to disrupt the relatively robust homomeric interaction within TRPC3 complexes. As illustrated in Fig. 3B (middle panel), co-expression of YFP- and CFP-tagged TRPC3 fusion resulted in substantial FRET, which was markedly suppressed when TRPC4 was expressed in addition to the TRPC3 FRET partners (Fig. 3, B, lower panel, and C). These results demonstrate interaction of full-length TRPC3 and TRPC4 proteins in the HEK293 expression system. The PLC- and Redox-activated TRPC3 Cation Conductances Recorded in the HEK293 Expression System Are Inhibited by Dominant Negative TRPC4 Mutants—The concept of heteromeric interaction implies that dominant negative mutants of one specie are likely to suppress the channel function generated by the other TRPC species. We therefore set out to study the effect of dominant negative TRPC4 constructs on TRPC3 currents. Two different approaches were employed to test for sensitivity of TRPC3 to dominant negative suppression by TRPC4 proteins. As we have previously found that N-terminal fragments of TRP proteins are highly effective as dominant negative constructs (2Groschner K. Hingel S. Lintschinger B. Balzer M. Romanin C. Zhu X. Schreibmayer W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we co-expressed full-length TRPC3 with an N-terminal fragment (1-292 amino acids) of TRPC4. Expression of this N-terminal TRPC4 fragment significantly suppressed the carbachol-activated TRPC3-mediated currents typically recorded in the HEK293 expression system (Fig. 4A). In a second approach, we co-expressed TRPC3 with an exoHA-tagged TRPC4(α) protein, which by itself, did not inhibit the CCh-induced conductance mediated by TRPC3. Nonetheless, this construct introduced a significant sensitivity of the CCh-activated TRPC3 channel activity to block by anti-HA antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, TRPC3-related currents in T3-9 cells were virtually lacking in exoHA-TRPC4-expressing cells incubated with anti-HA antibody. Thus, we observed generation of anti-HA sensitivity of a TRPC3-related conductance by co-expression of an exoHA-TRPC4 construct indicating the ability of the TRPC4 construct to form a pore complex with TRPC3. Similarly, expression of exoHA-TRPC4 generated a significant anti-HA sensitivity of the TRPC3 currents activated by cholesterol oxidase as illustrated in Fig. 4 (C and D). Again, expression of the exoHA-tagged TRPC4 construct itself did not suppress the cholesterol oxidase-induced currents in T3-9 cells but generated sensitivity of this conductance to block by anti-HA antibody. The cholesterol oxidase-induced current was completely abolished by anti-HA preincubation, indicating that the TRPC4 construct is effectively incorporated into the redox-sensitive TRPC3-related pore complex. As shown in Fig. 4D, redox-activated currents in sham-transfected T3-9 cells were perfectly insensitive to anti-HA incubation. The Redox-activated Cation Conductance of PAECs Is Inhibited by Dominant Negative Exo-tagged TRPC3 and TRPC4 Mutants—The involvement of both TRPC3 and TRPC4 in the cholesterol oxidase-activated conductance of PAECs was finally tested by patch-clamp experiments in PAECs, transiently transfected to express either exoHA-TRPC3 or exoHA-TRPC4. As shown in Fig. 5A, anti-HA antibody incubation of PAECs transfected to express either exoHA-tagged TRPC species significantly suppressed the redox stress-induced membrane current (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows representative current to voltage relationships derived by voltage ramp protocols in cholesterol oxidase-treated PAECs, which were transiently transfected with exoHA-tagged TRPC4. Expression of exoHA-tagged TRPC species by itself did not prevent the redox-activated conductance but generated anti-HA sensitivity similar to that observed in T3-9 cells (Fig. 4C). These results further corroborated the concept of TRPC3/C4 heteromerization in native endothelial cells and indicate that TRPC3/C4 heteromeric cation channel serves as a sensor for the cellular redox state. Comparison of Single Channel Properties—The existence of distinct, redox-sensitive pore complexes composed of TRPC3 and TRPC4 subunits was further tested at the single channel level. Fig. 6A illustrates the prominent unitary conductances activated by cholesterol-oxidase in TRPC3- and TRPC3+TRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells as well as in native endothelial cells (PAECs). All conductances reversed close to 0 mV (Fig. 6B), and the gating behavior of the observed channels was highly complex in all three cell systems displaying occasional fast, flickering behavior as well as subconductance levels. The prominent channel observed in T3-9 cells exhibited a chord conductance of 68 ± 7 pS (n = 3) at 0 mV. This channel type was also activated in response to stimulation of the cells with CCh (200 μm, n = 2, not shown). In T3-9 cells transfected to express TRPC4 in addition to TRPC3, the prominent unitary conductance activated by cholesterol oxidation was significantly smaller 44 ± 2 pS (n = 4). It is of note, that one cell-attached patch from a cell co-expressing TRPC3-TRPC4 contained a channel of larger conductance (∼80 pS, data not shown). As the unitary conductance of the prominent channel present in TRPC3-TRPC4-expressing cells was close to that reported for TRPC4 channels (∼30 pS (23Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)), we investigated additional regulatory properties of this channel. Challenge of TRPC3-TRPC4-expressing cells with OAG (100 μm), which has been reported to activate TRPC3 but not TRPC4 channels (8Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), induced a dramatic increase in the activity of the 44-pS channel observed in TRPC3-TRPC4-co-expressing cells (n = 3, Fig. 6C), substantiating that TRPC3-TRPC4-co-expressing cells display channel activity that is distinctly different from that of HEK293 cells expressing TRPC3 or TRPC4 only. The prominent cation channels observed in cholesterol oxidase-treated PAECs exhibited a unitary conductance that was slightly larger (81 ± 3 pS, n = 4, Fig. 6, A and B) than that calculated for TRPC3 channels. Activity of this channel typically occurred in bursts displaying fast flickering behavior (Fig. 6A). These results from single channel recordings demonstrate that co-expression of TRPC3 and TRPC4 in HEK293 cells produces a unique pore structure, clearly different from homomeric TRPC3 or TRPC4 channels. Generation of heteromeric TRPC3-TRPC4 channels in the HEK293 expression system, however, failed to perfectly reconstitute the native redox-sensitive cation conductance of endothelial cells. With the present study, we provide evidence for heteromeric assembly of TRPC3 and TRPC4 and indicate that such TRPC3/C4 heteromers are expressed endogenously in PAECs to serve as redox-sensitive cation channels. Our results support the previously proposed involvement of TRPC3 in the redox-sensitive membrane conductance of PAECs (14Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Groschner K. Rosker C. Lukas M. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 231-225, 263-266): 222-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate redox sensitivity of membrane conductances, cholesterol oxidase incubation was employed as an experimental model that allows for rather selective oxidative modifications of membrane lipids, generating membrane-delimited oxidative stress with less perturbance of overall cellular function as compared with direct administration of peroxides (15Groschner K. Rosker C. Lukas M. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 231-225, 263-266): 222-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with cholesterol oxidase was found to induce a non-selective cation conductance in both native endothelial cells and TRPC3-overexpressing HEK293 cells (T3-9 cells). The membrane responses induced by cholesterol oxidase incubation were similar to those obtained with the lipophilic peroxide t-BHP, which was used in previous studies aimed at the characterization of redox-sensitive membrane conductances (24Elliott S.J. Eskin S.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3806-3810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol oxidase activated cation conductances in both native endothelial cells (PAECs) as well as in TRPC3-expressing cells. These currents were similar but not perfectly identical in terms of their biophysical properties, because reversal potentials were slightly more negative in native endothelial cells. Moreover, the currents did not perfectly resemble those typically observed upon phospholipase C activation in TRPC3-expressing HEK293 cells (25Rosker C. Graziani A. Lukas M. Eder P. Zhu M.X. Romanin C. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13696-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This finding was considered to arise either from overlap of additional redox-sensitive conductances in PAECs or from a different composition of the redox-sensitive pore complexes. Nonetheless, both t-BHP and cholesterol oxidase activated a cation conductance in cells expressing TRPC3 but not in wild-type HEK293 cells, substantiating the potential role of TRPC3 as a component of redox-sensitive cation channels. The previously proposed concept of TRPC3 as a redox sensor in PAECs (14Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was in part based on the observed expression of TRPC3 mRNA in these native endothelial cells. In the present study, we confirmed TRPC3 expression at the protein level and demonstrated that this TRPC species is indeed targeted to the plasma membrane of these endothelial cells. As native TRPC channels are considered to involve heteromultimerization, we screened for plasma membrane expression of potential heteromerization partners of TRPC3. However, only TRPC4, a related protein that has so far not been identified as typical heteromerization partner of TRPC3 (18Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 26Schilling W.P. Goel M. Novartis Found Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 30-43, 98-102, 263-106): 18-30PubMed Google Scholar), was detected in the plasma membrane of PAECs. Nonetheless, Strübing et al. (7Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39014-39019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) demonstrated the general possibility of the formation of heteromeric channel structures composed of TRPC3 and TRPC4 when TRPC1 was present as the third channel subunit. Our immunoprecipitation experiments in PAECs indicated that endogenous TRPC3 and TRPC4 are able to associate in the membrane of PAECs. Consistent with the results of Strübing et al. (7Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39014-39019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we found indeed TRPC1 expression and evidence for a weak interaction between TRPC3 and TRPC1. However, plasma membrane expression of TRPC1 was not detectable in biotinylation experiments. Thus, the role of TRPC1 in the formation of heteromeric TRPC channels in PAECs remains to be clarified. Because TRPC3 and TRPC4 interactions have been excluded by two previous studies using heterologous overexpression combined with immunoprecipitation and FRET experiments (18Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 26Schilling W.P. Goel M. Novartis Found Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 30-43, 98-102, 263-106): 18-30PubMed Google Scholar), we performed several further experimental approaches to test for the existence of pore forming TRPC3/C4 complexes. The association of TRPC3 with TRPC4 proteins in HEK293 cells was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments and FRET microscopy. Importantly, we detected energy transfer between CFP- and YFP-tagged TRPC3 and TRPC4 proteins when the fluorescence tags were linked to the N- and C-terminal ends of the TRPC4 and TRPC3 protein, respectively. Protein interactions were not detectable when fluorescence proteins were linked to only the N or C termini of the interaction partners. These results indicate a high level of structural requirements regarding localization of the fluorophors for the detection of TRPC3/C4 association, which may explain some of the previous negative results obtained with FRET analysis. Our results indicate a close proximity of N and C termini within the TRPC3-TRPC4 complexes. TRPC3-TRPC4 interaction was further confirmed by the ability of wild-type TRPC4 to significantly reduce the homomultimerization between the CFP- and YFP-tagged TRPC3. Heteromerization of TRPC3 and TRPC4 in terms of formation of a distinct pore structure was further tested in single channel recording experiments, which clearly demonstrated that co-expression of TRPC3 and TRPC4 gives rise to cation channel activity of unique properties. The observed 44 pS, redox-regulated channel was found sensitive to activation by OAG, thereby representing a cation conductance clearly different from the so far described TRPC3 and TRPC4 unitary conductances generated by overexpression of individual channel proteins (23Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As the existence of TRPC3-TRPC4 pore complexes implies mutual dominant negative effects, we investigated the dominant negative effects of TRPC4 constructs on TRPC3-mediated membrane currents in HEK293 cells and in PAECs. Our results clearly demonstrated that both an N-terminal fragment of TRPC4 as well as an antibody-sensitive full-length TRPC4 mutant is able to eliminate TRPC3-related currents in T3-9 cells and PAECs. Thereby, we demonstrated that TRPC mutants, containing a HA epitope in the second extracellular loop, exert a dominant negative inhibition on TRPC3-mediated conductances. This dominant negative effect is “conditional” in terms that it requires the presence of an additional experimental condition, i.e. incubation with anti-HA antibody. Interestingly, co-expression of the full-length, exoHA-tagged TRPC4 construct with TRPC3 in HEK293 cells reconstituted the currents responses observed in native PAECs fairly well. Moreover, the oxidant-induced current responses were completely blocked in these cells by anti-HA incubation, indicating that this TRPC4 specie is effectively incorporated into the TRPC3 channel complexes. In line with the hypothesis of TRPC3 and TRPC4 association within a redox-sensitive channel complex in PAECs, we found that either expression of exoHA-TRPC3 or exoHA-TRPC4 was equally effective in terms of the antibody-induced dominant-negative suppression of the redox-sensitive current in PAECs. Nonetheless, characterization of the cholesterol oxidase-activated cation channels in PAECs revealed differences regarding unitary conductance and gating behavior between the endothelial redox-sensitive channel and the prominent channel observed in TRPC3-TRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells. The basis of the observed differences in single channel properties is unclear at this point. Nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate about the existence of TRPC3-TRPC4 heteromers with a different stoichiometry, which may explain the discrepancies between native cells and the heterologous expression system. Interestingly, we observed indeed in one patch of a TRPC3-TRPC4-expressing cell a larger conductance of ∼80 pS along with the predominant 44 pS channel, an observation that might be interpreted in terms of generation of a second heteromultimer. It appears important to note that the redox-sensitive channel observed in porcine aortic endothelium displays properties distinctly different from a previously reported redox-sensitive cation conductance observed in endothelial cells of calf aorta (28Koliwad S.K. Elliott S.J. Kunze D.L. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting molecular heterogeneity of endothelial redox-regulated cation channels. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence for cation channels comprised of both TRPC3 and TRPC4 subunits. We suggest that a TRPC3-TRPC4 heteromeric channel is expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells and represents a possible candidate responsible for oxidant-induced functional changes in the endothelium and, therefore, may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for novel cardiovascular drug therapies. We thank Drs. T. Hofmann and M. Schäfer for providing YFP-tagged TRPC3 and TRPC4 constructs, as well as Kerstin Geckl and Renate Schmidt for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2034488184,"Elucidation of the mechanism of transcriptional silencing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) provirus in latently infected cells is crucial to understand the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection and to develop novel therapies. Here we demonstrate that AP-4 is responsible for the transcriptional repression of HIV-1. We found that AP-4 site within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) is well conserved in the majority of HIV-1 subtypes and that AP-4 represses HIV-1 gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 as well as by masking TATA-binding protein to TATA box. AP-4-mediated transcriptional repression was inhibited by an HDAC inhibitor, tricostatin A, and could be exerted even at distant locations from the TATA box. In addition, AP-4 interacted with HDAC1 both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have revealed that AP-4 and HDAC1 are present in the HIV-1 LTR promoter in latently infected ACH2 and U1 cells, and they are dissociated from the promoter concomitantly with the association of acetylated histone H3, TBP, and RNA polymerase II upon TNF-α stimulation of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, when AP-4 is knocked down by siRNA, HIV-1 production was greatly augmented in cells transfected with a full-length HIV-1 clone. These results suggest that AP-4 may be responsible for transcriptional quiescence of latent HIV-1 provirus and give a molecular basis to the reported efficacy of combination therapy of conventional anti-HIV drugs with an HDAC inhibitor in accelerating the clearance of HIV-1 from individuals infected with the virus.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; LTR, long terminal repeat; TBP, TATA-binding protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; NRE, negative regulatory element; aa, amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TSA, tricostatin A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is a cytopathic retrovirus and the primary etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related disorders. Among the various steps of viral life cycle, the step of transcription from HIV-1 provirus is conceived to be crucial for viral replication since amplification of the viral genetic information is attainable only through transcription. HIV-1 transcription is directed by the promoter located in the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) of the integrated provirus and is controlled by cellular factors that bind to the multiple cis-regulatory elements located in the LTR as well as the virally encoded Tat protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and 2Pereira L.A. Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells chronically infected with HIV-1, activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by external stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and its binding to LTR triggers the initiation of transcription of viral genes including Tat, which results in explosive HIV-1 replication (reviewed in Refs. 3Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar and 4Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). However, little is known how transcription from HIV-1 provirus remains silent during the viral latency. There are multiple mechanisms known to be involved in the negative regulation of HIV transcription including elimination of transcriptional activator TATA-binding protein (TBP) transcriptional factor IID (TFIID) and the initiator protein complex by leader-binding protein (LBP)-1 (5Kato H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1991; 251: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and YY-1 (6Margolis D.M. Somasundaran M. Green M.R. J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2965-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and actions of transcription factors that interact with the negative regulatory element (NRE) located from -340 to -184 of HIV-1 LTR (2Pereira L.A.

Virol. 1991; 65: 5448-5456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the action of NRE, the mechanism by which NRE exerts its negative effect on transcription remains unknown because most of the transcription factors that interact with NRE are transcriptional activators. In addition, an in vitro study has revealed a potential role of activator protein (AP)-4 in blocking the TBP binding to TATA box (10Ou S.H. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Paulssen E.J. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7188-7199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, biological significance of this finding has not been clarified although the sequence comparison has revealed conservation of AP-4 sites in the majority of HIV-1 isolates (Fig. 1A) (11Estable M.C.

TFIID contains the 38-kDa TBP as the major component and induces transcriptional initiation by interacting with other general transcription factors and recruiting RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (17Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). TBP (TFIID) also serves as the target of DNA-binding factors binding to the cis-regulatory elements within HIV-1 LTR in both positive and negative fashions and thus determines its promoter activity (reviewed in Refs. 16Siekevitz M.

AP-4 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper (bHLH-Zip) subgroup of bHLH proteins and binds to the symmetrical DNA sequence 5′-CAGCTG-3′ (20Hu Y.F. Luscher B. Admon A. Mermod N. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1741-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 332: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). AP-4 site is found adjacent (-21/-16) to the HIV-1 TATA box (-27/-23) (10Ou S.H. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Paulssen E.J. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7188-7199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although AP-4 was initially identified as a cellular protein that binds to the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer and activates the viral late gene transcription (21Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 332: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), transcriptional repression by AP-4 was reported in a number of other genes including angiotensinogen (21Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 332: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and E7 oncoprotein of human papilloma-virus type 16 (23Glahder J.A. Hansen C.N. Vinther J. Madsen B.S. Norrild B. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 3429-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that AP-4 negatively regulates transcription of 8-oxo guanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) gene (24Imai K. Nakata K. Kawai K. Hamano T. Mei N. Kasai H. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26701-26713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, because AP-4 sites are not located adjacent to the TATA box in these promoters, the molecular mechanism of its repressive action is yet to be clarified. In this study we investigated the role of AP-4 in HIV-1 gene expression. Here we show that AP-4 represses HIV-1 transcription by recruiting HDAC1 as well as by masking the TBP to the HIV-1 TATA box. Biological and therapeutic implications are discussed. Cell Culture—CEM, HL-60, Jurkat, ACH2, and U1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To maintain the latency of the HIV-1 in ACH2 and U1, 20 μm AZT was added in the culture medium and was excluded prior to experiments. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

To generate pcDNA-AP-4 (full), pcDNA-ΔN100 AP-4 (100-355 aa), pcDNA-ΔN143 AP-4 (143-355 aa), pcDNA-ΔN180 AP-4 (180-355 aa), pcDNA-ΔC179 AP-4 (1-179 aa), and pcDNA-ΔC130 AP-4 (1-130 aa), each containing a FLAG epitope tag in the N terminus and a V5 epitope tag in the C terminus, the various portions of AP-4 cDNA were amplified by PCR using pMyc-AP-4 as a template with 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotide primers. These products were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 TOPO V5 vector (Invitrogen). Construction of HIV-1 LTR-based luciferase expression plasmid: CD12-luc (containing the HIV-1 LTR U3 and R) was previously described (25Takada N. Sanda T. Okamoto H. Yang J.P. Asamitsu K. Sarol L. Kimura G. Uranishi H. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutant HIV-1 LTR luciferase reporter constructs lacking AP-4 binding were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutant sequences (sense strand) utilized were the following: CD12-luc-m1, GAT CCT GCA TAT AAG tcg cga CTT TTT GCC TGT AC; CD12-luc-m2, GCA TAT AAG CAG CTc CTT TTT GCC TGT AC; CD12-luc-m3, GCA TAT AAG CAG Cgc TTA AGA TAC AGC; CD12-luc-m4, CCT GCA TAT AAG CAG tcG CTT TTT GCC TGT AC (consensus AP-4 binding sites are underlined, and the mutated sequences are in small letters). The mutant HIV-1 LTR-directed reporter constructs, in which the authentic AP-4 site is mutated and an AP-4 site is aberrantly inserted into various positions of the CD12-luc-m2 reporter plasmid, were constructed by PCR using CD12-luc-m2 DNA as a template and site-directed mutagenesis kit with the following mutagenesis oligonucleotide primer pairs: CD12-luc-m2(+55), forward (5′-GCT AGC TAG GGA ACA GCT GCC CAC TGC TTA AG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTT AAG CAG TGG GCA GCT GTT CCC TAG CTA GC-3′); CD12-luc-m2(-79), forward (5′-CTG GGG ACT TTC CAC AGC TGG GGA GGC GTG GCC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGC CAC GCC TCC CCA GCT GTG GAA AGT CCC CAG-3′); CD12-luc-m2(-150), forward (5′-GTG GCC CGA GAG CTC AGC TGG CAT CCG GAG TAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTA CTC CGG ATG CCA GCT CAG CTC TCG GGC CAC-3′); CD12-luc-m2(-400), forward (5′-GAT CTG TGG ATC TCA GCT GAC CAC ACA CAA GG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCT TGT GTG TGG TCA GCT GAG ATC CAC AGA TC-3′). The mutant pNL4-3 containing mutation in AP-4 binding was generated using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (24Imai K. Nakata K. Kawai K. Hamano T. Mei N. Kasai H. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26701-26713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with oligonucleotide primer pairs: forward, 5′-CAT ATA AGC AGC TcC TTT TTG CCT GTA C-3′ and reverse 5′-GTA CAG GCA AAA AGg AGC TGC TTA TAT G-3′ (mutated AP-4 binding sites are underlined and the mutated nucleotides are in lowercase letters). We first constructed the 5′-LTR AP-4 site mutant in the background of pNL4-3 by site-directed mutagenesis and additional AP-4 site mutation in the 3′-LTR was subsequently introduced into this mutant by site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an Applied Biosystems 313 automated DNA sequencer. Recombinant Protein and Purification—pGEX expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) was utilized to express glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria. To generate pGEX-AP-4-expressing GST-AP-4, the AP-4 cDNA was amplified by PCR using pMyc-AP-4 as a template with oligonucleotide primer pairs: forward, 5′-CGG GAT CCC GGA GTA TTT CAT GGT GCC CAC TCA G-3′, containing an BamHI site; reverse, 5′-GGA ATT CCT CAG GGA AGC TCC CCG TCC CCC G-3′, containing an EcoRI site. This product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned in-frame into pGEX-5X-3 vector at the BamHI/EcoRI sites. pGEX-AP-4 was transformed in Escherichia-coli strain DH5 and expression of recombinant GST-AP-4 protein was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h. Recombinant GST proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (26Tetsuka T. Uranishi H. Imai H. Ono T. Sonta S. Takahashi N. Asamitsu K.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The experimental procedure was carried out as described previously (24Imai K. Nakata K. Kawai K. Hamano T. Mei N. Kasai H. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26701-26713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant TBP and GST-TBP proteins were purchased from Promega and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to -42/+4 of HIV-1 LTR (CD12) containing the binding sites of TBP and AP-4 and their mutants were synthesized. The wild-type and mutant oligonucleotide sequences (sense strand) were the following: wild-type (5′-CCC TCA GAT CCT GCA TAT AAG CAG CTG CTT TTT GCC TGT A-3′) and mutants (the underlined AP-4 site has been changed to TGACGG (m1), TAGCTC (m2), CAGCGC (m3), and CAGTCG (m4)) (Fig. 2B). These oligonucleotides were labeled using the 5′-end-labeling kit (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) in the presence of [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences). DNA binding reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min for TBP and room temperature for 20 min for AP-4. Analysis of protein-DNA complexes was performed by electrophoresis in 6% native polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at a constant voltage of 125 V at 4 °C, followed by autoradiography. The specificity of DNA binding was assessed by preincubating with purified GST-AP-4, GST-TBP, or control GST proteins with specific antibodies or competitors for 20 min prior to the addition of the probe. Anti-AP-4 Antibody—Anti-AP-4 antibody was obtained by immunizing rabbits with GST-AP-4 fusion protein as no immunoprecipitable anti-AP-4 antibody was currently available from any commercial source. The immunized rabbit anti-AP-4 sera were affinity-purified by passing through affinity columns, and the lack of immunoreactivity with GST and other E. coli components was confirmed. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Assays—The experimental procedures for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (24Imai K. Nakata K. Kawai K. Hamano T. Mei N. Kasai H.

Briefly, cells were harvested with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-AP-4 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and antibody-bound proteins were dissolved by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with anti-AP-4 antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). To evaluate the level of AP-4 protein, cells were similarly treated with the lysis buffer, and the cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-AP-4 or V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—293 cells cultured in 12-well plates were transfected using Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (26Tetsuka T. Uranishi H.

CEM and HL60 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation as reported (24Imai K. Nakata K. Kawai K. Hamano T. Mei N. Kasai H. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26701-26713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells/ml were electroporated with 2 μg of CD12-luc together with 2 μg of pCMV-Tat and indicated amounts of Myc-AP-4 in 400 μl of serum-free RPMI using the Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX Electroporation System) apparatus at 260 V/1050 μfarads. For the internal control, we employed pRL-TK, expressing Renilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter not containing the AP-4 site. The transfected cells were harvested, and the extracts were subjected to the luciferase assay using the Luciferase Assay System™ (Promega). All the experiments were carried out in triplicates, and the data were presented as the fold increase in luciferase activities (means ± S.D.) relative to the control for three independent transfections. RNA Interference—The siRNAs with two thymidine residues (dTdT) at the 3′-end of the sequence were synthesized by Takara. The target sequences were as follows: AP-4-1 (5′-GUG CCC UCU UUG CAA CAU U-3′), AP-4-2 (5′-GGU CAU CAA CUC UGU UUC C-3′), and GFP (5′-GGC UAC GUC CAG GAG CGC ACC-3′). Transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagents. In Vitro Binding Assay—An in vitro protein-protein interaction assay was carried out as described previously (26Tetsuka T. Uranishi H. Imai H. Ono T. Sonta S. Takahashi N. Asamitsu K. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4383-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, AP-4 and luciferase proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT wheat germ extract-coupled system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 20 μg of GST fusion proteins were immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed two times with 1 ml of modified HEMNK buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After the final wash, 0.6 ml of beads suspension was incubated with radiolabeled proteins for 12 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed two times with 1 ml of HENMK buffer and two times with HENMK buffer containing 150 mm KCl. Bound radiolabeled proteins were eluted with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed according to the provider's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology) with some modifications as previously described (24Imai K. Nakata K. Kawai K. Hamano T. Mei N. Kasai H. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26701-26713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 10 min at 2 × 106 cells in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer. The cross-linked chromatin was sheared by sonication 13 times for 10 s at one-third of the maximum power of microson XL sonicator (Wakenyaku, Co., LTD., Kyoto, Japan) with 20 s of cooling on ice between each pulse. Cross-linked and released chromatin fractions were precleared with salmon sperm DNA and protein A-agarose beads for 1 h, followed by immunoprecipitation with the desired antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were sequentially washed once with lysis buffer, twice with high salt buffer, twice with low salt buffer, and twice with TE buffer. After the wash, immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA and protein A-agarose beads at room temperature for 1 h and extracted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. The eluted samples were reverse cross-linked by proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h and treated with RNase at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform and chloroform extractions, and ethanol precipitation. Finally, DNA was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer and subjected to PCR. The primer sequences used for PCR were the following: HIV-1 LTR (-109 to +79): forward (5′TAC AAG GGA CTT TCC GCT GG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTG AGG CTT AAG CAG TGG G-3′); β-actin promoter (-980 to -915) (as a control): forward (5′-TGC ACT GTG CGG CGA AGC-3′) and reverse (5′-TCG AGC CAT AAA AGG CAA-3′). The number of PCR cycles was as the following: 33 PCR cycles for all the ChIP experiments and 24 PCR cycles for the input samples, in which PCR amplification was obtained under the linear range of AP-4 binding to the HIV-1 LTR DNA. For each reaction, 10% of cross-linked released chromatin was saved and reversed by proteinase K digestion at 45 °C for 1 h followed by DNA extraction, and the recovered DNA was used as input control. Antiviral Assay and Measurement of Viral p24 Antigen—Antiviral activity of AP-4 was evaluated based on the extent of inhibition of viral antigen expression in the culture supernatants of Jurkat or 293 cells transfected with a full-length HIV-1 molecular clone (pNL4-3) or mutant pNL4-3, in which AP-4 site is mutated. 293 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of pNL4-3, together with various amounts of plasmids encoding wild-type AP-4 or AP-4 mutants with Fugene-6 transfection reagent. For siRNA studies, 100 nm siRNAs were introduced with 0.1 μg of pNL4-3 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Jurkat cells were transfected by Nucleofector™ kit V for Jurkat cell (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were mixed with 0.2 μg of wild-type or mutant pNL4-3 together with indicated amounts of FLAG-AP-4 in 100 μl of Nucleofector™ solution V. These samples were transferred into a transfection cuvette and subjected to electroporation using program T-14. The transfected cells were incubated in culture flasks with a complete media for 36 h. Then, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of TNF-α (3 ng/ml). The p24 antigen level in the cell culture supernatant was measured by p24 antigen capture ELISA assay using a commercial kit (RETRO-TEK HIV-1 p24 Antigen ELISA kit; Zepto Metrix Corp., Buffalo, NY) as described previously (25Takada N.

AP-4 Competes with TBP for Binding to the HIV-1 TATA Element—The HIV-1 TATA is located at nucleotide position from -27 to -23 relative to the transcription initiation site. The consensus AP-4 site, CAGCTG, is located -21 to -16 nucleotides immediately downstream of the TATA box. The AP-4 binding site in the HIV-1 LTR appears to be conserved in the majority of HIV-1 isolates (11Estable M.C. Bell B. Merzouki A. Montaner J.S. O'Shaughnessy M.V. Sadowski I.J. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 3740-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a majority of HIV-1 clones contain typical AP-4 binding sequence, CAGCTG, whereas it is mutated to CAGCCG in HIV-1 subtypes F1-F2, G, O, and 01-AE. Because the AP-4 binding site is located close to the TATA box, we first examined the effect of AP-4 on the binding activity of TBP to the TATA box in vitro. To address this issue, recombinant AP-4 protein was produced and purified (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 1D (left panel), EMSA analysis using a DNA probe (-42/+4) containing both the TATA box and AP-4 site, showed that AP-4 blocked the TBP binding to TATA box in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 6 and 7). The control GST proteins did not alter the DNA binding activity of TBP (Fig. 1D, right panel). These results were consistent with a previous study by Ou et al. (10Ou S.H. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Paulssen E.J. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7188-7199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of HIV-1 LTR Gene Expression by AP-4—Because AP-4 masks the TBP binding to the HIV-1 TATA box in vitro, we examined the effect of AP-4 on transcription from HIV-1 LTR. The luciferase reporter plasmid containing the HIV-LTR (CD12-luc) was cotransfected with an AP-4 expression vector (pMyc-AP-4) into CEM, HL-60, and 293 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, the basal transcriptional level from HIV-1 LTR was inhibited by AP-4 in a dose-dependent manner in all the cell lines tested. Upon stimulation of HIV-1 promoter by TNF-α, a physiological inducer of NF-κB, AP-4 could similarly exert its negative effect. In addition, AP-4 also inhibited the Tat-induced HIV-1 gene expression in these cells. To address whether the inhibitory effect of AP-4 depends on the presence of AP-4 site, we have create"
https://openalex.org/W1981363241,"The supramolecular organization of photosystem II (PSII) was characterized in distinct domains of the thylakoid membrane, the grana core, the grana margins, the stroma lamellae, and the so-called Y100 fraction. PSII supercomplexes, PSII core dimers, PSII core monomers, PSII core monomers lacking the CP43 subunit, and PSII reaction centers were resolved and quantified by blue native PAGE, SDS-PAGE for the second dimension, and immunoanalysis of the D1 protein. Dimeric PSII (PSII supercomplexes and PSII core dimers) dominate in the core part of the thylakoid granum, whereas the monomeric PSII prevails in the stroma lamellae. Considerable amounts of PSII monomers lacking the CP43 protein and PSII reaction centers (D1-D2-cytochrome b559 complex) were found in the stroma lamellae. Our quantitative picture of the supramolecular composition of PSII, which is totally different between different domains of the thylakoid membrane, is discussed with respect to the function of PSII in each fraction. Steady state electron transfer, flash-induced fluorescence decay, and EPR analysis revealed that nearly all of the dimeric forms represent oxygen-evolving PSII centers. PSII core monomers were heterogeneous, and a large fraction did not evolve oxygen. PSII monomers without the CP43 protein and PSII reaction centers showed no oxygen-evolving activity."
https://openalex.org/W2041604586,"Activation of protein 4.1R exon 16 (E16) inclusion during erythropoiesis represents a physiologically important splicing switch that increases 4.1R affinity for spectrin and actin. Previous studies showed that negative regulation of E16 splicing is mediated by the binding of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A/B proteins to silencer elements in the exon and that down-regulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in erythroblasts leads to activation of E16 inclusion. This article demonstrates that positive regulation of E16 splicing can be mediated by Fox-2 or Fox-1, two closely related splicing factors that possess identical RNA recognition motifs. SELEX experiments with human Fox-1 revealed highly selective binding to the hexamer UGCAUG. Both Fox-1 and Fox-2 were able to bind the conserved UGCAUG elements in the proximal intron downstream of E16, and both could activate E16 splicing in HeLa cell co-transfection assays in a UGCAUG-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of Fox-2 expression, achieved with two different siRNA sequences resulted in decreased E16 splicing. Moreover, immunoblot experiments demonstrate mouse erythroblasts express Fox-2. These findings suggest that Fox-2 is a physiological activator of E16 splicing in differentiating erythroid cells in vivo. Recent experiments show that UGCAUG is present in the proximal intron sequence of many tissue-specific alternative exons, and we propose that the Fox family of splicing enhancers plays an important role in alternative splicing switches during differentiation in metazoan organisms.

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA leads to the synthesis of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. It is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression and may be utilized by 40-60% of human genes (1Black D.L.

Regulation of alternative splicing occurs in both a tissue- and development-specific manner, resulting in alterations in the structure and function of critical proteins. Altered splicing regulation can also be of widespread importance in the etiology of human disease (5Cartegni L. Chew S.L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Rev.

The protein 4.1 gene family serves as an excellent model for investigating the regulation of alternative splicing. The four genes that comprise the family (4.1R, 4.1G, 4.1B, and 4.1N) display a remarkable array of highly regulated, tissue-specific splicing events. These alternative splicing events facilitate expression of distinct isoforms of 4.1 protein in cells of erythroid, epithelial, neural, and muscle origin (8Parra M. Gascard P. Walensky L.D. Gimm J.A.

To date, mechanistic studies have focused predominantly on erythroid cells, in which 4.1R protein is a structural component of the erythrocyte plasma membrane and is important for structural integrity and stability of the membrane skeleton. In differentiating erythroid progenitor cells, a dramatic switch in pre-mRNA splicing results in a physiologically important functional change in the encoded structural protein isoforms (15Chasis J.A.

E16 splicing is influenced by multiple regulatory elements located not only in the exon but also in the flanking introns and at the splice sites themselves (21Gee S.L. Aoyagi K. Lersch R. Hou V. Wu M. Conboy J.G. Blood. 2000; 95: 692-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Deguillien M. Huang S.C. Moriniere M. Dreumont N. Benz Jr., E.J. Baklouti F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6195-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One component of the regulatory machinery in erythroid cells is a stage-specific repression of E16 inclusion, mediated by binding of hnRNP 3The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; hFox, human Fox protein; mFox, mouse Fox protein; zFox, zebrafish Fox protein; nt, nucleotide(s); siRNA, small interfering RNA; RRM, RNA recognition motif. A/B proteins to exonic splicing silencer element(s) located within the exon. Repression occurs in early erythroid progenitors, which express high levels of hnRNP A/B proteins, and repression is subsequently relieved by a substantial down-regulation of hnRNP A/B expression in later stage erythroblasts (23Hou V.C. Lersch R. Gee S.L. Ponthier J.L. Lo A.J. Wu M. Turck C.W. Koury M. Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Conboy J.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6195-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reduction in the level of splicing inhibitory proteins thus appears to be a critical feature of the physiological E16 splicing switch in erythroid cells. In this article, we have described a second mechanism whereby E16 splicing efficiency can be regulated, in this case via the interaction of splicing activator protein(s) with positive regulatory elements in the downstream intron. Our results demonstrate phylogenetic conservation of UGCAUG splicing enhancer motifs downstream of E16, specific binding of these elements to both Fox-1 and Fox-2 splicing factor proteins, and UGCAUG-dependent stimulation of E16 splicing by both of these proteins in functional splicing assays. These findings support the emerging model of Fox protein splicing factors as important components of the cellular machinery that switches on splicing of critical alternative exons at appropriate times during development and differentiation by acting at highly specific UGCAUG intron enhancers (24Jin Y.

Nomenclature—The splicing factors described in this article have been reported independently by multiple laboratories in different contexts and with different names. Fox-1 is also known as ataxin 2-binding protein (A2BP1 (28Shibata H. Huynh D.P. Pulst S.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)) or hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 1 (HRNBP1 (29Winkelmann J.C. Chen W.-G. Chu Z.-L. Blough R.I.

Both Fox genes encode multiple isoforms via alternative splicing, e.g. see cDNAs AF094849, AF109106, and AF229057 and recent publications (27Baraniak A.P. Chen J.R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell.

Genetic Data Base Analysis—Human protein 4.1R exon 16 (May 2004 assembly, chromosome 1, nucleotides (nt) 29207550-29207612) was used as a query sequence with which to retrieve orthologous exons from other genomes, as well as flanking intron sequences, using the BLAT search tools. 4.1G exon 16 is on human chromosome 6 (nt 131242977-131243039), and 4.1B exon 16 is on human chromosome 18 (nt 5397436-5397501). Plasmids—The wild type 4.1R minigene was described earlier (21Gee S.L. Aoyagi K. Lersch R. Hou V. Wu M. Conboy J.G. Blood. 2000; 95: 692-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In construct 4.1Δhex, partial deletion of intron 16 sequences yielded a pre-mRNA that retained 21 nt of proximal intron 16 sequences joined at an XbaI site to the terminal 249 nt of intron 16 and exon 17; all three UGCAUG elements were removed. Derivatives of 4.1Δhex were constructed by inserting synthetic oligonucleotides containing two copies of either a wild type (5′-GATCATGCATGAGGGAAAGGTGCATGCAAAGGGAA-3′) or a mutated UGCAUG hexamer (5′-GATCATGACTGAGGGAAAGGTGACTGCAAAGGGAA-3′). Mammalian expression clones for mFox-2α (BC002124) and mFox-2β (BC027263) were obtained from Research Genetics. The human Fox-1α cDNA (AF094849) was cloned in one of our laboratories (by W. Chen and J. C. Winkelmann) and inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-Myc-His(-) between the XbaI and HindIII sites. siRNAs—Duplex siRNAs obtained from Dharmacon were as follows. Fox-2 siRNA duplex 1: sense strand, 5′-GACAGUAUAUGGUGCAGUCUU-3′; antisense strand, 5′-PGACUGCACCAUAUACUGUCUU-3′. Fox-2 siRNA duplex 2: sense strand, 5′-CGAGAAUAGUGCUGAUGCAUU-3′; antisense strand, 5′-PUGCAUCAGCACUAUUCUCGUU-3′. Splicing Analysis—HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfections with siRNA were performed for 24 h in 6-well culture dishes using 200 pmol of siRNA. Total RNA was isolated 72 h later using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from the isolated RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an exon 17 3′ primer. PCR analysis of spliced 4.1 pre-mRNA was performed using DNA primers located in exon 13 (forward primer: 5′-AGCCATTGCTCAGAGTCAGG-3′) and exon 17 (reverse primer: 5′-GCGAATTCCCGGATTCAGT-3′) of the 4.1 minigene. Immunoblot Analysis—HeLa cell protein extracts for immunoblot analysis were prepared by lysis in Novex Tris-glycine-SDS buffer (Invitrogen) plus dithiothreitol and boiled for 10 min. Anti-Fox-2 anti-serum (Washington Biotechnology) was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide, GVPHTQDYAGQT. This peptide was selected on the basis of its conservation between mouse and human Fox-2 and its divergence from mouse and human Fox-1. The Fox-2 antibody used in these experiments was affinity-purified against a synthetic peptide (GenScript Corp.) by using Affi-Gel®10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was diluted 1:100 in milk blotto/PBS-T solution (0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, 0.138 m NaCl, 0.0027 m KCl, pH 7.4, 0.25% Tween). For the detection of actin, the antibody (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was used at 1:5000 dilution. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution). For signal detection, the Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent kit was employed (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mouse erythroblasts were obtained from the spleens of mice infected with the Friend virus, anemia-inducing strain (FVA), cultured as described previously (34Koury M.J. Sawyer S.T. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Lee G. Spring F.A. Parsons S.F. Mankelow T.J. Peters L.L. Koury M.J. Mohandas N. Anstee D.J. Chasis J.A.

Protein was extracted from the cultured cells and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. SELEX Analysis of Fox-1 Binding Specificity—For SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) (36Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar), 500 μg of hFox-1α-Myc-His protein, isolated from a baculovirus/SF9 expression system, was coupled to 1 ml of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The oligonucleotides used for SELEX were identical or similar to those used previously (37Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 38Tsai D.E.

The SELEX analysis was performed as described previously with some modification (39Wang J. Dong Z. Bell L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22227-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 100 μg of SELF and 300 μg of SELN40 were annealed as the template for in vitro transcription using RiboProbe® in vitro transcription system (Promega). The synthesized RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and dissolved in binding buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 4 mg/ml tRNA. Approximately 1 mg of RNA was loaded onto a 1-ml hFox1α-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with binding buffer, mixed, and rotated mildly at room temperature for 10 min. The column was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer and eluted with 10 ml of 0.1 m NaCl, MTPBS (16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) followed by 10 ml of 1.0 m NaCl, MTPBS. The first 10 fractions (0.5 ml each) eluted by 1 m NaCl, MTPBS were collected, and the RNA was precipitated and dissolved in 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O. One-fifth of the RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified (22 cycles of 94 °C 45 s, 65 °C 45 s, and 72 °C 45 s). The amplified PCR product was resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Fractions 2, 3, and 4, eluted with 1 m NaCl, MTPBS, were pooled as templates for the next round of SELEX. Beginning with the fourth round, the concentration of NaCl was increased to 0.4 m in both the binding buffer and the first elution buffer. A total of seven rounds of SELEX were performed. The PCR product of the final round was digested with KpnI and BamHI and cloned to pBluescript vector. Individual clones were selected and sequenced. In Vitro Synthesis of hFox-1 and mFox-2 Proteins—Human Fox-1α cDNA from clone AF094849 was amplified using primers hBP1-S (5′-CACCAGCATGCTGGCGTCTCAAGGAGTTCTC-3′) and hBP1-AS (5′-TTAGTATGGAGCAAAACGGTTGTATCC-3′) and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pEXP1-DEST (Invitrogen). The resulting hFox-1 construct, tagged at the N terminus with the Express epitope and a His6 epitope, was synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation using Expressway Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse Fox-2β cDNA was amplified from clone BC027263 using primers mBP2-S (5′-CACCCGGATGGCGGAAGGCGGCCAGGCGCA-3′ and mBP2-AS (5′-CTAGTAGGGGGCAAATCGGCTGTAGCC-3′). and cloned into pEXP1-DEST for in vitro expression. Binding of Recombinant Fox Proteins to Biotinylated RNAs Containing UGCAUG—39-Mer RNAs representing nt 80-118 of intron 16 sequence were purchased from Dharmacon: wild type RNA sequence, 5′-biotin-GCCCUUGGGUUUGCAUGCCACUGCAUGAGAGACGUUUmAmG-3′; mutant sequence, 5′-biotin-GCCCUUGGGUUUGacUGCCACUGacUGAGAGACGUUUmAmG; (hexamer motifs are underlined, and mutations are represented by lowercase letters). Binding experiments were performed essentially as described previously (23Hou V.C. Lersch R. Gee S.L. Ponthier J.L. Lo A.J. Wu M. Turck C.W. Koury M. Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Conboy J.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6195-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant hFox-1 or mFox-2 or hnRNP A1 was incubated with 100 pmol of biotinylated-RNA in splicing buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. RNA and associated proteins were then removed by binding to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding Specificity of Mammalian Fox Splicing Factor Proteins for the Hexamer UGCAUG—The consensus binding site of the zebrafish splicing factor, zFox-1, was defined as the pentamer GCAUG (24Jin Y. Suzuki H. Maegawa S. Endo H. Sugano S. Hashimoto K. Yasuda K. Inoue K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We independently cloned human Fox-1 (hFox-1) cDNA and examined its binding specificity via SELEX. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the winner sequences binding to hFox-1 contained at least one copy of the same pentamer recognized by zFox-1, and four contained two copies (sequences 6, 10, 26, and 45). However, closer examination revealed that the great majority (45 of 47) of winner sequences for the human protein contained the hexamer UGCAUG, with an additional preference for U in the seventh position, i.e. UGCAUGU. These results are consistent with the recent structural analysis of a Fox-1-UGCAUGU complex (40Auweter S.D. Fasan R. Reymond L. Underwood J.G. Black D.L. Pitsch S. Allain F.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This extended consensus binding site for hFox-1 may reflect evolutionary changes in the protein from fish to mammals. Alternatively, the minor difference in binding specificity may be due to the fact that the reported zebrafish Fox-1 is not the best ortholog of human Fox-1, i.e. a closer homolog with higher identity to the human Fox-1 RRM is encoded in the zebrafish genome. 4J. G. Conboy, our unpublished observations. The powerful selection for winners with multiple UGCAUG elements may reflect cooperative binding of hFox-1 to regions with multiple binding sites. Notably, several of the natural occurrences of intronic UGCAUG or GCAUG splicing elements, including the 4.1 gene reported here, contain multiple elements (22Deguillien M. Huang S.C. Moriniere M.

Fig. 2 shows the domain structure of mammalian Fox-1 and two closely related Fox-2/RBM9/HRNBP2 protein isoforms (hereafter called Fox-2) that are used for functional studies in this article. The Fox-2 proteins possess different C-terminal domains and are derived from the same gene via alternative splicing, whereas Fox-1 is encoded by a separate gene. A C-terminal isoform of Fox-1 is also encoded by alternative splicing but was not studied here. All of these mammalian Fox proteins are 100% identical in the RRM domain. Outside of the RRM domain, the proteins exhibit a reduced but still highly significant homology except for the aforementioned alternative C terminus. The functional splicing experiments described below demonstrate that these novel Fox proteins can promote exon inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent manner. UGCAUG Elements Function as Intron Splicing Enhancers for Protein 4.1R Exon 16—E16 in the 4.1R gene undergoes a splicing switch during erythropoiesis, being skipped in early progenitor cells and efficiently included at later stages (Fig. 3, top). Three repeats of the UGCAUG hexamer are located downstream of protein 4.1R E16 in the human and mouse genes, and mutations of these elements have been reported to decrease E16 inclusion (22Deguillien M. Huang S.C. Moriniere M. Dreumont N. Benz Jr., E.J. Baklouti F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3809-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, lower panel, the presence of UGCAUG elements has been highly conserved in evolution, as 2-3 repeats are also located in the E16 proximal intronic regions of the rat, opossum, chicken, frog, and tetraodon (fish) 4.1R genes. In addition, two closely paralogous genes (4.1G and 4.1B) also possess UGCAUG repeats near alternative E16, although the surrounding intron sequences are otherwise quite divergent. These observations support a functional role for UGCAUG in regulating E16 splicing. To test whether the conserved UGCAUG elements could function as enhancers or silencers of E16 splicing, several 4.1 pre-mRNA constructs possessing or lacking intronic hexamers were compared in functional splicing assays in transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the wild type transcript with three hexamers yielded a modest inclusion efficiency for E16 (43%) among its spliced products (lower panel, lane 1). In contrast, deletion of an intronic region containing all three hexamers resulted in complete loss of E16 inclusion (Fig. 4, lower panel, lane 2, construct 4.1Δhex). This result was consistent with a model in which deletion of an intronic enhancer was responsible for reduced E16 splicing efficiency. Additional constructs were therefore designed to test whether the UGCAUG hexamers represented the active enhancer element(s). Splicing of construct 4.1Δhexwt, containing UGCAUG elements reinserted at the site of the deletion, rescued splicing efficiency to near wild type levels (Fig. 4, lower panel, lane 3). Negative control construct 4.1Δhexmut, containing a two-nucleotide mutation in the inserted hexamer elements, did not rescue E16 splicing (Fig. 4, lower panel, lane 4). Additional construct pairs containing wild type or mutant hexamers with different flanking nucleotides were also tested. Although the wild type hexamers consistently yielded much higher exon inclusion efficiency than the comparable mutant hexamers, it was also clear that neighboring sequences could influence the magnitude of these effects (results not shown). Analogous results were obtained in an in vitro splicing assay utilizing HeLa cell nuclear extract. E16 splicing efficiency in the wild type pre-mRNA was dramatically reduced by deletion of the hexamer element; insertion of intact UGCAUG elements, but not mutated hexamers, rescued E16 splicing (data not shown). These results indicated that UGCAUG represents an intronic splicing enhancer for E16 splicing. Fox Splicing Factors Promote E16 Inclusion in a UGCAUG-dependent Manner—The results reported above are consistent with a model in which Fox-1 and Fox-2 function as UGCAUG-dependent splicing factors that activate E16 splicing. This hypothesis was tested directly using a HeLa cell transfection strategy and asking whether Fox-1 or Fox-2 expression plasmids could stimulate E16 inclusion in 4.1 pre-mRNAs. Whereas the transfected wild type 4.1R construct alone exhibited only about 35% inclusion (Fig. 5A, 4.1wt), co-transfection with a full-length Fox-1 or Fox-2 expression plasmid significantly increased E16 inclusion to 80 or 70%, respectively. Additional transfection experiments revealed that despite the difference in C-terminal sequences of Fox-2a and Fox-2b, no significant difference in their ability to stimulate E16 splicing was observed (data not shown). To test whether this observed Fox protein enhancer activity was dependent on the presence of UGCAUG, further transfection experiments were performed. Pre-mRNA constructs containing or lacking the UGCAUG elements were co-transfected with the Fox-1 or Fox-2 expression plasmids. In contrast to the wild type pre-mRNA transfection, neither protein stimulated E16 splicing in pre-mRNA substrates from which the hexamers had been deleted (construct 4.1Δhex). Replacement of wild type hexamers (construct 4.1Δhexwt) but not mutated hexamers (construct 4.1Δhexmut) strongly restored the ability of Fox-1 and Fox-2 to stimulate E16 splicing. The low level of splicing stimulated by Fox-2 in construct 4.1Δhexmut is not understood and may indicate that splicing regulation is more complex in vivo. However, the major enhancement of splicing by Fox-2 is clearly UGCAUG-dependent. To confirm that Fox-proteins are indeed expressed even in the constructs that show no E16 splicing, immunoblot analysis was performed (Fig. 5B). As expected, in those cells that contain the Fox expression plasmid, a stronger Fox-1 or Fox-2 signal could be detected (indicated by arrows in Fig. 5B) in comparison with all other transfection samples. This observation is not due to a larger amount of protein sample loaded on the gel, as demonstrated by the actin detection (Fig. 5B, lower panels). Together, these results suggest that both Fox proteins can rescue splicing in a UGCAUG-dependent manner. To further confirm the correlation of Fox proteins and E16 splicing, the effect on splicing was investigated when the protein expression was decreased by RNA interference. Therefore, HeLa cells were transfected with the 4.1R minigene construct and siRNA duplexes against the Fox-2 gene. As shown in Fig. 6, co-transfection with siRNA duplex 1 led to a substantial reduction of E16 splicing in comparison to the wild type pre-mRNA. This re"

The role of EagI in malignant transformation has been suggested by several experiments, but the lack of specific EagI inhibitors has made it difficult to examine the influence of the channel on oncogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target. We have used short interfering RNA to test the effects of EagI reduction on the behavior of tumor cells in vitro. By generating and optimizing an EagI-specific short interfering RNA system, we were able to study the effects of EagI depletion on several cancer cell lines that endogenously express this protein. We show here that our short interfering RNA sequences act specifically on EagI, reproducibly induce a significant decrease in the proliferation of tumor cell lines, and do not trigger any observable nonspecific responses.

Thus, the activation of the channel is slower the more hyperpolarized the starting membrane potential is. This particular property has proven very useful when attempting to identify the channel in native tissues and has been postulated to be important for the physiological function of EagI, because the properties of the current in a particular cell will not only depend on the actual stimulus, but also be determined by the average membrane potential previous to the stimulus. hEag1 mRNA has also been detected in many cancer cell lines, although the corresponding normal tissue exhibits no such expression. Furthermore, hEag1 protein expression is detected in up to 75% of tumor tissues derived from different organs. 2B. Hemmerlein, R. M. Weseloh, F. Mello de Queiroz, H. Knötgen, A. Sánchez, M. E.

This is especially significant if one takes into account that the corresponding normal tissues were in all cases negative for EagI expression, except in some restricted populations. EagI overexpression in heterologous systems leads to a phenotype compatible with malignant transformation of the cells, like higher proliferation rate, loss of contact inhibition, and generate larger and more aggressive tumors than control cells when implanted subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficient mice (6Pardo L.A. del Camino D. Sánchez A. Alves F. Brüggemann A. Beckh S. Stühmer W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These data suggest that EagI may not only represent a potential marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer but also that it may contribute to the formation and progression of cancers. Indeed, it has been shown for breast cancer cells (13Ouadid-Ahidouch H. Le Bourhis X. Roudbaraki M. Toillon R.A. Delcourt P. Prevarskaya N. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 345-356PubMed Google Scholar) and for melanoma cells (14Gavrilova-Ruch O. Schönherr K. Gessner G. Schönherr R. Klapperstuck T. Wohlrab W. Heinemann S.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that the use of EagI blockers leads to a reduction in proliferation. In those reports, the antihistamine astemizole and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine were used, respectively. Although both are efficient EagI blockers, they are rather nonspecific (15García-Ferreiro R.E. Kerschensteiner D. Major F. Monje F. Stühmer W. Pardo L.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Not only the study of the physiological functions of EagI, but also the characterization of the potential usefulness of EagI as a cancer target still require the use of potent and specific inhibitors of the channel. RNA interference is a relatively new technology with the potential to investigate molecular physiology by means of specific and effective knock down of a particular gene both in vitro and in vivo (16Izquierdo M. Cancer Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Short interfering RNAs are 21–23 base pairs double stranded RNA molecules with 2-nucleotide 3′-overhangs (in practice modified to increase stability). When entering the cell, they bind to the RISC complex (RNA-initiated silencing complex), which promotes the cleavage of the RNA containing that particular sequence. The mechanism is very effective, leading to virtual abolition of the expression of the target gene, but its most interesting feature is the virtually absolute specificity that can be reached. The major drawback of the technique is the possible occurrence of off-target effects, either mediated by the siRNA itself (for example acting as a micro-RNA) or by the nonspecific stress response of the cell upon uptake of double stranded RNA (see Refs. 17Eckstein F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 18Huppi K. Martin S.E. Caplen N.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A number of independent control experiments need to be performed to minimize the risk of such off-target effects, a summary of which has been recently agreed on by an expert panel (19Anonymous (editorial material)Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effectiveness of siRNA 4The abbreviations used are: siRNA, short interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; nt, nucleotide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FAM, carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine. 4The abbreviations used are: siRNA, short interfering RNA; HEK, human embryonic kidney; nt, nucleotide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FAM, carboxyfluorescein; TAMRA, carboxytetramethylrhodamine.-mediated EagI silencing as a tool to reduce its tumorigenic properties in vitro. We initially used an EagI-transfected cell line (HEK293) to carefully characterize the action (with highest attention to specificity) of RNA interference in a heterologous system. Importantly, a panel of control experiments (some of them specifically designed for this study) suggest that the siRNA acts very specifically, i.e. only on EagI, without inducing spurious responses. We show not only a reduction of EagI at the mRNA, protein, and functional levels using electrophysiology but also the effects EagI silencing has on cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observe a similar behavior in several cancer cell lines that endogenously express EagI, derived both from the brain and peripheral tissues. Although it has generally been described that the silencing of most genes requires 2 days or more (20Choi I. Cho B.R. Kim D. Miyagawa S. Kubo T. Kim J.Y. Park C.G. Hwang W.S. Lee J.S. Ahn C. J. Biotechnol. 2005; 120: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), our results indicate that EagI mRNA degradation starts with in 4 h of the siRNA transfection and maximal inhibition occurs at 8 h in all three cell lines studied. In agreement with this data, we observed maximal protein and functional knock down at later time points. As the first report of siRNA used as a tool to reduce EagI expression, our data reinforce the concept of an implication of EagI in tumor cell proliferation and indicate a causal link between eag1 expression and increased proliferation. It could therefore serve as a basis for the development of anti-EagI siRNAs as a therapeutic strategy for tumors, while representing a useful tool for the exploration of EagI functional role in normal tissue. Cell Culture—Cell lines (HEK293, MDA-MB435S, Daoy, HT-1080, Hs633t, TE-671, A204, IGR-39, IPC298, HeLa, MCF-7, SHSY-5Y) were obtained from DSMZ, ATCC, or ECACC. Each cell line was propagated and maintained according to the instructions of the corresponding provider. siRNA Transfections—Four different siRNAs were designed against both EagI and EagII with accession numbers NM_172362 and NM_ 172376, respectively, using the HiPerformance siRNA Design Algorithm. The algorithm uses a neuronal network approach to design the siRNAs (21Huesken D. Lange J. Mickanin C. Weiler J. Asselbergs F. Warner J. Meloon B. Engel S. Rosenberg A. Cohen D. Labow M. Reinhardt M. Natt F. Hall J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and discards those sequences with high similarity to regions of other genes. Areas of the target sequence with known single nucleotide polymorphisms were avoided. The generation of multiple functional siRNAs against EagI allowed independent confirmation of the phenotypic effects (18Huppi K. Martin S.E. Caplen N.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There are no reports in which different phenotypes induced by the two known splice variants of EagI have been described. Only Eag1a has been studied in terms of cell proliferation, and we therefore did not attempt to design siRNAs that could discriminate between the two EagI splice variants. siRNAs (1–100 nm) were transfected using either Oligofectamine, Lipofectamine (Qiagen), or Dharmacon Transfection Reagent 2 (Dharmacon) transfection reagents in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen). Cells were plated 1 day before transfection. The following siRNAs were used: siRNAs directed against hEAG1 with NM_172362 as target sequence, Kv10.1 nt 1509–1529, Kv10.1-1 nt 236–256, Kv10.1-2 nt 863–883, Kv10.1-3 nt 1793–1813, Kv10.1-4 nt 1022–1042; siRNAs directed against hEAG2 with NM_172376 as target sequence, Kv10.2-1 nt 378–398, Kv10.2-2 nt 678–698, Kv10.2-3 nt 1524–1544, Kv10.2-4 nt 837–857. As negative controls we used siRNA with the reverse but not complementary (“scrambled”) sequence of Kv10.1 and Kv10.1-3 (revKv10.1 and revKv10.1-3). These molecules have the same base composition and closest structure to the active siRNA. The sense strand of the annealed siRNA duplexes was modified with two dT at the 3′-ends, the antisense strand with the sequence-corresponding desoxynucleotides to stabilize the siRNAs against degradation (22Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). All siRNAs were synthesized by Qiagen and annealed prior to use, except the commercial Negative Control #1 and the human GAPDH siRNA (Ambion), which we used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The cells were incubated with the siRNA and the transfection reagent for between 4 and 24 h. Cells were harvested for the experiments at different time points after the start of transfection. Additionally cells treated only with OptiMEM and Oligofectamine, Lipofectamine, or Dharmacon Transfection Reagent 2 were included as controls. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations and stored at –80 °C until used. 5 μg of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript (Invitrogen) or M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Real time PCR was performed in triplicates on 100 ng of cDNA using the two-step TaqMan Core Kit (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI 7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) sequence analyzer. The following fragments were amplified: nt 1070–1168 from sequence NM_002238 was detected with the hEAG1a probe (5′-FAM-AACGTGGA(TAMRA dT)GAGGGCATCAGCAGCCT SpacerC3–3′); nt 1751–1886 from sequence NM_172376 detected with the hEAG2 probe (5′-FAM-CCCTTCCC(TAMRA dT)AAAATAGCCACCACCTCA Spacer-C3–3′); nt 1001–1081 from sequence NM_002610 was detected with the hPDK1 probe (5′-6-FAM-TGAGGATTTGACTGTGAAGATGAGTGACCGA-TAMRA-3′); nt 1632–1732 from sequence NM_003234 was detected with the hTFR probe (5′-JOE-TGAATGGCTAGAGGGA(TAMRA dT)ACCTTTCGTCCC-3′); nt 85–180 from sequence NM_002046 was detected with the hGAPDH probe (5′-FAM-AATACGACCAAATCCGTTGACTCCGAC-TAMRA-3′). PCR conditions were: 2 min 50 °C; 15 min 94 °C; 15s 94 °C, 15s 56 °C, and 1 min 60 °C (40 cycles). Copy numbers per volume of the samples were determined with the help of a calibration curve of plasmid standards with a known number of copies. The resulting concentrations were standardized to the amount of a housekeeping gene, the human transferrin receptor type 1. The plotted graphs are thus standardized values further normalized to the Negative Control #1, revKv10.1, and revKv10.1-3 control values as means with S.E., respectively. Except as otherwise indicated (N in the figure legend), data shown in the figures correspond to the analysis of results obtained in three independent RNA preparations. Western Blot—To obtain cell lysates, cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics). The crude cell lysate was homogenized 10 times through a 23-gauge injection needle, sonicated to disrupt DNA, and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge. The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins (30 μg) were denatured and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters at pH 10. The membranes were blocked (2% casein, Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h, incubated with polyclonal anti-EagI antibody in 1% casein (23Napp J. Monje F. Stühmer W. Pardo L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29506-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for 2 h, washed (3 × 10 min Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The membranes were developed using chemoluminescence (ECL kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Flow Cytometry—After treatment with siRNA, cells were plated in 6-well plates and were incubated for 24–144 h before measurements. Cells were trypsinized, and the suspension was incubated in phosphatebuffered saline containing 0.1% saponin and a mixture of two anti-EagI monoclonal antibodies directly labeled with quantum dots. After 2 h on ice, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% saponin and analyzed on a BD FACSAriaTM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Quantum dots were excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence was collected using a LP556 dichroic and BP660/20 filter. Gates for viable cells (using propidium iodide) were established, and the mean of fluorescence intensity was determined after the exclusion of dead cells. Electrophysiology—hEag1a-transfected HEK293 cells were plated on multiple poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in Petri dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were treated with siRNAs for 4 h. 24 or 72 h after treatment, the coverslips were removed from the dish and used for electrophysiological measurements. Electrophysiological recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar) using an EPC9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA, Germany). Currents were digitized at 50 KHz (with 5-fold over-sampling). Patch pipettes were pulled from Corning #0010 glass (World Precision Instruments) to resistances of 1–2 megohms when filled with the internal solution 100 mm KCl, 45 mm NMDG, 5 mm 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (KOH). The bathing solution contained 160 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 8 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). We used the automated capacity compensation of the amplifier to estimate series resistance, which was compensated to 85%. Under such conditions, the heterologous EagI currents are robust enough to mask endogenous currents almost completely (see for example Ref. 15García-Ferreiro R.E. Kerschensteiner D. Major F. Monje F. Stühmer W. Pardo L.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To measure EagI currents, we applied a conditioning pulse to 100 mV for 1500 ms to slow down the activation of EagI (11Terlau H. Ludwig J. Steffan R. Pongs O. Stühmer W. Heinemann S.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Ludwig J. Terlau H. Wunder F. Brüggemann A. Pardo L.A. Marquardt A. Stühmer W. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the outward currents were then elicited by a square depolarization to +40 mV. We measured the mean steady state current between 350 and 450 ms after the start of depolarization and subtracted from this value the current amplitude between 7 and 13 ms after the start of depolarization. Using this protocol we assume that any fast activating currents are unrelated to EagI (endogenous). The final current values were divided by the measured capacitance of the cell to obtain current densities. Proliferation Assay—Proliferation was estimated based on the ability of metabolically active cells to either reduce resazurin to fluorescent resorufin (Alamar Blue, BIOSOURCE) or tetrazolium salts to colored formazan (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Roche Applied Science). siRNA- and control-treated cells were trypsinized and plated in 96-well plates in a volume of 200 μl at densities ranging from 1000 to 2500 cells/well depending on the cell line examined. To determine the metabolic activity, 20 μl of Alamar Blue or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent was added to each well and returned to the incubator for 2–4 h. The absorbance was determined in a 1420 Victor2 Multilabel Counter (Wallac) using a 570 nm filter and the fluorescence using 544 nm emission and 590 nm excitation filters. Specific siRNAs Reduce EagI mRNA Levels—Three cell lines were selected to observe the effects of silencing human EagI with RNA interference. EagI-transfected HEK293 cells were chosen as a heterologous system, whereas two additional cell lines that endogenously express hEag1 were picked as models for either “normal” (Daoy, derived from brain) or ectopic expression of the channel (MDA-MB435S, derived from breast carcinoma). As a positive control for transfection efficiency, we used siRNA directed against hGAPDH. Knock down of the protein concentration was confirmed by Western blot (not shown). As GAPDH is a key enzyme of glycolysis, reduction of the protein should be reflected on the metabolic activity of transfected cells. As expected, GAPDH-siRNA treatment reduced levels of GAPDH RNA in all three cell lines (Fig. 1, A–C). The metabolic activity of the cells was immediately reduced and remained clearly reduced for several days after transfection, which we interpret as a combination between slower cell proliferation and metabolic inhibition (Fig. 1D). The use of multiple functional siRNAs allows independent confirmation of the phenotypic effects (18Huppi K. Martin S.E. Caplen N.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Anonymous (editorial material)Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), as different siRNAs targeting the same gene are often differentially effective in silencing. This behavior is because of their different thermodynamic properties, stabilities, and positioning of either the siRNAs themselves or of the target region of the gene (17Eckstein F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore tested four siRNAs directed against EagI, which have been designated Kv10.1-1–Kv10.1-4 to distinguish them from the channel. These siRNAs recognize distinct target sequences in EagI and differ in their silencing potency in both EagI-transfected HEK293 and endogenously expressing cells as shown in Fig. 2. Kv10.1-1 did not reduce the amount of hEag1a RNA significantly in hEag1a-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all four sequences were effective at the RNA level in endogenously expressing cell lines (Fig. 2, B and C). In all cell lines, Kv10.1-3 was the most potent siRNA reducing the hEag1a RNA content by 63.2 ± 9.7% (HEK-hEAG1a, Fig. 2A), 81.3 ± 12.7% (MDA-MB435S, Fig. 2B), and 75.1 ± 4.9% (Daoy, Fig. 2C). Off-target effects and nonspecific cellular responses are major concerns when interpreting the phenotypes induced by siRNA. To address this issue, we used several independent approaches. First, we determined and subsequently used the minimal effective concentration of each EagI siRNA. We also utilized both commercial nonsense siRNAs (Negative Control #1), which have been established not to induce a noticeable phenotype in several cell lines, as well as two negative controls specially designed for this work. These negative controls each consist of siRNA with the reversed (but not complementary) sequence of the corresponding targeting siRNAs that are directed against two different regions in the EagI sequence. This means that these controls not only comprise the same nucleotides but also the same sequence of nucleotides as the targeting EagI siRNAs. In all experiments described in this study, none of these control siRNAs produced significant changes in any of the parameters measured (Figs. 2, 5, 8, and 9). Finally, siRNA directed against the close relative EagII failed to reduce the mRNA content of EagI in cells and conversely, EagI siRNA did not alter the levels of EagII mRNA, indicating specific effects on the particular target sequence (Fig. 3).FIGURE 8siRNA treatment efficiently reduces protein content and function.

Zhu X. Green M.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). None of the specific siRNAs reported here induced changes in the expression levels of PDK1, indicating that the phenotypic effects observed are not related to nonspecific double stranded RNA-induced responses (Figs. 4 and 5). We also determined the effects of varying the duration that the cells are in contact with the siRNA-transfection reagent mix. For transfection, a minimum time of 4 h is generally recommended, but the optimal time depends on the system used. Cells were incubated with equilibrated siRNA-transfection reagent mix for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, and the relative reduction in EagI RNA levels elicited by Kv10.1-3 was monitored by real time PCR. Additionally, we measured the hPDK1 mRNA levels to assess the nonspecific response. We detected optimal EagI reduction after an 8-h incubation with siRNA in hEag1a HEK293-transfected cells. Longer incubations resulted in non-significant changes in the levels of hPDK1, suggesting that incubation over longer time periods would induce nonspecific changes. We therefore established the 8-h incubation to be optimal and used this time for all experiments (Fig. 5).

Here we show that EBI2 signals with constitutive activity through Gαi as determined by a receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production and an induction of the serum response element-driven transcriptional activity in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Gαs and Gαq were not activated constitutively as determined by the lack of cAMP production, the lack of inositol phosphate turnover, and the lack of activities of the transcription factors: cAMP response element-binding protein and nuclear factor-κB. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy of FLAG- and green fluorescent protein-tagged EBI2 revealed cell-surface expression. A putative N-terminal truncated version of EBI2, Δ4-EBI2, showed similar expression and signaling through Gαi as full-length EBI2. By using a 32P-labeled EBI2 probe we found a very high expression in lymphoid tissue (spleen and lymph node) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a high expression in lung tissue. Real-time PCR of EBV-infected cells showed high expression of EBI2 during latent and lytic infection, in contrast to the EBV-encoded 7TM receptor BILF1, which was induced during lytic infection. EBI2 clustered with the orphan GPR18 by alignment analysis as well as by close proximity in the chromosomal region 13q32.3.

Based on the constitutive signaling and cellular expression pattern of EBI2, it is suggested that it may function in conjunction with BILF1 in the reprogramming of the cell during EBV infection. The orphan EBI2 2The abbreviations used are: EBI2, Epstein-Barr virus induced receptor 2; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; 7TM receptors, seven transmembrane spanning α-helix receptors; HHV8, human herpesvirus 8; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; NK cell, natural killer cell; CysL1, and -2, cysteinyl leukotriene receptors 1 and 2; Ptx, pertussis toxin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CREB, cAMP responsive element-binding protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; SRE, serum response element; PAA, phosphonoacetic acid; wt, wild-type; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; wt, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein. receptor belongs to the superfamily of rhodopsin-like 7TM receptors (seven-transmembrane segment receptors), also known as G-protein-coupled receptors. The sequencing of the human genome has identified around 700 7TM receptors, and approximately half of these are believed to encode sensory receptors. The remaining receptors are divided into different classes of which class A (rhodopsin-like) includes the vast majority of the receptors. The cognate ligands have been identified for ∼200 non-sensory 7TM receptors, whereas the rest are still orphan receptors (1Schwartz T.W. Holst B. Foreman J.C. Johansen T. Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2003: 65-85Google Scholar). EBI2 was cloned in 1993 as one out of nine up-regulated genes in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected Burkitt lymphoma cells (2Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These nine genes were up-regulated from 4- to >100-fold upon EBV infection, and two 7TM receptors were identified among the up-regulated genes (Epstein-Barr-induced receptors 1 and 2, EBI1 and -2). EBI1 was later deorphanized as the receptor for the chemokines CCL19/ELC and CCL21/SLC and was consequently renamed CCR7 (3Yoshida R. Imai T. Hieshima K. Kusuda J. Baba M. Kitaura M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13803-13809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), whereas the ligand(s) for EBI2 still remains to be identified. EBI2 displayed the highest up-regulation (>200-fold) among the nine EBV-induced genes compared with for example 21-fold for CCR7 (2Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial expression analyses of the nine genes uncovered an expression of EBI2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), tonsils, spleen, and lung tissue (2Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CCR7 and EBI2 are not the only 7TM receptors being regulated by EBV. In fact, up- and down-regulation of endogenous 7TM receptors and ligands are important events following a virus infection, and interestingly, many of these genes belong to the chemokine system (4Cahir-McFarland E.D.

Molecular mimicry is another approach used by many herpes- and poxviruses to manipulate the host immune system, and again the chemokine system is “over-represented” compared with other 7TM receptor systems (7Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Curr. Drug Targets. 2006; 7: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Murphy P.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, a growing number of herpes- and poxvirus-encoded receptors, and ligands have been identified within the last decade, and most of these receptors bind a broad spectrum of chemokines and signal in a constitutive manner. Of these, the γ2-herpesvirus-encoded ORF74 receptors are the most abundantly characterized receptors (9Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 10Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The first γ1-herpesvirus-encoded 7TM receptor (vGPCR) was identified in 2002 in region A5/BILF1 of the porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus-1 by Goltz et al. (12Goltz M. Ericsson T. Patience C. Huang C.A. Noack S. Sachs D.H. Ehlers B. Virology. 2002; 294: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The same paper described the presence of BILF1 homologs in other γ1-herpesviruses, for instance EBV. The EBV-encoded BILF1 receptor was recently cloned and characterized as a highly constitutively active receptor (13Paulsen S.J. Rosenkilde M.M. Eugen-Olsen J. Kledal T.N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Beisser P.S. Verzijl D. Gruijthuijsen Y.K. Beuken E. Smit M.J. Leurs R. Bruggeman C.A. Vink C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The knowledge about the orphan EBV-induced EBI2 receptor is limited to the original cloning paper (2Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to a study showing a lack of simian immunodeficiency virus cell entry cofactor function for EBI2 (15Farzan M. Choe H. Martin K. Marcon L. Hofmann W. Karlsson G. Sun Y. Barrett P. Marchand N. Sullivan N. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the present study we compare the primary structure of EBI2 with other herpesvirus-related 7TM receptors (i.e. the herpesvirus-encoded receptors) and a selection of endogenous 7TM receptors. We find that EBI2 does not resemble any of the herpesvirus-encoded 7TM receptors but is closest related to the orphan 7TM GPR18 and the two lipid receptors cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 and 2 (CysL1 and -2). In addition, we find that EBI2 clusters with GPR18 in region q32.3 at chromosome 13. We characterize EBI2 in terms of signaling activities at the level of G-proteins as well as at the level of the transcriptional activity. The cellular as well as tissue expression of EBI2 is characterized and the expression of EBI2 during the different replication states of EBV is quantified by real-time PCR and compared with the BILF1 receptor expression. We find that the constitutive signaling through Gαi and the cell-surface localization of EBI2 is similar to BILF1 (13Paulsen S.J. Rosenkilde M.M. Eugen-Olsen J. Kledal T.N. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas the expression pattern during virus infection varies, because EBI2 is expressed during latent as well as lytic replication, whereas BILF1 is induced during lytic infection. Materials—EBI2 was cloned from a human spleen cDNA library from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and corresponded to the GenBank™ accession number L08177. The human CCR7 was kindly provided by Martin Lipp (Molecular Tumor Genetics, MDC-Berlin, Germany). The human chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 were purchased from PeproTech (London, England). The promiscuous chimeric G-protein GαΔ6qi4myr (abbreviated Gqi4myr) was kindly provided by Evi Kostenis (7TM-Pharma, Denmark). LipofectAMINE™ 2000 Reagent and Opti-MEM 1 were purchased from Invitrogen. LucLite (lyophilized substrate solution) was from Packard (Boston, MA). myo-[3H]Inositol, cAMP-EIA kit, and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody were from Amersham Biosciences. Pertussis toxin (Ptx), forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and anti-FLAG (M2) antibody were from Sigma. AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin was from Bio-Rad. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The human EBI2 was inserted into a set of different eukaryotic expression vectors: the pTEJ8 vector (16Johansen T.E. Schøller M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the pcDNA3 vector, the pEGFP-N1 vector, and a modified pcDNA3 vector with a FLAG tag inserted upstream of the polylinker region kindly provided by Kate Hansen (7TM-Pharma, Denmark). N-terminal truncation of EBI2 (Δ4) was made by PCR using the wild-type/full-length EBI2 as template. All reactions were carried out using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The wild-type and truncated EBI2 DNA were verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI 310 sequencer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Transfections and Tissue Culture—COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen, cat. no 21885-025) adjusted with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin (PenStrep). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium adjusted to contain 4500 mg/liter glucose (cat. no. 31966-021) with the same amount FBS and PenStrep as the COS-7 cells at 10% CO2 and 37 °C. The HEK293 cell media was modified to hold heat-inactivated FBS and no PenStrep during luciferase based assays. Stable transfected and naïve L12 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, PenStrep, and the selection marker G418 for the EBI2-expressing cell lines. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Brauner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE™ 2000 Reagent in the serum-free media Opti-MEM 1 according to the manufacturer's description for all experiments. L12 cells were stably transfected by electroporation. Briefly, EBI2-GFP DNA was linearized and transferred into a 0.4-cm cuvette, and a single electroporation pulse at 250 V and 960 microfarads was applied. The electroporated cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and transferred to culture at 37 °C in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Geneticin (G418) was added to a final concentration of 800 mg/ml 48 h after transfection, and the cells were plated in 96-well plates (25,000 cells/well) (17Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P. Li Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C.J. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 weeks, five G418-resistant clones were selected for further FACS sorting according to EBI2-GFP expression (see below). FACS Sorting and Fluorescence Analysis of Stably Transfected L12 Cells—Five different EBI2-GFP-expressing L12 cell clones were each FACS-sorted by a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage SE, Diva into a fraction with no EBI2 expression, a fraction with low EBI2 expression, and a fraction with high EBI2 expression. Among the EBI2-expressing fractions, four fractions were chosen representing the spectrum from low to high EBI2 expression. These four fractions were analyzed in respect of adenylate cyclase inhibition (cAMP-assay, see below), and the signaling activities were compared with the EBI2 expression level. Purification and Fractionation of PBMCs in B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, Monocytes, and NK Cells—Buffy-coats from four healthy blood donors were obtained 16 h after blood collection. The reminiscent erythrocytes were lysed by a 1:1 mixture of the buffy-coats with Hoffman's reagent (0.16 NH4Cl, 0.10 mm Na2EDTA, and 10 mm NaHCO3), and the granulocytes were separated from the PBMCs by density centrifugation using the reagent Lymphoprep (AXIS-SHIELD, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PBMCs were further fractionated into T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and NK cells by CD3-, CD19-, CD14-, and CD56-covered magnetic beads, respectively (Micro-beads from Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Briefly, the PBMCs were mixed with the antibody-covered Micro-beads (2 μl of Micro-beads per 107 cells), and the mixtures were subsequently applied to MS-columns (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) that were attached to a MiniMac separator (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). The purification efficiencies of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and NK cells were determined by FACS analysis using perCpCy5 (Peridinin chlorophyll protein cyanin), phycoerythrin, or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD3, CD19, CD14, and CD56 antibodies (DAKO, Denmark) and found to be 85–95%. Real-time PCR Analysis of EBI2 Expression in T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, Monocytes, and NK Cells—Total RNA was extracted from isolated T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and NK cells using a QIAamp RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Subsequently, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the ImProm II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Quantification of EBI2 transcript levels in the PBMC subsets was performed using the SYBR Premix Ex TaqRT-PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and the Mx3000P system (Stratagene). Expression of β-actin was used for copy number normalization. A calibrator consisting of a mixture of cDNA from all samples was included in each run to facilitate comparative analysis. Each sample was assessed three times in triplicates. The primer pairs used were as follows: EBI2 forward: 5′-GAATCGGAGATGCCTTGTGT-3′; EBI2 reverse: 5′-GCCTCCTGCTTTGACATAGG-3′; β-actin forward: 5′-CGTCTTCCCCTCCATCGT-3′; β-actin reverse: 5′-CGCCCACATAGGAATCCTTC-3′. Amplification efficiency of the primer pair was validated using serial dilutions of the calibrator sample being satisfactory in both cases. Phosphatidylinositol Assay (PI Turnover)—COS-7 cells were transfected according to the procedure mentioned above. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of receptor or vector control cDNA (from 0 to 10 μg/flask) with or without 30 μg of the promiscuous chimeric G-protein, Gqi4myr, which turns the Gαi-coupled signal into the Gαq pathway (phospholipase C activation measured as PI turnover), or the Gqs5, which turns the Gαs-coupled signal into the Gαq pathway (18Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, COS-7 cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol in 0.4 ml of growth medium per well. Cells were washed twice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and the cells were incubated in 0.4 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were extracted by addition of 1 ml of 10 mm formic acid to each well followed by incubation on ice for 30–60 min. The generated [3H]inositol phosphates were purified on AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (19Berridge M.J. Dawson M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvin R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Determinations were made in duplicates. Adenylate Cyclase Inhibition Assay (cAMP-assay)—HEK293 cells were seeded at 35,000 cells/well in culture plates 1 day prior to transfection and were transfected with 50 ng/well EBI2 or the pcDNA3 vector as control. 24 h after the transfection, the cells were washed twice in HBS buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, supplemented with 0.75 mm NaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in HBS buffer supplemented with 1 mm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and various concentrations of the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. After incubation, the cells were placed on ice, the medium was removed, and the cAMP concentration was measured using the cAMP-EIA kit (Amersham Biosciences). The effect of 100 and 500 ng/ml Ptx was tested by adding it to the cells immediately following transfection. Naïve and stably transfected L12 cell lines were seeded at 50,000 cells/well 24 h before cAMP determination performed as described for the HEK293 cells above. Determinations were made in duplicates. Constitutive CREB, NF-κB, and SRE cis-Reporting Luciferase Assay— Cells were seeded at 35,000 cells/well in culture plates 24 h prior to transfection and were transfected with 50 ng/well of the (cis)-reporter plasmid (pCREB-Luc, pSRE-LUC, and pNF-κB-Luc) and concentrations from 0 to 50 ng/well of receptor plasmid. Immediately following transfection, the cells were given new media with variations in the concentrations of FBS (10% for the NF-κB and 0.1% for the CREB and the SRE reporter system) and incubated for 18 h in the presence or absence of Ptx. One day after transfection, the cells containing the CREB-luciferase receptor (and EBI2 or pcDNA3 vector) were given new media with or without forskolin and incubated for 5 h. All cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (0.9 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 137 mm NaCl, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4), and the luminescence was measured in a micro plate scintillation and luminescence counter (Top-counter, Packard) after 10 min incubation in 100 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline together with 100 μlof LucLite substrate. Determinations were made in quadruples. Microscopy—Transiently transfected HEK293 cells and stably transfected L12 cells expressing the EBI2 receptor fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), EBI2-GFP, were analyzed using a Zeiss ConfoCor2 LSM-FCS confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an Argon/2 laser (488 nm) using an apochromat 63×/1.4 oil differential interference contrast immersion lens. Surface Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with the N-terminal FLAG-tagged variants of EBI2 wt and Δ4-EBI2 for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in parallel with cells used for the CREB assay. The cells were washed once in TBS (35 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, and incubated in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin in TBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently kept at room temperature and incubated 2 h with anti-FLAG (M1) antibody (2 μg/ml) in TBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm CaCl2. After three washes in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2 the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody in the same buffer as the anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h. After three washes in TBS with 1 mm CaCl2 the immune reactivity was revealed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase substrate according to manufacture's instruction. Tissue Expression Analysis—This was performed using Clontech's Multiple Tissue Expression Array according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, a PCR fragment corresponding to the EBI2 sequence from bp 160–403 was obtained using the primers GTCGTCATTGTTCAAAACAGG (forward) and GCACCACAGCAATGAAGC (reverse). The fragment was 32P-labeled and used as probe for hybridization to the Multiple Tissue Expression Array. The data were visualized by a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the Quantity One Program (Bio-Rad). Stimulation of EBV-infected Cells—Akata+ and B95.8 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, 21875-034) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units penicillin and streptavidin per milliliter. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, and 5% CO2. Approximately 107 cells were used for each assay. Prior to stimulation cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in media (106 cells/ml). The Akata+ cells were stimulated with 0.5% v/v IgG antibody (DAKO, A042410), or IgG antibody plus 300 μg/ml PAA (phosphonoacetic acid) to inhibit viral DNA replication for 3 h, whereas the B95.8 cells were stimulated with 6 mm butyrate and 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate. Cells were resuspended in media with or without PAA and grown for 48 h. RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR—The RNAqoues 4-PCR kit (Ambion, cat no. 1914) was used for isolation of RNA. cDNA was synthesized using a First Strand Transcription cDNA synthesis kit from Roche Applied Science (cat. no. 04379012001), and the amount of RNA used varied between 1 and 3μg. Primer sequences were BILF1 (5′-CTATCAGCCTGACATCCATT-3′), EBI2 (5′-ACACAAGGCATCTCCGATTC-3′), BZLF1 (5′-GGAACACCAATGTCTGCTAG-3′), gp350 (5′-TGTCAGCTGGCCAAAGTCAA-3′), and EBNA3C (5′-TTTCTTGCTCTCTTGGTCCA-3′). Real-time PCR were run on a LightCycler using the LightCycler-Fast-Start DNA Master SYBR green I kit from Roche Applied Science (cat. no. 2239264). The forward primers were BILF1 (5′-GTCAATGCAACGGAAGATGC-3′), EBI2 (5′-GTCTTCATCATTGGGCTCGT-3′), BZLF1 (5′-CTCCGACATAACCCAGAATC-3′), gp350 (5′-TACACCATCCAGAGCCTGAT-3′), and EBNA3C (5′-GGGATATCGTACAGCAACAC-3′), and the reverse primers as mentioned above were used. For standard curves a series of 10-fold dilutions was prepared, reaching from 102 to 108 copies of a construct containing the gene of interest. The program used for amplification was 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Finally a melting curve was determined by heating to 95 °C. In each run both positive and negative controls were included. The plasmids used to create the standard curve were used for the positive control to know the specific number of copies. Fragment length was analyzed on agarose gels. EBI2 Groups with GPR18 and the Two Lipid Receptors CysL1 and -2— Numerous alignments and structural analyses in the literature have suggested different grouping for EBI2 among endogenous 7TM receptors (20Lapinsh M. Gutcaits A. Prusis P. Post C. Lundstedt T. Wikberg J.E. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Vassilatis D.K. Hohmann J.G. Zeng H. Li F. Ranchalis J.E. Mortrud M.T. Brown A. Rodriguez S.S. Weller J.R. Wright A.C. Bergmann J.E. Gaitanaris G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the primary structure of EBI2 has never been compared with the herpesvirus-encoded 7TM receptors, and we therefore aligned EBI2 with a broad selection of endogenous and viral 7TM receptors (Fig. 1). We included the receptors recently suggested to be closest to EBI2 (GPR18, CysL1, and -2 (21Vassilatis D.K. Hohmann J.G. Zeng H. Li F. Ranchalis J.E. Mortrud M.T. Brown A. Rodriguez S.S. Weller J.R.

(2002) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/11/research/0063Google Scholar)) together with a selection of monoamine and peptide receptors: the α2 and β1-adrenergic receptors, the ghrelin, the neurotensin receptor 2, and the melanocortin receptors 1 and 2 and selected orphan receptors (GPR3, -6, -9, and -39). Many of these were chosen due to their constitutive signaling (ghrelin, neurotensin receptor 2, melanocortin receptors 1 and 2, and GPR3, -6, -9, and -39). The chemokine system was represented by the endogenous receptors CCR1, -2, -4, and -8, CXCR1–4, XCR1, CX3CR1, and RDC1 together with certain constitutively active herpesvirus-encoded receptors (2Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Elsevier, New York2004: 779-785Google Scholar). Thus, we included the EBV-encoded receptor (BILF1), the γ2-herpesvirus-encoded ORF74 receptors from human herpesvirus 8 (ORF74-HHV8), from herpesvirus saimiri (ORF74-HVS, previously identified as HVS-ECRF3) and from equine herpesvirus 2 (ORF74-EHV2) and the human cytomegalovirus-encoded US28 and US27 receptors. EBI2, as expected (21Vassilatis D.K. Hohmann J.G. Zeng H. Li F. Ranchalis J.E. Mortrud M.T. Brown A. Rodriguez S.S. Weller J.R. Wright A.C. Bergmann J.E. Gaitanaris G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4903-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 22Joost, P., and Methner, A. (2002) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/11/research/0063Google Scholar), only grouped with the GPR18 and the CysL1 and -2 receptors among the endogenous receptors. No structural homology was found between EBI2 and the family of constitutively active (β- and γ-herpesvirus-encoded 7TM receptors) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, analysis of the chromosomal localization of EBI2, GPR18, and the CysL1 and -2 receptors revealed an intimate relationship between EBI2 and GPR18, because both genes were located at chromosome 13 in the region 13q32.3 at the minus strand, with only 32,792 bp separation. Another related gene, EBI2-like (a pseudogene) was also found in this region 100,923 bp from GPR18. In the same region, but at the positive strand, an unrelated gene, PGDH-like 1 (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase-like 1) was flanking both GPR18 and EBI2 (Fig. 1B). This close proximity was not found for the CysL1 and -2 receptors that were located at Xq13.2–21.1 and 13q14.12-q21.1, respectively. EBI2 Is Expressed at the Cell Surface and Signals Constitutively through Gαi in a Ptx-sensitive Manner—The cellular expression was analyzed in two different cell lines, the laboratory fibroblast HEK293 cell line used for binding and signaling characterization of 7TM receptors in general, and the pre-B-cell lymphocyte cell line L12, chosen due to the original cloning of EBI2 from B-lymphocytes infected with EBV. As shown in Fig. 2, EBI2 fused to green-fluorescent protein (EBI2-GFP) localized predominantly to the cell-membrane in both cell lines, as shown for the majority of endogenous 7TM receptors (1Schwartz T.W. Holst B. Foreman J.C. Johansen T. Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2003: 65-85Google Scholar). To study whether EBI2 is a functional receptor, we tested for putative signaling through a variety of G-proteins. The Gαi coupling of EBI2 was initially analyzed by means of cAMP formation in transiently transfected HEK293 in the absence and presence of forskolin (a direct activator of adenylate cyclase).

https://openalex.org/W2116425205,"Coxsackievirus infection leads to a rapid reduction of the filling state of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi Ca2+ stores. The coxsackievirus 2B protein, a small membrane protein that localizes to the Golgi and to a lesser extent to the ER, has been proposed to play an important role in this effect by forming membrane-integral pores, thereby increasing the efflux of Ca2+ from the stores. Here, evidence is presented that supports this idea and that excludes the possibility that 2B reduces the uptake of Ca2+ into the stores. Measurement of intra-organelle-free Ca2+ in permeabilized cells revealed that the ability of 2B to reduce the Ca2+ filling state of the stores was preserved at steady ATP. Biochemical analysis in a cell-free system further showed that 2B had no adverse effect on the activity of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, the Ca2+-ATPase that transports Ca2+ from the cytosol into the stores. To investigate whether 2B specifically affects Ca2+ homeostasis or other ion gradients, we measured the lumenal Golgi pH. Expression of 2B resulted in an increased Golgi pH, indicative for the efflux of H+ from the Golgi lumen. Together, these data support a model that 2B increases the efflux of ions from the ER and Golgi by forming membrane-integral pores. We have demonstrated that a major consequence of this activity is the inhibition of protein trafficking through the Golgi complex.

Enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, ECHOvirus) belong to the family of Picornaviridea, a large family of nonenveloped, cytolytic viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. Upon infection, enteroviruses induce a number of dramatic alterations in their host cell, which serve to create the appropriate conditions for viral RNA replication and/or prevent antiviral host cell responses. One of these alterations is the modification of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. We have previously shown that infection of HeLa cells with coxsackievirus results in a reduction of the amount of Ca2+ that can be released from the intracellular stores using thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), 2The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; BGM, Buffalo green monkey; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NGS, normal goat serum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. the Ca2+-ATPase that transports Ca2+ from the cytosol into the stores. In addition, a gradual increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) was observed due to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (1Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L.

The enterovirus 2B protein, one of the nonstructural proteins involved in viral RNA replication, plays a major role in the alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis that take place in enterovirus-infected cells (1Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. Smeets R.L.L. Willems P.H.G.M. Dijkman H.B.P.M. Galama J.M.D. Melchers W.J.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3519-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Campanella M. De Jong A.S.

The mechanism by which 2B, or its precursor 2BC, exerts its effects is largely unknown. Ca2+ homeostasis in the intracellular stores (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi) is the net result of the activity of the SERCA on the one hand and the continuous passive Ca2+ leak from these organelles that exists under normal conditions on the other hand (3Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Thus, the reductions in the Ca2+ filling state of the stores in 2B-expressing cells may result from a decrease in Ca2+ uptake (through reduced SERCA action) or from an increase in Ca2+ efflux. The enterovirus 2B protein is a small (97–99 amino acids) membrane-integral protein (4De Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. Van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Biol.

Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4679-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enterovirus 2B protein contains two hydrophobic regions (HR1 and HR2), the first of which is predicted to form a cationic amphipathic α-helix (6Van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. van den Hurk P. J. J.C. Melchers W. J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-helix displays characteristics typical for the group of the socalled lytic polypeptides, which may build membrane-integral pores by forming transmembrane multimers (7Segrest J.P. De Loof H.

Accumulating evidence indicates that 2B forms homo-multimers, in which both hydrophobic regions span the phospholipid bilayer, suggesting that 2B increases the efflux of Ca2+ from the stores by forming transmembrane pores (9De Jong A.S.

In this study, we investigated ER and Golgi ion homeostasis in 2B-expressing cells. Using organelle-targeted aequorins, we have provided evidence that 2B decreases the Ca2+ content of both the ER and Golgi complex without affecting the Ca2+ uptake. Moreover, measurement of the Golgi pH with a Golgi-targeted pH-sensitive GFP variant revealed that expression of 2B also results in an increased Golgi pH, indicative of the efflux of H+ from the lumen of the Golgi. Together these data support the idea that 2B increases the efflux of ions from the ER and Golgi. Finally, we have shown that this activity of 2B results in the inhibition of protein trafficking through the Golgi complex.

BGM cells seeded on 13-mm glass coverslips were transfected and used for luminescence measurements as described previously (16Visch H.J. Rutter G.A. Koeppe R.E. Koenderink J.B.

Cells were reconstituted with coelenterazine-N (5 μm) in Ca2+-free Hepes-Tris medium (132 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing ionomycin (1 μm) to deplete the intracellular stores for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Next, coverslips were washed thoroughly with Ca2+-free medium containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to remove ionomycin and placed in a luminometer. To selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, cells were perfused with Ca2+-free intracellular medium (10 mm Hepes, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2,2mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, pH 7.05) containing 20 μg/ml of saponin for 2 min at 37 °C. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake into the stores was started by adding 0.55 mm CaCl2, resulting in a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 μm. At the end of the measurement, cells were lysed with 100 μm digitonin in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and aequorin photon emission was converted off-line into Ca2+ concentration values according to Montero et al. (12Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Values from multiple experiments were expressed as average ± S.E. SERCA Activity Measurements—SERCA activity was determined using a radiochemical method (17Swarts H.G. Klaassen C.H. Schuurmans-Stekhoven F.M. De Pont J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested in PBS supplemented with 10 mm EDTA at 40 h posttransfection. After washing with PBS, cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using an Altra Hypersort flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) equipped with an Argon laser running at 20 milliwatts. Forward scatter, side scatter, and cell fluorescence were analyzed and viable GFP-positive cells were high speed sorted (15,000 cells/s) using a band-pass filter of 525/530 nm and a dichroic mirror of 550 nm. GFP-positive cells were washed with homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Ac, pH 7.0) and lysed by resuspension in 0.1 ml of H20 and freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen three times. The homogenate was diluted with 0.2 ml of homogenization buffer. Aliquots of 20 μl were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in a reaction medium containing 50 mm Tris-Ac (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2,1mm Tris-azide, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 μm ionomycin, 150 mm KCl, 3 mm (γ-32P)ATP (specific activity 100–500 mCi/mmol), and 0.5 mm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+]5 μm). The reactions were stopped by adding 500 μl of 10% (w/v) charcoal in 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the mixture was centrifuged for 30 s at 10,000 × g. To 200 μl of clear supernatant containing the liberated inorganic phosphate (32Pi), 4 ml of OptiFluor (Canberra Packard, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added, and the mixture was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. Blanks were prepared by incubation of the reaction medium in the absence of homogenate. ATPase activity was determined in the presence and absence of 10 μm thapsigargin, and SERCA activity is presented as the difference between the mock-treated and the thapsigargin-treated homogenates. pHluorin Measurements—Targeted pHluorin constructs were used to measure pH in cytosol, med-trans region of the Golgi complex, and the TGN at the single cell level. Coverslips containing pHluorin-expressing BGM cells were mounted in a Leiden chamber (18Ince C. van Dissel J.T. Diesselhoff M.M. Pflugers Arch. 1985; 403: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200 m; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×63, 1.25 NA plan-Neofluar objective. During measurement, cells were perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium. pHluorin was excited at 395 and 470 nm, respectively, using a monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany), and fluorescence was monitored at 508 nm. Fluorescence light was directed by a 505DRLPXR dichroic mirror (Omega Optical Inc.) through a 515ALP emission filter (Omega Optical Inc.) onto a Cool-SNAP HQ monochrome CCD-camera (Roper Scientific, Vianen, The Netherlands). Hardware was controlled with Metafluor 6.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp.) running on a PC equipped with 1 Gb RAM and Windows XP Professional. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—BGM cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at the indicated time points posttransfection. Cells were permeabilized using PBS/0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Primary antibodies and conjugates were diluted 1:200 with PBS/0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100/2% (w/v) normal goat serum (NGS). Incubations with the primary antibody were carried out overnight at 4 °C, and incubations with the secondary antibody were carried out for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS/0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 between incubation steps and mounted in mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS NT; Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Calculations—Data are presented as mean values ± S.D. Differences were tested for significance by means of the Student's t-test. The 2B Protein Disturbs ER and Golgi Ca2+ Homeostasis without Affecting Ca2+ Uptake—Previously, we demonstrated that 2B expression resulted in a reduced filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ stores in intact HeLa cells (2Campanella M. De Jong A.S. Melchers W.J.G. Willems P.H.G.M. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Van Kuppeveld F. J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18440-18450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effect of 2B on ER and Golgi Ca2+ levels in BGM kidney cells. Measurements of organelle [Ca2+] were performed in cells that were permeabilized with saponin and then incubated in an intracellular medium containing a high ATP concentration (saponin specifically permeabilizes the plasma membrane without affecting endomembranes). By following this approach, it can be excluded that possible effects on organelle [Ca2+] are caused by reduced SERCA activity due to ATP depletion. The [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi were determined by bioluminometric analysis of cell populations using the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin that was targeted to these organelles by fusion to specific targeting signals (12Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 13Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). BGM cells were cotransfected with expression constructs of either ER- or Golgi-targeted aequorin together with either p2B-Myc or a control plasmid. Upon perfusion of the permeabilized cells with intracellular medium containing 0.1 μm free Ca2+ and 2.5 mm ATP, the organelle [Ca2+] increased rapidly by the action of the SERCA (Fig. 1, A and B, left panels). No increase in organelle [Ca2+] was observed under these conditions in the absence of saponin, indicating that the cells were efficiently permeabilized (data not shown). Moreover, the increase in luminescence observed upon addition of ATP and Ca2+ was blocked by the SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid, indicating that Ca2+ is actively stored in the ER and Golgi compartment (data not shown). After ∼40 s, a steady state [Ca2+] was reached at which the amount of Ca2+ pumped into the organelle by the SERCA was equal to the Ca2+ leak. In control cells, the mean steady-state [Ca2+]ER was 650 μm (Fig. 1A, right panel). In 2B-expressing cells, however, this value was significantly (p < 0.005) decreased to 430 and 395 μm at 18 and 40 h posttransfection, respectively. Expression of the 2B protein had a similar effect on [Ca2+]Golgi (Fig. 1B, right panel). In control cells, the mean steady-state [Ca2+]Golgi was 520 μm, whereas in 2B-expressing cells this value was significantly (p < 0.005) decreased to 340 and 325 μm at 18 and 40 h posttransfection, respectively. These results demonstrate that 2B expression reduces the Ca2+ content of both the ER and Golgi complex in BGM kidney cells and that this effect is not caused by ATP depletion. To address the possibility that the 2B protein reduced [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]Golgi by inhibiting the SERCA pump, we performed an in vitro radiochemical analysis of SERCA activity (17Swarts H.G. Klaassen C.H. Schuurmans-Stekhoven F.M. De Pont J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). BGM cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1 (control) or p2B-EGFP. At 40 h posttransfection, fluorescent cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and subsequently homogenized. ATPase activity of the homogenate was determined by analyzing (γ-32P)ATP hydrolysis, counting the amount of liberated radiolabeled inorganic phosphate (32Pi). Homogenates were assayed in the absence and presence of 10 μm thapsigargin and at an ambient-free [Ca2+]of5 μm. The total amount of liberated 32Pi was equal in EGFP- and 2B-EGFP-expressing cells (45 ± 3 and 46 ± 10 nmol/h/106 cells, respectively), demonstrating that 2B does not affect overall ATPase activity. In each experiment, the total ATPase activity was set at 100%, to which the activity measured in the presence of thapsigargin was related. Fig. 2 shows that the thapsigargin-sensitive ATPase activity was not different between control cells and 2B-expressing cells and amounted to ∼45% of the total activity. This indicates that the 2B protein does not inhibit the SERCA pump. Together with the observation that reduced Ca2+ filling of the ER and Golgi complex occurs also when ATP is not rate-limiting, this argues against an effect of 2B on Ca2+ uptake. The 2B Protein Disturbs the pH of the Golgi Complex—We next investigated whether the 2B-induced increase in ER and Golgi membrane permeability is Ca2+-specific or also applies to other ions. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of 2B expression on the pH of the Golgi complex, reasoning that non-selective alterations in membrane permeability would result in a disturbance of the proton gradient that exists over the Golgi membranes. This proton gradient is the consequence of the gradual acidification of secretory pathway organelles by the activity of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (19Schoonderwoert V.T. Martens G.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intra-organelle pH measurements were performed by digital imaging microscopy of individual cells expressing targeted ratiometric pHluorin constructs. pHluorin is a variant of wild-type (non-enhanced) GFP that displays a pH-dependent fluorescence excitation spectrum due to specific substitution mutations (14Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). The excitation spectrum of pHluorin displays two excitation peaks, one at 395 and one at 470 nm. At low pH values, emission intensity is low at 395 nm and high at 470 nm, resulting in a low 395/470-nm fluorescence emission ratio at 510 nm (R395/470). At high pH values, emission intensity is high at 395 nm and low at 470 nm, resulting in a higher R395/470 value. Thus, the R395/470 increases as a function of the pH and can be used to determine pH differences (14Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). First, we investigated whether the ratiometric pHluorins allowed us to sensitively detect in vivo pH differences in BGM cells. To this end, we determined the R395/470 emission ratio of the cytosol (pHcyt ∼ 7.2), the med-trans region of the Golgi complex (pHGolgi ∼ 6.4), and the trans-Golgi network (pHTGN ∼ 5.9) (pH values described in Ref. 19Schoonderwoert V.T. Martens G.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pHluorin expression constructs targeted either to the cytosol (pHluorin-cyt), the med-trans region of the Golgi complex (pHluorin-Golgi), or the trans-Golgi network (pHluorin-TGN). Fig. 3A shows the localization of the targeted pHluorins. At 40 h posttransfection, the R395/470 fluorescence emission ratio of the different subcellular compartments was determined. The mean R395/470 of pHluorin-cyt was 1.04 ± 0.02 (Fig. 3B), indicative of the neutral pH that exists in the cytosol. The mean R395/470 values obtained with pHluorin-Golgi (0.59 ± 0.10) and pHluorin-TGN (0.44 ± 0.07) were significantly lower (p < 0.005), reflecting the lower pH values in these compartments. Next, we investigated the effect of 2B expression on the pH of the Golgi complex. Previous work showed that the 2B protein predominantly localizes to the med-trans region of the Golgi complex (4De Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. Van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the med-trans Golgi-targeted pHluorin (pHluorin-Golgi) to investigate the effect of 2B expression on the pH in this compartment. In this part of the study we used the 2B-Myc protein because fluorescence derived from 2B-EGFP would contaminate the pHluorin signals. Colocalization of 2B-Myc and pHluorin-Golgi was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D demonstrates that in 2B-expressing cells the R395/470 was increased to 0.72 ± 0.09 at 18 h posttransfection (p < 0.05) and to 0.81 ± 0.12 at 40 h posttransfection (p < 0.005), suggesting that the 2B protein increases the pH of the Golgi. Expression of a control protein (i.e. Golgi-targeted aequorin) had no effect on Golgi pH (Fig. 3D), indicating that the increased Golgi pH in 2B-expressing cells is not a mere consequence of the overexpression of a Golgi-localized membrane protein. To exclude the possibility that the observed higher R395/470 ratio is due to an altered localization of the pHluorin probe (e.g. in earlier, higher pH compartments), we analyzed the subcellular localization of pHluorin-Golgi in the absence and presence of 2B-Myc at 40 h posttransfection. Fig. 3, E and F, shows that the subcellular localization of pHluorin-Golgi was not altered by 2B expression. Together, these data demonstrate that the 2B protein not only causes the efflux of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores but also significantly alters the pH of the Golgi complex. Importantly, the increase in Golgi pH was also observed in coxsackievirus-infected BGM cells at 5 h postinfection (data not shown). The 2B Protein Inhibits Protein Transport through the Golgi Complex—Alterations in lumenal ion concentrations of secretory pathway organelles can have deleterious effects on protein transport. For instance, the monensin-induced increase in pH of the Golgi complex has been shown to result in the inhibition of protein trafficking through the Golgi complex (20Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that there may also be a role for Ca2+ in vesicular traffic. The release of Ca2+ from the lumen of transport vesicles is involved in many soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent fusion events (21Burgoyne R.D. Clague M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether the 2B-induced disturbances of ion homeostasis in the lumen of the ER and Golgi complex affect protein trafficking. As a marker for protein trafficking, we used the temperature-sensitive mutant of the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G-ts045, hereafter referred to as VSV-G) fused to the N terminus of GFP. At 40 °C, the temperature-sensitive fusion protein (VSV-G-GFP) is misfolded and accumulates in the ER (Fig. 4A). Upon shifting the temperature to 32 °C, the protein is correctly refolded and transported via the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B) (22de Silva A.M. Balch W.E. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fig. 4C shows that treatment of BGM cells with monensin resulted in accumulation of VSV-G-GFP in the Golgi region, consistent with earlier observations reported in the literature (20Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To test the effect of 2B on vesicular trafficking, BGM cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding VSV-G-GFP and 2B-Myc. Cells were incubated at 40 °C for 18 h to accumulate VSV-G-GFP in the ER and subsequently at 32 °C for 2 h to allow its transport out of the ER. Cells were fixed, stained with anti-c-Myc, and processed for CLSM. In 2B-expressing cells, VSV-G-GFP colocalized with the 2B-Myc protein in the med-trans region of the Golgi complex (Fig."

Many aHUS patients carry mutations in the two C-terminal modules of factor H, which normally confer upon this abundant 155-kDa plasma glycoprotein its ability to selectively bind self-surfaces and prevent them from inappropriately triggering the complement cascade via the alternative pathway. In the current study, the three-dimensional solution structure of the C-terminal module pair of factor H has been determined. A binding site for a fully sulfated heparin-derived tetrasaccharide has been delineated using chemical shift mapping and the C3d/C3b-binding site inferred from sequence comparisons and computational docking. The resultant information allows assessment of the likely consequences of aHUS-associated amino acid substitutions in this critical region of factor H. It is striking that, excepting those likely to perturb the three-dimensional structure, aHUS-associated missense mutations congregate in the polyanion-binding site delineated in this study, thus potentially disrupting a vital mechanism for control of complement on self-surfaces in the microvasculature of the kidney.

Inappropriate or disproportionate activation of the complement system underlies the debilitating symptoms of a long list of autoimmune, degenerative, and iatrogenic diseases (1Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The role of the complement system is to rid the body of infectious agents and clear the bloodstream of immune complexes, apoptotic cells, and other debris (2Walport M.J. N. Engl. J.

Following its activation, deposition of complement proteins onto target surfaces ensues, marking the target for destruction and clearance, accompanied by release of mediators of inflammation and activators of the acquired immune response. Tight regulation and targeting of the complement system is thus essential to good health. The recent association of genetic variations in complement regulatory proteins with pathologies of the kidney (4Buddles M.R. Donne R.L. Richards A. Goodship J. Goodship T.H. Am. J. Hum.

It not only offers additional insights into the role played by complement in pathophysiological mechanisms, but it opens up the possibility of tailoring prevention and intervention according to genotype. The ability to consider such sequence variations within the context of a three-dimensional structure in which key functional regions have been identified significantly enhances these opportunities. In this report, we describe the structure of a region of factor H implicated in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 2The abbreviations used are: HUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome; aHUS, atypical HUS; RCA, regulators of complement activation; CCP, complement control protein module; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; fH, factor H.2The abbreviations used are: HUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome; aHUS, atypical HUS; RCA, regulators of complement activation; CCP, complement control protein module; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; fH, factor H. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a thrombotic microangiopathy that occurs primarily in the kidneys. It is characterized by hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia and is a leading cause of acute renal failure in children. Typical HUS is associated with infection by Escherichia coli (10Tarr P.I. Gordon C.A. Chandler W.L. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1073-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) and has a good prognosis (11Renaud C. Niaudet P. Gagnadoux M.F. Broyer M. Habib R. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1995; 9: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The rarer atypical variant of HUS (aHUS) (12Neuhaus T.J. Calonder S. Leumann E.P. Arch. Dis. Child. 1997; 76: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is recurrent and displays high mortality and morbidity even following renal transplantation (13Olie K.H. Florquin S. Groothoff J.W. Verlaak R. Strain L. Goodship T.H. Weening J.J. Davin J.C. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2004; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is triggered by a range of factors (14Esparza-Gordillo J. Goicoechea de Jorge E. Buil A. Carreras Berges L. Lopez-Trascasa M. Sanchez-Corral P. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) but generally presents in the absence of infections. Many aHUS patients carry mutations in the regulators of complement activation (RCA) gene cluster of chromosome 1q32. Between 10 and 30% of aHUS patients are heterozygous for mutations in the complement regulatory protein, factor H (fH) (4Buddles M.R. Donne R.L. Richards A. Goodship J. Goodship T.H. Am. J. Hum.

Many of the remaining patients carry mutations elsewhere in the RCA gene cluster (18Fremeaux-Bacchi V. Kemp E.J. Goodship J.A. Dragon-Durey M.A. Strain L. Loirat C. Deng H.W. Goodship T.H. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 22: 22Google Scholar). All such mutations should be considered against a background of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the RCA gene cluster that appear to further enhance disease susceptibility (14Esparza-Gordillo J.

A different single nucleotide polymorphism in the factor H gene predisposes to age-related macular degeneration (6Edwards A.O. Ritter R. III Abel Manning K.J. Panhuysen A. Farrer C.L.A.

Factor H is an abundant plasma glycoprotein (155 kDa) (19Sim R.B. DiScipio R.G. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that controls the alternative pathway of complement activation (20Whaley K. Ruddy S. Science. 1976; 193: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway of complement is triggered on any surface (self or foreign) not protected by specialized regulatory proteins. Self-cells carry membrane-associated regulators to prevent complement activation via the alternative pathway, most of which, like fH, are encoded by the RCA gene cluster (21Hourcade D. Holers V.M. Atkinson J.P. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 45: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Factor H is a fluid phase protein that normally prevents complement amplification on all self-surfaces. It is, therefore, important for blocking complement at host surfaces not enclosed by a cell membrane carrying other RCAs. Factor H acts on a key bimolecular enzymatic complex in the complement cascade, C3 convertase (C3b.Bb). Factor H competes with C3b for binding of factor B, is a cofactor for proteolytic cleavage of C3b, and accelerates the decay of the C3 convertase into its components (22Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 23Weiler J.M. Daha M.R. Austen K.F. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3268-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Factor H consists of 20 tandem, ∼60-residue-long, complement control protein modules (CCPs). The cofactor and decay acceleration activities of fH map to the N-terminal four CCPs (24Alsenz J. Lambris J.D. Schulz T.F. Dierich M.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Kuhn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar). There are three C3b-binding sites in fH (26Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar): CCPs 1–4, CCPs 8–15, and finally, CCPs 19–20, which also binds C3d generated during complement activation (27Jokiranta T.S. Hellwage J. Koistinen V. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Factor H interacts with polyanions via three sites, in CCPs 7, 9, or 13 and in CCP 20 (28Pangburn M.K. Atkinson M.A. Meri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16847-16853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blackmore T.K. Sadlon T.A. Ward H.M. Lublin D.M. Gordon D.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5422-5427PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blackmore T.K. Hellwage J. Sadlon T.A. Higgs N. Zipfel P.F. Ward H.M. Gordon D.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3342-3348PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the capacity of fH to distinguish self from non-self depends upon a sophisticated recognition capability for specific polyanionic markers on host surfaces (31Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The primary region for host recognition has been mapped to the four C-terminal modules (32Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4702-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it is noteworthy that the two C-terminal modules of fH harbor a binding site for polyanions and one for C3b/C3d, in addition to being a hotspot of aHUS-associated mutations (15Caprioli J. Bettinaglio P. Zipfel P.F. Amadei B. Daina E. Gamba S. Skerka C. Marziliano N. Remuzzi G. Noris M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 297-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This polyanion-binding site appears to also represent a site for attachment to endothelial cell surfaces (33Jokiranta T.S. Cheng Z.Z. Seeberger H. Jozsi M. Heinen S. Noris M. Remuzzi G. Ormsby R. Gordon D.L. Meri S. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 167: 1173-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore one hypothesis is that aHUS-linked mutations induce pathogenesis by interfering with a recognition site on fH for polyanionic self-markers. Additional explanations are that the mutations disrupt structure, that they interfere with the C3b/C3d-binding site, or that they compromise the ability of fH to form quaternary structure. Affinity chromatography and related techniques, utilizing for the most part commercially available preparations of heparin, have been employed previously to provide an overall assessment of how well mutant forms of fH bind polyanionic carbohydrates, but they do not provide a clear picture of the potential contribution of individual amino acid residues to the more sophisticated in vivo recognition process. Thus, as described below, elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the CCPs 19 and 20 (fH∼19–20) and experimental identification of the residues that comprise a polyanion recognition site represent a powerful means of investigating these hypotheses further. Protein Production—The fragment containing human fH residues 1107–1231 (native sequence numbering) was cloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector pPICZα. The expressed fH∼19–20 was directed to the secretory pathway by placing the coding sequence behind the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion sequence. Inefficient cleavage of this secretion signal combined with cloning artifacts resulted in the additional sequence EAEF at the N terminus. Cation-exchange chromatography was used to purify the fH∼19–20 collected from the culture supernatant. NMR Data Collection—NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers using 5-mm triple resonance probes. Data were collected at 37 °C on a 1 mm sample of 13C, 15N fH∼19–20 in 20 mm sodium acetate (deuterated), 200 mm NaCl at pH 4.0. 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments were acquired with mixing times of 100 ms. NMR data were processed using the AZARA suite of programs, provided by Wayne Boucher and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge with maximum entropy processing used for the F1 and F2 dimensions of the three-dimensional experiments. Heteronuclear (1H–15N) nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), at 600 MHz, were calculated from the ratio of the intensities of the cross-peaks in the reference spectra to those recorded with saturation of the 1H signal. Resonance Assignment and Structure Calculation—Processed spectra were viewed and nuclei were assigned using ANSIG (34Kraulis P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 696-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Resolved peaks in 15N-NOESY and 13C-NOESY spectra were picked and, where possible, assigned unambiguously. Ambiguous restraints were generated by matching the chemical shifts of NOESY cross-peaks with the resonance assignments. The “connect” routine within the AZARA suite was used to convert normalized intensities into four distance categories: <2.7 Å, <3.3 Å, <5Å, and <6 Å. Relatively slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by analysis of two-dimensional heteronuclear water exchange experiments. Structure calculations were carried out using the crystallography and NMR system (CNS)-based protocols (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). The first round of structure calculations was performed using only the unambiguous restraints list, whereas all subsequent rounds were performed using both unambiguous and ambiguous restraints (36Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 37Nilges M. Fold Des. 1997; 2: S53-S57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Habeck M. Rieping W. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 379-402PubMed Google Scholar). The potential H-bond acceptors for slowly exchanging amide protons were elucidated from inspection of well converged initial structures calculated in the absence of H-bond based restraints and on the basis of supporting nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data. Hydrogen bonds inferred in this way were represented in the calculation by an appropriate set of distance restraints that were included during subsequent rounds of structure calculations. Four “filtering” steps were performed on the ambiguous restraints between successive rounds of structure calculations (38Habeck M. Rieping W. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 379-402PubMed Google Scholar); the first three removed restraints contributing <1% of the total NOE, and the final one eliminated restraints contributing <2%. An ensemble of 26 lowest NOE-energy structures was selected. Determination of the Minimum Heparin Species Necessary for Binding—Heparin-derived oligosaccharides were prepared from low molecular weight heparin as described (39Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fluorophore-labeled heparin species were produced by attachment of 2-aminoacridone to the oligosaccharide reducing end as described (40Jackson P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The gel mobility shift assays were performed as described (41Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T.

Active residues were defined on the basis that they were both solvent-accessible and among those suggested by Hellwage et al. (44Hellwage J. Jokiranta T.S. Friese M.A. Wolk T.U. Kampen E. Zipfel P.F. Meri S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6935-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Passive residues were defined as the solvent-exposed residues surrounding the active residues. Standard analyses were performed by HADDOCK, including an analysis of the energy contributions from buried surface area and electrostatic interactions. On this basis, the best 13 structures from 50 water-refined structures overlaid on all backbone atoms with a root mean square deviation value of 0.7 Å. Locating the Polyanion-binding Site by Chemical Shift Mapping—A 10 μm sample of 15N-labeled fH∼19–20 in 8 mm NaOAc (deuterated), 50 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, was used to acquire 15N, 1H HSQC spectra on the 800 MHz spectrometer, at 25 °C, in the presence of varying concentrations of homogeneous, fully sulfated, heparin-derived tetrasaccharide over the range 0–120 μm. Backbone amide resonance assignments for the free protein were reconfirmed under these buffer conditions. The polyanion-binding site was inferred from the location of amide resonances that exhibited significant changes in chemical shift (combined chemical shift difference ≥0.02 ppm) or line width, in spectra of the complex and that could be confidently assigned on the basis of assignments of the free protein. Structure Determination of fH∼19–20—There were no NOEs, nor was there other evidence, in support of non-transient self-association of fH∼19,20, despite the relatively high sample concentration in the NMR tube. Two disulfide linkages in each module were inferred from the proximity and geometry of Cys side chains. All proline residues in fH∼19,20 were defined as trans on the basis of chemical shift differences between Cα and Cβ resonances and the observation of appropriate NOEs. It is apparent from the ensemble of lowest energy structures (Fig. 1) and the root mean square deviation values (Table 1) that the three-dimensional structure of each module is well defined by experimental data. Residues without long range NOEs occupy loops, and they have low 1H, 15N NOE values (Fig. 2), consistent with nanosecond time scale backbone flexibility. The numbers of medium and long range NOEs originating from linker residues (Leu1164–Pro1166) are similar to those from residues in well structured regions of the two modules (Fig. 2), and the sets of module-to-module and module-to-linker distance restraints dictate a well defined mutual orientation of the module pair (Fig. 1A). The 1H, 15N NOE values for linker residues indicate relatively little linker mobility on the nanosecond time scale. These two modules therefore form a structural unit with limited intermodular flexibility.TABLE 1Structural Statistics for the 26 Lowest Energy StructuresCCPs 19 -20Total unambiguous NOEs1993Hydrogen bonds38For unambiguous NOEs Sequential481 Short range (2 ≤ |i—j| ≤ 4)100 Long range (|i—j| > 4)469 IntermodularaFor the purpose of this table, module boundaries are defined as the 1st and 4th of the 4 consensus cysteines.11 Intralinker26 From CCP 20 to linker20 From CCP 19 to linker15For ambiguous NOEs (≥ 40 % of cross-peak) Sequential289 Short-range (2 ≤ |i—j| ≤ 4)152 Long range (|i—j| > 4)218 Intermodular6 Intralinker3 From CCP 20 to linker11 From CCP 19 to linker12Total (all structures) NOE violations > 0.5 Å24Percent of residues in regions of Ramachandran plot Most favored52.0 Additionally allowed38.1 Generously allowed6.8Root mean square deviations CCP 19 (all residues) All heavy atoms1.13 Backbone atoms Cα, N, CO0.69 Cα only0.73Root mean square deviations CCP 20 (all residues) All heavy atoms1.16 Backbone atoms Cα, N, CO0.67 Cα only0.71Root mean square deviations CCP 19-20 (all residues) All heavy atoms1.50 Backbone atoms Cα, N, CO1.17 Cα only1.20a For the purpose of this table, module boundaries are defined as the 1st and 4th of the 4 consensus cysteines.

Two disulfide bonds, CysI–CysIII, CysII–CysIV, lie at opposite extremes of a hydrophobic core to which the consensus Trp (Trp1157) contributes. Its structure resembles those of other CCPs found elsewhere in factor H (45Norman D.G. Barlow P.N. Baron M. Day A.J. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

CCP 20 (Fig. 3A) has the same disulfide pattern, but the overall structure of this module differs from those of all other CCPs solved to date. Although adopting the CCP module fold, CCP 20 (∼28 × ∼20 Å) is shorter than CCP 19 and exhibits more prominent lateral bulges and a helical turn. Nearly all CCPs contain a structurally critical Trp residue between CysIII and CysIV; in CCP 20, Trp1219 occupies such a position in the sequence but is solvent-exposed. A second Trp residue in CCP 20, Trp1183, is part of a prominent hypervariable loop (Fig. 3A, and see below). The two modules are stacked in an elongated fashion (Fig. 3B), unlike the tilted arrangement observed in many other CCP module pairs (51Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), stabilized by interactions between the two modules and the bulky side chains of the short linker. Equivalent parts of the two modules are on the same face of the overall structure. An electrostatic surface representation (Fig. 3C) reveals that one face of fH∼19–20 is positively charged, whereas the other has a predominantly negative charge. A band of mainly positive charge running up one face of CCP 19 is contiguous with a positively charged area of the CCP 20 surface, which stretches to the C terminus of the protein. The five-membered ring of the indole side chain of Trp1183 is wedged between Arg1182 and Lys1186 within the hypervariable loop, leaving the six-membered aromatic ring exposed to solvent at the center of the positively charged CCP 20 surface patch.

Syndapins, however, have only one Src homology 3 domain mediating both interactions. Here we show that syndapins self-associate via direct syndapin/syndapin interactions, providing a molecular mechanism for the coordinating role of syndapin. Cross-link studies with overexpressed and endogenous syndapins suggest that predominantly dimers form in vivo. Our analyses show that the N-terminal Fes/Cip4 homology domain but not the central coiled-coil domain is sufficient for oligomerization. Additionally, a second interface located further C-terminally mediated interactions with the N terminus. The Src homology 3 domain and the NPF region are not involved and thus available for further interactions interconnecting different syndapin binding partners. Our analyses showed that self-association is crucial for syndapin function. Both syndapin-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements and endocytosis were disrupted by a self-association-deficient mutant. Consistent with a role of syndapins in linking actin polymerization bursts with endocytic vesicle formation, syndapin-containing complexes had a size of 300-500 kDa in gel filtration analysis and contained both dynamin and N-WASP. The existence of an interconnection of the GTPase dynamin with N-WASP via syndapin oligomers was demonstrated both by coimmunoprecipitations and by reconstitution at membranes in intact cells. The interconnection was disrupted by coexpression of syndapin mutants incapable of self-association. Syndapin oligomers may thus act as multivalent organizers spatially and temporally coordinating vesicle fission with local actin polymerization.

Syndapin oligomers may thus act as multivalent organizers spatially and temporally coordinating vesicle fission with local actin polymerization. The cortical actin cytoskeleton is crucial for shaping cells and for maintaining specialized morphologies that are directly related to various cellular functions. Cortical cytoskeletal structures can be extremely elaborate and, supported by experimental data in particular for exocytic membrane trafficking events, have therefore mainly been viewed as a barrier for membrane trafficking events (1Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Valentijn K. Valentijn J.A. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For endocytosis, in contrast, mounting evidence suggests that the actin cytoskeleton may also have a supporting role (for reviews, see Refs. 3Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J.

The formation of vesicles from a donor membrane requires complex protein machinery and additional proteins to control it (7Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev.

Among those is the large GTPase dynamin that has been observed to concentrate at constricted necks of forming endocytic vesicles and is a crucial but mechanistically still not fully understood player in the vesicle fission step (9Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 10Sever S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Sever S.

Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). We have suggested several possibilities how the actin cytoskeleton may support endocytosis (3Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal components may localize the endocytic machinery to domains of the plasma membrane, either by trapping it or by direct anchoring. This would greatly speed up the assembly of the machinery at locations of receptors and cargo to be internalized. Furthermore, actin polymerization may provide the forces to deform the membrane and to drive vesicle formation and detachment. In line with these hypotheses, short lived actin structures at sites of endocytosis coinciding with dynamin-mediated vesicle release have indeed been observed (13Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 14Yarar D. Watermann-Storer C.M. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Most recently, the burst of actin polymerization at clathrin-coated pits has been reported to coincide with a local recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex (15Merrifield C.J. Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Almers W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which promotes actin filament nucleation and polymerization (16Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev.

Also the Arp2/3 complex activator N-WASP 2The abbreviations used are: N-WASP, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; SH3, Src homology 3; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PRD, proline-rich domain; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; IP, immunoprecipitation; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-[dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide; BAR, BIN/amphiphysin/RVS; CC, coiled-coil; FCH, Fes/Cip4 homology.

J. 2004; 380: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) appears transiently at sites of endocytosis (15Merrifield C.J. Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Almers W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that actin polymerization during endocytosis is triggered by N-WASP, and the Arp2/3 complex was substantiated by experiments showing that an interference with N-WASP function in vivo had a strong impact on receptor-mediated endocytosis (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data were recently confirmed by the analysis of cells from N-WASP knock out mice that also showed impairments in endocytosis (21Benesch S. Polo S. Lai F.P. Anderson K.I. Stradal T.E. Wehland J. Rottner K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3103-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Innocenti M. Gerboth S. Rottner C. Lai F.P.L. Hertzog M. Stradal T.E.B. Frittoli E. Didry D. Polo S. Disanza A. Benesch S. Di Fiore P.P. Carlier M.-F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In order to support and not inhibit endocytic vesicle formation, actin polymerization during endocytosis requires an extremely fine control in time and space. The molecular mechanism that ensures that N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex trigger local actin polymerization specifically at sites of endocytosis and only during and/or after vesicle fission appears to be the interaction of N-WASP with so-called accessory proteins of the vesicle formation machinery, such as syndapins (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Syndapins, a family of dynamin-binding proteins also referred to as PACSINs, were suggested to be molecular links between membrane trafficking and cortical cytoskeleton dynamics (reviewed in Ref. 25Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3077-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both aspects of syndapin function are supported by in vivo data, the dynamin-binding syndapin Src homology 3 (SH3) domain is a potent inhibitor of receptor-mediated endocytosis, and overexpression of full-length syndapins induced a cortical actin phenotype (24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative effects observed upon overexpression of N-WASP and fragments thereof encompassing the syndapin-binding proline-rich domain and corresponding rescue experiments strongly suggested that N-WASP's role in endocytosis may involve the syndapin association (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further strengthened by the observation that syndapins can recruit N-WASP to cellular membranes and that the reconstitution of such protein complexes elicited local actin polymerization in an Arp2/3 complex-dependent manner (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The functional duality of syndapins, however, is based on protein interactions all mediated via one binding module, the C-terminal SH3 domain of syndapins. This raised the question whether syndapins exist in a variety of different two-component complexes, which may even represent distinct functions, or whether syndapins indeed have the capability to connect endocytic, cytoskeletal, and other cellular functions represented by their SH3 domain interaction partners. We have suggested earlier that the syndapin N-terminal regions could oligomerize, since syndapins contain stretches of a high propensity for coiled-coil domains (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed a potential syndapin oligomerization in vitro and in vivo and examined its importance for both the cytoskeletal and the endocytic functions of syndapin. DNA Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—Constructs coding for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of syndapin I full-length (amino acids 1-441), syndapin I ΔSH3 (amino acids 1-382), syndapin I SH3 (amino acids 376-441), and the P434L mutant form of the syndapin I SH3 domain were described previously (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). GST-N-WASP PRD (amino acids 313-349) was generated by PCR and inserted into pGEX-5.1. Mammalian expression constructs encoding the corresponding full-length protein or fragments thereof fused to the C terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP), the FLAG epitope, and the Myc epitope were generated by subcloning the corresponding DNA inserts from the pcDNA3.1/His vector (24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene) or pRK5, respectively. Constructs to express maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins of syndapin I full-length protein or parts thereof were generated by PCR using the corresponding GST-syndapin I plasmid as a template. The PCR products were cloned into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs). GST and MBP fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified as described previously (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Xpress-tagged syndapin I, GFP-N-WASP, and the plasmid encoding mitochondria-targeted syndapin I were described in Refs. 24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar and 20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, respectively. The hemagglutinin (HA)-dynamin 1 construct was a gift of Dr. Sandra Schmid (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Further partial syndapin I expression constructs were generated by PCR, cloned into the appropriate expression vectors, and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The Mito-GFP vector was generated by introducing a sequence coding for GFP, which was amplified by PCR from a commercially available GFP vector (Clontech), into the mitochondrial targeting vector (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cDNAs encoding for rat N-WASP full-length (amino acids 1-501) and the proline-rich domain (PRD) of rat N-WASP (amino acids 265-391) (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the Mito-GFP vector. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-syndapin and anti-GST antibodies as well as guinea pig anti-N-WASP antibodies were raised and affinity-purified as described previously (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol.

Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (M2) were from Sigma, monoclonal anti-Xpress antibodies were from Invitrogen, and monoclonal anti-dynamin antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-MBP antibodies were from New England Biolabs, rabbit anti-FLAG antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (290) were from Abcam. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (B34), anti-Myc antibodies (9E10), and antibodies against the HA tag (HA.11) were purchased from Babco. Secondary antibodies used in this study include goat anti-mouse peroxidase (Dianova), goat anti-guinea pig peroxidase (ICN Biochemicals), donkey anti-rabbit peroxidase (Dianova), Alexa Fluor™ 568 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), Alexa Fluor™ 350 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), and Alexa Fluor™ 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). Coprecipitation Assays—In order to test for a direct syndapin I/syndapin I interaction, GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in the presence of 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with MBP fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.25% bovine serum albumin, 300 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins coprecipitated with the GST fusion proteins were eluted with glutathione-containing buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with rabbit anti-MBP antibodies. Gel Filtrations—Rat brain extracts were fractionated on a Superose 6 column (30 × 1 cm). Fractions eluted with buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. After Ponceau-S staining, the distribution of syndapin I and of its direct binding partners was detected with antibodies against dynamin 1, N-WASP, and syndapin I. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitations of epitope-tagged proteins, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transfected with different GFP- and FLAG-tagged constructs using the Lipofectamine PLUS transfection reagent method according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The cells were grown for an additional 40 h, harvested, and homogenized in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. 6 μg of monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), 3 μg of mouse anti-GFP antibody 3E6 (Molecular Probes), or nonimmune mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) prebound to protein G-Sepharose was incubated with the high speed supernatants prepared from the lysed HEK cells overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated material was washed and probed for coimmunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using rabbit and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies, rabbit and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies, and rabbit anti-syndapin antibodies. For coimmunoprecipitations of tertiary complexes of dynamin, syndapin, and N-WASP, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with HA-dynamin 1, with GFP-N-WASP, and, when indicated, with Xpress-syndapin I as described above. Cell lysates adjusted to 30 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 final were incubated with 6 μg of anti-HA antibodies or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °Cand subsequently precipitated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Specifically precipitated material was analyzed for immuno- and coimmunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies, and rabbit anti-syndapin SH3 antibodies (2521). For competition experiments, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with HA-dynamin 1 and Xpress-syndapin I. Prior to the immunoprecipitation with anti-Xpress antibodies, cell lysates were incubated with GST-N-WASP PRD fusion protein for 10 min at 30 °C as indicated. For coimmunoprecipitations of syndapin I-containing protein complexes from gel filtration fractions, affinity-purified anti-syndapin I or anti-GST antibodies prebound to protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with syndapin I-containing fractions adjusted to 75 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. After intense washing, the precipitated material was analyzed for the presence of syndapin I, dynamin 1, and N-WASP via immunoblot analyses. Cross-linking Experiments—For cross-link studies of endogenous proteins, rat brain extracts were prepared as described (26Qualmann B. Boeckers T.M. Jeromin M. Gundelfinger E.D. Kessels M.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Brain extracts at a total concentration of 0.7 mg/ml and a final concentration of 100 mm NaCl were incubated in the presence of increasing amounts of the heterobifunctional cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-[dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC) (Pierce) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2,and 2 mm EGTA for 20 min at 30 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. Extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with different constructs encoding for different tagged syndapin proteins or fragments thereof were prepared as described above. The extracts were incubated with increasing amounts of EDC as indicated for 20 min at 30 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% or 5-8% polyacrylamide gels and by subsequent immunoblotting. In Silico Analyses and Predictions of Protein Structure—Software used for predictions of protein secondary structure (especially of α-helices and loop regions) is available on the World Wide Web at cmpharm.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/nnpredict and www.predictprotein.org. Coiled-coil predictions were performed by using both the PAIRCOIL program (available on the World Wide Web at paircoil.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/paircoil) and the program COILS with window settings of 14, 21, and 28 amino acids (available on the World Wide Web at www.ch.embnet.org/cgi-bin/COILS). Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK293, HeLa, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For mitochondrial targeting experiments, COS-7 cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips 1 day prior to transfection. Transfections were performed with Polyfect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature and processed for immunofluorescence according to Ref. 27Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein Å.E.Y. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar. For mitochondrial staining, cells were incubated with MitoTracker® as described previously (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Images were recorded digitally using a Leica DMRD fluorescence microscope and a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Examinations of the actin cytoskeletal phenotype induced by overexpression of syndapin full-length proteins and fragments thereof were performed in HeLa cells and have been described previously (24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). F-actin was stained with Alexa568-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The presence of several or extended lamellipodial areas decorated with filopodial structures and marked by accumulated F-actin signal at the leading edge was used for scoring. The effect of each construct was determined in several independent assays, and 134-528 transfected cells were scored in systematic searches across the coverslips. The assays were conducted as blind studies to ensure that the researcher was unbiased. Induction of the cortical actin phenotype upon N-WASP overexpression and epidermal growth factor stimulation was performed essentially as established by Miki et al. (28Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis of the phenotype and of changes induced upon cotransfection with syndapin constructs, 316-387 transfected cells from three independent assays were scored in systematic searches across the coverslips and grouped into two categories, smooth and rough/filopodia-decorated appearance of plasma membrane edges, respectively. Transferrin Uptake Assays—COS-7 cells were subjected to transferrin uptake assays 48 h after transfection as described previously (24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 27Kessels M.M. Engqvist-Goldstein Å.E.Y. Drubin D.G. Qualmann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The percentages of transfected cells showing no detectable uptake of transferrin, significantly reduced transferrin signals, and normal levels of internalized transferrin and S.D. values were calculated by scoring and counting cells in at least three independent experiments each. Syndapins have been suggested to functionally interconnect endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton by interactions of their C-terminal SH3 domain with dynamin and N-WASP (24Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, syndapins have only one SH3 domain for an interaction with either dynamin or N-WASP. To function as molecular links, syndapins would thus have to build multivalent platforms in a non-SH3 domain-dependent manner. Analyses of fractions of rat brain cytosol obtained by size exclusion chromatography over a Superose 6 column revealed that the size of syndapin I-containing complexes by far exceeds the calculated size of monomeric syndapin. Syndapin I has a predicted molecular mass of 50.4 kDa, but syndapin-containing complexes were detected in a range between apparent molecular masses of 300 kDa and about 500 kDa, corresponding to fractions 15-17 (Fig. 1A). Complexes with a molecular mass around 400 kDa were especially abundant. The existence of syndapin complexes with even higher molecular mass also remains possible because the analysis was performed with cytosolic extracts cleared from extremely large protein complexes by high speed centrifugation. Immunoblotting analysis of rat brain cytosol fractionated by gel filtration showed that the N-WASP and dynamin distribution both peak in the syndapin I-containing fractions (Fig. 1A). The apparent molecular weights of syndapin, N-WASP, and dynamin all exceed those of the monomeric proteins and even those of combinations of one syndapin molecule with one interaction partner. Blot overlay analysis with a GST fusion protein of syndapin I as a probe revealed that literally all direct syndapin binding partners run at molecular weights that are much larger than those of the monomeric proteins and thus correspond to protein complexes that partially cofractionate with syndapin I (data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitations from the gel filtration fractions directly demonstrated that syndapin I is complexed with N-WASP and dynamin in high molecular weight fractions. Both N-WASP and dynamin were specifically coimmunoprecipitated with syndapin I from fraction 16/17 (data not shown) as well as from fraction 15 (Fig. 1B). Based on secondary structure predictions, we have hypothesized earlier that syndapins might have the capability to interact with themselves and form oligomers (23Qualmann B. Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Kelly R.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Since our gel filtration studies (Fig. 1) support such a scenario, we experimentally addressed the existence of syndapin-syndapin interactions by conducting coimmunoprecipitation experiments with differentially tagged syndapin I proteins overexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, A-D). Both FLAG-tagged syndapin I and a GFP-tagged syndapin I fusion protein can be expressed and coexpressed in HEK cells (Fig. 2, A and B) and were successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies, respectively (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the immunoprecipitates from cells double-transfected with FLAG-syndapin I and GFP-syndapin I demonstrated that FLAG-syndapin I was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-syndapin I (Fig. 2D). GFP-syndapin did not associate with anti-FLAG antibodies when transfected alone or with nonimmune mouse IgG. Consistently, FLAG-syndapin I was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-syndapin I but not with GFP alone (Fig. 2D). Control experiments demonstrate that FLAG-syndapin was not precipitated by anti-GFP antibodies upon single transfection of the construct or by unrelated mouse IgG (Fig. 2D). Our coimmunoprecipitation studies thus demonstrate that syndapin I can efficiently form oligomers in vivo. We next addressed the question of whether the syndapin oligomerization is independent of the SH3 domain, as hypothesized. For this purpose we first coexpressed different GFP-syndapin I constructs in combination with FLAG-syndapin I (Fig. 2, E and F) and conducted immunoprecipitations of the GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 2G). Similar to full-length syndapin I, both GFP-syndapin I with a mutated SH3 domain and GFP-syndapinΔSH3 effectively and specifically coimmunoprecipitated FLAG-syndapin I (Fig. 2H). In contrast, FLAG-syndapin I was not coimmunoprecipitated together with the GFP-syndapin I SH3 domain (Fig. 2H). These data clearly show that the non-SH3 part of syndapin I is sufficient for oligomerization. This leaves the SH3 domain free for further protein-protein interactions forming larger macromolecular complexes, as seen in Fig. 1. In order to firmly exclude putative posthomogenization artifacts in our coimmunoprecipitation analyses, we next reconstituted and visualized the syndapin-syndapin interactions that we observed in cellular extracts (Fig. 2, A-H) in intact cells (Fig. 2, I-O). We have developed a mitochondrial targeting system that allows for incorporating syndapin fusion proteins into the outer mitochondrial membranes in a manner that ensures that the syndapin part is facing the cytoplasm (20Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Sco"
https://openalex.org/W2092577442,"Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1), a well conserved protein from yeast to humans, acts as a histone chaperone and is predicted to participate in a variety of chromatin-mediated cellular processes. To investigate the physiological role of vertebrate Asf1 in vivo, we generated a conditional Asf1-deficient mutant from chicken DT40 cells. Induction of Asf1 depletion resulted in the accumulation of cells in S phase with decreased DNA replication and increased mitotic aberrancy forming multipolar spindles, leading to cell death. In addition, nascent chromatin in Asf1-depleted cells showed increased nuclease sensitivity, indicating impaired nucleosome assembly during DNA replication. Complementation analyses revealed that the functional domain of Asf1 for cell viability was confined to the N-terminal core domain (amino acids 1-155) that is a binding platform for histones H3/H4, CAF-1p60, and HIRA, whereas Asf1 mutant proteins, abolishing binding abilities with both p60 and HIRA, exhibit no effect on viability. These results together indicate that the vertebrate Asf1 plays a crucial role in replication-coupled chromatin assembly, cell cycle progression, and cellular viability and provide a clue of a possible role in a CAF-1- and HIRA-independent chromatin-modulating process for cell proliferation.

During S phase, newly synthesized histones H3-H4 are assembled behind the replication fork, followed by loading of the H2A-H2B dimer to complete de novo nucleosome formation on newly replicated DNA (1Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys.

Besides such a replication-coupled chromatin assembly process, a DNA synthesis-independent chromatin assembly process also exists to operate histone deposition during transcription and DNA repair (4Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16477-16484Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These processes are mediated by several specialized histone chaperones (1Tyler J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor-1), a trimeric protein complex consisting of p150, p60, and p48 subunits, is the most characterized chaperone responsible for loading of histones H3 and H4 onto replicating DNA through an interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), 2The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; aa, amino acid(s); tet, tetracycline; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BrdUrd, 5-bromodeoxyuridine; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EST, expressed sequence tag; RNAi, RNA interference; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. the DNA polymerase sliding clamp (5Shibahara K.

In fact, loss of CAF-1 by a small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down system results in both impaired S phase progression and cell viability accompanied with defect of nascent chromatin assembly (6Hoek M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2853-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting its essentiality for coordinated DNA synthesis and chromatin assembly (6Hoek M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 2003; 11: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the yeast CAF-1 mutant exhibits no growth retardation, implying the availability of other histone H3-H4 deposition factors (9Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Asf1 was originally identified in yeast as its anti-silencing function in silent mating loci (10Le S. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Sternglanz R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Biochemically identified Drosophila RCAF complex, containing Asf1 and newly synthesized acetylated histones H3 and H4, was shown to facilitate efficient replication-coupled nucleosome assembly only in the presence of a limited amount of CAF-1 (11Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Yeast Asf1 and two human forms, Asf1a and Asf1b, can interact with CAF-1p60 and promote replication or repair-dependent chromatin assembly synergistically with CAF-1 (12Sharp J.A. Fouts E.T. Krawitz D.C. Kaufman P.D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Krawitz D.C. Kama T. Kaufman P.D. Mol.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Two biochemically purified histone H3.1 and H3.3 complexes, containing CAF-1 and HIRA, possess the replication-coupled and -independent chromatin assembly activities, respectively (15Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 16Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Asf1 is retained in these two H3 variant complexes, suggesting the involvement of it in both chromatin assembly pathways (15Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). These together enforced a speculation about its role as histone donor chaperone effectively supplying histones to either the CAF-1- or HIRA-mediated chromatin assembly pathway (2Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the human or Drosophila Asf1 leads to impaired S phase progression (17Groth A. Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Lukas J. Bartek J. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Schulz L.L. Tyler J.K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 488-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as observed in CAF-1-depleted human cells (6Hoek M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12183-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In yeast, the loss of Asf1 results in impaired cell proliferation, increased sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (11Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and minor defects of gene silencing at telomere and silent mating loci. These effects are enhanced by incorporating additional mutations either of CAF-1 or Hir (11Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 12Sharp J.A. Fouts E.T. Krawitz D.C. Kaufman P.D. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 614-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, both genetic and biochemical data suggest that Asf1 synergistically acts with CAF-1 or HIRA in the regulation of chromatin assembly that has impact on DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and formation/maintenance of heterochromatin structure (2Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 19Gunjan A. Paik J. Verreault A. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Zhang R. Poustovoitov M.V. Ye X. Santos H.A. Chen W. Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Serebriiskii I.G. Canutescu A.A.

In addition, Asf1 exhibits several distinct features in addition to a synergistic role with CAF-1. For example, recent findings in yeast indicate that, in contrast to CAF-1, Asf1 functions as a disassembly factor for histone deposition on overall genome (21Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52069-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and facilitates chromatin disassembly at PHO5 promoter loci so as to allow transcription activation (22Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), suggesting that it acts as a histone acceptor. The nature of Asf1 as an interactor with the TFIID subunit also suggests its participation in transcription control at various RNA polymerase II-dependent gene loci (23Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Zabaronick S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast Asf1 is involved in genomic stability in conjunction with the checkpoint machinery (25Myung K. Pennaneach V. Kats E.S. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and interacts with the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Rad53 (26Hu F. Alcasabas A.A. Elledge S.J.

Cell. 2001; 7: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and human Asf1 is phosphorylated by tousled-like kinase (Tlk), which is inhibited by ATM/ATR/Chk1 kinases in response to DNA damage, suggesting its role as mediator of checkpoint signal to chromatin (28Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1068-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Groth A. Lukas J. Nigg E.A. Sillje H.H. Wernstedt C. Bartek J. Hansen K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses in Drosophila suggest a linkage between cell proliferation and a Tlk-Asf1-mediated chromatin assembly pathway (30Carrera P. Moshkin Y.M. Gronke S. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Jackle H. Karch F. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2578-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Asf1 is a highly conserved protein among eukaryotes and shares common features associated with a variety of chromatin-mediated processes as described above. Although the inactivation of Asf1 leads to a broad range of cellular defects based on altering chromatin structure in yeast (2Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Polo S.E. Almouzni G. Cancer Lett. 2005; 220: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Gunjan A. Paik J. Verreault A. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), its role in vertebrates has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, to investigate the physiological role of Asf1 in vertebrates, we generated a conditional Asf1-deficient DT40 mutant cell, using the gene targeting technique. Analyses of the mutant cells indicate that vertebrate Asf1 plays a crucial role in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly linked to DNA replication, S phase progression, and viability. Cell Culture—DT40 cells and mutants were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10-5 m β-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin and streptomycin at 39 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Transfections and selections of drug-resistant cells were conducted as described (31Takami Y. Nakayama T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, cells were counted to determine the growth rate. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Transfection was conducted as described (32Ahmad A. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cloning of Genomic DNA, Gene Constructs, Transformation, and Mutant Isolation—Chicken full-length Asf1 cDNA was PCR-amplified from DT40 cDNA on the basis of the sequence from the chicken Web Bursal EST data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.chick.umist.ac.uk/index.html). The nucleotide sequence of obtained cDNA was verified by the dye terminator method (Applied Biosystems Division, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Genomic Asf1 DNA clones were isolated by screening the DT40 λ FIX II genomic library (33Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using Asf1 cDNA as a probe. The Asf1 disruption constructs were made in pBlue-script vector by subcloning 2.0-kb upstream and 2.5-kb downstream fragments of Asf1 genome DNA. The neomycin cassette flanked by loxP site or bsr/cre-ER drug resistance cassette (34Fukagawa T. Hayward N. Yang J. Azzalin C. Griffin D. Stewart A.F. Brown W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1966-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was inserted between upstream and downstream arms. Gene targeting with these constructs was expected to disrupt 131 amino acids (aa) in exon 3 of the Asf1 gene. The tetracycline (tet)-responsible Asf1 expression vector was constructed by inserting the HA-tagged full-length chicken Asf1 cDNA into the pUHD10-3 plasmid (35Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). To obtain the ptTA-bleo construct, a cassette of the bleomycin-resistant gene driven by the β-actin promoter was inserted into the pUHD15-1 plasmid, which contains the tet-responsive transactivator gene controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. For FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant Asf1 expression vectors, the respective Asf1 cDNA fragments generated by PCR amplification or the QuikChange method using Pfu turbo (Stratagene) were inserted into pApuro, carrying the chicken β-actin promoter upstream of the cloning site and a marker gene, the puro-resistant gene, under the control of the SV40 promoter (36Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) or into the pCite vector (Invitrogen). Knock-in type targeting construct for CENP-H-GFP was the same as described (37Fukagawa T. Mikami Y. Nishihashi A. Regnier V. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Sugata N. Todokoro K. Brown W. Ikemura T.

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle—Flow cytometric analyses were carried out using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) as described (39Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16191-16201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For synchronization into mitotic phase, cells were cultured in the absence or presence of tet for 24 h and treated with nocodazole (200 ng/ml) for 8 h, released from the block by washing with medium three times, and further cultured with or without tet. At 2-h intervals, the cells were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and then analyzed. For two-dimensional cell cycle analysis, cells were cultured in the presence of 20 μm BrdUrd at 39 °C for 10 min, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with FITC-labeled anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:400; Chemicon) and PI. Analysis of DNA Synthesis and Chromatin Structure—To monitor the DNA synthesis rate during Asf1 deletion, cells were cultured with or without tet (1 μg/ml) for the indicated times and then pulse-labeled by the addition of 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min. Collected cells were lysed by NaOH, followed by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, and passed through a filter, and then incorporated radioactivities were counted using a liquid scintillation counter. To examine nascent chromatin structure, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (20 μCi/ml) for 10 min, and labeled nuclei were prepared as follows. Cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated in NB (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The resultant nuclei were washed twice with NB, suspended at 20 A260/ml (A260 was measured in 2 m NaCl and 5 m urea) in NB, and digested at 37 °C for 8 min with 0.0025-0.2 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Sigma). The reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS, and then DNA was purified by incubation with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel followed by EtBr staining and then transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane. To detect 3H-labeled DNA, blots were directly exposed on a BAS screen (TR2040) specified for tritium and visualized using a Mac BAS-1000 Bio Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Film). Densitometric tracing of the nucleosomal ladder was carried out by using Image Gauge version 3.3 (Fuji Film). Western Blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—For production of anti-chicken Asf1, anti-chicken CAF-1p150, and anti-chicken CAF-1p60 antibodies, GST fusion proteins (GST-Asf1-(1-204), GST-p150-(720-938), and GST-p60-(1-256)) were expressed in bacteria, and then purified fusion proteins were injected into rabbits. Affinity purification of antibodies was performed using standard procedures. DT40 cells (1 × 107) were lysed in 200 μl of SDS buffer, and then aliquots (10-20 μl) of the resultant cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The filter was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of antibodies against Asf1, p150, p60, p48 (Pharmingen), PCNA (PC10; Sigma), γ-H2AX (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), α-tubulin (Sigma), HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), or FLAG M2 (Sigma), followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dako)). The signal was developed using a Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and visualized with a LAS-1000 (Fuji Film). For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, cells (5 × 107) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice, and then clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 immobilized beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing by radioimmune precipitation buffer three times, beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer, followed by Western blotting using antibodies against FLAG M2, p60, histone H3 (Cell signaling), and acetylated histone H4 (K12) (Upstate Biotechnology). To examine the phosphorylation states of Asf1, beads containing Asf1-FLAG protein were untreated or treated with 10 units of alkaline phosphatase in 25 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 1 h. After elution with SDS sample buffer, mobility of Asf1-FLAG in SDS-gel was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. For in vitro immunoprecipitation analysis, 35S-labeled proteins, FLAG-tagged Asf1 and its derivatives, HA-tagged HIRA, and HA-tagged Tip60 were produced by an in vitro translation kit STP3 (Novagen) using pCite vectors containing cognate regions of Asf1 and HIRA or Tip60. The following procedures for the in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described (38Ahmad A. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 342: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—DT40 cells were attached on poly-ethyleneimine-coated slides, fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized by 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS, and rinsed with PBS. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin plus PBS for 20 min, cells were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin plus PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The following antibodies were used: rat anti-HA monoclonal (1:1000; Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-PCNA (1:400; PC10; Sigma), rabbit anti-p150 (1:1000), rabbit anti-p60 (1:1000), and FITC-conjugated anti-α-tubulin monoclonal (1:100; Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit and rat IgG antibodies (1:400; Molecular Probes, Inc.). DNA was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) at 0.1 μg/ml. For Triton extraction, attached cells on slides were incubated with CSK (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C followed by fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and absolute methanol for 20 min at -20 °C as described (40Martini E. Roche D.M. Marheineke K. Verreault A. Almouzni G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To examine co-localization of BrdUrd with PCNA, cells were pulse-labeled with 20 μm BrdUrd at 39 °C for 10 min. After staining of PCNA with AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as described above, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then treated with 2 m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After washing three times, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:400; Chemicon). Fluorescence images were visualized with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA ER; Hamamatsu Photonics) using Axiovert M-200 (Zeiss). TUNEL Assay—TUNEL assay was performed using a MEBSTAIN Apoptosis Kit Direct (MBL). Briefly, cells were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 15 min at room temperature. DNA break ends were labeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and FITC-dUTP, and then DNA was counterstained with PI and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Complementation Assay—To determine the ability of Asf1 and its derivatives to rescue the tet-induced lethality of the Asf1-deficient cells, a complementation assay was carried out as described (39Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16191-16201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Asf1-conditional knock-out cells were transfected with pApuro-Asf1-FLAG and its derivatives and split into two portions. A half-portion was incubated on 96-well plates in medium containing 0.4 μg/ml puromycin to determine the frequency of transfection, and the other was incubated on 96-well plates in medium containing 0.4 μg/ml puromycin plus 1 μg/ml tet. After incubation for 10 days, the numbers of surviving colonies were counted. Generation of Conditional Asf1 Knock-out DT40 Cells—To design gene distribution constructs, chicken Asf1 cDNA was isolated by combination of EST searching (available on the World Wide Web at swallow.gsf.de/dt40Est.html) and reverse transcription-PCR. We found several EST sequences that have significant homology to human Asf1a. Using reverse transcription-PCR based on these sequences, we cloned chicken full-length Asf1a cDNA. The deduced aa sequences of chicken Asf1a completely matched those of human and mouse Asf1a, indicating that it is a highly conserved protein throughout eukaryotes. Although two forms of Asf1a and Asf1b, sharing 69% aa sequence homology, were found in humans and mice, we could not find a chicken Asf1b homolog in either the EST or genome databases. Consistent with this, Southern hybridization under low stringency conditions using the chicken Asf1a cDNA as a probe failed to detect any signal other than the Asf1a homolog in DT40 genomic DNA. Western blotting also failed to detect Asf1b signal in DT40 cells using our raised antibody against Asf1a, which could recognize both Asf1a and Asf1b proteins in HeLa cells (data not shown). These suggest that chicken had only the Asf1a gene, and Asf1b might be divergent from Asf1a throughout vertebrate evolution. Hereafter, we referred the Asf1a homolog as chicken Asf1 (accession number AB238225). We isolated chicken genomic Asf1 DNA by library screening and designed gene targeting constructs (Fig. 1A). We could obtain heterozygous knock-out clones (+/-) but never obtain homozygous knock-out clones (-/-), even after several attempts. Therefore, we tried to obtain tet-responsive conditional null mutants of Asf1, since this system has been applied successfully to generate conditional homozygous mutants for other essential genes (39Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16191-16201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After we obtained Asf1+/- clones (Fig. 1, A and B) where one allele had been disrupted by the neo disruption construct, we produced several Asf1+/-+ tetHA-Asf1 cell lines, in which N-terminal HA-tagged Asf1 was expressed under the control of a tet-responsive promoter. After confirmation of tet-repressive expression of HA-Asf1, one of the clones was transfected for the second round disruption of the remaining allele of Asf1 by the bsr/cre-ER disruption construct to obtain three independent Asf1-/-+tetHA-Asf1 clones (Fig. 1, A and B). Hereafter, we referred to these cell lines as Asf1-conditional knock-out cell lines. In these cells, levels of HA-Asf1 proteins were slightly higher than that of the endogenous Asf1 protein in DT40 cells (data not shown), but upon the addition of tet, HA-Asf1 protein level decreased gradually and became undetectable under our blotting conditions after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1C). Of note, doublet Asf1 bands in SDS-PAGE may represent phosphorylated (upper bands) and unphosphorylated (lower bands) forms (28Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1068-1073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which were confirmed as described below (see Fig. 5D). Progressive decrease of Asf-1 protein level was also confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Asf1 staining signal was distributed within the nucleus, but by 36 h, this staining signal was no longer detectable (Fig. 1D, top). It should be noted that treatment of Triton-X100 prior to fixation of cells led to diffusion of the Asf1 signal out of the nucleus (Fig. 1D, bottom), suggesting that the majority of Asf1 protein exists in a soluble nuclear fraction that is not tightly bound with chromatin. This observation was consistent with a previous report that subnuclear localization of human Asf1 is sensitive to Triton extraction (14Mello J.A. Sillje H.H. Roche D.M. Kirschner D.B. Nigg E.A. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Since all of the Asf1-conditional knock-out clones exhibited essentially the same phenotypic properties following the treatment with tet, we describe phenotypes of one of these clones hereafter.FIGURE 5Regions of Asf1 required for protein binding and cell viability. A, N-terminal or C-terminal deletion and missense mutant Asf1 proteins used are schematically represented on the left, and the obtained results are summarized on the right. The solid black boxes indicate β-sheet structures, and an asterisk indicates point-mutated sites. For the survival assay, vectors expressing a series of puro resistance Asf1-FLAG proteins were transfected into Asf1-conditional knock-out cells, and those were cultured in the presence of puro (0.4 μg/ml) either with or without tet. a, numbers of surviving colonies were counted at 10 days after transfection and shown in numerator (+tet) and denominator (-tet), respectively. From several puro-resistant clones in each transfection, one clone expressi"
https://openalex.org/W1971474467,"We have used the racemization of aspartic acid as a marker for the “molecular age” of aggrecan components of the human intervertebral disc matrix (aggregating and non-aggregating proteoglycans as well as the different buoyant density fractions of aggrecan). By measuring the d/lAsp ratio of the various aggrecan species as a function of age and using the values of the racemization constant, ki, found earlier for aggrecan in articular cartilage, we were able to establish directly the relative residence time of these molecules in human intervertebral disc matrix. For A1 preparations taken from normal tissue, turnover rates of 0.059 ± 0.01 and 0.063 ± 0.01/year correspond to half-life values of 12 ± 2.0 and 11.23 ± 1.9 years for nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus, respectively; the turnover rates of 0.084 ± 0.022 and 0.092 ± 0.034/year for degenerate tissue correspond to half-life values of 8.77 ± 2.2 and 8.41 ± 2.8 years, suggesting increased rate of removal of small aggrecan fragments. For the large monomer, fraction A1D1, turnover is 0.13 ± 0.04/year, corresponding to a half-life of 5.56 ± 1.58 years, similar to 3.4 years in human articular cartilage. For the binding region (A1D6), turnover is 0.033 ± 0.0012/year, corresponding to a half-life of 21.53 ± 0.6 years, similar to 23.5 years in articular cartilage. A1 preparations from nucleus pulposus contain a lower proportion of aggregating proteoglycans as compared with annulus fibrosus, suggesting increased proteolytic modification in the nucleus pulposus. d/lAsp values in aggregating and non-aggregating proteoglycans of a 24-year-old individual show similar results, suggesting that the non-aggregating molecules are synthesized initially as aggregating proteoglycans, which thereafter undergo cleavage and detachment from hyaluronan.

The intervertebral disc (IVD) 2The abbreviations used are: IVD, intervertebral disc; NP, nucleus pulposus; AF, annulus fibrosus; PG, proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CS, chondroitin sulfate; ANOVA, analysis of variance. is the largest avascular cartilaginous structure. It lies between the vertebral bodies, anchoring them together. IVD plays a primarily mechanical role in transmitting loads through the spine and providing flexibility to the spinal column. The IVD is highly bradytrophic; it is avascular and nourished by diffusion. Although the outer annulus fibrosus (AF) possesses blood vessels in early childhood, the inner nucleus pulposus (NP) remains avascular for the entire life of the organism (1Hirsch S. Schajowicz F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1953; 22: 184-231Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Maroudas A. Stockwell R.A. Nachemson A. Urban J. J. Anat. 1975; 120: 113-130PubMed Google Scholar). The disc has a complex structure and contains very few cells embedded in an extracellular matrix. These cells have the essential function of maintaining and repairing the matrix by synthesizing matrix macromolecules and by producing proteinases for matrix breakdown. Thus, disc function is dependent on a balance between synthesis and matrix breakdown. Normally, when this balance is maintained, damaged tissue can be restored by cellular repair responses. In pathology, when there is imbalance between matrix synthesis and breakdown, the matrix composition and organization are altered, and the cellular repair responses are inadequate. Hence, the degraded matrix can no longer carry loads effectively, which leads to the degeneration of the disc. During aging, many changes involving the proportions and biochemical properties of aggrecan occur. In particular, the structure and composition of aggrecan changes both with aging and with degeneration. These changes involve an increase in the relative contents of keratan sulfate and protein and a decrease in the molecular weight of aggrecan (3Bayliss M.T. Methods in Cartilage Research. Academic Press, London1990: 220-222Google Scholar). The important question of whether these changes in composition of the aggrecan with aging represent changes in biosynthesis or are due to the accumulation of degraded aggrecan fragments can be addressed by measuring the accumulation of the d-aspartic acid isomer and hence the residence time or the “molecular age” of these molecules. In nature, amino acids are synthesized as l-isomers. Spontaneous racemization slowly converts the l-form of amino acids into a racemic mixture of l- and d-forms. Aspartic acid is one of the most rapidly racemizing amino acids (4Helfman P.M. Bada J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 5Bada J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 98-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), allowing the measurement of the concentration of d-isomers in living subjects in proteins that are not renewed or that slowly turn over. It is well known that an age-dependent racemization occurs in various human and animal tissues containing metabolically stable, long-lived proteins, e.g. in enamel and dentine (4Helfman P.M.

Forensic Sci. 1998; 43: 949-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, turnover of the different populations of proteoglycans (PGs) in human IVD (aggregating and non-aggregating PGs, as well as different buoyant density fractions of the aggrecan) has been determined using racemization of aspartic acid as a tool for assessing the molecular age of long-lived proteins. By using the published racemization constant (ki) earlier found for articular cartilage (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we were able to determine the turnover rate of the different PG populations and a possible relationship with respect to their molecular age and origin. Tissue Sampling—Lumbar and thoracic spines from healthy (ages 0–62, n = 15) and pathological (ages 30–77, n = 14) discs (usually one from each individual) were obtained postmortem or during routine surgical procedures for treatment of herniation or disc degeneration. In this study, healthy discs will be referred to as “normal,” and pathological ones will be referred to as “degenerate.” All discs were divided into NP and AF zones, diced or cryosectioned into 20-μm slices, and stored at –20 °C until analyzed. Extraction of Aggrecan (A1)—For extraction of A1 from NP and AF, 10 volumes of 4 m guanidinium chloride (GuHCl) containing proteinase inhibitors in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 48 h were used (16Bayliss M.T. Ali S.Y. Biochem. J. (1978). 1978; 176: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C, 10,000 rpm for 40 min and exhaustively dialyzed against the same buffer containing no GuHCl. A1 preparations were separated from other tissue proteins by associative cesium chloride (CsCl) equilibrium density gradient centrifugation at a starting density of 1.5 g/ml using 50,000 rpm at 10 °C for 48 h (17Bayliss M.T. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A1 was then recovered from the densest fraction of the gradient (density greater that 1.59 g/ml CsCl). All A1 fractions were assayed for density, exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water, freeze-dried, and analyzed for glycosaminoglycan (GAG), (18Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar) and protein content. The A1 preparations contain aggrecan and its degradation products but not the small leucine-rich repeat PGs, which are also present in the tissue but which sediment at a lower buoyant density. Isolation of Aggrecan Subfractions (A1D1–A1D6)—A1 fractions were further separated by means of dissociative CsCl density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 4 m GuHCl (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4) at a starting density of 1.5 g/ml (10 °C, 50,000 rpm for 48 h) and subsequently fractionated into aggrecan monomers of decreasing buoyant density and increasing molecular weight (A1D1–A1D6) (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All fractions were assayed for density, exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water, freeze-dried, and analyzed for GAG (18Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar) and protein content. In some cases (individuals aged 24 and 56 years), aggrecan subfractions (A1D1–A1D4) were recovered from the aggregating portion alone of the A1 fraction by gel permeation chromatography. Briefly, the A1 preparations (8–12 mg/ml) were fractionated by gel filtration through a Sepharose CL-2B column (100 × 2.5 cm) at a flow rate of 30 ml/h using 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, as the running buffer. Fractions were divided into aggregating PGs eluting at the void volume (A1V0 preparation) and non-aggregating PGs eluting in the included volume (A1Vi1 and A1Vi2 preparations). The aggregating PG preparation (A1V0) alone was further fractionated to yield the aggrecan subfractions (A1D1–A1D4) by means of dissociative CsCl density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 4 m GuHCl at a starting density of 1.5 g/ml. The resulting fractions were assayed for GAG and protein contents. Determination of GAG Content—For determination of sulfated GAG content derived predominantly from aggrecan, 100-μl samples of the tissue digests were analyzed using the 1,9 dimethylmethylene blue dye binding assay (18Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar), with chondroitin sulfate as a standard. Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) Measurements—Uronic acid content as a measure of CS was determined by the carbazole reaction (19Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Hyaluronic acid is also present in the human IVD at between 1 and 4% of the total GAG content, depending on age and anatomical site (20Hardingham T.E. Adams P. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and will contribute to the estimation of CS by uronic acid content. However, its incomplete extraction and lower sedimentation position will minimize its presence in the high buoyant density A1 preparations. It is therefore unlikely that hyaluronic acid contributes greatly to the evaluation of CS by the carbazole reaction. Determination of Percentage of d-Aspartic Acid—The d/lAsp ratio was determined by high performance liquid chromatography according to Verzijl and Aswad (10Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W.J. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 21Aswad D.W.

All d/lAsp data were corrected for the amount of d- and l-Asp present in papain and for racemization during the hydrolysis step. Corrections were made either by subtracting the intercept of the graph for d/lAsp versus donor age or by subtracting the d/lAsp ratio measured for A1 preparations purified from human neonatal or from young fetal bone (∼17 weeks old). Calculation of Turnover Rates and Corresponding Half-lives—Turnover rates and half-lives of A1 and A1D1–A1D6 fractions were calculated based on previous work by Maroudas et al. (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Maroudas A. Palla G. Gilav E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) on collagen turnover with some modifications suitable for aggrecan and are discussed in detail in the Supplemental Data. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of the differences in d-Asp accumulation between (i) NP and AF and (ii) aggregating and non-aggregating PGs was determined using Student's t test (assuming unequal variances, p < 0.05). The statistical significance of the differences in d-Asp accumulation between normal and degenerate tissue and between age groups (or young and old specimens) from A1 or A1D1–A1D6 fractions was analyzed using two-factor ANOVA including the Tukey post hoc test and interactions; p < 0.05 was considered to represent statistically significant difference. Linear regression analysis of the age-related increase in protein content, normalized to A1, for normal and degenerate tissue (both NP and AF) was performed. The limit of significance of the difference in slopes between NP and AF was set at the p = 0.05 level. Accumulation of d-Asp in Aggrecan from Normal and Degenerate IVD—Fig. 1 shows the experimental values of d/lAsp for the A1 fractions obtained from NP and AF of normal and degenerate human IVD as a function of donor age. Corrections to the d/lAsp values were applied as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Racemization of aspartic acid (expressed as the ratio d/lAsp) in the A1 preparations clearly increases with age in a non-linear fashion (n = 8, r = 0.96 and n = 8, r = 0.97 for normal NP and AF, respectively, Fig. 1A; and n = 9, r = 0.87 and n = 6, r = 0.73 for degenerate NP and AF, respectively, Fig. 1B). No significant difference was observed in the rate of accumulation of the d-isomer with age in NP as compared with AF (p > 0.05) for both normal and degenerate tissue. For comparison, d/lAsp ratios for representative samples of A1D1 obtained from normal tissue (mean values of normal NP and AF) are shown in the same figure. In contrast to the entire aggrecan (A1), no age-related change is observed for A1D1 after maturity. Since aggrecan is known to be heterogeneous with respect to molecular size and composition (23Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1980-1989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Melrose J. Ghosh P. Taylor T.K.F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the observed age-related increase of d/lAsp for A1 taken together with the constancy of the A1D1 values indicate that there is a differential turnover of the various aggrecan subfractions. Fig. 2 shows the accumulation of d-Asp in A1 preparation obtained from NP of normal and degenerate human IVD as a function of donor age. Using two-factor ANOVA, a significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed between the mean values of d/lAsp for normal and degenerate tissues averaged over all age groups. The measured values of d/lAsp are consistently lower in degenerate aggrecan as compared with normal. For example, in the 30–40-year age group, accumulation of the d-isomer was nearly twice as high in the normal discs as compared with the degenerate discs. A significant difference in d-Asp accumulation between age groups (both normal and degenerate tissue) was noted only between 30–40 and 50–60 and between 30–40 and 60–80. Since differences in d-Asp accumulation are more marked between normal and degenerate tissue and less as a function of age, we conclude that the alterations occurring during aging are slow and statistically less significant than those occurring during degeneration. Similar results were obtained for AF (data not shown). To examine the significance of the constancy of A1D1, the d/lAsp ratio was determined for each of the different buoyant density fractions (A1D1–A1D6) isolated from the dissociative CsCl gradient of A1. It is well known that cartilage PGs distribute themselves within the CsCl density gradient according to their molecular composition, i.e. the higher the GAG content, the greater the density at which the PGs equilibrate (23Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1980-1989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the GAG/protein ratio (w/w) of A1D1–A1D6, taken from normal NP of young (22 years) and old (70 years) individuals, in a dissociative CsCl density gradient at a starting density of 1.5 g/ml. Thus, the A1D1 fraction contains the highest content of GAG per weight of protein, whereas the intermediate fractions (A1D2–A1D6) represent mixtures of aggrecan of decreasing carbohydrate content. The A1D6 fraction contains mainly free G1 domain and link protein. Moreover, the decrease in GAG content per weight of protein with age is also demonstrated. The chemical composition of A1D1 to A1D6 subfractions from a NP of a 62-year-old individual is shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Composition of aggrecan monomers of different buoyant density obtained from nucleus pulposus of a 62-year-old individualCompositionA1D1A1D2A1D3A1D4A1D5A1D6Dry weight recovered (mg)74.261.448.834.2168.5Protein (% of dry weight)6.79.412.216.736.632.6CS (% of dry weight)47.0336.619.914.212.147.3CS/protein (dry weight ratio)7.023.91.630.850.330.22Total GAG (% of dry weight)81.6768.2953.4343.9937.8736.02Buoyant density (g/ml)>1.591.55-1.591.51-1.551.49-1.511.46-1.491.42-1.46 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows a comparison between d/lAsp of normal and degenerate A1D1–A1D6 for three different age groups: young normal, elderly normal, and elderly degenerate. Data presented are the average between NP and AF. The averaging procedure was necessary due to the small amounts of material available and was justified due to the fact that no significant difference was found between the values of d/lAsp for NP as compared with AF (Fig. 1A, p > 0.05). Using two-factor ANOVA, a comparison of means between the different subfractions, revealed significant differences in d-Asp accumulation (p < 0.05) only between A1D1 and A1D3–A1D6. Significant difference was also found between young and elderly normal groups as well as between elderly degenerate and elderly normal groups. Accumulation of d-Asp in the elderly degenerate specimens is similar to that in the young normal age group, due to increased protein turnover in the degenerate tissue (Table 2).TABLE 2Half-life values of A1-preparations obtained from NP and AF of normal and degenerate human intervertebral discsFractionαkTHalf-lifeyear-1year-1yearsNP (normal)0.00470.059 ± 0.0112.0 ± 2AF (normal)0.0110.063 ± 0.0111.23 ± 1.9NP (degenerate)0.0630.084 ± 0.0228.77 ± 2.2AF (degenerate)0.0860.092 ± 0.0348.41 ± 2.8 Open table in a new tab As was found for the A1 preparation, an age-related increase in accumulation of the d-isomer is noted in A1D2–A1D6 subfractions (Fig. 4). It was found to be the highest in A1D6 from both normal and degenerate discs, as in the case of articular cartilage (12Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Bank R. Bayliss M.T. Johannes W.J.B. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Maroudas A. TeKoppele J.M. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); this is also the case for A1D1–A1D4 from the aggregating PG fraction isolated by chromatography of the A1 preparations on Sepharose CL-2B (data not shown). The amount of d-isomer in A1D1 remained approximately unchanged with age (Fig. 1A), as in A1D1 obtained from femoral head and femoral condyle cartilage (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An inverse correlation between GAG content and the extent of racemization is noted (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Assuming that the racemization rate is a constant for each subfraction, these results imply that the large heterogeneity in size and composition among these lower density fractions (A1D2–A1D6) is accompanied by a differential turnover. The maximum and age-independent turnover rate is inferred for the large monomer fraction, A1D1. As expected, the lowest values of d/lAsp were observed for the young and normal discs (ages 22 and 24 years). In the case of the older specimens, lower accumulation was observed for the degenerate tissue as compared with the normal tissue (Fig. 4). To learn more about the extent of modification of the aggrecan structure and accumulation of specific products, non-denaturing gel permeation chromatography (Sepharose CL-2B) was employed to separate the A1 preparations. Fig. 5 shows a typical elution profile (A1 prepared from a healthy 24-year-old donor) of three fractions representing aggregating PGs (Peak A1Voo, fractions 33–50), large non-aggregating PGs (Peak A1Vi1, fractions 51–68), and small non-aggregating PGs (Peak A1V i2, fractions 69–88). For the AF A1 preparations derived from 24- and 56-year-old individuals, the aggregating PGs accounted for about 42% of the total PGs. For the NP A1 preparations derived from the same individuals, the aggregating PGs accounted for 24 and 31% of the total PGs, respectively. Thus, the A1 preparations derived from the NP contain a lower proportion of aggregating PGs than those from the AF, suggesting a greater degree of proteolytic modification in the NP. The above fractions were characterized with respect to their d/lAsp content. The fact that no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed between d/lAsp ratios of aggregating (A1V0) and non-aggregating fractions (A1Vi1 and A1Vi2), from the 24-year-old individual (Fig. 6), suggests that the non-aggregating PGs were synthesized at the same time as the aggregating PGs and that both PG types exhibit similar retention times in the IVD. The fact that the d/lAsp ratio of the non-aggregating PGs is significantly lower (p < 0.012) than that of aggregating PGs in the 56-year-old individual implies that some of the non-aggregating PGs are preferentially lost, and it is most likely that these are the smaller fragments, with larger amounts of d-Asp. Throughout life, there is probably continual degradation of the non-aggregating PGs, and once they reach a critically small size, they will be lost from the disc by diffusion. This implies that the smallest non-aggregating molecules will be derived from the oldest aggrecan molecules and hence will be of the highest d-Asp content. The fact that similar d/lAsp values were obtained for the non-aggregating pools of the 56-year-old individual suggests that a balance exists between the loss of small fragments from A1Vi2 and cleavage of the larger fragments from the A1Vi1 pool to smaller fragments present in A1Vi2. Turnover of Aggrecan and Its Subfractions (A1D1–A1D6)—Despite the fact that the A1 preparations are very heterogeneous in nature (composed of aggregating and non-aggregating PGs), we nevertheless considered it useful to calculate the mean half-life values of the protein moiety in these preparations obtained from normal and degenerate specimens. Using the racemization rate constant of l- to d-conversion of aspartic acid (ki) of 1.87 × 10–3 year–1 found previously for articular cartilage (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the d/l data obtained from the racemization measurements, we were able to calculate the rate constant for protein turnover (kT) and the corresponding half-life for A1 preparations as well as for the aggrecan subfractions (A1D1–A1D6) as described in the Supplemental Data. Values for α, which relate to the increase in the amount of protein with age, are derived from Fig. 7. For A1 preparations taken from normal tissue, turnover rates of 0.059 ± 0.01 and 0.063 ± 0.01/year correspond to half-life values of 12 ± 2.0 and 11.23 ± 1.9 years for NP and AF, respectively; the turnover rates of 0.084 ± 0.022 and 0.092 ± 0.034/year for degenerate tissue correspond to half-life values of 8.77 ± 2.2 and 8.41 ± 2.8 years (Table 2), suggesting an increased rate of removal of small aggrecan fragments. The large scatter is probably due to the heterogeneity of the A1 preparations. The protein turnover rate for aggrecan subfractions (A1D1–A1D6) from normal tissue was calculated after averaging NP and AF (Table 3). The mean value of the turnover rate constant (kT) for the large monomer in fraction A1D1 is 0.13 ± 0.042/year, which corresponds to a half-life of 5.56 ± 1.58 years as compared with 3.4 years in human articular cartilage (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas the turnover for the binding region (A1D6) is 21.53 ± 0.6 years as compared with 23.5 years previously found for articular cartilage (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).TABLE 3Half-life values of aggrecan monomers (A1D1-A1D6) taken from normal human IVDAggrecan monomerskTHalf-lifeyear-1yearsA1D10.134 ± 0.0425.56 ± 1.58A1D20.054 ± 0.000212.85 ± 0.05A1D30.042 ± 0.00316.51 ± 1.20A1D40.0427 ± 0.00417.28 ± 1.14A1D50.039 ± 0.003517.92 ± 1.29A1D60.033 ± 0.001221.53 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab In this research, an attempt was made to determine the turnover rates and resulting half-life values of different PG populations in human IVD by using the accumulation of the d-Asp isomer as a marker for residence time in the tissue. A rapid turnover of a given species in the tissue implies a short residence time and hence a possibility of renewal and repair of matrix components. A slow turnover, on the other hand, means that it is more difficult for cells to repair defects, which therefore may accumulate with aging. Determination of the residence time of a molecular species is one way to assign age-related changes in composition to either alteration of synthesis or degradation. Aggrecan from human IVD exists in forms that vary with respect to the size and composition of the protein moiety as well as the size of the covalently bound carbohydrate polymers. This heterogeneity is very similar to that of aggrecan in articular cartilage (15Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Many of these variations occur during maturation and degeneration of the tissue and give rise to a broad distribution of molecular sizes (25Bayliss M.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A1 subfractions (A1D1–A1D6) isolated by means of dissociative CsCl gradient centrifugation show continuous changes from the fraction isolated at the highest buoyant density (A1D1) to that recovered from the lowest buoyant density (A1D6). These changes include: (a) an increase in the relative amount of protein; (b) a decrease in the relative amount of uronic acid and hence of CS; (c) a decrease in the relative amounts of GAG and hence in the sum of keratan sulfate and CS; (d) a decrease in the ratio of CS to protein. A1 preparation, as a whole, shows an increase in the amount of protein with age. This is due to a very slow turnover of A1D6 (half-life of 21.53 ± 0.6 years) as compared with a relatively rapid turnover of the large monomer, A1D1 (half-life of 5.56 ± 1.58 years). It is therefore the small molecular species that are rich in protein that accumulate with age. These turnover products may be attached to hyaluronan or be non-aggregated. For the aggrecan species in the A1D1 fraction, representing the GAG-rich intact monomer, the d/lAsp ratio remains approximately constant throughout adult life; on the other hand, for the A1 preparation as a whole, there is an increase with age in the d/lAsp ratio after maturity (>20 years) until a plateau is reached above 60 years of age. This implies that between 20 and 60 years, the rate of racemization is higher than the rate of turnover, whereas above 60 years of age, these processes reach equilibrium. There are two main metabolic processes that may account for why the content of d-Asp in disc PGs does not continue to increase after age 60. First, the rate of synthesis of new PGs (with low d-Asp) is unlikely to increase as disc PG content decreases with age. Second, the rate of loss of the older PGs (with high d-Asp) may well increase, which is likely as the proportion of non-aggregating PGs increases with age, suggesting ongoing catabolism (due to lower d-Asp value). It is the loss of these small fragments coupled with the inability of the disc to replace them by synthesis of new aggrecan that results in the age-related decrease in disc PG content. Catabolism may not only result in loss of the smallest non-aggregating PGs but also in the loss of some free G1 and link protein due to hyaluronan depolymerization (26Sztrolovics R. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, due to differences between accumulation of the d-isomer in A1 and A1D1, we deduced that the A1 preparation must contain subpopulations with a lower turnover rate and hence longer residence time than that of the monomer in the A1D1 fraction. The data in Tables 1 and 3 confirm the existence of low buoyant density aggrecan subfractions with longer residence time in the tissue. It is for these fractions that the ratio d/lAsp increases with age. It is apparent from Fig. 1 that the mean turnover rate constant for A1 is lower than for A1D1. Indeed, for A1D1, the turnover rate constant is found to be 0.134/year, which corresponds to a half-life of 5.56 ± 1.58 years, whereas for A1, a mean turnover rate constant (average of NP and AF) of 0.062 ± 0.01/year corresponds to a half-life of 11.62 ± 2.0 years. The finding that the turnover rate constant, kT, was the same (p > 0.05) for the NP and AF in both normal and degenerate discs is surprising since these tissue zones have different cells, which produce different amounts as well as different morphologies of the matrix. We have no explanation for this finding. It is important to note that in all cases studied, d/lAsp content was lower in aggrecan from degenerate tissue as compared with normal, i.e. degenerate aggrecan is “younger”; this is in accordance with previously published data for osteoarthritic articular cartilage (12Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Bank R. Bayliss M.T. Johannes W.J.B. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Maroudas A. TeKoppele J.M. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This suggests that higher levels of turnover and hence lower levels of accumulation are present in degenerate tissue. It is important to note that the validity of the comparison between the molecular ages of different PG species from the determination of d/lAsp was based on the implicit assumption that the racemization rate constant, ki, of aspartyl and asparaginyl is the same throughout the protein core. This was indeed validated by the fact that there were only statistically minor differences between the d/lAsp ratios of the A1D1 and A1D6 fractions of young subjects (22 and 24 years), in which age-related changes are small and would not have masked the differences in the intrinsic racemization rate constants, had these been present (Fig. 4). An attempt was made to address the question regarding the origin of the small aggregating PGs as well as the non-aggregating PGs in human IVD, using the racemization of aspartic acid as a tool for determining in vivo turnover rates of different PG populations, in both normal and pathological tissues. Our finding that the non-aggregating PGs of a normal 24-year-old specimen have residence times that are similar to those of the aggregating PGs (p > 0.05, Fig. 6) and hence are of similar molecular age suggests that the non-aggregating PGs were synthesized at the same time as aggregating PGs. It is likely that the non-aggregating PGs were synthesized as aggregating PGs that were later cleaved by proteolysis. The PG fragments that were no longer bound to hyaluronan, but were retained within the disc, then formed the non-aggregating PGs (27Roughley P.J. Melching L.I. Heathfield T.F. Pearce R.H. Mort J.S. Eur. Spine J. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Such retention of non-aggregating fragments of aggrecan appears to be unique to the IVD and does not occur in articular cartilage. This probably reflects the large size and avascular nature of the disc, which prevents ready loss of large macromolecules by diffusion. The alternative explanation that the non-aggregating PGs were synthesized as such de novo is unlikely as there is no evidence to support the existence of such unique gene products.

The IL-6 family cytokines interact with their receptors through three different binding sites (I-III). We demonstrated previously that leptin has similar binding sites I-III and mapped the interactions between binding site II and cytokine receptor homology domain II (CRH2) (Peelman, F., Van Beneden, K., Zabeau, L., Iserentant, H., Ulrichts, P., Defeau, D., Verhee, A., Catteeuw, D., Elewaut, D., and Tavernier, J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 41038-41046). In this study, we built homology models for the CRH1 and Ig-like domains of the LR. The Ig-like domain shows a large conserved surface patch in the beta-sheet formed by beta-strands 3, 6, and 7. Mutations in this patch almost completely abolished the leptin-induced STAT3-dependent reporter activity. We propose that a conserved cluster of residues Leu370, Ala407, Tyr409, His417, and His418 forms the center of binding site III of the LR. We built a hexameric leptin.LR complex model based on the hexameric IL-6 complex. In this model, a conserved hydrophobic protuberance of Val36, Thr37, Phe41, and Phe43 in the A-B loop of leptin fits perfectly in the CRH2 domain, corresponding to the IL-6 alpha-receptor, and forms the center of binding site I. The 2:4 hexameric leptin.LR complex offers a rational explanation for mutagenesis studies and residue conservation."

The heme transport systems in Gram-negative bacteria comprise a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor critical for active transport of heme into the periplasm (12Braun V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), where a periplasmic heme-binding protein then acts as a soluble receptor for the transport of heme to the cytoplasmic membrane. In addition, genes bearing significant homology to the previously characterized cytoplasmic permease and ATPase proteins facilitate active uptake of heme into the cytoplasm (13Shea C.M. McIntosh M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two distinct heme uptake operons have been identified (10Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The phu (Pseudomonas heme utilization) and has (heme assimilation system) heme-uptake systems are under the transcriptional regulation of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) and are found in distinct loci within the genome. Both operons have genes encoding for outer membrane receptors phuR and hasR, respectively. In addition, the phu operon encodes genes for a periplasmic binding protein (PhuT), cytoplasmic heme-binding protein (PhuS), and the ATP-dependent permease proteins (PhuUVW) (10Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The has operon encodes for an extracellular heme-binding protein or hemophore HasA that functions to deliver heme to HasR. The remaining genes in the operon, hasD and -E, are proposed to be components of an ABC-transporter for secretion of the hemophore (HasA) (14Letoffe S. Ghigo J.M. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Letoffe S. Redeker V. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Whereas the general concept of heme uptake is fairly well understood from genetic and biochemical studies of the iron-siderophore uptake systems, the fate of the heme once transported into the cytoplasm was based on speculation of a heme oxygenase-like activity. In Yersiniae entercolitica the cytoplasmic heme-binding protein encoded by the hemS gene was essential in preventing heme toxicity and was proposed to be a heme-degrading enzyme (16Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast, the shuS gene of Shigella dysenteriae was not essential in the prevention of heme toxicity (17Wyckoff E.E. Lopreato G.F. Tipton K.A. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is unclear at this point whether this reflects functional differences in the ShuS and HemS proteins, or between their respective outer membrane receptors (18Wyckoff E.E. Duncan D. Torres A.G. Mills M. Maase K. Payne S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The existence of degenerate systems for heme and iron acquisition in such organisms may also complicate identification of distinct phenotypes. We have recently purified and characterized the ShuS protein from S. dysenteriae as a heme-binding protein and based on preliminary characterization it does not appear to be a heme oxygenase (19Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recent identification and characterization of iron-regulated heme oxygenases from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (HmuO) (20Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), Neisseriae meningitidis (HemO) (21Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and P. aeruginosa (pa-HO, PigA) (22Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) suggest that the function of the cytoplasmic heme-binding proteins is distinct from that of the heme oxygenases. The recent identification of a heme oxygenase (BphO), which produces α-biliverdin as a chromophore for the sensor kinase (BphP) of a bacterial two-component signaling system (23Wegele R. Tasler R. Zeng Y. Rivera M. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45791-45802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), confirms the role of the δ-selective pa-HO in the mining of iron from exogenously acquired heme. These recent findings led us to hypothesize that the PhuS protein is an intracellular heme trafficking protein specific to the iron-regulated heme oxygenase (pa-HO). Materials—All chemicals (ACS grade or better), resins, DNA modifying enzymes, and oligonucleotides were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Plasmid purification, subcloning, and bacterial transformations were carried out as previously described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Deionized, doubly distilled water was used for all experiments. Bacterial Strains—Escherichia coli strain DH 5α (F′, ara D(lac-proAB) rpsL ø80dlacZDM15 hsd R17) was used for DNA manipulation and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (F-ompT hsdS (rB-mB-) gal dcm (DE3)) was used for expression of the wild type PhuS construct. Construction of the Expression Vector pEPhuS—pCRphuS was generated by PCR amplification using Herculase DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers containing the listed restriction site: 5′ NdeI-GAACCGCATATGAGCAGCACTCCC and 3′ XhoI-CCTCAGAGCGCCTTGAAGGATTCG. Poly(A) overhangs were generated by the addition of 1 μm dATP and 1 μlof Taq polymerase to the completed PCR and incubation at 72 °C for 15 min. The 1.1-kb PCR product was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO II vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCR-phuS. The resultant phuS fragment was subcloned into pET21a expression vector by NdeI-XhoI digestion and re-ligation generating pEphuS. Expression and Purification of the PhuS Protein—The PhuS proteins were purified by a modification of the published procedure for ShuS (19Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A 10-ml innoculum in Luria-Bertani (LB)-ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was prepared from LB-Amp (100 μg/ml) agar plates with freshly transformed colonies of pEPhuS in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. One-liter cultures were innoculated to an A600 of 0.06 from a 100-ml subculture (A600 = 0.6). The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown for a further 2 h at room temperature and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8,000 × g. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 35 min. The soluble fraction was applied to a Sepharose-Q Fast Flow column (30 × 150 mm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and washed with 5 column volumes of 20 mm Tris containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was further washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mm NaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 50-400 mm NaCl. The protein eluted at a concentration of 200 mm NaCl. The peak fractions as judged by SDS-PAGE were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml and stored at -80 °C or reconstituted with heme. For reconstitution, a 10 mm stock solution of heme was prepared in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide and subsequently buffered to pH 8.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl. The concentration of the stock solution was then accurately determined by the pyridine hemochrome method (25Fuhrop J.H. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1975Google Scholar). The protein was then reconstituted by addition of heme to give a 1.5:1 ratio of heme to protein and the excess heme was removed by passage over a Sephadex G-50 column (2 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The purified holoprotein was concentrated and stored as described for the apoprotein. The native molecular mass of PhuS was analyzed on a Pharmacia AKTA FPLC system fitted with a Superdex S200 HR 10/300 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) that was 100 mm in NaCl. A 50-100-μl sample at a final concentration of 100 μm heme-PhuS was injected onto the column and the elution volume noted. In a separate experiment the molecular mass markers (100 μl) were injected and their retention times were used to generate a standard curve that covered the range from 669 to 17 kDa. Expression and Purification of the Heme Oxygenase Proteins—The iron-regulated pa-HO was purified as described previously (22Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The BphO protein was purified by modification of the previously described procedure for pa-HO (22Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). An overnight 10-ml innoculum in LB-kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was prepared from LB-kanamycin (50 μg/ml) agar plates with freshly transformed colonies of pET28b-BphO in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. One-liter cultures were inoculated to an A600 of 0.06 from a 100-ml subculture grown to an A600 = 0.6 from the overnight growth. The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.8-0.9 and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were grown for a further 5-6 h at room temperature and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8,000 × g. The cells were lysed in 10 ml/liter of culture of BugBuster HT buffer (Novagen, CA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and a Complete Mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 50 ml of lysis buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 35 min. The soluble fraction was applied to a Sepharose-Q Fast Flow column (3 × 15 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The protein was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and eluted with a linear salt gradient from 50 to 350 mm NaCl. The protein eluted at 200 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml and stored at -80 °C. Absorbance Spectroscopy of the Heme-Phus Complex—The millimolar extinction coefficient at the Soret band maximum (410 nm) of the heme-PhuS complex in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was determined by the pyridine hemochrome method (25Fuhrop J.H. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1975Google Scholar). UV-visible absorbance spectra of the heme-PhuS complexes were recorded over the pH range of 6.0 to 10.5. This range was covered with 20 mm MES, 20 mm HEPES, and 20 mm CHES buffers. Spectra were recorded over this pH range and evaluated via global analysis to determine the speciation of the heme-PhuS complex and the corresponding pKa values. In a separate pH titration experiment, ΔA was monitored at 419 nm between pH 6.5 and 9.0 in 20 mm Tris-HCl. These data were fit to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, with the value of n held fixed at 1. Fluorescence Spectrophotometry—Titrations of PhuS with heme were monitored by steady state fluorescence emission. Samples were excited at 295 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored at 337 nm. Solutions of 1.0 μm PhuS in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) were titrated with 1-μl aliquots (0.1-100 μm) of heme at 25 °C. All stock heme solutions were freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and used within 30 min. The binding constant (Kd) was calculated by Scatchard analysis, which was based on the decrease in Trp fluorescence intensity at 337 nm as a function of increasing heme concentration. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman (rR) spectra were obtained with either 413.1 nm excitation from a Kr+ laser or 441.6 nm excitation from a HeCd laser. PhuS samples were 20 to 90 μm in heme. Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman spectrometer described previously (26Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The spectrometer was calibrated using the Raman shifts of bands from spectra of neat toluene, dimethyl formamide, and methylene bromide as external frequency standards. Data were collected at ambient temperature from samples in spinning 5-mm NMR tubes using the 135° backscattering geometry. Laser powers ranged from 10 to 15 milliwatt at the sample with 413.1 nm excitation and from 15 to 20 milliwatt with 441.6 nm excitation. No spectral artifacts attributable to photoinduced chemistry were observed. UV-visible spectra were recorded before and after rR experiments to ensure that the samples were not irreversibly altered by laser irradiation. Samples for the pH study were prepared by dilution of a stock of PhuS into 50 mm buffer at the desired pH. Reaction of the Heme-PhuS Complex with Ascorbate or NADPH Cytochrome P450 Reductase—To determine whether PhuS has heme oxygenase activity, the heme-PhuS complex was assayed in the presence of ascorbate (20Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Zhu W. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6783-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Ascorbate (500 μm final concentration) was added to the heme-PhuS complex (10 μm) in a final volume of 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25 °C. A second set of reactions with ascorbate were carried out in the presence of catalase (150 units) and superoxide dismutase so as to discriminate between heme degradation via coupled oxidation and that possibly arising from enzymatic heme oxygenation. The experiments described above were also carried out with the P. aeruginosa heme oxygenase (pa-HO) to establish a basis for comparison of the aforementioned activity with that of an authentic heme oxygenase. In Vitro Heme Transfer Experiments—Absorbance spectra of pure heme-PhuS, apo-pa-HO, and BphO were recorded between 300 and 700 nm. Following addition of an equimolar amount of either apo-pa-HO or apo-BphO to heme-PhuS, the spectrum was recorded again. The extent of heme transfer from the heme-PhuS complex to pa-HO or BphO was verified by UV-visible absorbance (406 nm for heme, 280 nm for protein) and SDS-PAGE analysis of chromatographic fractions separated from the reaction mixture by gel filtration (Sepharose S-100, 1.5 × 120-cm column, equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl). UV-visible Stopped Flow Measurements—Rate measurements were carried out using a model SX18MV stopped flow spectrometer from Applied Photophysics. Determinations were made in both the single- and multichannel modes. Equimolar amounts of heme-PhuS and apo-pa-HO or apo-BphO were mixed to final concentrations of 10 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). For each reaction, 60 μl of each protein were mixed and the increase in absorbance at 406 nm was tracked. Initial rates of the reactions of heme-PhuS with apo-pa-HO and BphO were determined from time courses of ΔA, which was followed for 50 and 1000 s, respectively. Protein-Protein Interaction as Determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance—Kinetic evaluations of heme-PhuS (analyte) binding to immobilized pa-HO or BphO were carried out on a BIACORE 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C on carboxymethyl-dextran sensor chips (CM5), which were activated using equimolar amounts of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride for 7 min (Amine Coupling Kit; BIAcore). The ligand, either pa-HO or BphO, was diluted in the acetate coupling solution to a concentration of 30 μg/ml at pH 5.0 and pumped over the activated surface at 5 μl/min. Approximately 2000 and 3500 resonance units of either pa-HO or BphO, respectively, were immobilized on the chip. The surface of the flow cell was then blocked with ethanolamine for 7 min to deactivate any unreacted esters and to remove any remaining unbound protein. A second flow cell was activated and deactivated to yield a blank surface. All analyte samples were diluted in degassed, filter-sterilized buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20). The same solution was used as running buffer during kinetics experiments. For reactions of heme-PhuS with immobilized pa-HO, the concentration of heme-PhuS was varied between 0 and 350 nm in 50 nm increments. The analyte flow rate was 20 μl/min. The association with immobilized pa-HO was followed for 180 s, and the dissociation for 300 s at each concentration. Following completion of the dissociation step, surface regeneration was accomplished with a 5-μl injection of 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The data were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir model using the BIAevaluation Software provided by BIA-core. Control experiments were carried out at each analyte concentration by passage over the activated blank chip to determine any nonspecific binding of heme-PhuS to the surface. Any signal attributable to nonspecific binding was then subtracted from the actual data curves. Similar experiments were carried out for the reaction of heme-PhuS with immobilized BphO. Heme-PhuS concentrations were varied from 0 to 150 μm. The flow rate was 30 μl/min and the association and dissociation rates were both measured over a period of 200 s. Regeneration of the surface was accomplished as described above. Expression and Purification of PhuS—PhuS purifies as the apo-protein, as judged by the absence of heme features in its UV-visible absorbance spectrum. Following ion exchange, heme reconstitution, and size exclusion chromatography, the PhuS protein was judged 98% pure by SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig. 1A). The yield of purified PhuS ranged from 10 to 20 mg/liter of cell culture. Analysis of the heme-PhuS complex by size exclusion chromatography indicates that, in vitro, the protein exists as a mixture of dimer (78 kDa) and monomer (39 kDa) (Fig. 1B), and the ratio of dimer to monomer appears to be independent of whether the heme is present or not (data not shown). In addition, varying the salt concentration in the elution buffer up to 300 mm NaCl did not affect the ratio of dimer to monomer (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction is hydrophobic. It is unclear at the present time whether the dimerization of PhuS is physiologically relevant. However, the PhuS homolog, ShuS from S. dysenteriae, also forms dimers and oligomers in vitro (19Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Characterization of the Heme-PhuS Complex—The heme binding constants (Kd) were measured by the addition of heme aliquots to protein at pH 8.0 and monitored by the heme-induced decrease in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2A). This method yielded Kd values of 0.18 ± 0.01, 0.72 ± 0.06, and 1.5 ± 0.1 μm for PhuS, pa-HO, and BphO, respectively. Upon reconstitution with heme the Soret maximum of the heme-PhuS complex occurs at 410 nm at pH 8.0 with visible bands at 545 and 570 nm (Fig. 2B). The extinction coefficient at 410 nm was determined to be 122 mm-1 cm-1. The visible spectrum of heme-PhuS at pH 8.0 is very similar to a number of heme-hydroxide complexes, such as those reported for Hb at pH 10.4, Mb at pH 10.4 (27Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Antonini E. Brunori M. Frontiers in Biology; Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. 21. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar), various peroxidases (29Howes B.D. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1532-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Smulevich G. Neri F. Marzocchi M.P. Welinder K.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10576-10585Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), heme-HO at pH 10.0 (31Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and FixL at pH 10.7 (32Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rexine J.L. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13543-13552Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the absorbance spectrum is shown in Fig. 3A. These experimental spectra are comparable with the component spectra of the acidic, neutral, and alkaline species obtained from global analysis of the pH titration over the range of 6.0 to 10.5. The speciation of these heme-PhuS forms is shown in Fig. 3B. The pKa values for the transitions involving these three species are at 7.2 ± 0.1 and 10.2 ± 0.5. The pKa1 of 7.2 is assigned to the Fe(III)-H2O to Fe(III)-OH transition. Least squares analysis of the pH titration of heme-PhuS monitored by changes in absorbance at 419 nm between pH 6.5 and 9.0 yields a similar pKa of 7.1 ± 0.1 for this acid-base equilibrium (data not shown). The pH-dependent changes in spin state and axial coordination of the heme identified via the spectrophotometric titration were further clarified by rR spectroscopy. Fig. 4A shows the rR spectra of heme-PhuS between pH 5.7 and 10.0. In the high frequency rR spectra of ferric hemes, the ν3 band, often referred to as the heme spin-state marker, falls in characteristic frequency ranges for the following permutations of spin state and coordination number: 1490-1500 cm-1 for high-spin (HS) five-coordinate (5-c), 1475-1488 cm- for HS six-coordinate (6-c), and 1500-1510 cm-1 for low-spin (LS) 6-c hemes. The spectra at pH < pKa1 show that 5-c HS, 6-c HS, and 6-c LS heme species are present. Whereas the same spin states and coordination numbers are present at pKa1 > pH < pKa2, their relative populations differ with the 6-c LS heme being favored. In conjunction with the visible titration, the acidic 6-c HS form is assigned to the Fe(III)-H2O adduct of heme-PhuS, whereas the two 6-c species observed at neutral pH are assigned to 6-c LS and 6-c HS heme hydroxide adducts. The 5-c HS heme form observed at pH 7.2 and above could have either a histidine or a hydroxide as the fifth heme ligand; there is precedent for both (33Boffi A. Das T.K. della Longa S. Spagnuolo C.

Chem. 1999; 38: 1952-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The persistence of 6-c LS heme at acidic pH suggests that the acid-base transitions involving an exogenous axial ligand do not account for all of the heme. This is consistent with a second endogenous ligand with which water and hydroxide compete. Efforts to identify this ligand are ongoing. The persistence of 6-c LS and 6-c HS hemes under alkaline conditions is consistent with a distal hydroxide ligand, as heme-OH complexes often exist as HS/LS equilibria (27Feis A. Marzocchi M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2106037345,"The pituitary glycoprotein hormones, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), act through their cognate receptors to initiate a series of coordinated physiological events that results in germ cell maturation. Given the importance of FSH in regulating folliculogenesis and fertility, the development of FSH mimetics has been sought to treat infertility. Currently, purified and recombinant human FSH are the only FSH receptor (FSH-R) agonists available for infertility treatment. By screening unbiased combinatorial chemistry libraries, using a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter assay, we discovered thiazolidinone agonists (EC50's = 20 μm) of the human FSH-R. Subsequent analog library screening and parallel synthesis optimization resulted in the identification of a potent agonist (EC50 = 2 nm) with full efficacy compared with FSH that was FSH-R-selective and -dependent. The compound mediated progesterone production in Y1 cells transfected with the human FSH-R (EC50 = 980 nm) and estradiol production from primary rat ovarian granulosa cells (EC50 = 10.5 nm). This and related compounds did not compete with FSH for binding to the FSH-R. Use of human FSH/thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor chimeras suggested a novel mechanism for receptor activation through a binding site independent of the natural hormone binding site. This study is the first report of a high affinity small molecule agonist that activates a glycoprotein hormone receptor through an allosteric mechanism. The small molecule FSH receptor agonists described here could lead to an oral alternative to the current parenteral FSH treatments used clinically to induce ovarian stimulation for both in vivo and in vitro fertilization therapy.

The compound mediated progesterone production in Y1 cells transfected with the human FSH-R (EC50 = 980 nm) and estradiol production from primary rat ovarian granulosa cells (EC50 = 10.5 nm). This and related compounds did not compete with FSH for binding to the FSH-R. Use of human FSH/thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor chimeras suggested a novel mechanism for receptor activation through a binding site independent of the natural hormone binding site. This study is the first report of a high affinity small molecule agonist that activates a glycoprotein hormone receptor through an allosteric mechanism. The small molecule FSH receptor agonists described here could lead to an oral alternative to the current parenteral FSH treatments used clinically to induce ovarian stimulation for both in vivo and in vitro fertilization therapy. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 2The abbreviations used are: FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; -R, receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TM, transmembrane; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CRE, cyclic-AMP response element. is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the anterior pituitary that plays a key role in stimulating ovulation and spermatogenesis. Like other members of the glycoprotein hormone family (luteinizing hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)), FSH is a heterodimeric protein of ∼30,000 Da that consists of a common α-subunit joined noncovalently to a hormone-specific β-subunit. FSH activity is mediated through binding to the FSH receptor (FSH-R), which belongs to family I of the large 7-transmembrane-spanning, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The glycoprotein hormone receptors are unique among the members of the GPCR family, because they recognize protein hormones and are dominated by a large N-terminal extracellular region (366 amino acids in the case of the FSH-R) that is the predominant site of hormone binding (1Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Christophe S. Robert P. Maugain S. Bellet D. Koman A. Bidart J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is required for signal transduction. The binding of FSH to its receptor results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase through heterotrimeric G proteins. Interaction of the activated FSH-R with Gs initiates the cAMP signaling cascade (3Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ability of the FSH-R to activate adenylyl cyclase was exploited to generate a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) FSH-R reporter cell line (4Albanese C. Cristin-Maitre S. Sluss P.M. Crowley W.F. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5George S.E. Bungay P.J. Naylor L.H. Biochem.

Screening of a collection of diverse chemotypes led to the identification of compounds that activated this reporter cell line but were inactive on CHO cells lacking the human FSH-R. The activity of these compounds on receptor chimeras, which contained only a small portion (TM1 through TM3) of the FSH-R, suggests action through a site distinct from the large N-terminal extracellular domain, the region reported to be the predominant site of hormone binding (1Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Christophe S. Robert P. Maugain S. Bellet D. Koman A. Bidart J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reported effects of FSH and FSH-R defects provide evidence for the importance of this glycoprotein hormone and its receptor on female fertility. Mutations in FSH-R have been linked to clinical cases of infertility. Nonfunctional FSH-Rs have been found to cause resistant ovary syndrome, which results in infertility in women (7Aittomaki K. Lucena J.L.D. Pakarinen P. Sistonen P. Tapanainen J. Gromoll J. Kaskikari R. Sankila E.M. Lehvaslaiho H. Engel A.R. Nieschlag E. Huhtaniemi L. de la Chapelle A. Cell. 1995; 82: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The FSH-β gene knock-out female mouse is infertile because of inhibition of folliculogenesis prior to antral follicle formation (8Kumar T.R. Wang Y. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In addition, FSH-R gene knock-out female mice are also infertile because of arrested folliculogenesis (9Dierich A. Sairam M.R. Monaco L. Fimia G.M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In males, FSH regulates the function of testicular Sertoli cells. However, the importance of FSH in male fecundity is less clearcut, as clinical reports of mutations to either FSH or its receptor describe reduced fertility but not complete sterilization. Human menopausal gonadotropin, a 1:1 mixture of FSH and luteinizing hormone, has been used successfully clinically to induce ovarian stimulation in both in vivo and in vitro fertilization therapy. Human menopausal gonadotropin is purified from the urine of postmenopausal women and must be administered by injection. Recombinant human FSH has recently become available for parenteral human therapy. Treatment typically involves multiple injections, which can have a negative impact on patient compliance and initiation of this course of treatment. Consequently, patients being treated for infertility may prefer an orally administered small molecule that mimics the activity of FSH. Therefore, we have set out to identify nonpeptide synthetic agonists to the hFSH-R for potential use in novel infertility treatments. A class of thiazolidinone agonists was identified through unbiased combinatorial chemistry library screening. Additional optimization through analog library screening and parallel synthesis led to the development of a potent FSH-R-selective and -dependent agonist with full efficacy to FSH. The thiazolidinone agonists appear to activate the FSH-R through an allosteric mechanism, which was determined by the use of human FSH-R/TSH-R chimeras. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K-1 cells were used to engineer a clonal cell line that stably expresses the human FSH-R. cDNA for the human FSH-R was cloned into the α+12CA5-KH expression vector as described (10Koller K.J. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Ries T. Aguilar B. Chernov-Rogan T. Davis A.M. Dobbs A. Yen M. Barrett R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and transfected into CHO-K1 cells by electroporation. After G418 selection, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 12CA5 antibody, and those expressing the FSH-R were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Individual clones were examined for the ability to produce cAMP in response to purified human FSH (Cortex Biochem). Clone 3D2 was identified as a stable clone that responded to purified human FSH with an increase in cAMP production. In addition, the cloned human FSH-R gene was transfected along with a 6XCRE-luciferase plasmid (11McDonnell J. Latif M.L. Rees E.S. Bevan N.J. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) into CHO K-1 cells by electroporation. Following G418 selection, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 12CA5 antibody, and those expressing the FSH-R were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Clone 1D7 was identified as a stable clone giving a robust luciferase reporter gene response to human FSH. Reporter cell lines expressing each of the chimeric receptors described below were generated in the same manner as for the CHO FSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase cell line. A mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (Y1 cells) purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was engineered to stably express the full-length human FSHR cDNA (provided by Dr. Kerry Koller) as described previously (12Arey B.J. Deecher D.C. Shen E.S. Stevis P.E. Meade E.H. Jr-Wrobel J. Frail D.E. Lopez F.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3822-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The FSH-R α+T8-12CA5-KH plasmid construct was available from previous work (10Koller K.J. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Ries T. Aguilar B. Chernov-Rogan T. Davis A.M. Dobbs A. Yen M. Barrett R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TSH-R was amplified by PCR from cDNA made from a human thyroid gland poly(A)+ RNA library (Clontech) using oligonucleotide primers generated from the GenBank™ sequence M32215, and cloned into the α+T8-12CA5-KH plasmid at the XhoI and NotI restriction sites. The correct sequence was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Chimeric constructs were made combining the FSH-R and TSH-R. Oligomers were designed to engineer restriction sites into the most highly conserved regions of the first and second transmembrane regions of each receptor. No new amino acid codons were added when the restriction sites were inserted. TSH-R/FSH-R Chimera—The construct contained the TSH-R from amino acids 1-407 and the FSH-R from amino acids 360-678 of the respective mature proteins. NheI sites were added at amino acids 405-407 for the TSH-R(LLA)/FSH-R amino acids 357-359(ILA). FSH-R/TSH-R Chimera—The construct contained the FSH-R from amino acids 1-356 and the TSH-R from amino acids 405-743 of the respective mature proteins. NheI sites were added at amino acids 435-437 for the FSH-R(LLA)/TSH-R amino acids 405-407(ASE). F/T II Chimera—The construct contained the FSH-R from amino acids 1-437 and the TSH-R from amino acids 486-743 of the respective mature proteins. NheI sites were added at amino acids 435-437 for the FSH-R(ASE)/TSH-R amino acids 482-485(ASE). F/T III Chimera—The construct contained the TSH-R from amino acids 1-407, the FSH-R from amino acids 357-442, and then the TSH-R from amino acids 490-743. The same NheI site as in FSH-R/TSH-R was used, and HpaI sites were added at amino acids 442-444 of the FSH-R(TLT)/TSH-R amino acids 490-492(TLT). Cells were placed at 100,000/well into a 96-well black-bottom microtiter plate (Packard) in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) without phenol red. Human FSH, human TSH (Cortex Biochem), or thiazolidinone compounds were added in DMEM/F12 without phenol red, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. After 4 h, an equal volume of LucLite reagent (Packard) was added, and the plate was counted in a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard). CHO cells transfected with the human FSH receptor were placed at 100,000/well into a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. After washing with DMEM/F12, cells were challenged with compounds for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μl DMEM/F12 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. At the end of the challenge period, the assay was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2 n HCl. The media were removed and subsequently assayed for cAMP by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences, RPA542). Compounds were prepared using either Fmoc-aminoethyl-photolinker NovaSyn® TG resin (Novabiochem) or ArgoGel®-Rink-Fmoc resin (Argonaut Technologies) following standard protocols (13Holmes C.P. Chinn J.P. Look G.C. Gordon E.M. Gallop M.A. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 7328-7333Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Products were cleaved from resin by photolysis (λ = 365 nm) or by treatment with TFA/CH2Cl2, as described previously and depicted in synthetic Scheme 1, and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The production of estradiol by primary rat granulosa cells and progesterone by Y1/5E5/s3 cells after treatment with purified human FSH or test compounds was determined as described previously (12Arey B.J. Deecher D.C. Shen E.S. Stevis P.E. Meade E.H. Jr-Wrobel J. Frail D.E. Lopez F.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3822-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Screening Combinatorial Small Molecule Libraries for FSH-R Agonists Using a Reporter Gene Assay—Extensive screening of combinatorial small molecule libraries for compounds that would displace the binding of [125I]FSH to the human FSH-R was unsuccessful. To screen directly for small molecule activators of the FSH receptor, we employed a reporter gene assay (4Albanese C. Cristin-Maitre S. Sluss P.M. Crowley W.F. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 101: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5George S.E. Bungay P.J. Naylor L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6George S.E. Bungay P.J. Naylor L.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1278-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in which the firefly luciferase gene was placed downstream of a series of cyclic-AMP response elements (CRE) to screen for compounds that activate adenylyl cyclase (3Johnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the CHO FSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase cell line, 1D7, responded in a dose-dependent manner to challenge with human FSH. Maximal efficacy for human FSH in this assay was ∼10-fold greater than control cells. The EC50 for human FSH in this bioaasay was ∼110 pm (Fig. 1A). We utilized this FSH-R luciferase reporter assay to screen a collection of small molecule combinatorial libraries representing more than 20 core scaffolds created using solid-phase chemical synthesis methodologies (14Gordon E.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Gordon E.M. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Fodor S.P. Gallop M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1385-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Libraries were typically prepared by split synthesis on TentaGel® resin equipped with a photocleavable linker (16Holmes C.P. Jones D.G. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 2318-2319Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and compounds were screened in pools containing 10-36 compounds at an estimated concentration of 1-5 μm/compound. More than 120,000 compounds were initially tested for agonist activity using the CHO FSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase reporter cell line. Activity was detected upon screening of ACL1547, a 960-member thiazolidin-4-one library (Fig. 1B). Individual compounds from active pools were resynthesized, purified, and tested in the CHO FSH-R reporter assay. Two compounds, 1 and 2 (Fig. 1D), were found to activate the luciferase reporter gene but exhibited low potency (EC50 ∼ 20 μm) (Fig. 1C). Potency Optimization through Analog Libraries—One of the advantages of obtaining leads through a combinatorial library approach is that focused analog libraries can be rapidly generated in a search for compounds with improved properties. To rapidly identify more potent compounds, an encoded analog library (ACL1876) was generated using the same thiazolidinone scaffold employed in ACL1547, with 35 amino acids at the R1 position, 35 aldehydes at the R2 position, and 35 amines at the R3 position (17MacLean D. Holden F. Davis A.M. Scheuerman R.A. Yanofsky S. Holmes C.P. Fitch W.L. Tsutsui K. Barrett R.W. Gallop M.A. J. Comb. Chem. 2004; 6: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The R1 and R2 positions were fully encoded using secondary amine tags (18Ni Z.J. Maclean D. Holmes C.P. Murphy M.M. Ruhland B. Jacobs J.W. Gordon E.M. Gallop M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the R3 pools were kept separate for screening purposes. The compounds were synthesized on 130-μm TentaGel resin bearing a photocleavable linker. This library of 42,875 compounds was screened as 35 pools containing 1,225 compounds each, at 30 beads/well (an estimated concentration of 800 nm/compound). Most of the pools lacked activity; however, one pool containing 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine at the amine position showed significant levels of activity. Single beads from this pool were distributed into separate wells, and the compounds were released by photolysis and tested for activity using the CHO FSH-R reporter assay. Beads from active wells were collected, and their tags were decoded to determine the structure of the active compounds. Two of these (compounds 3 and 4) were synthesized as pure compounds for further investigation (Table 1). Thiazolidinones 3 and 4 were found to act as full agonists in the reporter assay with potencies significantly greater than the initial lead compounds (EC50 values of 300 and 30 nm, respectively) but possessing an efficacy equivalent to that of hFSH (Fig. 2). Finally, parallel synthesis was used to generate additional analogs, resulting in identification of compounds 5 (EC50 = 2 nm), 6 (EC50 = 6 nm), and 7 (EC50 = 1 nm) as highly potent agonists in the reporter assay (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Potent thiazolidin-4-one FSH agonists identified from combinatorial analog libraries based on compounds 1 and 2 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Response of CHO FSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase clone 1D7 to human FSH and small molecule agonists.

Compound 5 elevated cAMP levels with an EC50 ∼ 2 nm (data not shown). Both compounds 4 and 5 (at up to 100 μm concentration) failed to elevate cAMP levels or stimulate luciferase production in a number of control cell lines, including untransfected CHO cells and CRE-based reporter CHO cells expressing the calcitonin receptor, glucagon receptor, or the homologous human TSH receptor (data not shown). To ascertain whether thiazolidinone 5 was an agonist of the rat FSH-R, compound 5 was tested for its ability to activate the native FSH-R found in primary cultures of rat ovarian granulosa cells (19Hsueh A.J. Bicsak T.A. Jia X.C. Dahl K.D. Fauser B.C. Galway A.B. Czekala N. Pavlou S.N. Papkoff H. Keene J. Boime A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1989; 45: 209-277PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arey B.J. Stevis P.E. Deecher D.C. Shen E.S. Frail D.E. Negro-Vilar A. Lopez F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 517-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells produce an FSH-dependent increase in estradiol production. Compound 5 was a full agonist, with an EC50 of 10.5 nm in this in vitro assay (Fig. 3A). Compound 5 also produced FSH-like responses in a mouse adrenal Y1 cell line transfected with the human FSH-R. This cell line produced a dose-dependent increase in progesterone upon stimulation with FSH resulting in an EC50 of 992 pm (Fig. 3B). Compound 5 was less potent (EC50 = 998 nm) but had an efficacy comparable to purified human FSH in stimulating progesterone production via the recombinant human FSH-R. Neither purified human FSH nor compound 5 stimulated progesterone production on parental Y1 cells (data not shown). Stereoselectivity of FSH Mimetic Compounds—Racemic mercaptosuccinic acid was used in the solid-phase synthesis of thiazolidin-4-ones in the initial library and in subsequent focused chemistry that resulted in formation of four isomers of each compound. The cis and trans racemates could be separated by reversed-phased HPLC. Compounds 3, 4, and 5 are each a racemic pair of cis enantiomers. The corresponding racemic trans isomers of these three compounds were tested in the reporter assay and found to be at least 100-fold less active. Results from subsequent studies in which the pair of cis enantiomers was resolved by chiral HPLC or where the individual cis enantiomers were synthesized using optically active mercaptosuccinic acid indicated that the isomer having the 2S,5R configuration was exclusively responsible for the FSH-mimetic activity. Thus, interaction of this compound class with the FSH-R appears to exhibit exquisite stereoselectivity. Mapping Site of Action Using FSH-R/TSH-R Chimeras—The generation and characterization of chimeric receptors is a convenient way to identify the functional activity of specific domains. Glycoprotein hormone receptor chimeras have been used to map the regions responsible for ligand binding and signaling (21Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Wong R. Dias J.A. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15532-15540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Commun. 1990; 173: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To map the site of action of the thiazolidinone compounds on the human FSH-R, we constructed chimeric receptors using the human TSH-R. This glycoprotein hormone receptor possesses 39% homology to the human FSH-R in the N-terminal extracellular domain and 68% homology over the 7-transmembrane-spanning portion (24Vassart G. Parmentier M. Libert F. Dumont J.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 2: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extracellular domain of the human FSH-R was fused to the remainder of the human TSH-R to generate a FSH-R/TSH-R chimera (Fig. 4, upper left), and the N-terminal domain of the TSH-R was swapped onto the human FSH-R to generate a TSH-R/FSH-R chimera (Fig. 4, upper right). CHO 6XCRE-luciferase reporter cell lines were generated expressing each of these chimeric receptors. The parent cell line, CHO FSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase clone 1C2, responded to FSH with an EC50 of 110 pm but did not respond at all to TSH at concentrations ranging from 1 nm up to 10 μm. In the presence of compound 6, this cell line gave a maximal response equivalent to that produced by FSH, with an EC50 of 2.7 nm (Table 2). The CHO FSH-R/TSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase clone 2B6 responded to FSH with an EC50 of 200 pm (Table 2). Thus, the high affinity response of the FSH-R to FSH appears to require only the N-terminal ligand binding domain, as reported by others (30Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15970-15973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A.

In these experiments, CHO FSH-R/TSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase clone 2B6 did respond to TSH with an EC50 of 310 nm; however, this cell line did not respond at all to compound 6 at concentrations up to 10 μm (Table 2).TABLE 2Activity of FSH, TSH, and thiazolidinone compounds on CHO cell lines expressing chimeric receptors Chimeric receptors were constructed from cDNA sequences for the human FSH-R and human TSH-R, and CHO 6XCRE-luciferase reporter cell lines were generated expressing each of these chimeric receptors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were incubated in 96-well plates with purified human FSH, purified human TSH, or thiazolidinone compounds for 4 h at 37 °C, and luciferase activity was measured using LucLite (Packard) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ND, not determined.ReceptorLigand (EC50)FSHTSHCompound 6Compound 7FSH-R140 pm>1 μm3 nm1 nmFSH-R/TSH-R200 pm310 nm>10 μmNDTSH-R/FSH-RND24 nm200 nm76 nmF/T II50 pm>1 μm87 nmNDF/T IIIND280 nm610 nm62 nm Open table in a new tab CHO TSH-R/FSH-R 6XCRE-luciferase clone 3E7 responded to TSH with an EC50 of 24 nm (Table 2). These cells responded to thiazolidinone 6 with an EC50 of 200 nm (Table 2) and to thiazolidinone 7 with an EC50 of 76 nm. Thus, this cell line, which completely lacks the N-terminal FSH-binding domain, is able to respond to thiazolidinones 6 and 7. To further define the site of action of compound 6, the chimeric receptor F/T II was generated. This construct contains FSH-R sequences through the first extracellular loop (N-terminal domain, first two transmembranes (TMs), first intracellular loop, and first extracellular loop), with the remainder of the receptor being TSH-R (Fig. 4, lower left). CHO F/T II clone 2G7 responded to FSH with an EC50 of 50 pm and responded to TSH only at concentrations above 200 nm, while responding to compound 6 with an EC50 of 87 nm (Table 2). Thus, it appears that the FSH sequences contained in the F/T II chimera are sufficient to confer high affinity binding of FSH and the thiazolidinone compound tested. Finally, the receptor chimera F/T III was constructed, in which the N-terminal FSH-R domain from F/T II was replaced with the N-terminal domain of the human TSH-R (Fig. 4, lower right). F/T III contains only FSH-R sequences corresponding to TM1, the first intracellular loop, TM2, and the first extracellular loop. CHO FTIII 6XCRE-luciferase clone 1C9 cells did not respond to FSH at concentrations tested up to 100 nm. However, these cells responded to TSH with an EC50 of 280 nm, and they responded to compound 5 with an EC50 of 610 nm and to compound 7 with an EC50 of 62 nm (Table 2). These thiazolidinone agonists appeared to activate FSH-R by interacting in an allosteric region (TM1 through the first extracellular loop) separate from the N-terminal domain. The GPCR family of cell surface receptors is estimated to contain up to 1000 members. A large percentage of the current pharmacopia is comprised of compounds that interact with specific GPCRs. Thus, it is widely believed that existing and newly discovered members of this family represent attractive targets for future drugs. Historically, competitive radioligand binding assays have been utilized for high throughput screening for antagonists and agonists of GPCRs. Our search for a small, orally available mimic of FSH action began by screening for compounds that would competitively block the binding of radiolabeled FSH to CHO cells expressing the FSH receptor. Using membranes prepared from CHO FSH-R cells and a scintillation proximity assay format, we screened combinatorial small molecule libraries representing a total of 130,000 compounds at an estimated concentration of 1-5 μm/compound. We were unable to find any compounds that showed reproducible inhibition of FSH binding. Clearly, the identification of a small molecule that can block the interaction between a large protein and its cell surface receptor presents a challenge. Much effort has been expended within the pharmaceutical industry in the search for small molecule antagonists of various growth factor receptors with little success, although a small molecule FSH-R antagonist was discovered using a radioligand binding assay (12Arey B.J.

However, by screening directly for compounds with agonist activity, small molecule activators have been identified for the insulin receptor (25Zhang B. Salituro G. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Zhang Y. Royo I. Vilella D. Diez M.T. Pelaez F. Ruby C. Kendall R.L. Mao X. Griffin P. Calaycay J. Zierath J.R. Heck J.V. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Science. 1999; 284: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and the granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor (26Tian S.S. Lamb P. King A.G. Miller S.G. Kessler L.

Using a cell-based method similar to our approach, small molecule FSH-R agonists have been identified (27Guo T. Adang A.E. Dolle R.E. Dong G. Fitzpatrick D. Geng P. Ho K.K. Kultgen S.G. Liu R. McDonald E. McGuinness B.F. Saionz K.W. Valenzano K.J. van Straten N.C. Xie D. Webb M.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Guo T. Adang A.E.

Lett. 2004; 14: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These compounds activate a CHO FSH-R reporter cell line and induce cAMP activity; however, their site of action remains unknown. We constructed a reporter cell line expressing the FSH-R and the luciferase gene under a cAMP-responsive 6XCRE-based control element and established a high throughput reporter assay for compounds that would act as FSH agonists. Using this assay, we screened over 78,000 molecules in pools of 10-36/well from our collection of combinatorial small molecule libraries. The lead thiazolidinone compounds, 1 and 2, showed activity in the 20-50 μm range using the FSH-R reporter assay. With the use of combinatorial analoguing efforts we rapidly identified potent analogs with activity in the low nanomolar range. To address the mechanism of action of these novel FSH agonists, we tested for their ability to compete with the binding of radiolabeled FSH to both cells expressing the FSH-R and to membranes prepared from such cells; the compounds were unable to block the binding of 125I-labeled FSH. An obvious question that we posed is: What is the mechanism of activation of the FSH-R by the thiazolidinone compounds? The response is specific and stereoselective, requires the presence of the FSH-R, and occurs in the absence of FSH. However, a number of mechanisms can be postulated. FSH is known to bind with high affinity to the large extracellular domain on the FSH-R (1Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Christophe S. Robert P. Maugain S. Bellet D. Koman A. Bidart J.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, high affinity binding and signaling appear to involve separate domains on the FSH-R (29Sohn J. Ryu K. Sievert G.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2648-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Allosteric modulators have also been reported for a number of 7-transmembrane GPCRs (32May L.T. Christopoulos A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Christopoulos A. Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 323-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 34Arey B.J. Seethala R. Ma Z. Fura A. Morin J. Swartz J. Vyas V. Yang W. Dickson J.K. Jr-Feyen J.H. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2015-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and have been proposed as possible for glycoprotein hormone receptors on the basis of a reported separation of sites necessary for ligand binding and signal transduction. Recently, the crystal structure of human FSH bound to the extracellular portion of the FSH-R has been reported, along with data indicating that the active receptor complex exists as a dimer (35Fan Q.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for FSH stimulation of its receptor invokes high affinity binding to this N-terminal domain followed by receptor activation via interaction of the tethered FSH with the extracellular face of the 7-transmembrane core of the receptor similar to that proposed for proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) (36Lerner D.J. Chen M. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13943-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A model for glycoprotein hormone activation has been proposed in which ligands bind with high affinity to the N-terminal extracellular domain and convert the extracellular domain from an inverse agonist into a full agonist, activating the transmembrane-spanning portion of the receptor (37Chappel S. Buckler D. Kelton C. Tayar N.E. Hum. Reprod. (Oxf.). 1998; (June 13, 1998), and 47-51: 18-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The thiazolidinone compounds could interact with the same site on the core of the receptor to promote such a conformational change in the receptor. If this proposed mechanism is accurate, it suggests the possibility that small molecule analogs could be generated that bind to the same site but lack the ability to activate the receptor, leading to effective antagonism. Such small molecule FSH antagonists could be effective oral contraceptives and useful for other therapies requiring hormonal modulation. Alternatively, the thiazolidinone compounds could bind to an unrelated site on the FSH-R to cause an allosteric change in receptor conformation or the direct recruitment of G protein. If any of these mechanisms of drug action can be applied generally to other members of the GPCR family, it suggests that the screening of diverse collections of small molecules using cellular functional assays may be a very productive means of identifying new drug candidates. FSH-R/TSH-R chimeras were generated to identify the regions responsible for FSH agonist receptor activation and signaling described herein. The results with the FSH-R/TSH-R and TSH-R/FSH-R chimera-expressing cell lines clearly show that whereas response to the hormones maps with the N-terminal extracellular domain, response to the thiazolidinone compounds maps with the transmembrane-spanning portion of the receptor. Activity on the F/T II chimera-expressing cell line shows responsiveness to FSH (as it contains the FSH-R N-terminal domain) and response to thiazolidinone compounds. By then swapping the N-terminal domains in the generation of F/T III, we were able to show that only a small portion of the FSH-R is required for thiazolidione action. This region, spanning TM1 through TM3, is sufficient to elicit a response to the thiazolidinone compounds. Further definition of the site of action of these compounds would be helpful to determine whether the compounds are acting on the first extracellular loop or with one of the transmembrane-spanning regions. This study represents the first reported small molecule high affinity agonist of the important class of 7-TM glycoprotein hormone receptors that appears to function through a novel allosteric mechanism. The small molecule FSH receptor agonists described here are a significant achievement toward the development of an oral alternative to the current injectable FSH treatments for clinical use to induce ovarian stimulation for both in vivo and in vitro fertilization therapy. In addition, the allosteric mechanism by which these agonists act may remedy the infertility that is attributable to FSH-R mutations in the N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain."

Binding of the 5′ -terminal cap structure of mRNA to eIF4E is a critical event during this process. Mammalian eIF4E is phosphorylated at Ser-209 by Mnk1 and Mnk2 kinases. We investigated the interaction of both eIF4E and phosphorylated eIF4E (eIF4E(P)) with cap analogs and capped oligoribonucleotides by stopped-flow kinetics. For m7GpppG, the rate constant of association, kon, was dependent on ionic strength, decreasing progressively up to 350 mm KCl, but the rate constant of dissociation, koff, was independent of ionic strength. Phosphorylation of eIF4E decreased kon by 2.1-2.3-fold at 50-100 mm KCl but had progressively less effect at higher ionic strengths, being negligible at 350 mm. Contrary to published evidence, eIF4E phosphorylation had no effect on koff. Several observations supported a simple one-step binding mechanism, in contrast to published reports of a two-step mechanism. The kinetic function that best fit the data changed from single- to double-exponential as the eIF4E concentration was increased. However, measuring koff for dissociation of a pre-formed eIF4E·m7GpppG complex suggested that the double-exponential kinetics were caused by dissociation of eIF4E dimers, not a two-step mechanism. Addition of a 12-nucleotide chain to the cap structure increased affinity at high ionic strength for both eIF4E (24-fold) and eIF4E(P) (7-fold), primarily due to a decrease in koff. This suggests that additional stabilizing interactions between capped oligoribonucleotides and eIF4E, which do not occur with cap analogs alone, act to slow dissociation.

The efficiency of mRNA translational initiation is strongly enhanced by the 5′-terminal cap, m7GpppN (1Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. Annu. Rev.

The complex of full-length human eIF4E with m7GpppA is bell-shaped, with the cap analog situated in a deep slot in the concave surface of the protein. The cap-binding pocket consists of separate recognition components for the m7G base, the triphosphate moiety, and the second nucleoside residue. The alkylated base is stacked between Trp-56 and Trp-102. (Amino acid numbers refer to the human sequence (14Rychlik W. Domier L.L. Gardner P.R. Hellmann G.M. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trp-56 also interacts directly with the ribose moiety, and Arg-157 and Lys-162 interact directly with the α- and β-phosphate oxygen atoms. The second nucleoside moiety of m7GpppA is fixed by the flexible C-terminal loop. To date, there have been no structures reported for eIF4E in complex with capped mRNA or even short oligoribonucleotides.Cap analogs bind to eIF4E in a tight complex, a step that has been studied primarily by equilibrium techniques (15McCubbin W.D.

The opposite conclusion, that eIF4E phosphorylation does not affect the rate of protein synthesis, or even decreases it, has been drawn from studies with Mnk overexpression (51Knauf U. Tschopp C.

Transgenic Drosophila that express a non-phophorylatable form of eIF4E are small, have morphological defects, and are less viable (56Lachance P.E.D. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homolog of Mnk, Lk6, is dispensable under a high protein diet, but its loss causes growth reduction when amino acids in the diet are restricted (57Arquier N. Bourouis M. Colombani J. Leopold P. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 19-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 58Reiling J. Doepfner K. Hafen E. Stocker H. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 24-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yet when Mnk1 and Mnk2 are knocked out in mice, no phenotype is observed (59Ueda T. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6539-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Thus, at the levels of protein synthesis, cell growth, and intact animal physiology, the roles of Mnk and eIF4E phosphorylation are controversial.The current study was motivated by several gaps in our understanding of eIF4E-cap interactions as well as discrepancies in the published literature. First, protein synthesis is a dynamic process and, during each round of initiation, the mRNA cap is presumably both bound and released by eIF4E. A full understanding of the biochemical consequences of eIF4E phosphorylation therefore requires a knowledge of kon and koff values for both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated eIF4E (eIF4E and eIF4E(P)). Second, it is not known whether the discrepancies in kinetic values noted above (35Blachut-Okrasinska E. Bojarska E. Niedzwiecka A. Chlebicka L. Darzynkiewicz E. Stolarski R. Stepinski J.

Third, the kon for eIF4E(P)-cap analog association has not yet been measured directly. Fourth, kinetic parameters measured by the stopped-flow technique have not been reported for the binding of capped oligoribonucleotides to eIF4E. Fifth, all previous studies of eIF4E interactions with capped oligonucleotides (20Carberry S.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4542-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Carberry S.E.

Sixth and finally, the proposed two-step mechanism for cap binding to eIF4E (26Niedzwiecka A. Marcotrigiano J. Stepinski J. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Dadlez M. Gingras A.-C. Mak P.

Our findings differ from those of previous reports with regard to the magnitude of kinetic constants, the effects of eIF4E phosphorylation on kon and koff, and the mechanism of cap binding. With regard to the latter, our data support a one-step rather than two-step binding model. Furthermore, the stopped-flow results provide a kinetic basis for enhanced binding of eIF4E to capped oligoribonucleotides compared with cap analogs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All common reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. m7GTP, m7GTP-Sepharose 4B, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Diagnostics. The syntheses of m7GpppG and m27,3′-OGpppG were performed as described previously (63Stepinski J. Waddell C. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. RNA (N.Y.). 2001; 7: 1486-1495PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of dinucleotide cap analog solutions were determined by absorbance (ϵ255 nm = 22.6 × 103 m-1 cm-1 at pH 7.0).eIF4E Expression and Purification—Full-length wild-type human eIF4E (14Rychlik W. Domier L.L. Gardner P.R. Hellmann G.M. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 15 °C. We found that these conditions (lowering the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside concentration and temperature) increased the yield of soluble eIF4E compared with the published procedure (64Stern B.D. Wilson M. Jagus R. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and produced 7-10 mg/liter of cell suspension. Cells (3 g) were lysed with a French press in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% streptomycin sulfate, and protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 32,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, the soluble fraction was diluted 1:1 with 100 μm GTP and loaded onto a 3-ml m7GTP-Sepharose column. This and other chromatographic steps were monitored spectrophotometrically at λ280 nm. The column was washed with 40 column volumes of buffer B (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). eIF4E was eluted with buffer B except that the KCl concentration was 0.5 m KCl. Use of KCl for elution rather than the more traditional m7GTP (65Webb N.R. Chari R.V.J. DePillis G. Kozarich J.W. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) prevents formation of tight eIF4E complexes with the cap analog (66von der Haar T. Ball P.D. McCarthy E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30551-30555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which can affect the measurement of kinetic parameters for the binding reaction. eIF4E was at least 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (see “Results”). For eIF4E purification from E. coli cells and Mnk purification from HEK 293 cells, protein concentrations were determined with the protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad, in which bovine serum albumin was used as standard. For kinetic experiments, protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, assuming ϵ280 nm = 53,400 m-1 cm-1 at pH 7.2.eIF4E Phosphorylation—Recombinant mouse Mnk kinase was produced as described previously (42Scheper G.C. Morrice N.A. Kleijn M. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) but with modifications. Plasmids pEBG-Mnk2 and pEBG-Mnk1T2A2 were generously provided by Christopher Proud (University of British Columbia). These encode, respectively, wild-type Mnk2 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST::Mnk2) and an inactive variant, GST::Mnk1T2A2 (41Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells, grown in 10-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were transfected with plasmids in complex with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 44 h, cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C by incubation with buffer C (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) at a ratio of cell pellet to buffer C of 1:8 (w/v) over 30 min with rotation. The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and GST::Mnk2 was purified from the supernatant on glutathione-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5% glycerol) at a supernatant:Sepharose ratio of 10:3 (v/v). Glutathione-Sepharose beads with bound GST::Mnk2 and GST::Mnk1T2A2 were stored at -80 °C.Recombinant eIF4E was phosphorylated in vitro essentially as described (37Scheper G.C. van Kollenburg B. Hu J. Luo I. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) but with some modifications. Recombinant eIF4E (225 μg) was incubated at room temperature (23 °C) in a 0.5-ml reaction mixture containing 150 μl (packed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST::Mnk2 and 500 μm ATP in buffer D for 6 h with rotation. The kinase was removed by centrifugation, and then eIF4E(P) was passed over a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) to separate it from ATP and to transfer it into an appropriate buffer for kinetic experiments. In parallel experiments, eIF4E was mock-phosphorylated with GST::Mnk1T2A2. The efficiency of eIF4E phosphorylation was determined by isoelectric focusing on CleanGel IEF polyacrylamide gels (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 8 m urea, 30 mm CHAPS, and 2% Pharmalyte 3-10 according to the manufacturer's instructions. IEF was conducted at 15 °C on a Multiphor II apparatus for horizontal separation equipped with a cooling platform and MultiDrive XL power supply (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue. In preliminary experiments to determine the optimal time for enzymatic phosphorylation, we also used [γ-32P]ATP.Synthesis of Oligoribonucleotides—T7 RNA polymerase was prepared as previously described (67Zawadzki V. Gross H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The template consisted of two complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technology Inc., Coralville, IA), 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTTATGCGCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′, which contain the T7 promoter followed by a single-stranded 12-nucleotide 5′-overhang. This sequence was chosen because it gave the highest yield of several tested (68Milligan J. Groebe D. Witherell G. Uhlenbeck O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotides, each at 183 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were annealed by heating at 90 °C and slow cooling to room temperature. Transcription reactions were performed as described previously ("
https://openalex.org/W2120010534,"Congential disorder of glycosylation type 1a (CDG-1a) is a congenital disease characterized by severe defects in nervous system development. It is caused by mutations in α-phosphomannomutase (of which there are two isozymes, α-PMM1 and α-PPM2). Here we report the x-ray crystal structures of human α-PMM1 in the open conformation, with and without the bound substrate, α-d-mannose 1-phosphate. α-PMM1, like most haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) members, consists of two domains, the cap and core, which open to bind substrate and then close to provide a solvent-exclusive environment for catalysis. The substrate phosphate group is observed at a positively charged site of the cap domain, rather than at the core domain phosphoryl-transfer site defined by the Asp19 nucleophile and Mg2+ cofactor. This suggests that substrate binds first to the cap and then is swept into the active site upon cap closure. The orientation of the acid/base residue Asp21 suggests that α-phosphomannomutase (α-PMM) uses a different method of protecting the aspartylphosphate from hydrolysis than the HADSF member β-phosphoglucomutase. It is hypothesized that the electrostatic repulsion of positive charges at the interface of the cap and core domains stabilizes α-PMM1 in the open conformation and that the negatively charged substrate binds to the cap, thereby facilitating its closure over the core domain. The two isozymes, α-PMM1 and α-PMM2, are shown to have a conserved active-site structure and to display similar kinetic properties.

The most common CDG, congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1a (CDG-1a) (8Grunewald S. Matthijs G. Jaeken J. Pediatr. Res. 2002; 52: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), manifests in infancy with physical and developmental abnormalities. Numerous clinical genotypes have been identified, with the range of phenotypes extending from mild to severe (9Neumann L.M. von Moers A. Kunze J. Blankenstein O. Marquardt T. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The most common mutant, R141H (40% of disease alleles of CDG-1a patients), has a high carrier frequency of 1/70 in the general population. Individuals homozygous for this mutation have not been identified, suggesting that this genotype is lethal (12Matthijs G. Schollen E. Van Schaftingen E. Cassiman J.J. Jaeken J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 542-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Human α-PMM, which catalyzes the conversion of d-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) to α-d-mannose 1-phosphate (α-Man-1-P) (see Fig. 1) is required for GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate-mannose biosynthesis. Two isoforms are found; PMM2 is expressed in all tissues, whereas expression of PPM1 (65% sequence identity with PMM2) is restricted to the brain and lungs (14Pirard M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Schollen E. Matthijs G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). α-PMM belongs to the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF), distinguishing it both structurally and mechanistically from the phosphomanno/phosphoglucomutase enzymes of the phosphohexomutase superfamily that are integral to glycolysis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (15Dai J.B. Liu Y. Ray Jr., W.J. Konno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6322-6337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to alginate biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria (16Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Within the HADSF, α-PMM is distinguished from the bacterial β-phosphoglucomutase (β-PGM) in its C(1) anomer specificity as well as in the position and fold of the cap domain which serves as a lid over the conserved catalytic core domain. In HADSF members, wherein phosphatases predominate, the conserved aspartate nucleophile of the core domain mediates the transfer of the phosphoryl group. Remarkably, the α-PMM and β-PGM evolved independently to arrive at an adaptation of the phosphatase scaffold, which allows the aspartylphosphate of the core domain to discriminate between solvent and the sugarphosphate substrate as the phosphoryl group acceptor. Herein we report the x-ray crystallographic structures of α-PMM1 in the Mg2+-bound form and in complex with the substrate of the reaction, α-Man-1-P. These structures are analyzed in the context of the coordinates for uncomplexed α-PMM2 deposited in the Protein Data Bank by the Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics (accession code 2AMY) to identify active-site residues with roles in binding and catalysis as well as residues involved in subunit dimerization. The structure and kinetic analyses of α-PMM1 and α-PMM2 provide for the first time insight into how quaternary structure, stability, and catalytic efficiency are altered in clinically important mutants. Materials—Except where indicated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Primers, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen. The Geneclean spin kit and the Qiaprep spin miniprep kit were from Qiagen. Host cells were purchased from Novagen. The Biolmol green phosphate assay kit was purchased from Biolmol Research Laboratories Inc. The α-mannose 1,6-bisphosphate used in the kinetic assays was prepared according to published procedure (13Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The cDNA encoding the α-PMM1 gene was purified from the host cells purchased from ATCC (ATCC 7483527). Oligonucleotide primers (5′-CGCGGACCTGCAGCCATGGCA, and 5′-ACACACAGATGTGGGATCCGGTCA), containing the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites NcoI and BamHI (underlined), were used to amplify the α-PMM1 open reading frame. The open reading frame of α-PMM2 was obtained from the Mammalian Genome Collection, Homo sapiens, and amplified using primers containing NdeI and a BamHI restriction sites (underlined) (5′-GAAACTGGGCATATGGCAGCGCCT-3′ and 5′-TGTGGGAGGATCCTCGGCTCT-3′). The α-PMM1 and α-PMM2 genes were cloned into pET-28b(+) or pET-23b(+) vectors (Stratagene), respectively. The ligation products (pET-28b(+)-pmm1 or pET-23b(+)-pmm2) were used to transform Escherichia coli JM109 competent cells. The purified plasmids were sequenced by the Tufts University Core Facility. α-PMM-1 was purified from E. coli Rosetta™ (DE3) cells containing the pET-28b(+)-pmm1 plasmid. Transformed cells (4L) were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth (or minimal medium containing selenomethionine) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and induced for 4 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet (11 g) was suspended in 100 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT). Cells were lysed by sonication (6 × 6 min at 50% power and 30% duty cycle) with a Branson sonifier 250 (VWR Scientific Inc.). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 60 min at 18,000 rpm (38,384 × g). The protein precipitated with 40-50% (NH4)2SO4 was harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (26,895 × g) for 15 min. Following dissolution in 25 ml of lysis buffer and dialysis against buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT) overnight, the protein was loaded onto a 100-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, and eluted with a 0.7-liter linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing α-PMM1 were combined and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 1 m. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (26,895 × g) for 5 min to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml butyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 1 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml 1 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A and then eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 1 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. α-PMM1 was concentrated and stored at -80 °C. The protein, shown to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE, was obtained in a yield of 2 mg of protein/g of cell paste. Selenomethionine-substituted α-PMM1 was expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus cells. The cells were grown in minimal medium prepared by mixing 200 ml of 20× M9(10gofNH4Cl, 30 g of KH2PO4,60g of Na2HPO4, 500 ml of H2O, pH 7.5), 20 ml of amino acid mix I (the 20 standard amino acids excluding Met, Tyr, Trp, and Phe, each at 4 mg/ml), 40 ml of amino acid mix II (Tyr, Trp, and Phe, each at 2 mg/ml in distilled/deionized H2O, pH 9.0), 1 ml of vitamin mixture (riboflavin, niacinamide, pyridoxine monohydrochloride, and thiamine, each at 1 mg/ml), 4 ml of 1 m MgSO4, 4 ml of 12.5 mg/ml FeSO4, 20 ml of 40% (w/w) glucose, and 4 ml of 10 mg/ml selenomethionine in a final volume of 2 liters. Chloramphenicol (16.5 mg/liter) and kanamycin (50 mg/liter) were added to the culture. The culture was grown at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until the A600 reached 0.8-1.1 (24 h), at which point α-PMM1 expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The cells were grown for an additional 10 h at 25 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The protein was purified using the procedure described above, except that the DTT concentration was increased to 10 mm, and 1 mm EDTA was added throughout. The purification of α-PMM2 was similar to that of α-PMM1 with a few modifications. The cell pellet from a 10-liter culture of E. coli Rosetta™ (DE3) cells (30 g) containing the pET-23b(+)-pmm2 plasmid was suspended in 300 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT). The cell lysate was loaded directly onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). The fractions containing α-PMM2 were pooled, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 15%. The fractions were then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer containing 15% (NH4)2SO4. The protein was eluted with a 600-ml 15% to 0% (NH4)2SO4 gradient. The fractions having α-PMM activity were pooled and concentrated, then dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT at 4 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of SeMet α-PMM1 were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method over well solution containing 15-18% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.15 m dl-malate, pH 7.0, 50 mm MgCL2, and 8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Drops were formed by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at 15-25 mg/ml with 2 μl of well solution. Crystals were transferred to paratone N and flash-cooled in a gaseous N2 stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Beamline X12C. α-PMM1 crystallized in space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 50.9 Å, c = 213.0 Å. The 0.7 × 0.3 × 0.3-mm crystal diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution. The ligand-bound structure was obtained by soaking SeMet α-PMM1 crystals for 1 h in mother liquor containing 100 mm α-d(+)-mannose 1-phosphate. All data sets were indexed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Model Refinement—Because structure determination by molecular replacement was unsuccessful, the structure was phased by the multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction method, using three 2.1 Å SeMet data sets. The selenium substructure was solved using BnP (18Weeks C.M. Blessing R.H. Miller R. Mungee R. Potter S.A. Rappleye J. Smith G.D. Xu H. Furey W. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 686-693Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which found three of the four selenium sites in the protein. The sites were confirmed by comparison with the anomalous difference Patterson map. The N-terminal methionine, along with the next 10 residues, was disordered. An initial model was built using RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and improved by manual rebuilding in the graphics suite COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22527) Google Scholar). This partial model was refined in the REFMAC5 (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) module of the CCP4 suite (22Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) using the Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients from BnP. Electron density maps calculated from the combined phases were of very high quality and permitted rapid rebuilding of the model. Iterative cycles of restrained refinement in REFMAC5 and rebuilding in COOT ultimately yielded a model containing 244 of 262 residues, 171 water molecules, and 2 Mg2+ ions. The quality of the model at this point was assessed by MOLPROBITY (23Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), and 235 residues (96.3%) were in the favored regions, 9 residues were in the additionally allowed regions, and no residues were in the disallowed regions. The ligand-bound structure was solved by Fourier difference methods using phases from the 2.1 Å SeMet native model. After rigid body refinement in REFMAC5 the electron density for Man-1-P was clearly defined. The Man-1-P was not modeled until the model reached an Rwork of 22.3% and an Rfree of 27.4%. After several more rounds of model building and refinement, the final α-PMM1·Man-1-P model was comprised of residues 13-258 of α-PMM1, 235 water molecules, two Mg2+ ions, and one molecule of Man-1-P.

The initial velocity of α-PMM catalyzed Glc-6-P formation from α-Glc-1-P was measured in the presence of 50 μm α-Glc-1,6-bisP, 0.2 mm NADP, and 5 units/ml Glc-6-P dehydrogenase by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6.2 mm-1 cm-1) resulting from the Glc-6-P dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction of NADP. The initial velocity of α-PMM-catalyzed Man-6-P formation from α-Man-1-P was measured in the presence of 50 μm α-Man-1,6-bisP (13Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), 5 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5 units/ml phosphomannose isomerase, 5 units/ml phosphoglucose isomerase by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (Δϵ = 6.2 mm-1 cm-1) resulting from the Glc-6-P dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of NADP. The kcat and Km values were determined from the initial velocity data using the equation V0 = Vm[A]/(Km + [A]), where [A] is the α-Glc-1-P or α-Man-1-P concentration, V0 is the initial velocity, Vm is the maximum velocity, and Km is the Michaelis constant. The kcat was calculated from the ratio of Vmax and the α-PMM concentration. Overall Structure—Recombinant human α-PMM1 was purified by conventional chromatographic techniques and crystallized from a solution of polyethylene glycol 3350, MgCl2, β-mercaptoethanol, and dl-malic acid at pH 7.0 for x-ray structure determination. Both the native and SeMet α-PMM1 crystallized in space group P43212 (unit cell dimensions a = b = 50.9 Å, c = 213.0 Å) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement using the structure of α-PMM2 (65% identical, Protein Data Bank accession code 2AMY, unpublished submission by the Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics) as the search model did yield a viable solution; however, the resulting model did not refine well, and several surface loops appeared to be disordered. To obtain experimental phases, the structure was determined using multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing of the selenomethionine-substituted protein. The final model contained 245 of 262 residues. The first 11 residues at the N terminus and the last 6 residues at the C terminus were disordered. The refined model of the Mg2+-bound form of α-PMM1 was used to phase the structure of α-PMM1 in complex with α-d-mannose 1-phosphate (α-PMM1·Man-1-P) obtained by soaking the Mg2+-bound crystals with α-Man-1-P. α-PMM1, like other HADSF phosphotransferases, is comprised of two domains, a core domain and a smaller cap domain (Fig. 2). The overall dimensions of the monomer are ∼63 × 31 × 42 Å. The core domain (residues 1-90 and 198-262) consists of a six-stranded parallel β-sheet (β1-β5 and β10-β11) flanked by five α-helices (α1-α2 and α7-α9) (Fig. 2B) with typical β-α-β connections. The cap domain (residues 95-194) is inserted between β5 and α7 of the core domain. The αββ(α)αββ topology of the cap domain, as well as its position in the primary sequence between motifs 2 and 3 (see Ref. 24Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar for review), place this enzyme in subclass IIb of the HADSF. The secondary structure elements are arranged to form a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β6-β7 and β8-β9) topped by three α-helices (α4-α6). Two flexible “hinge” regions comprising residues 91-94 and 195-197 connect the two domains. The hinge regions were identified using visual inspection of the structure together with the program FlexOracle (25Echols N. Milburn D. Gerstein M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In both structures reported herein, the cap domain is in an open conformation, with the active site exposed to solvent. The 29.7-kDa monomer forms a homodimer in solution as demonstrated by size-filtration chromatography. This dimer is observed in the crystal structure of α-PMM1, with the interface consisting exclusively of interactions between the cap domains (Fig. 3A). Two major interactions dominate the dimer interface: a helix-helix interaction between the first α-helices (α4) and an antiparallel β-sheet interaction between the first β-strands (β6) of the two cap domains. The interaction between the strands creates an extended eight-stranded β-sheet across the two monomers, holding the two core domains away from one another. Residues Leu105, Ile109, Leu113, Phe128, Ile129, and Phe131 form a hydrophobic core at the dimer interface. Several hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge anchor the interface at each end (Fig. 3B). The same oligomerization interface can be observed in the structure of human α-PMM2, demonstrating that this is a conserved feature of human α-PMMs. One of the more common deleterious mutations of α-PMM2, F119L (Phe128 in α-PMM1), is located in the center of the dimer interface (Fig. 3B), highlighting the potential importance of the quaternary structure for function and/or stability of the protein. Based on previous studies of catalytic cycling in other HADSF enzymes, it is known that the cap domain must dissociate from the core domain to allow substrate to bind, then associate to seal the active site from aqueous solvent (26Lu Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8684-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8351-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A portion of the cap domain that would contact the core domain in α-PMM carries a large number of positively charged residues (Figs. 4 and 5). These include the three conserved residues Arg150, Arg143, and Arg132 in α-PMM1 and Arg141, Arg134, and Arg123 in α-PMM2. One might expect that there would be complementary negatively charged residues on the surface of the core domain; however, the corresponding surface of the core retains an overall positive charge contributed by conserved residues Arg28 and Lys58 in α-PMM1 and Arg21 and Lys51 in α-PMM2. Thus, rather than acting as a “clasp” these two surfaces may act as an electrostatic wedge retaining the correct interdomain orientation. Indeed, the importance of these residues to protein function is highlighted by the fact that the mutation R141H (Arg150 in α-PMM1) has been identified as one of the major deleterious polymorphic mutations of α-PMM2.FIGURE 5The enzyme active site with Man-1-P (orange ball-and-stick) bound. A dot surface shows the overall charge of the cap and core domain surfaces at the Man-1-P-binding site. The image was rendered using CCP4MG (39Potterton E. McNicholas S. Krissinel E. Cowtan K.

By analogy to other HADSF phosphatases, the key active-site residues are the catalytic nucleophile Asp19, the putative acid/base residue Asp21 (contributed by motif 1), Ser54, which helps position the phosphoryl group (contributed by motif 2), the salt bridge residue Lys198 (contributed by motif 3), and the metal-binding residue Asp218 (contributed by motif 4). In both the native and α-PMM1·Man-1-P structures, the acid/base residue Asp21, stationed two residues upstream from the nucleophile (thus denoted the Asp-plus-2 residue), is held in position for proton transfer by a hydrogen bond to residue Gln62 contributed by α2, as has been noted previously for the corresponding residue in HADSF type IIA (28Tremblay L.W. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), type IIB (26Lu Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8684-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and type III (29Peisach E. Selengut J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12770-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) phosphatases. Because Asp21 is positioned to activate a water molecule as well as the C(6)OH of α-Man-1-P for attack at the aspartylphosphate, it is clear that a different mechanism for ensuring that phosphomutase activity predominates over phosphatase activity is operative in α-PMM than the substrate induced-fit mechanism, which is operative in β-PGM. In the case of β-PGM, the Asp general acid/base residue is pinned to the linker in the cap-open conformation and to the active site in the cap-closed conformation. The bound substrate and not a water molecule functions to stabilize the cap-closed conformation for catalytic turnover. Substrate Binding—The structure of α-PMM1 with α-d-mannose 1-phosphate bound identifies the active-site residues contributing to substrate specificity. Since this structure was obtained by soaking preformed crystals of α-PMM1 with Man-1-P, the domain motions required to close the active site could not occur, because the enzyme conformation was held fast by the crystal lattice. The Man-1-P-bound structure was surprising because it was anticipated from observations of phosphate (and phosphate analog) binding to other HADSF members that the electropositive environment created by the active-site Ser54, Lys198, and Mg2+ would constitute a more competent phosphate-binding site than that of the cap domain (26Lu Z. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8684-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N.

Thus, α-PMM1 is unique in that the phosphorylated substrate is seen bound primarily by interactions with the cap domain (Figs. 2A and 4). The electron densi"
https://openalex.org/W2146385874,"Ligand-induced transcription by nuclear receptors involves the recruitment of p160 coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1), in complex with histone acetyltransferases such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Here we describe the solution structure of a complex formed by the SRC1 interaction domain (SID) of CBP and the activation domain (AD1) of SRC1, both of which contain four helical regions (Calpha1, Calpha2, Calpha3, and Calpha3' in CBP and Salpha1, Salpha2', Salpha2, and Salpha3 in SRC1). A tight four-helix bundle is formed between Salpha1, Calpha1, Calpha2, and Calpha3 that is capped by Salpha3. In contrast to the structure of the AD1 domain of the related p160 protein ACTR in complex with CBP SID, the sequences forming Salpha2' and Salpha2 in SRC1 AD1 are not involved in the interface between the two domains but rather serve to position Salpha3. Thus, although the CBP SID domain adopts a similar fold in complex with different p160 proteins, the topologies of the AD1 domains are strikingly different, a feature that is likely to contribute to functional specificity of these coactivator complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2166556795,"D-sites are a class of MAPK-docking sites that have been found in many MAPK regulators and substrates. A single functional, high affinity D-site has been identified near the N terminus of each of the MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) MEK1, MEK2, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6. Here we demonstrated that MKK7 recognizes its target JNK by a novel mechanism involving a partially cooperative interaction of three low affinity D-sites in the N-terminal domain of MKK7. Mutations of the conserved residues within any one of the three docking sites (D1, D2, and D3) disrupted the ability of the N-terminal domain of MKK7β to bind JNK1 by about 50–70%. Moreover, mutation of any two of the three D-sites reduced binding by about 80–90%, and mutation of all three reduced binding by 95%. Full-length MKK7 containing combined D1/D2 mutations was compromised for binding to JNK1 and exhibited reduced JNK1 kinase activity when compared with wild-type MKK7. Peptide versions of the D-sites from MKK4 or the JIP-1 scaffold protein inhibited MKK7-JNK binding, suggesting that all three JNK regulators bind to the same region of JNK. Moreover, peptide versions of any of the three D-sites of MKK7 inhibited the ability of JNK1 and JNK2 to phosphorylate their transcription factor substrates c-Jun and ATF2, suggesting that D-site-containing substrates also compete with MKK7 for docking to JNK. Finally, MKK7-derived D-site peptides exhibited selective inhibition of JNK1 versus ERK2. We conclude that MKK7 contains three JNK-docking sites that interact to selectively bind JNK and contribute to JNK signal transmission and specificity.

In mammalian organisms, the following four major MAPK cascades have been characterized: ERK1/2, ERK5, p38, and JNK pathways (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4398) Google Scholar). Each cascade contains three sequentially acting protein kinases collectively known as a MAPK module (2Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This module consists of a MAPK/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK or MAP3K), which activates a downstream MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK, MKK, or MAP2K) that subsequently activates a particular set of MAPKs (2Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Activated MAPKs further propagate the signal by phosphorylating downstream targets such as transcription factors and other kinases. How this ubiquitous versatile module achieves specific coupling of signal to cellular response is an important and unresolved issue that is currently the subject of intense investigation (3Morrison D.K.

JNK1 and JNK2 have ubiquitous expression profiles, whereas JNK3 is primarily found in neural tissue (9Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). The three JNK proteins are regulated by two MAPK kinases-MKK4 (also called JNKK1 or SEK1) and MKK7/JNKK2/SEK2 (25Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

Optimal activation of JNK requires the activity of both MKK4 and MKK7; although both MEKs are capable of dual phosphorylation of JNK at the activation loop residues Thr and Tyr, MKK4 prefers the Tyr and MKK7 prefers the Thr (31Lawler S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MKK4 is primarily activated by environmental stresses, whereas MKK7 is primarily activated by cytokines (10Weston C.R. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 33Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in mice support a critical role for MKK7 in several aspects of cell and organismal physiology. MKK7 is essential for liver formation during embryogenesis; furthermore, loss of MKK7 in fibroblasts results in premature senescence and G2/M cell cycle arrest (34Wada T. Joza N. Cheng H.Y. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Bachmaier K. Katada T. Schreiber M. Wagner E.F. Nishina H. Penninger J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, MKK7 is a negative regulator of cell growth in multiple hematopoietic lineages (35Sasaki T. Wada T. Kishimoto H. Irie-Sasaki J. Matsumoto G. Goto T. Yao Z. Wakeham A. Mak T.W. Suzuki A.

MAPK-docking sites are found in the N-terminal regulatory domains of many MKKs, where they contribute to accurate and efficient enzyme-substrate recognition by promoting the formation of relatively stable, high affinity MKK·MAPK complexes (2Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This paradigm of MAPK recognition was first established for the yeast MEK Ste7 (36Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C.

Biol. 2005; 25: 9820-9828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The MAPK-docking sites in many MKKs, including yeast Ste7 and human MEK1/2, MKK3/6, and MKK4, share a core consensus sequence consisting of a cluster of about three basic residues, followed by a short spacer of 1–6 residues, and finally a hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic submotif (Fig. 1B) (37Bardwell L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we shall refer to this class of MAPK-docking sites as “D-sites.” D-sites have also been found in MAPK scaffolds, phosphatases, and substrates (2Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 42Kusari A.B. Molina D.M. Sabbagh W. Jr-Lau C.S. Bardwell L. J.

Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). D-sites in MKKs are crucial for the activation of their cognate MAPKs in vivo (44Enslen H. Brancho D.M. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 45Grewal S. Molina D.M. Bardwell L. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), where they function as portable, modular motifs that primarily serve to tether their cognate MAPKs near the kinase domain of MKKs (45Grewal S. Molina D.M. Bardwell L. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). D-sites also display some selectivity in binding to MAPKs, suggesting a role in specificity (40Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32662-32672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 46Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, the D-sites in MEK1 and MEK2 do not bind effectively to JNK2 (40Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32662-32672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As noted above, functional D-sites have been characterized in MEK/MKK1–4 and MKK6. MEK5 does not contain a D-site but instead contains a novel MAPK-docking site of acidic character (41Seyfried J. Wang X. Kharebava G. Tournier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9820-9828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No MAPK-docking site has heretofore been identified in MKK7; however, the N-terminal domain of the MKK7β isoform (the most prevalent isoform in humans) has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for high affinity complex formation with JNK1 (47Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the N terminus of MKK7β contains three weak D-sites that interact in a partially additive, partially synergistic manner to create a high affinity JNK-docking platform. Genes—The MKK7β1 clone used in this paper corresponds to GenBankTM accession number NM_005043. Accession numbers of other genes used in this study have been given in an earlier work (40Ho D.T.

Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a derivative of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). In pGEXLB, an encoded Pro residue is replaced with a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly sequence to promote the independent functioning of the GST and fusion moieties. The cloning of pGEXLB-JNK1α1 was described previously (48Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To generate GST-MKK7-(1–85), GST-MKK7-(1–60), and GST-MKK7-(1–38), PCR was used to amplify the specific fragments and introduce a BamHI at the N terminus and a SalI site at the C terminus. The primers used are shown in Table 1; a human MKK7β1 cDNA clone (48Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was used as the template. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and SalI and subsequently inserted into the appropriate sites on pGEX-LB. To generate the plasmids for GST fused to the independent MKK7β-docking sites (see Fig. 3), an adaptor oligonucleotide approach was used. pGEX-LB was cut with BamHI and SalI, and the polylinker insert was removed. The excised fragment was replaced by annealed oligonucleotide pairs that encoded the independent docking sites. To encode MKK7-D2, the oligonucleotide pair used was MKK7For 35–49 and MKK7Rev 35–49; for MKK7-D3, MKK7For 67–80 and MKK7Rev 67–80; for the D-site from MKK4, MKK4For 36–49 and MKK4Rev 36–49 (Table 1). Site-directed mutagenesis (Quickchange, Stratagene) was used to generate the GST-MKK7-(1–85)-docking site mutant constructs used in Fig. 4. The template used in these mutagenesis reactions was pGEM-MKK7-(1–85). The following complement primers were used to mutate each respective docking site as follows: for D1, MKK7D1mutFor and MKK7D1mutRev; for D2, MKK7D2mutFor and MKK7D2mutRev; and for D3, MKK7D3mutFor and MKK7D3mutRev (Table 1). The double and triple D-site mutants were generated by mutating one D-site at a time. The D12 and D123 mutants required an additional primer pair to correct the return to wild-type caused by the D1 mutation primers. The accuracy of all mutant constructs was verified by sequencing. Plasmids for Tissue Culture Transfections—To generate pcDNA3.1-MKK7β1-FLAG (“MKK7-FLAG”), containing full-length MKK7β1 tagged at its C terminus with the FLAG epitope, the MKK7β1 coding sequence was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/FLAG vector using the HindIII and KpnI sites. MKK7-KD-FLAG, a catalytically inactive (“kinase dead”) mutant (K149A) of MKK7-FLAG, was created by site-directed mutagenesis using primers MKK7KDFor2 and MKK7KDRev2. MKK7-D12-FLAG, the D1/D2 double mutant of MKK7-FLAG, was created using the same primers and site-directed mutagenesis procedure used to make the MKK7-(1–85)-D12 mutant described above. Mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing the full-length coding sequence. Plasmid pcDNA3.1-JNK1α1-V5-His, encoding C-terminally epitope-tagged JNK1, was obtained from the Invitrogen. Transcription and Translation in Vitro—Proteins labeled with [35S]methionine were produced by coupled transcription and translation reactions, partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and quantified as described previously (38Bardwell A.J.

Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 mg of MKK7-FLAG, MKK7-D12-FLAG, or pcDNA3.1/FLAG plasmid DNA and co-transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-JNK1α1-V5-His plasmid DNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cells from two 35-mm wells were lysed into 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then cleared with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of beads (50% slurry) that had been preincubated with 1 μl of anti-V5 antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assays—HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA encoding either FLAG-tagged wild-type MKK7, docking site mutated MKK7, kinase-dead MKK7, or empty vector. After 48 h, the cells were serum-starved for 30 min and then treated with anisomycin (20 μg/ml) and IL-1 (5 ng/ml) for another 30 min. Cells were lysed, and MKK7-FLAG derivatives were immunoprecipitated as above. The immunoprecipitation complexes were then washed twice with wash buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The activity of MKK7 was determined in a reaction at 30 °C for 30 min in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 μg of unactivated JNK1, 2 μg of GST-c-Jun, 50 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, detected by immunoblot and autoradiography, and quantified on a PhosphorImager.

Among P2X receptors, ion currents through homomeric P2X4 receptors exhibit intermediate desensitization when compared with P2X1 and P2X3 (much faster) and P2X2 and P2X7 (slower). We recorded membrane currents in HEK293 cells transfected to express the human P2X4 receptor. The decline in current during a 4-s application of ATP (100 μm) was about 30%; this was not different during whole-cell or perforated patch recording. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the intracellular C terminus identified two positions with much accelerated desensitization kinetics (Lys373: 92% and Tyr374: 74%). At position 373, substitution of Arg or Cys also strongly accelerated desensitization: however, in the case of K373C the wild-type phenotype was fully restored by adding ethylammonium methanethiosulfonate. At position 374, phenylalanine could replace tyrosine. These results indicate that wild-type desensitization properties requires an aromatic moiety at position 374 and an amino rather than a guanidino group at position 373. These residues lie between previously identified motifs involved in membrane trafficking (YXXXK and YXXGL) and implicates the C-terminal also in rearrangements leading to channel closing during the presence of agonist.

P2X receptors belong to a family of ATP-gated ion channels, seven subunits of which have been currently identified and cloned (P2X1–7) (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Functional P2X receptors probably form as trimers, incorporating the same or different subunits (2Jiang L.H. Kim M. Spelta V. Bo X. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8903-8910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Barrera N.P. Ormond S.J. Henderson R.M. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The P2X subunits are considered to have two hydrophobic transmembrane domains with intracellular N and C termini and a large extracellular ectodomain containing conserved cysteines (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar); the ectodomain also contains residues that appear to contribute to the binding site for ATP (4Jiang L.H. Rassendren F.

In the central nervous system, P2X receptors have been implicated in mediating ATP-dependent fast excitatory neurotransmission (6Evans R.J. Derkach V. Surprenant A. Nature. 1992; 357: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 7Edwards F.A. Gibb A.J. Colquhoun D. Nature. 1992; 359: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 8Bardoni R.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2121-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P2X4 subunit is highly abundant in the central nervous system, with expression in both spinal cord and brain, including dentate gyrus, CA1/CA3 pyramidal, and cerebellar Purkinje cells (10Séguéla P. Haghighi A. Soghomonian J.J. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 448-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Soto F. Garcia-Guzman M. Karschin C. Stuhmer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); they are particularly localized to glutamatergic synapses (12Rubio M.E. Soto F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 641-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, P2X4 can regulate cellular Ca2+ levels via direct permeation and by the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. P2X receptor activity has therefore been proposed to be important in synaptic plasticity (13Pankratov Y.V. Lalo U.V. Krishtal O.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8363-8369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang Y. Haughey N.J. Mattson M.P. Furukawa K. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The time course of the effect of ATP at P2X receptors is strongly influenced by receptor desensitization, a feature common to most other ligand-gated ion channels. Desensitization manifests itself as a decline in current amplitude during agonist occupancy of the receptor, and in the case of P2X4, it can be modified pharmacologically (15Priel A. Silberberg S.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recombinant P2X receptors display varying degrees of desensitization; membrane current recordings show that P2X1 and P2X3 undergo fast desensitization (tens of milliseconds), P2X4 exhibits moderate desensitization (several seconds), and P2X2, P2X5, and P2X7 show less desensitization (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 16Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G.

Sci. 2005; 1048: 116-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For various P2X receptors, desensitization can be regulated by cellular signaling events, which further suggests its importance in P2X receptor physiology. Several studies have demonstrated regulation of P2X desensitization by protein kinase activity, either via direct N-terminal phosphorylation (at a highly conserved protein kinase C site) or via phosphorylation of an associated protein (18Boué-Grabot E. Archambault V. Séguéla P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Ennion S.J. Evans R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). P2X3 desensitization can be decreased by the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of the N terminus (20King B. Chen C.C. Akopian A.N. Burnstock G. Wood J.N. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Experiments using chimeric constructs of P2X1 and P2X2 subunits identified desensitization critical domains as the transmembrane segments and the intracellular juxtamembrane regions (up to 15 amino acids in length). Other domains within the C terminus of P2X2 have been identified by functional analysis of splice variants (21Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). P2X receptors have very different C-terminals, and the regions important for P2X4 subunits are not known. Given the likely importance of the P2X4 receptor in central synaptic physiology, it seemed useful to understand further the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to P2X4 desensitization. Human P2X4 subunit with a C-terminal EMYPME epitope tag subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) was used as the template for all mutagenesis reactions. Mutagenesis was achieved using Pfu turbo polymerase and QuikChange methodology (Stratagene). Truncated receptors were generated by the introduction of a premature stop codon by mutagenesis. HEK293 cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant P2X receptor (1 μg) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (0.1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Whole-cell recordings were made from HEK293 cells at room temperature, 24–48 h after transfection. The extracellular solution contained (mm): 145 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 13 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES. The intracellular pipette solution contained (mm): 145 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA. Solutions had pH 7.3 after titration with 5 m NaOH. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). Pipettes had resistances of 3–5 mΩ. For perforated patch-clamp, perforation was achieved by the addition of 120 μg/ml amphotericin in the patch pipette solution. Perforation typically occurred 5–8 min after gigaseal formation. ATP was applied using an RSC 200 system (Biological Science Instruments, Grenoble, France). Ethyl ammonium methane thiosulfonate (MTSEA 2The abbreviation used is: MTSEA, ethyl ammonium methane thiosulfonate.: Toronto Research Chemicals) was prepared as a concentrated stock, stored at –20 °C, and diluted in extracellular solution immediately prior to application. MTSEA was applied by superfusion at a rate of ∼2 ml/min. For immunohistochemistry, transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked for 30 min (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-EE, 1:500; Bethyl Laboratories) in blocking solution for 1–2 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and differences were tested by Student's t test and analysis of variance. Decline in Response with Repeated ATP Application—We distinguish two forms of desensitization at the human P2X4 receptor. The first is the decline in the peak current with repeated brief applications of ATP. Thus, in whole-cell recording, the peak current amplitude progressively declined when ATP (100 μm, 2 s) was applied at 1-min intervals (Fig. 1a). This decline was well fit with a single exponential (τ = 93 ± 6.2 s, n = 25 cells), reaching a plateau level at ∼20% of the initial peak amplitude. We observed no recovery from desensitization with repeated application when the application interval was increased to 5, 10, or 20 min (data not shown). P2X4 currents recorded using the perforated patch configuration (amphotericin 120 μg/ml) did not show decline with repeated applications (Fig. 1, a and b). However, we were unable to influence the decline in response by a range of other perturbations. Ivermectin (3 μm, 3 min) did not alter the kinetics of current decline (τ = 98 ± 5.4 s; n = 8, p > 0.05) (Fig. 1a), although it increased peak current amplitudes ∼3-fold. The rate of current decline was unchanged in external solutions containing 0 mm calcium and also not different when the recording pipette contained ATP (1 mm), GTP (1 mm), staurosporine (100 nm), genistein (100 μm), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (50 μm), or U73122 (10 μm). P2X4ΔY378, which is truncated so as to lack the endocytic motif YEQGL (Fig. 2), showed properties not different from wild type receptors (τ = 91 ± 5.2 s, n = 12 cells, p > 0.05). Decline in Response during ATP Application—The second form of desensitization is the decline in the membrane current during the continued application of ATP, and this is the subject of the remainder of this paper. Currents evoked by ATP (100 μm) rose to their peak amplitude in 410 ± 8.2 ms, and the average peak amplitude was 151 ± 30 pA (n = 25 cells). During a 5-s application of ATP (100 μm), wild-type currents declined to a value that was 32 ± 7.9% (n = 25 cells) of their initial peak amplitude. These values were obtained in the whole-cell configuration, but the decline in current during the application was not different when recorded using the perforated patch configuration (27 ± 5.2%, n = 12 cells, p > 0.05) (Fig. 1c). However, the decline during the application was substantially slowed by ivermectin (3 μm, 3 min; 2.4 ± 0.8%, n = 12 cells, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1c) (15Priel A. Silberberg S.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The decline in response was independent of ATP concentration (1 μm, 30 ± 1.8%, 3 μm, 31 ± 1.4%, 30 μm, 31 ± 4.1%, 300 μm, 34 ± 2.0%; n = 6 cells). Further experiments were carried out with 100 μm ATP. The rate of current decline was not different when the extracellular calcium concentration was 0 mm as compared with 2 mm; it was also independent of holding potential (–60 mV versus +60 mV). Truncations and Alanine Scanning in the C Terminus—The C terminus of the human P2X4 receptor extends from residue Leu358, at the end of the second transmembrane domain, to Gln388. A truncation that deleted the final eleven amino acids (ΔY378) had properties not different from wild type P2X4; it showed a similar desensitization during the application (Fig. 2) and a similar decline with repeated applications. Removal of the residues from and including Lys373 or Lys362 resulted in receptors that were non-functional (Fig. 2b). Receptors containing a singly substituted alanine at the 27 positions from Tyr359 to Gln388 had normal currents in response to ATP, with several exceptions (Fig. 3). Substitution of alanine for Tyr367, Lys371, or Tyr372 produced non-functional receptors that have been described previously (23Chaumont S. Jiang L.H. Penna A. North R.A. Rassendren F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29628-29638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Royle S.J. Qureshi O.S. Bobanovic L.K. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3073-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Non-functional receptors reached the plasma membrane when wild-type and mutant receptor immunocytochemistry was compared (Fig. 3c). All mutant receptors gave current densities not significantly different from wild-type when challenged with 100 μm ATP, with the exception of P2X4[D377A] and P2X4[E379A] (wild-type, 121 ± 10 pA/pF; P2X4[D377A], 20 ± 4 pA/pF, 25 ± 5 pA/pF, p < 0.01, n = 5 cells). Substitution of alanine at Lys373 and Tyr 374 resulted in currents with much accelerated current decline in the presence of ATP (K373A: 92 ± 3.2%, n = 20; Y374A: 74 ± 4.2%, n = 15, p < 0.01). The double mutant receptor P2X4[K373A,Y374A] had properties not different from the single mutant P2X4[K373A](decline in current 93 ± 2.8%; n = 8 cells; Fig. 3). Both P2X4[K373A] and P2X4[Y374A] had accelerated rundown kinetics compared with wild-type in whole-cell patches (τ = 41 ± 2.2 s and 61 ± 3.8 s, respectively; n = 15–20, p < 0.01). All other alanine mutants had wild-type run-down kinetics (data not shown). Sequence alignment of the C-terminal regions of the seven P2X subunits shows that P2X4 (and P2X1) subunits differ from the others at positions 373 and 374 (Fig. 2a). P2X4 and P2X1 have a positively charged residue at position 373, whereas all the others are negative. P2X4 and P2X1 subunits have an aromatic tyrosine residue at position 374, whereas in the others it is charged or polar (P2X7). We investigated the effect of substituting equivalent residues from P2X2 (a non-desensitizing receptor) for residues at positions 373 and/or 374 in P2X4. However, currents at P2X4[K373D], P2X4[Y374K], or P2X4[K373D,Y374K] receptors were not significantly different from those seen with the alanine-substituted equivalents (92 ± 5.4%, 93 ± 3.2%, and 92 ± 4.8%, respectively, n = 8–12 cells, p > 0.05). Phenylalanine substituted fully for tyrosine at position 374: P2X4[Y374F] showed currents and desensitization not different from wild type (28 ± 6.2%, n = 8 cells, p > 0.05) (Fig. 3a). Further Studies at Lys373—When arginine replaced lysine at position 373 (P2X4[K373R]) the receptors exhibited a current not significantly different from P2X4[K373A] (89 ± 3.4%, n = 8 cells, p > 0.05) (Fig. 3a). This indicates that the arginine side chain (–CH2)3–NH–C(NH2) = NH+2) cannot substitute for that of lysine (−(CH2)4−NH3+) at position 373. We examined further the difference between the [cepsilon]-amino group and the guanidino moiety by expressing the P2X4[K373C] receptor. Current evoked by ATP at this receptor declined similarly to that seen with P2X4[K373A] (87 ± 3.4%, n = 8 cells, p > 0.05). However, MTSEA (1 mm; 10 min) restored the wild-type phenotype (38 ± 6.3%, n = 6 cells, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4a). This effect of MTSEA was prevented by intracellular cysteine (20 mm: in the recording pipette; Fig. 4b). MTSEA had no effect on wild type (33 ± 4.2%, n = 6–10) or P2X4[K373A] receptors (90 ± 4.2%, n = 8, p > 0.05), indicating that the effect of MTSEA was a specific modification of the cysteine at position 373 (Fig. 4). These results indicate that maintained channel opening in the presence of ATP requires Lys373 (or the equivalent side chain −S−S−(CH2)2−NH3+). We asked therefore in how many subunits of a homotrimeric receptor was the lysine required? We co-expressed wild-type and P2X4[K373A] receptors in nominally equal amounts. Whole-cell recordings showed typical ATP-activated currents, but the decline during the application was intermediate between that seen for cells expressing either wild-type or P2X4[K373A] receptors alone (Fig. 4c). In fact, the current declined by 58 ± 8.4% over 4 s (n = 12 cells) during a 4-s application. This decline in the current was not different from that which would have been observed from an equal mixture of wild type and [K373A] substituted receptors. If one assumes that heterotrimer formation occurs readily between subunits containing alanine and those containing lysine and that only two (rather than four) phenotypes can occur, then this result indicates that a single alanine-containing subunit does not exert a dominant effect with respect to the desensitization kinetics (Fig. 4c). Our results distinguish two modes of P2X4 receptor desensitization. In our whole-cell experimental conditions, P2X4 responses declined both during ATP applications lasting a few seconds and with applications repeated at 1-min intervals (Figs. 1a and 2a). With perforated patch recording to minimize dialysis of intracellular contents, the decline with repeated application (“run-downP”) was completely prevented, whereas the decline during ATP applications was the same as in whole-cell recordings (Fig. 1). The prevention of P2X4 rundown by perforated patch recording is comparable with the work by Lewis and Evans (25Lewis C.J. Evans R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), who showed that the run-down of a P2X1-like current in smooth muscle cells did not occur with amphotericin-permeabilized recordings. The phenomena of run-down has been observed for P2X1, P2X3, P2X4, and P2X7; other P2X receptors give robust steady-state currents with repeated ATP applications. A likely explanation for P2X4 run-down in whole-cell recording is that a diffusible cytosolic factor that tonically regulates the receptor is lost during intracellular dialysis. The identity of such a factor is not obvious, but from our experiments it seems not to be ATP, GTP, or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The mechanism underlying the decline in P2X4 response with repeated ATP application is also not likely to involve AP2-mediated receptor internalization. This is because the truncation P2X4[Δ Y378], and the point mutations Y378A and L382A, each of which lack the AP2-dependent endocytic motif YXXGΦ responsible for receptor internalization in neurons (27Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), exhibited a decline in response with repeated ATP application that was not different from wild type receptors. These truncated receptors would presumably use the YXXV motif (beginning at Tyr372) for their normal trafficking (24Royle S.J. Qureshi O.S. Bobanovic L.K. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3073-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ivermectin increases the currents evoked by ATP at P2X4 receptors (26Khakh B.S. Proctor W.R. Dunwiddie T.V. Labarca C. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7289-7299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent careful study by Priel and Silberberg (15Priel A. Silberberg S.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) distinguished two effects: the first is an increase in the maximum current that is seen at concentration around 0.3 μm, and the second is a slowing of deactivation that occurs at 10-fold higher concentrations. Both these effects were observed in our experiments, using 3 μm ivermectin. However, in ivermectin there was no change in the decline of the peak currents observed with repeated application of ATP. Parenthetically, we also noted that the increase in current by ivermectin was observed in the truncated P2X4 receptor P2X4[ΔY378]. The C terminus of P2X4 is short (30 residues) relative to that of other P2X receptors: 62% of these residues are either charged or aromatic (tyrosine) (Fig. 2a). By alanine scanning we identified two residues (Lys373 and Tyr374) as being important for the time course of desensitization during the ATP application. Both K373A and Y374A mutations resulted in receptors with much accelerated decline in response during ATP application as compared with wild-type receptor currents (Fig. 3a). These residues lie between two other functionally important regions for P2X receptors. These are the YXXXK motif that is found in all P2X family members (Tyr367 to Lys371, human P2X4) and the YEQGL sequence (Tyr378 to Leu382) found uniquely in P2X4 subunits. The first of these contributes to receptor stabilization at the plasma membrane (23Chaumont S. Jiang L.H. Penna A. North R.A. Rassendren F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29628-29638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The second has been shown to bind directly to the μ2 subunit of the adaptor protein AP-2, where it occupies a site comparable to that seen for the more common endocytic motif YXXΦ (24Royle S.J.

This binding is key to clathrin-mediated receptor internalization undergone by P2X4 receptors (27Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These two residues that we have identified form the heart of the YKYV motif that is not normally used for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of P2X4 receptors (24Royle S.J. Qureshi O.S. Bobanovic L.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We asked how critical was the requirement for tyrosine at position 374 and found that P2X4[Y374F] functioned essentially as the wild-type receptor with respect to the decline in current during the ATP application (Fig. 3a). This indicates that the requirement for aromaticity at this position for the channel to remain open during agonist occupancy. It further indicates that Tyr374 is unlikely to be phosphorylated: for example, previous work (28Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) on P2X7 receptors has indicated that repeated activation leads to receptor dephosphorylation and that this underlies the decline in the responses in that case. On the other hand, arginine could not substitute for lysine at position 373 (Fig. 3a). This suggests that the critical moiety is not simply the positive charge but other features of the lysine side chain (such as the hydrocarbon chain). We tested this by expressing the P2X4[K373C] receptor and using MTSEA to add a side chain of similar length (−S−S−CH2−CH2−NH3+) to that of lysine (−CH2−CH2−CH2−CH2−NH3+). This completely restored the wild-type phenotype. Control experiments showing that MTSEA did not modify the wild-type channel or the fast desensitizing mutant P2X4[K373A], and that the effect of MTSEA was prevented by intracellular cysteine (29Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 30Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strongly support the interpretation that MTSEA is acting by modification of the cysteine side chain at position 373. This indicates that lysine rather than arginine is required for structural reasons (e.g. the arginine side chain −CH2−CH2−CH2−NH−C(NH2)=NH2+ is too long to be accommodated) or perhaps that the lysine is subject to posttranslational modification. For example, post-translational modification of lysine has been shown to be important for the function of other ion channels (32Rajan S. Plant L.D. Rabin M.L. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2005; 121: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, there are no consensus motifs for lysine modification apparent at position 373 and the relatively fast time course (5–10 min: Fig. 4b) with which MTSEA restored the wild type phenotype effect also argues against such an interpretation. The simplest explanation of why K373A mutation accelerates the decline in response during ATP application is that the critical positioning of this positive charge is required for channel opening to be maintained when ATP is bound. This implies that gating transitions involve not only conformational changes in the ectodomain and transmembrane hydrophobic regions but also the first part of the C terminus (33Werner P. Seward E.P.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6968-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is difficult to make further mechanistic interpretation, given that the residue at this position is lysine in one other P2X subunit (P2X1, which shows rapid desensitization) and negatively charged (Glu or Asp) in all others. In a previous study by Koshimizu et al. (22Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the region 376–381 (EDYEQG) was identified as being important in controlling P2X4 desensitization during sustained applications of ATP. They measured the decline in intracellular calcium concentration over periods of several hundred seconds, so it is difficult to interpret those results with respect to the present studies in which ionic current was measured over a period of 5 s. Under our experimental conditions, these residues do not participate in receptor desensitization, as determined by alanine substitution or truncation. Previous work by Royle et al. (27Royle S.J. Bobanovic L.K. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35378-35385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has shown that this region contains the first four amino acids of the motif (YEQGL) that interacts with the μ2 subunit of the adaptor protein AP2 and is thus involved in receptor internalization. In general terms, this would be consistent with our interpretation that the decline in the current during the time frame of a few seconds that we have studied is unrelated to receptor internalization. P2X receptors are generally considered to operate as trimers (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Our final question was whether the rapid desensitization was observed when only one of the three subunits carried alanine at position 373 (i.e. P2X4[K373A]·P2X4·P2X4) (Fig. 4); in other words, did this mutation confer a dominant phenotype. The result of the co-expression of wild-type and mutant subunits in equal amounts (Fig. 4c) strongly indicates that accelerated desensitization is seen only in channels with two or more subunits carrying the alanine (i.e. P2X4[K373A]·P2X4[K373A]·P2X4). This would imply that normal channel function can occur even though one of the three subunits is mutated to alanine at this position. We cannot exclude the alternative explanation for the results of the co-expression, which is that the lysine to alanine mutation prevents the formation of heteromeric channels, and that the currents observed flow through approximately equal parts of the homomeric wild type P2X4 and mutant P2X4[K373A] channels. This seems unlikely given that the P2X4[K373A] has properties similar in many respects to wild type channels, which shows that alanines in this position (at least with three of them) do not themselves prevent formation of functional homomers. In summary, we have identified Lys373 and Tyr374 in the C terminus of the P2X4 receptor as being key determinants of P2X4 receptor desensitization on the time scale of seconds. This implicates the juxtamembrane C terminus in playing an important role in determining the duration of the physiological action of ATP at the P2X4 receptors. We thank H. Broomhead, L. Almond, and K. Dossi for technical assistance during this study."

In cultured cells, most of the clathrin is localized to large patches that display little lateral mobility. The functional role of these regions is not clear, and it has been thought that they may represent artifacts of cell adhesion of cultured cells. Here we have analyzed clathrin organization in primary adipose cells isolated from mice, which are nonadherent and fully differentiated. The majority of clathrin on the plasma membrane of these cells (>60%) was found in large clathrin patches that displayed virtually no lateral mobility and persisted for many minutes, and a smaller amount was found in small spots that appeared and disappeared rapidly. Direct visualization of transferrin revealed that it bound onto large arrays of clathrin, internalizing through vesicles that emerge from these domains. High resolution imaging (50 images/s) revealed fluorescence intensity fluctuations consistent with the formation and detachment of coated vesicles from within large patches. These results reveal that large clathrin assemblies are active regions of endocytosis in mammalian cells and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanistic basis for this organization.

These results reveal that large clathrin assemblies are active regions of endocytosis in mammalian cells and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanistic basis for this organization. Clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane is required for the endocytosis of many receptors and transmembrane proteins. Insight into the mechanism of clathrin assembly and coated vesicle formation was obtained initially from electron microscopy and biochemical studies. This information formed the basis for a well accepted model in which individual clathrin-coated pits form on the plasma membrane, grow and invaginate by progressive association of coat subunits, and detach to form free, short-lived vesicles enriched in endocytic cargo (1Schmid S.L.

The availability of fluorescent derivatives of clathrin provided the opportunity to test this model in live cells. The first visualization of fluorescent clathrin generated several surprising findings, among which was the perception that clathrin-coated vesicles were produced recurrently from specific sites within the plasma membrane. In addition, many of these sites displayed a gradual loss of fluorescence, not a sudden catastrophic disappearance, suggesting that individual coated pits could form from within an expansive clathrin patch. Results consistent with the existence of large clathrin lattices harboring invaginated structures have also been captured by electron microscopy (4Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The use of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M) 3The abbreviations used are: TIRF-M, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; GFP, green fluorescent protein.3The abbreviations used are: TIRF-M, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; GFP, green fluorescent protein. has provided the additional technical advantage over confocal microscopy of being able to specifically see events occurring within 100 nm of the plasma membrane (7Axelrod D.

Images derived from TIRF-M of clathrin are consistent among many groups using either dsRed-clathrin or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-clathrin, in stable or transiently transfected cells, and also have provided unexpected results. Foremost among these findings is that the vast majority (80%) of the clathrin signal on the plasma membrane is present as a population that is static during the average period of observation, typically 60 s. Only a small population of clathrin (10–20%) is present as small, rapidly disappearing structures, which would be the ones expected to predominate if the earlier model of clathrin-mediated endocytosis were occurring in live cells (9Rappoport J.Z.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13190-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although these observations have been reported repeatedly, the significance of this organization has remained unclear, and the possibility has been suggested that it may represent an artifact of cell adherence in culture (17Ehrlich M. Boll W. Van Oijen A. Hariharan R. Chandran K. Nibert M.L. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2004; 118: 591-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). To better define the physiological significance of these observations, we have analyzed the dynamics of clathrin assembly using three novel approaches. First, we visualized clathrin dynamics in primary adipose cells isolated from mouse epididymal fat. Isolated adipocytes float in culture medium because of the buoyancy conferred by their lipid content, and therefore artifacts due to adherence onto glass or plastic are eliminated. Moreover, this cell type has been used in studies of endocytic trafficking of GLUT4, a transmembrane transporter known to internalize through a clathrin-mediated mechanism (18Lizunov V.A. Matsumoto H. Zimmerberg J. Cushman S.W. Frolov V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 19Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Second, we have used algorithms that incorporate the signal detected throughout the whole adherent surface of the cells, avoiding the potential bias introduced by the selection of single events for analysis. Third, we have developed an imaging platform consisting of a TIRF microscope equipped with two lasers and a highly sensitive, high speed camera that allows the capture of images at rates up to 50 Hz (50 images/s). Our results indicate that apparently static clathrin patches display small subregional intensity changes consistent with the formation of clathrin-coated pits from within these patches. Moreover, simultaneous imaging of transferrin and clathrin demonstrates that ligands are internalized from large clathrin patches. These results suggest a model in which defined regions of the plasma membrane are specialized for the assembly of large clathrin assemblies that functionally support endocytosis. Optical System—Coherent Innova 70C lasers were used (argon ion and an argon-krypton ion) to produce the 488 and 568 nm light, respectively. The combined beams were coupled into a single mode fiber using a KineFLEX fiber coupler (Point Source). A modified Olympus IX81 inverted microscope, TIRF fiber illuminator, and Plan APO 60× objective with a numerical aperture of 1.45 were used. TIRF illumination was introduced through the edge of the objective at an angle set between 65 and 68 degrees, giving a penetration depth of 90–121 nm at 488 nm and 105–141 nm at 568 nm. Light was collimated through the objective and a layer of immersion oil onto the coverslip. The quality of the collimation was set halfway between the best qualities for 488 and 568 nm. Light from the fluorophores was collected and relayed onto a 640 × 448-pixel charge-coupled device camera developed by Lincoln Laboratory (MIT). A Physik Instruments PIFOC was used for fine focus control. The entire microscope was contained in a heated chamber held at 35 °C. Imaging Hardware and Software—The acquisition system uses the following components: Intel L440GX+ server motherboard with dual peripheral component interconnect (PCI) buses; two 800-MHz Pentium III processors with 2 gigabytes of RAM; Instrutech ITC-18 data acquisition system; Bitflow Roadrunner differential camera interface; ATTO UL3D Ultra160 SCSI Raid controller and four Seagate Cheetah 18-gigabyte Ultra 160 SCSI drives (model ST318351LW). The Bitflow Roadrunner uses a 66-mHz PCI slot. The other components use the 33-Mhz PCI bus. The four Seagate Cheetah drives are in a Raid-0 configuration. Two drives are attached to each of the two controllers on the ATTO UL3D. Sustained read and write speeds are over 100 megabytes/s. The acquisition software, called ScratchNG, is a custom multi-threaded Windows application designed for sustained image capture to RAM, a RAID disk, or both. The Roadrunner streams incoming images into a primary double buffer in system memory. Although one buffer is being addressed by the Roadrunner, the image from the other buffer is copied into a secondary buffer. The secondary buffer can vary in size, depending upon the number of images that need to be captured or whether the images are to be transferred directly to the RAID device. The software image capture capability is only limited by the size of the RAID device, which is 72 gigabytes currently. ScratchNG uses the Instrutech ITC-18 to generate camera read pulses, shutter openings, filter wheel changes, and focus changes. Interactive three-dimensional and four-dimensional (3D+time) visualization and co-localization analysis was performed using Data Analysis and Visualization Environment software (21Lifshitz L.M. Collins J. Moore E. Gauch J. Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Biomedical Image Analysis. IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA1994: 166-175Google Scholar). Curve fitting was done using Origin (Origin Labs Corp., Northampton, MA). Fluorescent Probes and Cells—Alexa568-transferrin (Molecular Probes) was applied to the cells at 20 μg/ml. GFP-clathrin represents a N-terminal fusion of GFP with clathrin light chain A, generated and generously provided by J. H. Keen (20Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In the experiments described herein, COS cells were transfected with 1–4 μg of plasmid DNA using calcium phosphate transfection. For primary fat cell isolation, epididymal fat pads from 10-week-old male C57BL6 mice were weighed and cut into 0.03-cm3 pieces with scissors and then resuspended in KRH (NaCl 125 mm), KCl 5 mm, CaCl2 1.3 mm, MgSO4 1.2 mm, HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm, sodium pyruvate 2 mm, and 2.5% bovine serum albumin containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington)). The fat pads were digested for 30–45 min at 37 °C in an orbital bath with shaking at 100 rpm. The digested samples were squeezed through chiffon, and the isolated cells and washed three times in KRH buffer, pH 7.4, plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin and immediately transfected by electroporation. Cells were then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and visualized 18 h later. Isolated adipocytes transfected with GFP-clathrin were visualized by epifluorescence and TIRF-M. To enable contact between the adipocytes (which float) and the bottom coverslip, a 15-mm coverslip was placed over a 15-μl volume of the cell suspension, trapping the cells in the 84-μm space between the two coverslips (Fig. 1, diagrams above panels A–C). GFP-clathrin was seen in epifluorescence as a bright rim surrounding the single large lipid droplet. As the objective was lowered, a small adherent region could be visualized (Fig. 1, A–C). When visualized by TIRF-M the same region appeared smaller in diameter (Fig. 1, compare D and F) because of the illumination of only 100 nm from the surface of the coverslip. Images were then acquired at 0.5 Hz (one image every 2 s) for a duration of 10–20 min. GFP-clathrin was observed in regions of heterogeneous size and intensity. To analyze quantitatively the distribution of clathrin within these regions, we used the following strategy. First, raw images were corrected by subtracting the background fluorescence outside the cell (Fig. 2a, panel A). Second, a running average of three time points in all each comprising a 4-s interval was generated, which removed slight speckling due to camera noise but had a negligible effect on the data (Fig. 2a, panel B). Third, to generate images in which structured fluorescence (i.e. pits and patches) could be quantitatively analyzed without interference from background diffuse fluorescence, images were smoothed by convolving with a small, two-dimensional Gaussian spot (s = 160 nm), which preserved the mean intensity. In order to be able to separate the clathrin spots from the background based on their intensity, the local background was estimated by convolving with a larger, two-dimensional Gaussian (s = 320 nm) and subtracting this from the smoothed images. From this we generated a binary masking image by setting the intensity of all positively valued pixels to 1 and all other pixels to zero (Fig. 2a, panel C). We then multiplied the mask by the original image (Fig. 2a, panel D) to display areas in the image with intensity exceeding the average local background. The masked images could then be used to measure the size and intensity of clathrin pits or patches over the entire adherent surface of the cell. They could also be used to measure the average persistence of these regions over time, as well as their co-localization with cargo (see below). To estimate the size distribution of clathrin assemblies, histograms of images from 16 time points/cell for four independent cells were averaged (shown in Fig. 2B). A peak comprising small, diffraction-limited regions 360 nm in diameter was seen. 30% of total fluorescence was derived from regions smaller than 360 nm in diameter, 60% from regions 360–700 nm in diameter, and 10% from regions larger than 700 nm in diameter. The resolution of the TIRF system was measured by imaging a 190-nm fluorescent green bead three dimensionally with 100-nm z-steps to obtain the best focal plane, and then switched to TIRF. The full width of the image obtained was 376 nm. Because single pits would be expected to have a real diameter of ∼50–100 nm and thus be visualized in TIRF as regions of <376 nm, we concluded that in primary cells, the majority of clathrin is distributed in assemblies larger than those attributed to individual clathrin-coated pits. This distribution of clathrin regions is similar to that observed by others in either stably or transiently transfected cell lines (10Rappoport J.Z. Simon S.M. Benmerah A. Traffic. 2004; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Rappoport J.Z. Taha B.W. Lemeer S. Benmerah A. Simon S.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13190-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The behavior of these regions over time was quantified by the following procedure. First, the time series was projected as a three-dimensional image, with the TIRF image defined by X and Y and time defined by Z. Clathrin “objects” were defined as contiguous voxels in this three-dimensional space (Fig. 3A). Second, for each time point in the series, the regions corresponding to objects present because t = 0 were labeled as “persistent,” whereas those appearing de novo were labeled as “new” (Fig. 3B). Third, the total amount of fluorescence in persistent or new regions at each time point was recorded (Fig. 3C). This provided a measurement of how much clathrin was present in rapidly disappearing versus persistent regions throughout the whole adherent surface. When the plot was fitted with the sum of two exponentials, a fast time constant of 24.0 ± 16.4 s (95% confidence interval) was observed, which accounted for 40% of the regions. A slow time constant of 537 ± 222 s (95% confidence interval) accounted for the remaining 60% of the regions. Thus, more than half of the clathrin regions in the cell are long-lived. A complementary measurement of the persistence of clathrin regions is shown in Fig. 4, in which the degree of co-localization of an image (t = 0, displayed in green) with subsequent images (t = n, displayed in red) is quantified. Colocalized spots are displayed in white, and red and green voxels represent regions that appeared or disappeared outside the more stable areas, which remain white (Fig. 4). For quantification, the loss of co-localization was measured as the percent of red voxels co-localized with green voxels over the whole adherent surface of the cell, using images acquired at 2-s intervals over a 2.5-min period (Fig. 4B). When these plots were fitted with the sum of two exponentials, fast and slow time constants of 8.4 ± 0.87 and 157 ± 5 s (95% confidence interval), accounting for 43 and 57% of the regions, were observed. These time constants are slightly faster than those derived from the procedure shown in Fig. 3, probably because of the fact that this alternative method does not account for cell shape changes that would lead to an artificial decorrelation of persistent regions. Nevertheless, the proportion of long-lived clathrin-coated regions was still estimated to be higher than 50%. A similar behavior was observed in cultured cell types, including differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (not illustrated) and COS cells (Fig. 5). To estimate the size distribution of clathrin images, histograms from 18 images/cell from three independent cells were averaged. As in primary cells, a peak around the equivalent diameter of 360 nm is seen, which possibly corresponds to single pits (Fig. 5A). Regions smaller than 360 nm (between 361 and 700 nm) and larger than 700 nm accounted for 20, 60, and 20% of the total fluorescence, respectively. Analysis of the persistence of objects in time also corresponded well with that observed for primary cells (Fig. 5B). When the loss of co-localization over time was measured (Fig. 5, C and D) fast and slow time constants of 11.6 ± 1.1 and 376 ± 6 s (95% confidence interval) accounting for 40 and 60% of the regions were observed. Thus in both primary and cultured cells, the majority of clathrin was found in large assemblies that persisted in the same region for prolonged periods of time. To determine whether these regions are static or actively exchange clathrin with the cytoplasm, we analyzed the pattern of recovery of fluorescence following photobleaching. After imaging by TIRF-M, the top left quadrant of the cell was bleached in epifluorescence mode for 2 min. Images were then acquired in TIRF mode for 20 additional minutes (Fig. 6A, panels A–C). Much of the signal appeared in regions that overlapped exactly with those visible prior to photo bleaching (Fig. 6A, panels D–F), revealing that these apparently static regions actively exchange clathrin with the cytoplasm. Measurements of the rate of recovery of fluorescence revealed a mean half-time of 479 ± 145s(n = 3) (Fig. 6B). This slow rate of recovery may be due to the bleaching of a substantial proportion of the cytoplasmic pool of clathrin. However, the kinetics may be an accurate reflection of the rate of clathrin exchange in long-lived clathrin regions (Figs. 3, 4, 5). To determine whether large, persistent clathrin assemblies are competent for endocytosis, we simultaneously imaged GFP-clathrin and Alexa568-transferrin. Because only the fluorophore present within 100 nm of the coverslip surface is excited in TIRF mode, the fluorescence from transferrin bound to receptors at the plasma membrane is high enough relative to the fluorescence from transferrin in the buffer to provide an adequate signal to noise ratio. Soon after its addition to the medium, transferrin binding was observed both diffusely distributed and concentrated in regions of ∼500 nm diameter over the entire surface (Fig. 7A, top left panel). Fluorescence in both areas increased steadily in the continuous presence of transferrin in the medium (Fig. 7A, bottom left panel). To determine the correspondence between regions of transferrin binding and of assembled clathrin, we superimposed masks of the clathrin images on corresponding transferrin images. Intense transferrin binding is seen in regions inside the mask, which correspond to large areas of persistent clathrin assembly (Fig. 7B, upper panels, arrowheads). The transferrin signal outside these regions is less intense and very diffuse at early time points (Fig. 7C, upper panels). After 10 min the transferrin signal within the clathrin mask remains intense (Fig. 7B, lower panels, arrowheads) but is now also seen in vesicular structures close to but outside the clathrin mask (Fig. 7C, lower panels, arrows). To quantify these observations, we recorded total transferrin fluorescence (the product of total voxels and their mean intensity), as well as the concentration of transferrin (total intensity/number of voxels) inside and outside the clathrin mask over time (Fig. 7, D and E, respectively). Although the total amount of bound transferrin is higher in the larger area outside the mask, the concentration of transferrin is higher inside than outside the mask throughout the time series (Fig. 7E). The greatest difference in concentration (∼ 6-fold) is seen within the first few seconds (Fig. 7F), indicating that initial transferrin binding is on regions where clathrin is assembled (Fig. 7F). This is consistent with a higher concentration of transferrin receptors in clathrin-coated regions of the membrane at steady state. After a few minutes, vesicular structures containing transferrin are seen outside the clathrin mask (Fig. 7C, lower panels) and appear to be emanating from regions of persistent clathrin assembly. Superimposition of clathrin and transferrin images illustrates this process (Fig. 8). Stable patches of clathrin (Fig. 8, arrows) become labeled rapidly upon addition of transferrin to the medium (notice the whiter appearance of the clathrin patches after time = 0, reflecting co-localization of GFP-clathrin and Alexa568-transferrin). Transferrin then appears in vesicular structures that emanate from the clathrin patches (Fig. 8, arrowheads). Transferrin accumulation within the cell distal from the plasma membrane was seen in epifluorescence images of the cells during this time (data not shown). When transferrin was removed from the medium, it gradually disappeared from clathrin patches, but the patches themselves remained present (Fig. 8, arrows; compare t = 0 with t = 18 min). These results demonstrate directly that transferrin endocytosis occurs through regions of persistent clathrin assembly. These results suggest that cargo-laden clathrin-coated vesicles are generated from within these larger clathrin assemblies. If so, fluorescence intensity fluctuations consistent with vesicle formation and detachment within these assemblies should be detectable at higher spatial and temporal resolution. To test this possibility we imaged clathrin patches at an optical resolution of 60 nm/pixel and at a rate of 50 Hz (50 images/s) for 60 continuous seconds. To rule out the possibility that observed intensity fluctuations might be due to nonbiological fluctuations in signal intensity (camera or laser noise) we re-imaged the same cells after fixation with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by washes to remove the formaldehyde. Clear upward and downward fluctuations in intensity within clathrin patches were observed in live cells that were qualitatively different from the noise detected in the same patch after fixation (Fig. 9, A and B). The fluctuations seen in live cell patches resembled those seen when the process of coated pit formation from within a large patch was modeled mathematically (Fig. 9, C–F). These results are most consistent with the hypothesis that individual coated vesicles can bud off large clathrin arrays that form at specific sites on the plasma membrane. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that sites at the plasma membrane that support the assembly of compact clusters of many individual coated pits could also account for the data observed. Nevertheless, the results unambiguously demonstrate the existence of sites within the plasma membrane that preferentially support the formation of large clathrin assemblies competent for endocytosis. Diverse classes of clathrin assemblies have been seen by several groups (9Rappoport J.Z. Benmerah A. Simon S.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Rappoport J.Z.

Importantly, whether these types of assemblies occur physiologically in cells or are an aberrant response due to cell attachment to glass or plastic is not known. To address this question, we used primary adipocytes in which the buoyancy conferred by the fat globule renders the cells incapable of touching solid substrate. We find that the organization of clathrin on the membrane of isolated primary adipocytes is similar to that reported by others in cultured cells (10Rappoport J.Z. Simon S.M. Benmerah A. Traffic. 2004; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Rappoport J.Z. Simon S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Moskowitz H.S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and is remarkable in that a large proportion of clathrin is found within large, apparently static assemblies. These results raise two important questions: first, whether these large apparently static structures are competent for endocytosis, and second, the molecular basis by which this organization is initiated and maintained. Experiments shown here indicate that large assemblies of clathrin support endocytosis. Our results are consistent with those of Merrifield et al. (15Merrifield C.J. Perrais D. Zenisek D. Cell. 2005; 121: 593-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), who used a pH-sensitive transferrin receptor construct to determine the endocytic competence of cell surface clathrin assemblies and the timing of endocytosis relative to actin polymerization. Our results indicate that 60% of all clathrin assemblies persist for 60 s or more. Furthermore, by visualizing transferrin we have been able to follow the fate of the ligand as it transfers from these large assemblies into the endocytic pathway. Our results demonstrate that vesicles containing transferrin emanate from clathrin patches that are not consumed as transferrin is internalized. These regions are not consumed, because clathrin is being continuously replaced into the patch from a pool of cytoplasmic clathrin, as evidenced by the recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching. High temporal resolution imaging of clathrin patches also reveals fluorescence intensity fluctuations of several milliseconds within these assemblies; these fluctuations are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with vesicle formation and detachment. Because both upward and downward regional fluctuations were observed, the results suggest that clathrin patches give rise to individual coated pits that form (upward intensity fluctuations) and detach (downward fluctuations), perhaps leaving small regions of uncoated membrane that can rapidly reassemble clathrin (Fig. 9). Whether clathrin patches contain a combination of flat arrays of clathrin as well as regions of coated pit clusters that rapidly assemble and disassemble cannot be distinguished at this point (Fig. 10). Regardless of this distinction, our results indicate unambiguously that clathrin organizes at the plasma membrane in specific persistent regions that are dynamic and support endocytosis. Not all clathrin-mediated endocytic events take place from large assemblies (17Ehrlich M. Boll W. Van Oijen A. Hariharan R. Chandran K. Nibert M.L. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2004; 118: 591-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In recent studies using spinning-disk confocal microscopy in which analysis was deliberately restricted to clathrin structures smaller than 3 pixels (600 nm) that appear and disappear within the imaging period of 7 min, the presence of cargo appeared to stabilize the transient assemblies of clathrin. These results suggested a model in which clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane occurs on random regions, which are then stabilized by the presence of cargo molecules. When restricted to the nonpersistent population of clathrin structures, and accounting for the fact that TIRF-M does not detect vesicles beyond 90–100 nm from plasma membrane assembly sites, the analysis of our data is not inconsistent with that reported by Ehrlich et al. (17Ehrlich M. Boll W. Van Oijen A. Hariharan R. Chandran K. Nibert M.L. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 2004; 118: 591-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) with regard to the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of this small subset of clathrin assemblies. However, our results demonstrating that large clathrin assemblies, which constitute the majority of the clathrin signal, are endocytically active underscore the importance of further investigation of the mechanism for initiation and maintenance of such assemblies. The physiological significance of the organization of clathrin into large assemblies is not known. One possibility may be that the interaction of both clathrin and actin assembly factors with phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2 may require organization around specific membrane regions enriched for these phospholipids. Further analysis of the spatial relationship between phospholipid metabolism and the different modalities of clathrin assembly may shed light on this important aspect of cellular architecture. We thank other members of the Corvera and Fogarty groups for helpful comments and support. In particular we acknowledge the valuable help of Isabelle Fay in helping establish the focus control parameters during the early stages of development of the microscope."

Here we characterize a low affinity anti-CD9 antibody, C9BB, which binds preferentially to homoclustered CD9. Using mAb C9BB as a tool, we show that cell surface CD9 homoclustering is promoted by expression of α3β1 and α6β4 integrins and by palmitoylation of the CD9 and β4 proteins. Conversely, CD9 is shifted toward heteroclusters upon expression of CD9 partner proteins (EWI-2 and EWI-F) or other tetraspanins, or upon ablation of CD9 palmitoylation. Furthermore, unpalmitoylated CD9 showed enhanced EWI-2 association, thereby demonstrating a previously unappreciated role for tetraspanin palmitoylation, and underscoring how depalmitoylation and EWI-2 association may collaborate to shift CD9 from homo- to heteroclusters. In conclusion, we have used a novel molecular probe (mAb C9BB) to demonstrate the existence of multiple types of CD9 complex on the cell surface. A shift from homo- to heteroclustered CD9 may be functionally significant because the latter was especially obvious on malignant epithelial tumor cells. Hence, because of its specialized properties, C9BB may be more useful than other anti-CD9 antibodies for monitoring CD9 during tumor progression.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CD9 also directly associates with itself, suggesting that CD9-CD9 homodimers are building blocks for larger tetraspanin complexes (30Kovalenko O.V. Yang X. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additional partners for CD9 include the laminin-binding integrins α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 (31Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One consequence of integrin-CD9 association is the recruitment of EWI-2, via CD9, into a functionally important EWI2-CD9-integrin complex, that affects integrin-dependent morphology and motility (32Stipp C.S.

Instead, cell surface tetraspanin studies have relied on covalent cross-linking, co-capping, immunofluorescence co-localization, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (45Levy S. Shoham T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 46Szollosi J. Horejsi V. Bene L. Angelisova P. Damjanovich S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2939-2946PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe a new tool, anti-CD9 mAb C9BB, which enables novel insights into CD9 molecular organization. mAb C9BB is distinct from other anti-CD9 antibodies in terms of binding affinity, and preference for clustered CD9. Using C9BB as a probe, we demonstrate the contrasting effects of protein palmitoylation, integrins, tetraspanins, and EWI proteins on CD9 organization, and we show that CD9 palmitoylation markedly affects CD9-EWI2 association. Furthermore, we provide evidence that homoclustered CD9 may diminish even more than total CD9 on malignant tumor cells, thus making C9BB particularly useful for monitoring tumor progression.Antibodies, Cells, and Chimeric Proteins—mAbs to tetraspanins CD9 (ALB6 and DU-ALL-1), CD63 (6H1), CD82 (M104); and to integrins α2 (A2-IIE10), α3 (A3-X8), β1 (TS2/16), and β4 (3E1) were referenced elsewhere (38Yang X.

FITC-ALB6 and FITC-MM2/57 were from Immunotech, and Research Diagnostics, respectively. Cultured human cell lines were purchased from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES plus antibiotics. For studies of endogenous CD9, we mostly used human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells (which have abundant CD9 levels) and for studies of CD9 mutants, we used RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells, since they express minimal endogenous CD9. Palmitoylation deficient CD9-Pal- and GFP-CD9-Pal- (containing 6 membrane-proximal Cys→Ser mutations) were 100% deficient in palmitate incorporation (30Kovalenko O.V. Yang X. Kolesnikova T.V.

Expression of EWI-2 in A431 cells was described elsewhere (32Stipp C.S. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following cell surface biotin labeling, cells were lysed in 1% Brij 96, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted as previously described (38Yang X. Kovalenko O.V. Tang W. Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Yang X. Claas C. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Chemical cross-linking of oligomerized CD9 was achieved as described previously (30Kovalenko O.V. Yang X. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact A431 cells were treated for 20-22 h with 50 μm 2-bromopalmitate (to block cysteine palmitoylation), and then cross-linked with a thiol-specific reagent, DTME (Pierce) prior to lysis. Alternatively, RD cells transiently expressing CD9 were treated with DTME 24-h post-transfection, and then lysed. Prior to cell lysis, residual free cysteines were blocked by incubation with 10 mm N-ethyl maleimide.Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For flow cytometry, cells were detached, stained on ice with either control IgG or specific mAbs (at ∼10 μg/ml for 30 min), followed by 20 min with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), and then analyzed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). At least 10,000 cells were counted per experiment, unless otherwise indicated. Background staining, obtained using negative control antibodies, was subtracted from all mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values prior to calculating antibody staining ratios. For confocal microscopy 2-color imaging, cells were cultured overnight on 60-mm dishes with coverglass bottoms (MaTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Cells were then stained on ice with anti-CD9 mAb C9BB, which was detected using ALEX-549-conjugated 2nd antibody (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR). The same cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated MM2/57 or FITC-ALB6 anti-CD9 mAbs. Slides were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and images were acquired through the z-axis (at 0.5-1 μm increments) and visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope, with LSM510 Meta software package.RESULTSCell Type-specific Variations in Recognition of CD9 by mAb C9BB—Compared with other anti-CD9 antibodies, mAb C9BB showed considerable variability in recognition of cell surface CD9. For example, on breast carcinoma HCC1419 cells, staining by C9BB was relatively high compared with anti-CD9 mAb MM2/57 (ratio C9BB/MM2/57, 0.55). In contrast, on MDA-MB-468 cells, the C9BB/MM2/57 ratio was 0.08 (Fig. 1). On human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells the C9BB/MM2/57 ratio is 0.29 (supplemental Fig. S1). At saturating levels on A431 cells, C9BB staining yielded a MFI of 99, whereas other anti-CD9 antibodies yielded high (MFI = 318, 327) or intermediate (MFI = 198, 243) values (supplemental Fig. S1). Because staining ratios among ALB6, DU-ALL-1, and MM2/57 were relatively stable, these three mAbs were used somewhat interchangeably to assess total CD9 in subsequent experiments. Evaluation of an extensive panel of cells showed consistently variable C9BB staining, relative to that seen using other CD9 antibodies such as DU-ALL-1 and ALB6 (supplemental Table S1). For example, C9BB/ALB-6 ratios ranged from 0.02 to 1.37, and C9BB/DU-ALL-1 ratios ranged from 0.05 to 0.74, mostly because of variations in C9BB staining (supplemental Table S1). Subsequent experiments (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were aimed at determining the molecular basis for widely varying recognition of CD9 by C9BB.FIGURE 2Integrin β4 palmitoylation alters C9BB staining of CD9. Integrin β4 wild type (β4-WT) and β4 lacking all 7 membrane-proximal cysteine palmitoylation sites (β4-7CS) were stably expressed in MDA-MB-435 cells (which lack endogenous β4) as previously described (38Yang X. Kovalenko O.V. Tang W. Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cell surface staining was measured by flow cytometry counting of ∼10,000 cells, using the indicated antibodies to CD9, integrin α6, and CD81. In each case, single fluorescence peaks were observed, yielding the indicated MFI values. r = C9BB/ALB-6 staining ratio, after background subtraction. Differences between C9BB and ALB-6, and between C9BB (β4-7CS) and C9BB (β4-WT) are highly significant (p < 0.005). Similar results have been seen in multiple experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3CD9 palmitoylation promotes C9BB staining. A, RD cells were transiently transfected to become >90% positive for untagged CD9-Wt or CD9-Pal-. At least 3000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in each experiment. r = C9BB/ALB6 and C9BB/MM257 mean fluorescence intensity ratios. Differences between C9BB and other CD9 antibodiesonRD-CD9-Pal- cells,andbetweenC9BB on CD9-Wt and CD9-Pal-cells are highly significant (p < 0.005). Similar results have been seen in multiple experiments. B, RD cells were transiently transfected with GFP-CD9 or GFP-CD9-Pal-. After 48 h, cells were stained with either C9BB or ALB6 mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry simultaneously for CD9-GFP expression (x-axis) and anti-CD9 mAb staining (using PE-conjugated 2nd Ab,y-axis). Right panels (upper right plus lower right) contain 11-12% of total CD9-Wt cells and 19-20% of total CD9-Pal- cells. C, live MCF-7 cells stably transfected with GFP-tagged CD9-Wt or CD9-Pal- were visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Variable integrin and EWI-2 effects on C9BB staining. A, 501-Mel cells were stably transfected with integrin α3 subunit (dark peaks) or mock-transfected (lighter peaks), and then analyzed by flow cytometry for CD9 (C9BB or ALB-6) and integrin α3 (mAb A3X8) expression. B, A431 cells were stably transfected with EWI-2 (solid line), or mock-transfected (dotted line), and analyzed by flow cytometry, using the indicated anti-CD9 antibodies. C, MDA-MD-231 cells and MCF-7 cells were labeled with biotin, lysed in 1% Brij 96, and then CD9 was immunoprecipitated using mAb MM2/57 or C9BB as indicated. Biotin-labeled proteins are visualized by blotting with Avidin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5C9BB preference for oligomerized CD9. A, RD cells, transiently transfected to express CD9, were treated with thiol-specific cross-linker, DTME, and then lysed in 1% Brij 96. The presence of constitutively free cysteines made treatment with 2-bromopalmitate unnecessary. Anti-CD9 antibodies ALB6, MM2/57, and C9BB were used for immunoprecipitation. B, A431 cells were incubated in growth medium supplemented with 50 μm 2-bromopalmitate for 20 h (to expose free cysteines) and then treated with DTME. Relative levels of each form of CD9 (right box) were determined from densitometric measurements. Note: although mutation of CD9 palmitoylation sites resulted in diminished C9BB staining of cell surface CD9 (Fig. 3), inhibition of CD9 palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate does not decrease C9BB binding in Fig. 5B. Once CD9 oligomers are stabilized by covalent cross-linking, presence or absence of palmitoylation becomes irrelevant. Furthermore, 2-bromopalmitate diminishes CD9 palmitoylation to an extent sufficient to enable covalent cross-linking, but not enough to affect cell surface recognition of CD9 by C9BB (not shown). Note: panels in A and B each are single, contiguous, unsectioned, gel images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6C9BB affinity, susceptibility to other tetraspanins and immunofluorescence localization. A, A431 cells were incubated with CD9 antibodies (C9BB or ALB6, at 15 μg/ml) for various times (upper panel) or for 30 min at various doses (lower panel), and then MFI values were determined by flow cytometry. B, MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected to express (panel a) vector alone, (panel b) additional CD9 (1.2-fold above endogenous) or (panel c) CD82 proteins. U937 cells were transfected to express CD9 alone (panel d) or CD9 plus CD81 (panel e). Flow cytometry analyses were carried out using the indicated anti-CD9 antibodies. Inset boxes show C9BB/ALB6 and C9BB/DU-ALL-1 ratios. MFI values for CD82 are 8.5, 11, and 105 in panels a, b, and c respectively. MFI values for CD81 are ∼10 and ∼200 in panels d and e respectively. C, for 2-color confocal microscopy analysis, A431 cells were stained with (panel a) C9BB (red), (panel b) MM2/57 (green), or (panel c) an overlay of both red and green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Palmitoylation Uniquely Affects CD9 Recognition by Monoclonal Antibody C9BB—Removal of palmitoylation sites from the integrin β4 subunit resulted in a substantial decrease in β4-dependent cell spreading and signaling, accompanied by diminished recognition of cell surface CD9 by mAb C9BB (38Yang X. Kovalenko O.V. Tang W. Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the same experiment, the total amount of cell surface CD9 did not change (38Yang X. Kovalenko O.V. Tang W. Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here we confirm and extend those results. Upon stable expression of either wild-type β4, or palmitoylation-deficient β4(β4-7CS) in MDA-MB-435 cells, amounts of cell surface CD9 (detected by flow cytometry, using mAb ALB6), integrin α6 (mostly associated with β4), and tetraspanin CD81 were relatively similar in both cell types (Fig. 2). In sharp contrast, staining by mAb C9BB was markedly diminished in cells expressing β4-7CS, as the C9BB/ALB6 staining ratio decreased from 0.58 to 0.085. We showed previously that physical association of CD9 with β4 is substantially diminished when β4 palmitoylation sites are removed (38Yang X. Kovalenko O.V. Tang W. Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Hence, absence of palmitoylation sites in β4-7CS is not causing β4 to shield the C9BB binding epitope.We then determined the effects of removing palmitoylation sites from CD9 itself. Untagged CD9-Wt and CD9-Pal- (lacking 6 membrane-proximal cysteines) were expressed at similar levels on the surface of RD cells, as detected by anti-CD9 mAbs ALB6 and MM2/57 (Fig. 3A). However, the palmitoylation-deficient protein again showed a decrease (>50%) in C9BB staining (Fig. 3A). Consequently there was a substantial decrease in C9BB/ALB6 (1.20 → 0.43) and C9BB/MM2/57 (0.64 → 0.27) ratios (Fig. 3A). As shown previously, C9BB immunoblotting of CD9 was undiminished upon removal of all 6 CD9 palmitoylation sites (Ref. 30Kovalenko O.V. Yang X. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and confirmed in Fig. 6B), indicating that the C9BB binding epitope on CD9 is not directly affected by the presence or absence of palmitoylation sites. In a separate experiment, we also analyzed GFP-tagged CD9 expression in RD cells. Again, both CD9-Wt and CD9-Pal- showed ample staining of CD9 with mAb ALB6 (Fig. 3B, right panels). However, among cells that were GFP-positive (right quadrants) CD9-Pal- cells showed only 0.3% staining for C9BB (Fig. 2B, bottom middle panel, upper right quadrant), whereas wild-type GFP-CD9 yielded 17.5% staining with C9BB (Fig. 3B, upper middle panel, upper right quadrant). By immunofluorescence microscopy, wild-type GFP-tagged CD9 appe"

In this study, we address the function of the conserved glycine- and phenyalanine-rich (G/F-rich) region of the Escherichia coli DnaJ in the DnaK chaperone cycle. We show that the G/F-rich region is critical for DnaJ co-chaperone functions in vivo and that despite a significant degree of sequence conservation among the G/F-rich regions of Hsp40 homologs from bacteria, yeast, or humans, functional complementation in the context of the E. coli DnaJ is limited. Furthermore, we found that the deletion of the whole G/F-rich region is mirrored by mutations in the conserved Asp-Ile/Val-Phe (DIF) motif contained in this region. Further genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that this amino acid triplet plays a critical role in regulation of the DnaK chaperone cycle, possibly by modulating a crucial step subsequent to DnaK-mediated ATP hydrolysis.

Molecular chaperones assist the folding of proteins, mainly by protecting them from intracellular aggregation (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). Of these, the highly conserved Hsp70 chaperone machine plays a central role in a plethora of cellular processes related to protein folding. Hsp70 assists the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, as well as protein translocation, disaggregation, and targeting for degradation (1Hartl F.U.

Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). All of these Hsp70 functions depend on the ability of Hsp70 to interact in an ATP-dependent manner with extended hydrophobic stretches of polypeptide substrates (2Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

To actively perform as a bona fide chaperone, Hsp70 necessitates the assistance of its Hsp40 co-chaperone partners, which efficiently stimulate both its intrinsically weak ATPase activity and facilitate its interaction with polypeptide substrates (2Bukau B.

Some Hsp70 family members additionally require other co-chaperone partners, such as GrpE, Bag-1, or HspBP1, to regulate substrate release and nucleotide exchange (5Brehmer D. Rudiger S. Gassler C.S.

Active J-domains contain a canonical His-Pro-Asp (HPD) triplet (in some cases Asp is replaced by Glu) that is essential for their activity. The members of the Hsp40 proteins family can be grouped in three classes with respect to their additional conserved domains (9Hennessy F. Nicoll W.S. Zimmermann R. Cheetham M.E. Blatch G.L.

Although the type II Hsp40 family members lack the central zinc-binding domain, the type III members only share the J-domain signature sequence with their related type I and II members (9Hennessy F. Nicoll W.S. Zimmermann R. Cheetham M.E. Blatch G.L. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).The role of the conserved G/F-rich region of both major type I and II family members has remained enigmatic. This region was originally proposed to be a flexible link between the J-domain and the central zinc-binding domain, but later evidence suggested different functions. For example, in E. coli, the N-terminal J-domain together with the flanking G/F-rich region of the type I Hsp40 member DnaJ were necessary and sufficient to activate DnaK (3Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DnaJ construct where the G/F-rich region was replaced by an unrelated sequence (HMGSHM hexapeptide) could efficiently stimulate DnaK ATPase activity and bind the σ32 substrate but could not efficiently activate DnaK itself to bind σ32 (22Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These results suggested that, in contrast to the N-terminal J-domain, the G/F-rich region does not directly trigger the stimulation of DnaK ATPase activity per se but may be rather involved in a mechanism that modulates substrate binding by DnaK. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this region seems to confer a certain degree of specificity. Indeed the G/F-rich region of the S. cerevisiae type II Hsp40 protein Sis1 could not be replaced by the G/F-rich region of the S. cerevisiae type I Ydj1 Hsp40 homolog, when complementation for the lethal phenotype of a Δsis1 strain was monitored (23Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7751-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An additional central aspect of the Sis1 G/F-rich region is that, although not essential for yeast growth, this region was specifically required for the maintenance of the yeast prion [RNQ+] (24Lopez N. Aron R. Craig E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Sondheimer N. Lopez N. Craig E.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, prion maintenance was specifically dependent upon the presence of a short stretch of amino acid residues in the Sis1 G/F-rich region not present in the Ydj1 homolog (24Lopez N. Aron R. Craig E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The NMR solution structure of the J-domain and the flanking G/F sequence of E. coli DnaJ revealed that in contrast to the compact structure of the J-domain, the G/F-rich region adopts an extended disordered conformation (26Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, a short stretch of amino acids in the G/F-rich region presents reduced local flexibility when compared with the rest of the region and undergoes rapid exchange between favored conformations (26Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This short segment corresponds to conserved Asp-Ile/Val-Phe triplets of amino acids in the DnaJ G/F-rich region, referred to as the DIF motif (see Fig. 1A) (22Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used in vivo and in vitro approaches to examine the role of the G/F-rich region and its DIF motif in the biology of DnaJ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Bacteriophages—All of the bacterial strains used in this study are derivatives of E. coli K-12. The strain Δ3 is an arabinose-resistant derivative of MC4100 dnaJ::Tn10-42 ΔcbpA::kan ΔdjlA::Ωspc (27Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain Δ4 is MC4100 Δara714 ΔdnaKdnaJ::kan thr::Tn10(Tet) ΔcbpA::kan ΔdjlA::Ωspc and was constructed as follows. The ΔdnaKdnaJ::kan allele from PK101 (28Kang P.J. Craig E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) tightly linked to the thr::Tn10(Tet) marker (laboratory collection) was introduced at 30 °C by P1 transduction into the arabinose-resistant strain MC4100 Δara714 ΔcbpA::kan ΔdjlA::Ωspc (29Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5747-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by selecting for tetracycline resistance. Subsequently, transductants were screened for temperature sensitivity and were further verified for the loss of DnaK and DnaJ by Western blot analysis. MG1655 dnaJ::Tn10-42 ΔcbpA::kan (27Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), referred to as Δ2, was used to test bacterial motility and bacteriophage λ growth using bacteriophages λcI and the dnaJ transducing phage λcIdnaJ+ (laboratory collection), essentially as described (27Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids pBAD22 and pBAD33 (30Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and pDM38(dnaKdnaJ) (34Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2613-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously.Alanine substitution mutants in the DIF motifs of DnaJ and DnaJ12 were constructed by PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis using the appropriated primers and plasmids pWKG90 or pWKG100. The entire deletion of the G/F-rich region (Δ72–108) of DnaJ was constructed by two-step PCR using pWKG90 and the primers: ΔG/F-for, 5′-gtatggtcatcaacgtgcggcgcgcggtgct-3′, and ΔG/F-rev, 5′-cgcacgttgatgaccatactgatcgtatgc-3′.To construct the chimerae consisting of the J-domain of DnaJ and the G/F-rich region of Ydj1 (DnaJ12-Ydj1 G/F), the G/F-rich region of Ydj1 was first PCR-amplified using primers Ydj1G/F-for (5′-ggggtaccgatggtctaagtggtgct-3′) and Ydj1G/F-rev (5′-gcggatccttatcttttgtgcgccaccagc-3′) and S. cerevisiae DNA (a gift of Dr. Martine Collart, University of Geneva). The resulting 124-bp fragment was digested with KpnI and BamHI and ligated into pWKG90KPN digested with the same enzymes. To construct the DnaJ12-Mdj1 G/F chimera, the G/F-rich region of Mdj1 was PCR-amplified using primers Mdj1G/F-for (5′-ggggtaccgctgccttcggcggcggc-3′) and Mdj1G/F-rev (5′-gcggatccttatgcgccaccgctaccgcg-3′) and S. cerevisiae DNA. The resulting 202-bp fragment was digested with KpnI-BamHI and ligated into pWKG90KPN digested with the same enzymes. The chimera comprising the DnaJ J-domain flanked by the G/F-rich region of Hdj2 (DnaJ12-Hdj2 G/F) was constructed by PCR using primers Hdj2G/F-for (5′-cgtggtacccaggcaattaaagagggt-3′) and Hdj2G/F-rev (5′-cgtagatctttatacaacatttttacctct-3′) and HeLa cells cDNA (a gift of Dr. Samuel Deutsch, University of Geneva) as template. The resulting 138-bp fragment was digested with KpnI and BglII and ligated into pWKG90KPN digested with the same enzymes.DjlAΔTM with the G/F-rich region of DnaJ attached at its C terminus was constructed as follows. A KpnI site was first introduced before the djlA stop codon by PCR using primers pdTMN-term-for (5′-ccggaattcatgcaggataaagcccgtagccgt-3′) and pdjlAC-termKpnI-rev (5′-cagcggtacctttaaaccctttctgctgctt-3′) and pWKG52. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and KpnI and ligated into pWKG100KPN digested with the same enzymes.To construct plasmid pGPPK, the dnaK gene plus its native promoter sequences was first amplified from plasmid pDM38 (dnaKdnaJ) using the primers 5′-gtgcagcacagcatcaggcta-3′ and 5′-ggaagcttggatccttattttttgtctttgacttcttcaaattc-3′. The resulting 2596-bp fragment was digested with HindIII and ligated into the EcoRV/HindIII-digested p29SEN. To construct DnaK with a C-terminal His6 tag, the dnaK gene was amplified with primers 5′-gcccatgggtaaaataattggtatcgacctg-3′ and 5′-gcaagcttcaatgatgatgatgatgatgttttttgtctttgacttcttc-3′ and cloned as an NcoI-HindIII fragment into pSE380 digested with the same enzymes. Control experiments both in vivo and in vitro indicated that the C-terminal addition of His6 to DnaK did not noticeably alter DnaK function. To construct the pGPE plasmid, the grpE gene was amplified by PCR using appropriated primers and cloned as an EcoRI/BglII fragment into the pSE380ΔNcoI vector digested with the same enzymes.Plasmids pGPJ-His and pGPJ3DIF-His, encoding respectively for the DnaJ wild type and the DnaJ-DIF proteins with a C-terminal His6 tag, were obtained as follows. The dnaJ wild type and dnaJ (3DIF) mutant sequences were amplified by PCR, using the primers dnaJN-term (5′-gggaattcaccatggctaagcaagattattac-3′) and dnaJC-term His6X (5′-gcagatctcaatgatgatgatgatgatggcgggtcaggtcgtcaaaaaac-3′). The 1167-bp fragments (containing dnaJ linked in frame with six additional C-terminal histidines) were cleaved with EcoRI-BglII and cloned into pSE380ΔNcoI digested with the same enzymes. The dnaJ (H33Q) mutant was constructed using the same strategy, except that the EcoRI-BglII fragment was inserted in pBAD22. Control experiments indicated that the C-terminal addition of His6 to DnaJ did not noticeably alter DnaJ function.The pBAD33 DnaJ and DnaJ-3DIF derivatives were obtained by subcloning the EcoRV-SphI-digested fragment of pWKG90 containing dnaJ wild type or dnaJ (3DIF) into the EcoRV-SphI-digested pBAD33 vector. All of the constructs obtained by PCR were sequenced-verified using the appropriate primers.In Vivo DnaJ Activity Assays—Bacterial motility and bacteriophage λ plating assays were performed at 30 °C as described previously (27Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess bacterial viability, fresh plasmid transformants were grown overnight at 30 °C, serially diluted, and spotted on LB agar plates supplemented when necessary with the appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/μl ampicillin, 20 μg/μl chloramphenicol) and various l-arabinose inducer concentrations. The plates were incubated at 30 and 40 °C for 20 h and at 14 °C for 6 days.Immunoblot Analysis—For steady state protein expression, whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (32Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). DnaJ proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), probed with anti-DnaJ rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences).Protein Purifications—To avoid a toxic effect of protein overexpression in wild type E. coli, DnaJ and DnaJ-3DIF were purified from the Δ4 strain. Fresh overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in 500 ml of LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/μl ampicillin and grown with vigorous shaking at 30 °C. At an A600 of 0.5, 1 mm IPTG was added, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h. For DnaJ-H33Q-His6 overexpression, IPTG was replaced by 0.5% of l-arabinose. The cells were harvested at 5000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor and resuspended in 10 ml of J1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.6% (w/v) Brij 58). The cells were incubated on ice for 45 min and then sonicated twice for 10 s to reduce viscosity. After centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman 35 Ti rotor, the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of J2 buffer (1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 500 μl of protease inhibitor mix; Sigma) and then gently tumbled at 4 °C for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 90 min in a Beckman 35 Ti rotor. Supernatants (5 ml) were applied to 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns preequilibrated with 5 volumes of J2 buffer (without protease inhibitors). The following steps were performed as described in the procedure from Qiagen for purification of His6-tagged proteins from E. coli using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow under native conditions, using buffer J2 supplemented with 20 mm imidazole as washing buffer and with 250 mm imidazole as elution buffer. The proteins were stored at –80 °C in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol.DnaK with a C-terminal His6 tag was purified from strain Δ4. The cells were grown at 30 °C to mid-exponential phase, protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h, and purification was performed as described in the Qiagen protocol. The proteins were stored at –80 °C in TEG buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol).Purified GrpE protein was a kind gift of Dr. Krzysztof Liberek (University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland). Protein concentrations were routinely measured by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard and estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis.Luciferase Aggregation and Refolding Assays—Luciferase aggregation was performed as follows. 25 μm luciferase (Promega) was denatured in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT for 2 h at 22 °C. The reactions were initiated by a 100-fold dilution of denatured luciferase into a premix containing the indicated concentrations of DnaJ proteins in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT. Aggregation kinetics were followed at 22 °C by measuring light scattering at 320 nm. Luciferase refolding was essentially assessed as described (35Genevaux P. Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7906-7912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Specifically, luciferase 25 μm (Sigma) was denatured as described above and diluted 100-fold into a premix containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.015% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 5 mm ATP, 2 μm DnaK, and 0.5 μm DnaJ. After 10 min, the indicated concentration of GrpE was added. The luciferase activity was monitored at 22 °C by using the luciferase assay system from Promega (E1500) and a Turner luminometer (TD-20/20).Co-immunoprecipitation—The co-immunoprecipitation experiments were\carried out as described previously (36Deloche O. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28539-28544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), except that Pansorbin was replaced by IgGsorb (The Enzyme Center, Malden).Steady State and Single-turnover ATPase Assays—The steady state ATPase assay was performed essentially as described, with minor modifications (4Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The standard reaction conditions were 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 0.29 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 μm DnaK, 1 μm GrpE, and DnaJ or DnaJ mutants in the range 0–0.8 μm. When necessary, 250 nm of luciferase (Promega) denatured with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride was added in the reaction mix. Aliquots were removed from the reaction at the specified time points and spotted onto polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates (Merck). The plates were resolved with a 1:1 solvent mixture 1 m formic acid, 1 m LiCl. The amount of liberated γ-phosphate was quantified using phosphorimaging.Single-turnover ATPase assay was performed as described by Mayer et al. (37Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 15 μm DnaK was incubated with 800 μm ATP and 12 μCi [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 2 min on ice. DnaK-[α-32P]ATP complexes were then rapidly separated from free nucleotides with a Sephadex G50 Nick-column (Amersham Biosciences). The aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The reactions were initiated by adding DnaK-[α-32P]ATP complex to a premix containing 0.4 μm DnaJ in buffer A maintained at 25 °C. Aliquots (2 μl) were spotted onto polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates (Merck) and separated with 150 mm formic acid, 0.150 mm LiCl, and the ADP was quantified using phosphorimaging.RESULTSFunctional Conservation of the G/F-rich Region among Hsp40 Family Members—The G/F-rich region of Hsp40 family members is characterized by a relatively high frequency of glycine and phenylalanine residues, with one universally conserved sequence motif DIF (Fig. 1A). To gain insight into the function of this region, we first asked whether functional conservation could be observed among type I Hsp40 G/F-rich regions from several organisms. To this end, we constructed a series of chimerae where the G/F-rich region of E. coli DnaJ was replaced by the corresponding region from either yeast (cytosolic Ydj1 and mitochondrial Mdj1) or human (cytosolic Hdj2) type I Hsp40s. To minimize complexity, these chimerae were constructed in the stringent context of DnaJ12, which comprises the N-terminal amino acids 1–108 containing the J-domain and the G/F-rich region and is the smallest known part of E. coli DnaJ sufficient and necessary to partially support its DnaK co-chaperone function (21Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These constructs were then tested in vivo for their ability to complement the various phenotypes of the E. coli strain Δ3, which lacks all three Hsp40 co-chaperones of DnaK, namely DnaJ, CbpA, and DjlA (29Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5747-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We observed that none of the yeast and human G/F-rich regions tested are able to fully functionally replace the E. coli G/F-rich region (Fig. 1B). Specifically, although all the chimerae efficiently support bacterial growth at high temperature and λ propagation in the Δ3 strain, no complementation for bacterial growth at low temperature was observed for any of the chimerae (Fig. 1B; compare DnaJ12 to DnaJ12-Ydj1 G/F, DnaJ12-Mdj1 G/F, and DnaJ12-Hdj2 G/F). Steady state accumulation levels of the chimerae at permissive temperature (30 °C) were similar to those of DnaJ12 (data not shown). Among the chimerae tested, the DnaJ12-Hdj2 G/F construct exhibited the weakest complementation activity and, in contrast to the yeast chimerae, even exerted a negative effect on E. coli growth and λdnaJ+ transducing phage propagation at a permissive temperature (30 °C).We next asked whether addition of the G/F-rich region of DnaJ could convert a non-type I Hsp40 homolog into a functional DnaJ-like co-chaperone in vivo. To answer this, we grafted the G/F-rich region of DnaJ to the C-terminal part of the E. coli type III Hsp40 DjlA protein, a bona fide DnaK co-chaperone that does not efficiently complement DnaJ function in vivo for either bacterial growth at high and low temperatures or λ propagation (29Genevaux P. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5747-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 35Genevaux P. Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Kelley W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7906-7912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chimera (DjlAΔTM G/F) was able to rescue all of the phenotypes of the E. coli Δ3 mutant strain tested, including bacterial growth at low temperature (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that the G/F-rich region of DnaJ retains a substantial degree of specificity and is critical for DnaJ function in E. coli.The DIF Motif of the G/F-rich Region Is Critical for DnaJ Function in Vivo—The G/F-rich region of the Hsp40 proteins includes the conserved Asp-Ile/Val-Phe triplet of amino acids, referred to as DIF (Fig. 1A). The E. coli DnaJ G/F-rich region possesses three such repeats. To investigate whether this DIF motif is important for DnaJ function, we first replaced all of the nine amino acid residues comprising the DIF motif by alanines in the stringent context of DnaJ12 (DnaJ (1–108)) and tested the resulting mutant for complementation in our in vivo assays. As judged by the inability of the DnaJ12–3DIF mutant to support propagati"

Here, we show in a variety of cell types that the propeptide of ADAMTS9 is not excised intracellularly. Pulse-chase analysis in HEK293F cells indicated that the intact zymogen was secreted to the cell surface and was subsequently processed there before release into the medium. The processing occurred via a furin-dependent mechanism as shown using PC inhibitors, lack of processing in furin-deficient cells, and rescue by furin in these cells. Moreover, down-regulation of furin by small interference RNA reduced ADAMTS9 processing in HEK293F cells. PC5A could also process pro-ADAMTS9, but similarly to furin, processed forms were absent intracellularly. Cell-surface, furin-dependent processing of pro-ADAMTS9 creates a precedent for extracellular maturation of endogenously produced secreted proproteins.

It also indicates the existence of a variety of mechanisms for processing of ADAMTS proteases. Zinc metalloendopeptidases, like most proteases, are synthesized as zymogens, and the N-terminal propeptide is usually excised. Propeptide excision usually leads to enzymatic activation, an important regulatory event, and it can occur intracellularly, at the cell surface, or extracellularly through a variety of proteolytic mechanisms. In one such mechanism, the propeptide is proteolytically excised by serine proteases of the mammalian subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (PC) 4The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; TGN, trans-Golgi network; Pro-Cat, signal peptide, propeptide, and catalytic domain; cmk, chloromethyl ketone; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; siRNA, small interference RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type 1 repeats. 4The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; TGN, trans-Golgi network; Pro-Cat, signal peptide, propeptide, and catalytic domain; cmk, chloromethyl ketone; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; siRNA, small interference RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type 1 repeats. family (1Thomas G.

Furin cleaves on the carboxyl side of a consensus recognition site that is rich in basic residues (e.g. Arg-Xaa-Arg/Lys-Arg↓) (2Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol.

However, the physiological role of cell-surface or secreted furin in processing endogenous cellular products has remained elusive.The ADAMTS proteases are a family of 19 secreted enzymes, of which some have critical physiological functions and have been implicated in inherited human disorders, namely Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC (ADAMTS2), Weill-Marchesani syndrome (ADAMTS10), and inherited thrombocytopenic purpura (ADAMTS13) (23Apte S.S.

Overexpression of ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS4 is implicated in proteolytic loss of aggrecan, a major cartilage component, in arthritis (27Arner E.C. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ADAMTS proteases (except ADAMTS13, the von Willebrand factor-processing protease, whose propeptide contains 41 amino acid residues) are synthesized with propeptides of ∼220-240 amino acids, which are larger than the MMP and ADAM propeptides. Almost all ADAMTS propeptides have consensus sites for the attachment of N-linked oligosaccharide (Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser, where Xaa is any amino acid except Pro). Consensus recognition sequences for PCs are present at the junction of the propeptide and catalytic domain, and ADAMTS proteases may have additional, more N-terminal PC-processing sites within their propeptides. Previous studies of ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS7 suggested that, like ADAMs and the furin-processed MMPs, ADAMTS proteases were processed in the TGN by PCs, although some cell-surface processing of ADAMTS7 was also observed (11Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C.

This potential biological significance of ADAMTS9 prompted an in-depth analysis of the processing of its propeptide. In the initial characterization of ADAMTS9, we demonstrated that it could be processed at more than one site (30Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In continuing these studies, we have made the unexpected observation that ADAMTS9 processing is exclusively extracellular and occurs at the cell surface in cells that express high levels of furin. These results establish a precedent for the cell-surface activation of precursor endogenous proteins by furin and are possibly of broad biological relevance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmids for expression of full-length ADAMTS9, or a truncated form containing the signal peptide, propeptide, and catalytic domain (Pro-Cat) with C-terminal Myc and His tags were described previously (30Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Due to low expression levels of full-length ADAMTS9, we excised its open reading frame with the Myc-His tags as a NotI/PmeI fragment and then recloned this into pCEP4 (Invitrogen) digested with KpnI and blunt-ended followed by NotI digestion. To insert a FLAG tag between Thr276 and Arg277 in the propeptide, site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) was performed using the forward primer 5′-AATAAGACGGACAACACAGACTACAAGACGATGACGACAAGAGAGAAAAGAGGACCCAC-3′ (with FLAG encoding site underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-GTGGGTCCTCTTTTCTCTCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCTGTGTTGTCCGTCTTATT-3′ (FLAG encoding site underlined). Plasmids for expression of full-length ADAMTS1 or the propeptide and catalytic domain of ADAMTS7 (ADAMTS7-Pro-Cat) were previously described (11Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K.

New Zealand White male rabbits (7-8 pounds) were immunized with the conjugates at biweekly intervals for 8 weeks. After an initial injection in Freund's complete adjuvant, subsequent injections were given in incomplete adjuvant. Antibody titer was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using free peptides. Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared using the respective immobilized antigens. Anti-penta-His monoclonal antibody, anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were obtained from commercial sources (Invitrogen and Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-furin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Immunoblotting was done using denaturing SDS-PAGE and electroblotting to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane followed by detection of the bound antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Treatments—HEK293F cells stably transfected with ADAMTS9 or Pro-Cat, COS-1 cells, LoVo cells (ATCC no.

Transient transfections were done using FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. For inhibition of PCs, cells were treated with the PC inhibitory peptide dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk, Calbiochem) at different concentrations as indicated or with the polypeptide α1-PDX (Portland variant of α 1-antitrypsin) (37Dufour E.K.

As a control to eliminate cell-surface proteins, cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mm EDTA for 20 min on ice, and trypsin was subsequently inactivated with 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented medium.To examine the fate of cell-surface biotinylated protein, biotinylated cells were transferred to serum-free medium, and cells and media were collected at sequential time points. Biotinylated proteins were captured from samples using streptavidin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies.Pro-Cat was purified from lysates of stably transfected cells using Pro-Bond resin (Invitrogen). For determination of processing of exogenously added Pro-Cat by cells, untransfected HEK293F cells were cultured to confluence on 6-well plates and then in 293 SFM-II medium (Invitrogen). Purified Pro-Cat (50 μg/well) was added to untransfected HEK293F cells, and the cells were cultured further over an 8-h period. The medium was taken for analysis at successive time points. In parallel experiments purified Pro-Cat was incubated with cell-free conditioned medium from HEK293F cells to investigate whether the processing was cell-mediated or not. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc.Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Removal of N-linked carbohydrate with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was performed as previously described (30Somerville R.P.

Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and LoVo cells were transfected with Pro-Cat alone or together with plasmids encoding the proprotein convertases furin, PACE4, and PC5A (kindly provided by Dr. Nabil Seidah). 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated in 293 SFM-II medium for 24 h, and Western blotting of the cell lysate and medium was performed with anti-Myc.Cell-surface Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—48 h after transfection with the Pro-FLAG-Cat plasmid, HEK293F cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with the thiolcleavable, membrane-nonpermeable cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (Pierce Endogen, Rockford, IL) to cross-link molecules at the cell surface. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged. The soluble portion of the lysate was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated overnight with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C with rotation. Anti-FLAG-agarose was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and washed six times in lysis buffer. The supernatant was discarded, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine/HCl (pH 3.5) from the resin. The eluted samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-furin monoclonal antibody (Alexis Biochemicals) or RP4 antibody.Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase Analysis—HEK-293F cells stably expressing Pro-Cat were grown to confluence and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with cysteinemethionine-free medium containing radioactive cysteine/methionine (50 μCi/well in 6-well plates, Pulse medium) for 15 min using EXPRE35S35S (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For pulse-chase analysis, the pulse medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times on ice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2, followed by incubation for 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Chase medium) at 37 °C. At the end of the chase period, cells were placed on ice, the medium was collected, and the cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with lysis buffer. In parallel, samples were processed for removal of cell-surface proteins in these assays by treatment with trypsin/EDTA for 20 min on ice, and trypsin was subsequently inactivated with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented medium. The media and cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc followed by fluorography as described previously (30Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M.

After 48 h of incubation without antibiotics, the medium was changed to 293 SFM-II medium (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated for a further 24 h. The conditioned medium and cell lysate were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-RP4. Cell-surface biotinylation was done as above.RESULTSThe Proteolytically Processed ADAMTS9 Propeptide Is Present in the Conditioned Medium but Not in the Cell Lysate—The ADAMTS9 propeptide (Fig. 1, A and B) has five consensus furin-recognition sequences (Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Arg). Arg-Lys-Asp-Arg33 and Arg-Thr-Arg-Arg74 are near the signal peptidase processing site, whereas the remaining three sites (Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg280, Arg-Thr-His-Arg283, and Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg287) overlap and are clustered near the junction of the propeptide and catalytic domain. We previously showed that mutation of Arg74 and Arg287 abrogated processing at these sites, whereas mutation of Arg280, which compromised two putative sites, was without effect (30Somerville R.P. Longpre J.M. Jungers K.A. Engle J.M. Ross M. Evanko S. Wight T.N. Leduc R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9503-9513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The propeptide also contains three sequence motifs for attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 1B), whereas the catalytic domain has none.Two nonoverlapping synthetic peptides from the propeptide (RP1 and RP4; sequences are not provided for proprietary reasons of Triple Point Biologics) within the propeptide were used for the production of polyclonal antisera. In HEK293F cells stably expressing full-length ADAMTS9 (Fig. 2A), anti-RP4 recognized the expected ∼180-kDa zymogen in the cell lysate. Smaller polypeptides (37 kDa and a ∼20-22-kDa doublet) were recognized in the conditioned medium. These bands were not seen in untransfected HEK293F cells (Fig. 2A). When the medium was deglycosylated using PNGase F, the 37-kDa band and the ∼22-kDa doublet increased in mobility and migrated at 28 and 15 kDa, respectively, demonstrating the presence of N-linked carbohydrate (Fig. 2B), characteristic of propeptide fragments. Notably, the ∼22-kDa doublet converted to a ∼15-kDa doublet, indicating two protein species rather than glycoforms of the same fragment. When these experiments were conducted using an ADAMTS9 active site mutant (ADAMTS9 Glu381 → Ala, a widely used metalloprotease inactivating mutation (12Kuno K. Terashima Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18821-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K.

In Western blotting with anti-RP1 the medium showed a weakly immunoreactive 37-kDa band but not the ∼22-kDa doublet (Fig. 2C), whereas PNGase F treatment clearly resolved the 28-kDa band seen with RP4 and a 15-kDa doublet also seen with RP4. The comparable results with RP4 and RP1 as well as the presence of glycosylation identified these fragments in the medium as originating from the propeptide. The RP1 peptide is adjacent to an N-linkage site, and the carbohydrate may mask reactivity of the ∼22-kDa fragments without prior PNGase F treatment. Because anti-RP4 provided more robust immunoreactivity, it was used in subsequent experiments.FIGURE 2Characterization of propeptide antibodies and absence of intracellular processing in cells transfected with various ADAMTS9 plasmids.

The results were identical, i.e. anti-RP4 detected the intact Pro-Cat zymogen (55 kDa) only in the cell lysate, and 37- and 20-22-kDa fragments were found only in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2D). Similarly, anti-Myc detected only the unprocessed 55-kDa Pro-Cat zymogen in the cell lysate, and only the processed catalytic domain (29 kDa) in conditioned medium (Fig. 2D). Incubation of conditioned medium with PNGase F enhanced the mobility of propeptide fragments to the same extent as with full-length ADAMTS9 (Fig. 2E). That these fragments originated from the propeptide was further verified by insertion of a FLAG epitope tag between Thr276 and Arg277, i.e. upstream of the furin processing site at Arg287. Western blotting with anti-FLAG provided similar results to that with anti-RP4, with differences (Fig. 2F) reflecting distinct locations of the FLAG and RP4 epitopes within the propeptide. These results demonstrate that the propeptide is part of the intact zymogen in HEK293F cells, but that it is present as a distinct, proteolytically derived entity in their conditioned medium.We conclude that the 37-kDa band seen with all propeptide antibodies corresponds to the complete propeptide. When deglycosylated, its size (28 kDa), is compatible with processing at the most N- and C-terminal PC processing sites, i.e. Leu34-Arg287 (28 kDa). The site at which the processing of the pro"

In this study we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induction by AP-2α. We found that AP-2α induced apoptosis efficiently in cells treated with benzyloxycar-bonyl-IETD-fluoromethyl ketone or FADD-silenced cells but failed to do so in benzyloxycarbonyl-LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone-treated or apoptosis protease activation factor-1 (Apaf1)-silenced cells, suggesting the central role of mitochondria in AP-2α-induced apoptosis. In good correlation, cells overexpressing AP-2α showed a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release into cytosol, and Bax translocation into mitochondria. We found that the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is important for AP-2α-induced apoptosis as adenovirus AP2 failed to induce apoptosis in HCT116 Bax–/– cells. However, we found the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) inhibitor Smac/DIABLO may have a limited role in AP-2α-induced apoptosis as we found the IAP member Survivin down-regulated by AP-2α. Although the total Bax level remains unaltered, we found a time-dependent increase in the activated form of Bax in adenovirus AP2-infected cells. In addition, we show that AP-2α transcriptionally represses Bcl-2 by binding to its promoter both in vitro and in vivo and that this is essential for AP-2α-induced apoptosis as ectopic expression of Bcl-2 efficiently inhibited apoptosis induced by AP-2α. Furthermore, we show that chemotherapy-induced endogenous AP-2α down-regulates Bcl-2 and induces apoptosis in an AP-2α-dependent manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that inhibition of okadaic acid or staurosporine-sensitive pathways in AP-2α overexpressing breast cancer cells resulted in AP-2α-dependent apoptosis induction. These results suggest that AP-2α induces apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2 and utilizing a bax/cytochrome c/Apaf1/caspase 9-dependent mitochondrial pathway. Activator protein 2α (AP-2α) induces cytotoxicity by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induction by AP-2α. We found that AP-2α induced apoptosis efficiently in cells treated with benzyloxycar-bonyl-IETD-fluoromethyl ketone or FADD-silenced cells but failed to do so in benzyloxycarbonyl-LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone-treated or apoptosis protease activation factor-1 (Apaf1)-silenced cells, suggesting the central role of mitochondria in AP-2α-induced apoptosis. In good correlation, cells overexpressing AP-2α showed a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release into cytosol, and Bax translocation into mitochondria. We found that the pro-apoptotic protein Bax is important for AP-2α-induced apoptosis as adenovirus AP2 failed to induce apoptosis in HCT116 Bax–/– cells. However, we found the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) inhibitor Smac/DIABLO may have a limited role in AP-2α-induced apoptosis as we found the IAP member Survivin down-regulated by AP-2α.

AP-2α has been shown to regulate many genes involved in variety of biological functions (9Higler-Eversheim K. Moser M. Schorle H. Buettner R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidences indicate that AP-2α may act as a tumor suppressor gene. AP-2α gene is located in chromosome position 6p22, a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in breast and other cancers (10Piao Z. Lee K.S. Kim H. Perucho M. Malakhosyan S.

In good correlation, expression of dominant negative mutant AP-2α resulted in increased invasiveness and tumorigenicity (21Gershenwald J.E. Sumner W. Calderone T. Wang Z. Huang S. Bar-Eli M.

Significant correlation between AP-2α expression and p21WAF1/CIP1 has been observed in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and malignant melanoma (15Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I.

Loktev A.V. Weigel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45028-45033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Results from our laboratory suggest that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of AP-2α inhibits growth of cancer cells by inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis (25Wajapeyee N. Somasundaram K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52093-52101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent work establishes that AP-2α is induced in cancer cells upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs, which contributes to chemosensitivity because the simultaneous inhibition of AP-2α by siRNA increases the chemoresistance. In addition, the re-expression of epigenetically silenced AP-2α in breast cancer resulted in enhanced chemosensitivity and loss of tumorigenicity upon chemotherapy in an AP-2α-dependent manner (26Wajapeyee N. Raut C.G. Somasundaram K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8628-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results point out the importance of apoptosis induction by AP-2α for its functions, particularly the role in chemosensitivity.The molecular mechanism by which AP-2α induces apoptosis is not known. In the present study we have analyzed the pathways and various molecules involved in AP-2α-induced apoptosis. We found that AP-2α-induced apoptosis requires primarily the mitochondrial pathway involving a bax/cytochrome c/Apaf1/caspase 9-dependent mechanism. We also found that AP-2α binds to the Bcl-2 promoter leading to its transcriptional down-regulation and is essential for the apoptosis induction by AP-2α. In addition, we provide evidence that the overexpressed AP-2α (perhaps functionally inactive) in certain breast cancer cells can be made functional by inhibiting survival signaling pathways sensitive to okadaic acid and staurosporine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Adenoviruses, siRNA, Cell Lines, and Culture Conditions—pCEP4/AP-2α was generated by cloning AP-2α cDNA as a BamHI/HindIII fragment originally derived from pSG5/AP-2α, which was kindly provided by Dr. P.

Sequences of PCR primers for Survivin and Bcl-2 are the following: Survivin (S, 5′-CAGATTTGAATCGCGGGACCC-3′, AS, 5′-CCAAGTCTGGCTCGTTCTCAG-3′); Bcl-2 (S, 5′-CCTGTGGATGACTGAGTACC-3′, and AS, 5′-GAGACAGCCAGGAGAAATCA-3′).MTT Assay and Stable Colony Suppression Assay—MTT assay was carried out as described previously (25Wajapeyee N. Somasundaram K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52093-52101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For colony suppression assay, the cells were transfected with pCEP4 and pCEP4/AP-2α plasmids and selected on hygromycin (250 μg/ml).Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—Alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were analyzed by flow cytometry using the Δψm-sensitive dye JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′ tetrachloro-1,1′3,3′tetraethylben-zimidazolcarbocyanine iodide; Calbiochem) (33Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 1× PBS, and incubated with 1 μm JC-1 at 37 °C for 10 min. Stained cells were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry. JC-1 monomers emit at 527 nm (FL-1 channel), and “J-aggregates” emit at 590 nm (FL-2 channel). Valinomycin-treated cells were used for compensation (FL-1-FL-2), and a cytofluorometric profile from these cells defines the 590-nm cutoff for untreated versus treated cells.Generation of Bcl-2 Stable Cell Lines—SW480 cells were transfected with Bcl-2 plasmid (pD5neo-bcl-2) and selected for G418 resistance (800 μg/ml). Medium was changed periodically every third day. Resistant colonies were cloned and screened for Bcl-2 expression by Western blot analysis. Positive clones were checked for clonal purity and used for further experiments.Preparation of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Fractions—Cells were lysed in buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors, which contained antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin). Lysis buffer was added and incubated for 30 min on ice. In addition the cells were homogenized by 30 strokes in a 22-guage needle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect the mitochondrial pellets. The supernatant after mitochondrial pelleting was used as a cytosolic fraction.Luciferase Assay—Transfections were carried out either by using Escort III (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. In all transfections 1 μg of pCMV-LacZ DNA was added to normalize the transfection efficiency variation between samples. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (22Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 28-32Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The DNA binding domain of AP-2α (165–437) is purified as GST-AP-2α fusion protein and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Double-stranded probes were end-labeled by the T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe and 1 μg/reaction of poly(dI-dC) was added in a 20-μl reaction volume (containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the competing oligonucleotides) for 30 min on ice. Samples were loaded onto 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA, 5% acrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C. The following oligonucleotides and their complements were synthesized and annealed: Bcl-2wt, 5-CTAATTTTTACTCCCTCTCCCCCCGACTCCTGA-3′; Bcl-2m, 5′-CTAATTTTTACTCCTATTCCCAAAGACTCCTGA-3′; SV40-AP2wt, 5-GATCCAAAGTCCCCAGGCTCCCCAG-3′; SV40-AP2m, 5-GATCCAAAGTCTCCGAATTCTCGAG-3′.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (34MacLachlan T.K. El-Deiry W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent SW480 cells that were infected with Ad-AP2 for 24 h were treated with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 7 min at room temperature. Chemical cross-linking was terminated by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m followed by additional incubation for 5 min. After a wash with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 10 μg/ml antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin and kept at 4 °C for 10 min. The chromatin was then sonicated as described (34MacLachlan T.K. El-Deiry W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar) so that the total DNA is sheared to 200–1000 bases in length. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin). Diluted chromatin was precleared with protein A-agarose beads saturated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and salmon sperm DNA (500 μg/ml) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C using anti-AP-2 (C-18, Santa Cruz) or anti-mouse lamin B (Oncogene) and immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose beads. The beads were extensively washed, and then chromatin was eluted from beads by incubation in elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 2 h. Cross-links were then reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C in elution buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 30 μg of RNase A/ml. A 20% equivalent amount of diluted chromatin was similarly processed without immunoprecipitation and noted as “input” afterward. DNA samples were then purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and further analyzed by PCR for the region of interest. The primers used to amplify a 173-bp fragment spanning –129 to +44 of Bcl-2 promoter are as follows: upstream primer, 5-CGGTTGGGATTCCTGCGGATT-3′, and downstream primer, 5-AATTGCATAAGGCAACGATCCC-3′.RESULTSAP-2α Induces Apoptosis through an Intrinsic Pathway—AP-2α overexpression is highly cytotoxic to cancer cells as it inhibits cellular DNA synthesis leading to G1 cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis. To study the relative role of intrinsic versus extrinsic pathway in AP-2α-induced apoptosis, we examined the cells infected with AP-2α adenovirus (Ad-AP2) for activated forms of major effector caspases and their importance. In all our experiments where recombinant adenoviruses were used, a control adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) was also used. Infection of H460 human lung carcinoma cells with Ad-AP2 resulted in efficient induction of apoptosis as seen by the appearance of cells with less than a 2N amount of DNA, representing apoptotic cells, by 48 h of virus infection (Fig. 1A) and efficient PARP cleavage in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). AP-2α overexpression activated caspase 3, 8, and 9 as seen by the appearance of cleaved forms of these caspases in Ad-AP2- but not in Ad-LacZ-infected cells (Fig. 1C). In good correlation, AP-2α-induced caspase activation also coincided with PARP cleavage (Fig. 1C). We also found that caspase activation is essential for AP-2α-induced apoptosis as the pan caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, inhibited apoptotic cell death in Ad-AP2-infected cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, z-VAD-fmk treatment completely reversed the suppression of colony formation by AP-2α (Fig. 2B; compare pCEP4/AP-2α + z-VAD-fmk with pCEP4/AP-2α).FIGURE 2AP-2α induces apoptosis through caspase 9-dependent mitochondrial pathway. A, H460 cells were either infected with either Ad-LacZ or Ad-AP2 at a 20 m.o.i. in the absence or presence of various inhibitors as indicated. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected for FACS analysis. Apoptotic population measured as cells with less than 2N DNA content has been quantitated and presented in the table. B, SW480 cells were either transfected with pCEP4 or pCEP4/AP2α. After 48 h of transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with z-VAD-fmk (25 μm), z-LEHD-fmk (40 μm), or z-IETD-fmk (40 μm), and all the transfected samples were selected for hygromycin resistance. Medium was removed every 4th day and replenished with respective inhibitors and hygromycin (250 μg/ml). After the appearance of visible colonies, the plates were then stained with Coomassie Blue (CBB R-250) and shown. C, SW480 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with lamin or Apaf1 siRNA. After 4 days of siRNA transfection, total RNA was prepared and subjected to RT-PCR analysis for Apaf1, lamin, and GAPDH transcripts. D, SW480 cells were not transfected (Control) or were mock-transfected or transfected with lamin or Apaf1 siRNA. After 4 days of siRNA transfection, total cell lysate was prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis for Apaf1 and Actin proteins. E, SW480 cells were transfected with lamin or Apaf1 siRNA. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-AP2 at a 20 m.o.i. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points post-infection and subjected to FACS analysis. Apoptotic population measured as cells with less than a 2N content of DNA is quantitated and shown at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because both caspases 8 and 9 were activated in Ad-AP2-infected cells, we next determined the relative roles of the extrinsic (caspase 8-mediated) and intrinsic (caspase 9-mediated) pathways in AP-2α-induced apoptosis. To address this point, we used caspase 8- and 9-specific inhibitors as well as an siRNA approach. The caspase 9-specific inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk), but not caspase 8-specific inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk), efficiently inhibited AP-2α-induced apoptosis as seen by the reduced percentage of cells with less than a 2N content of DNA (Fig. 2A). In good correlation, colony suppression by AP-2α is completely reversed by z-LEHD-fmk but not by z-IETD-fmk (Fig. 2B). These results suggest the primary utilization of caspase 9, but not caspase 8, by AP-2α to induce apoptosis. To confirm this fact, we analyzed the role of FADD (the adapter protein, which acts upstream of caspase 8) and Apaf1 (which normally complexes with cytochrome c and caspase 9 to form an active apoptosome complex) in AP-2α-induced apoptosis. We found that AP-2α is able to induce apoptosis efficiently in cells where the expression of FADD is silenced by siRNA (see supplemental Fig. S1). On the other hand, AP-2α failed to induce apoptosis in Apaf1-silenced cells (see below). Transfection of Apaf1-specific siRNA reduced the levels of Apaf1 transcript but not lamin transcript (Fig. 2C, lane 3) and Apaf1 protein (Fig. 2D, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Similarly, lamin siRNA reduced the lamin but not Apaf1 transcript (Fig. 2C, lane 2) and Apaf1 protein (Fig. 2D, lane 3). Neither siRNA inhibited the level of GAPDH transcript (Fig. 2C) and actin protein (Fig. 2D). Although Ad-AP2 induced apoptosis in the cells transfected with lamin-specific siRNA efficiently, it failed to do so in the cells transfected with Apaf1-specific siRNA (Fig. 2E). The percentage of apoptotic cells in Ad-AP2 virus-infected cells was reduced from 49.48% in the lamin siRNA-transfected group to 6.23% apoptotic cells in the AP-2α siRNA-transfected group at 72 h after virus infection. These results suggest that caspase 8-mediated extrinsic pathway is dispensable, whereas caspase 9-dependent intrinsic pathway is required in AP-2α-induced apoptosis.Essential Role of Mitochondria in AP-2α-induced Apoptosis—To understand better the importance of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, we investigated the role of mitochondria in AP-2α-induced apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) as a measure of mitochondrial outer membrane"

The appearance of PrP in the cytosol could result from either retro-translocation of misfolded PrP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or impaired import of PrP into the ER. Transgenic mice expressing cytoplasmic PrP (cyPrP) developed neurodegeneration in cerebellar granular neurons, although no detectable pathology was observed in other brain regions. In order to understand why granular neurons in the cerebellum were most susceptible to cyPrP-induced degeneration, we investigated the subcellular localization of cyPrP. Interestingly, we found that cyPrP is membrane-bound. In transfected cells, it binds to the ER and plasma/endocytic vesicular membranes. In transgenic mice, it is associated with synaptic and microsomal membranes. Furthermore, the cerebellar neurodegeneration in transgenic mice correlates with the interaction between cyPrP and the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane but not with either the aggregation status or the dosage of cyPrP. These results suggest that lipid membrane perturbation could be a cellular mechanism for cyPrP-induced neurotoxicity and explain the seemingly conflicting results concerning cyPrP.

Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that are sporadic, inherited, or transmissible (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). The resistance of PrP 2The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; cyPrP, cytoplasmic PrP23-230; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. 2The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; cyPrP, cytoplasmic PrP23-230; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. knock-out mice to prion disease revealed the essential role of endogenous PrP in developing the two characteristics of prion disease, infectivity and neurodegeneration (2Bueler H.

In prion disease, a portion of PrP converts from its normal conformation, PrPC, to an insoluble and protease-resistant pathogenic conformation, PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence supports that PrPSc is the transmissible element in prion disease (3Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O.

Newly synthesized PrP contains an N-terminal signal sequence, which directs PrP to be co-translationally imported into the lumen of the ER. The signal sequence is cleaved within the ER, along with a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol signal sequence that is responsible for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition (6Harris D.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once folded correctly, PrP passes through the ER quality control machinery, maturing along the secretory pathway en route to the cell surface. In addition to cell surface and luminal localizations, cytosolic localized PrP has also been detected (7Mironov A. Jr-Latawiec D. Wille H. Bouzamondo-Bernstein E. Legname G. Williamson R.A. Burton D.

Recent studies revealed that the cytosolic appearance of PrP could result from two independent but not mutually exclusive pathways. In a variety of cell lines, including primary neurons expressing endogenous PrP, it has been found that some PrP molecules misfold in the ER and are retro-translocated to the cytosol for proteasome degradation via the ER-associated degradation pathway (9Jin T.

Disease-associated PrP mutants have an increased tendency to misfold and are subjected to ER-associated degradation (9Jin T. Gu Y. Zanusso G. Sy M. Kumar A. Cohen M. Gambetti P. Singh N. J. Biol.

An alternative pathway, the unsuccessful import of PrP because of the insufficiency of the PrP signal sequence, was revealed by an elegant study in mammalian cells (14Rane N.S. Yonkovich J.L. Hegde R.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4550-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and by heterologous expression of PrP in yeast (15Heller U. Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Reintjes A. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36139-36147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations at the C-terminal globular domain of PrP have also been found to interfere with PrP import into the ER (16Heske J. Heller U. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5435-5443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have investigated the biological consequences of PrP in the cytosol by using a variety of techniques (12Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Ma J. Lindquist S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Ma J. Lindquist S.

Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and we found that the cytosolic accumulation of PrP correlates with toxicity in some neuronal cells (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice expressing cyPrP (mouse PrP23-230 without signal sequences) under the control of the PrP promoter, rapid cerebellar granular neuron degeneration was observed in one transgenic line, 2D1, although neurodegeneration progressed slower in a separate line, 1D4 (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The two transgenic lines developed identical neuropathology in a transgene dosage-dependent manner (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), demonstrating the correlation between cyPrP transgene expression and neurodegeneration. Notably, cyPrP was present at a much lower level than endogenous PrP and sensitive to proteinase K digestion, indicating that the neurotoxic species is not the PrPSc form. Interestingly, the subset of neurons in the hippocampus, neocortex, and thalamus of mouse brain appeared healthy even though cytosolic localized PrP was detected in these neurons (7Mironov A. Jr-Latawiec D. Wille H. Bouzamondo-Bernstein E. Legname G. Williamson R.A. Burton D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Peters P.J. J.

Similarly, conflicting results on cyPrP-induced toxicity in cultured cells have been obtained by different groups (11Roucou X. Guo Q. Zhang Y. Goodyer C.G. LeBlanc A.C. J. Biol.

These discrepancies suggest that the cellular mechanism of cyPrP-induced toxicity is likely to be influenced by other cellular factors, which might include differences in cell types or growth environments. In this study, we investigated cyPrP in transgenic mice and in cultured cells in order to understand the cellular mechanism of its toxicity. A specific correlation between cyPrP-induced neurotoxicity and its interaction with the hydrophobic lipid core of membrane was found, suggesting membrane perturbation as the cellular basis for cyPrP-induced neurotoxicity. Cell Culture and Transfection—N2A cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to ATCC-recommended conditions, with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC) in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC) media. Penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) was included in the culture media. ExGen 500 reagent (Fermentas) was used to transfect N2A cells. Preparation of Post-nuclear Supernatant (PNS)—From cultured cells, one well of transfected cells on a 6-well cell culture plate was scraped into 350 μl of membrane preparation buffer (8% sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), homogenized, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. For mouse brains, half of the cerebellum or the rest of the brain was homogenized in the membrane preparation buffer and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Protein concentration of the PNS was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Pools of eight transgenic mice brains were used for the membrane extraction experiments. Separating Membrane and Cytosolic Fractions Using Iodixanol Gradient—PNS containing 100-300 μg of protein from mouse brain or 280 μl of PNS from cultured cells was mixed with stock iodixanol solution (OptiPrep, Axis-Shield PoC, AS) to generate 1 ml of 36% iodixanol solution, and the mixture was loaded at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. 1 ml of 31% iodixanol solution and 0.4 ml of 5% iodixanol solution were loaded on top of the sample sequentially. The gradient was centrifuged at 199,000 × g for 3 h at 4°C in a Sorvall micro-ultracentrifuge. Two hundred-microliter fractions were collected from the top to the bottom, and proteins in all fractions were precipitated by adding 200 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were sonicated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX Tris-glycine gel; Invitrogen) followed by immunoblot analysis. For membrane extractions, PNS prepared from cerebella or the rest of the brains was centrifuged at 346,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 0.5 m NaHCO3, pH 11, 1 m KCl, 1.5 m KCl, or 1.5 m KCl plus 10 mm NaOH and loaded on the iodixanol gradient. Fractions were collected from the top to the bottom, and the presence of cyPrP was determined by immunoblot analysis. Subcellular Fractionation Using Sucrose Gradient—Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially according to the method reported previously (23Ito D. Walker J.R. Thompson C.S. Moroz I. Lin W. Veselits M.L. Hakim A.M. Fienberg A.A. Thinakaran G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9456-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets from two 100-mm cell culture dishes were homogenized to prepare PNS. The discontinuous sucrose gradient consisted of PNS in 0.25 m sucrose (∼0.8 ml) on top, and (from top to bottom) 0.5 m (2 ml), 0.8 m (2.5 ml), 1.16 m (2.5 ml), 1.3 m (2.5 ml), 2 m (1.5 ml) sucrose in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The gradient was centrifuged at 36,000 rpm in a TH-641 ultracentrifuge rotor (Sorvall) for 2.5 h at 4 °C, and 1-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom. Proteins from these fractions were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and subjected to the immunoblot analysis. Determining the Aggregation Status of cyPrP from Transgenic Mouse Brains—The cerebellum and the rest of the brain were separated and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (1:10, w/v). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. Brain lysates used for determining cyPrP aggregation status are as follows: 10 μg of cerebellum lysate from a wild-type mouse, 5 μg of the rest of the brain lysate from a wild-type mouse, 50 μg of cerebellum lysate from a transgenic mouse on the PrP knock-out background, 50 μg of the rest of the brain lysate from a transgenic mouse on the PrP knock-out background. These brain lysates were resuspended in 100 μl (final volume) of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (final concentrations). After incubation on ice for 10 min, lysates were centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube, precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol (-20 °C), and incubated at -20 °C for more than 30 min. Pellet fraction and precipitated supernatant proteins were sonicated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% (w/v) SDS. After boiling, samples were separated in 14% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Subcellular Fractionation of Neuronal Structures—Fractionation of mouse brain homogenate was performed according to published protocols (24Nishiyama A. Endo T. Takeda S. Imamura M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis and Antibodies—Samples separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane for immunoblot analyses. Blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was performed on a Storm PhosphorImager System (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used were as follows: 3F4 monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (Signet Laboratories) at 1:2500; POM1 anti-PrP antibody (25Polymenidou M. Stoeck K. Glatzel M. Vey M. Bellon A. Aguzzi A.

Immunohistochemical Staining—The tissue processing for immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The anti-cPLA2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:50. A rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody (DAKO) was used at 1:400 for GFAP staining in the mouse brains. ABC, AKP, and DAB kits were purchased from the Vector Laboratories. Preparation of Liposome—One gram of mouse brain was homogenized in 10 ml of methanol for 1 min, followed by addition of 20 ml of chloroform to the mixture and homogenization for an additional 2 min. The homogenate was filtered, and the solid residues were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v, 30 ml) and homogenized for 3 min. After repeating this step once more, the combined filtrates were washed with 0.25 volume of 0.88% KCl in water followed by a wash with 0.25 volume of water/methanol (1:1). The purified lipids in the bottom layer were collected and dried under nitrogen. To prepare liposomes, 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, was added to the dried lipids, and the solution was sonicated until it became clear. Higher Level of Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the Degenerating Cerebellum—The cPLA2 is a calcium-responsive phospholipase, belonging to a large PLA2 family. It has been implicated as a contributor to the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including prion diseases (27Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Horrocks L. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Farooqui A.A. Ong W.Y. Horrocks L.A. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 1961-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Bate C.

Virol. 2004; 85: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We studied the protein level of cPLA2 in transgenic mice expressing cyPrP under the control of the PrP promoter (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The 2D1 line of transgenic mice developed neurodegeneration with a synchronized onset. Ultrastructural changes were detected by electron microscopy at 3 weeks of age, ataxia at 4 weeks, severe loss of granular neurons at 5 weeks, and overt gliosis at about 7 weeks (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the synchronized onset of neurodegeneration in this transgenic line, we asked whether there is a correlation between cPLA2 induction and cyPrP-induced neurotoxicity. An increase of cPLA2 was detected in the cerebellum of a 3-week-old transgenic mouse but not in the rest of the brain, nor in the cerebellum or the rest of the brain of a wild-type littermate (Fig. 1A). Because the cPLA2 induction correlated with the onset of neurodegeneration (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we tested whether the cPLA2 level continued to increase once neurodegeneration was in progress. Indeed, a higher level of cPLA2 was found in the cerebellum of a 4-week-old transgenic mouse compared with its wild-type littermate (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that higher level of cPLA2 was associated with cyPrP-caused neurodegeneration. Generally, cPLA2 is involved in the production of eicosanoids and is associated with reactive astrocytes (27Farooqui A.A. Yang H.C. Horrocks L. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Farooqui A.A. Ong W.Y. Horrocks L.A. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 1961-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine the relationship between the increase in cPLA2 and the reactive astrocytes, we performed immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against both cPLA2 and GFAP, a marker for reactive astrocytes. Compared with their wild-type littermates, a clear increase of cPLA2 immunoreactivity was detected in the cerebellum of transgenic mice at 4 weeks of age. However, a significant increase of GFAP immunoreactivity was not detected until mice reached 7 weeks of age (Fig. 1C). This result indicates that the increase of cPLA2 immunoreactivity might not be a direct result of astrogliosis. CyPrP Is Associated with Membranes in N2A Cells—An alternative explanation of increased cPLA2 levels could be that cyPrP disrupts lipid membranes, causing increased cytosolic calcium concentrations and subsequently an increase of the calcium-responsive cPLA2. If this were the case, cyPrP should be associated with cell membranes. To test this possibility, post-nuclear supernatants were prepared from N2A cells transfected with cyPrP. Iodixanol reagent was mixed with PNS to reach a final concentration of 36% and loaded at the bottom of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient (13Wang X. Wang F. Sy M.S. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this gradient, membrane fractions float to the top, which avoids the influence of the aggregation status of cyPrP in separating membrane and cytosolic fractions. CyPrP from N2A cells was detected in the top fractions of the gradient, along with the transmembrane protein calnexin (Fig. 2A), while the cytosolic chaperone Hsp70 remained in the bottom fractions (Fig. 2A). When recombinant PrP23-230 alone was tested in the same gradient, it remained in the bottom fractions as well. These results indicate that a large part of cyPrP in N2A cells is membrane-associated. CyPrP Is Associated with ER and Plasma/Endocytic Vesicular Membranes in N2A Cells—To understand the consequence of cyPrP membrane association, we determined the identity of the subcellular organelles with which it associated. PNS from N2A cells transfected with cyPrP was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (23Ito D. Walker J.R. Thompson C.S. Moroz I. Lin W. Veselits M.L. Hakim A.M. Fienberg A.A. Thinakaran G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9456-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The migration of subcellular organelles in the gradient was determined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies raised against specific subcellular organelle antigens. The transfected cyPrP contains a 3F4 epitope (sequences derived from human and hamster PrP) that is not present in murine endogenous PrP from N2A cells. Therefore, cyPrP can be specifically detected without interference from endogenous PrP. We found that cyPrP migrated into two peaks in the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3, cyPrP). One of the peaks co-localized with endogenous glycosylated PrP (Fig. 3, endogenous PrP), indicating that cyPrP was associated with plasma/endocytic vesicular membranes (6Harris D.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second peak co-migrated with the peak of the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 3, calnexin). There was some overlap between the first cyPrP peak and the Golgi marker syntaxin 6, although the highest peak of each protein appeared in different fractions. No association of cyPrP with the mitochondrial marker, porin, was detected. Therefore, we concluded that in N2A cells, cyPrP is mainly associated with either ER or plasma/endocytic vesicular membranes. CyPrP Is Associated with Synaptic and Microsomal Membranes in Transgenic Mice—Transiently transfected cells generally express high levels of cyPrP. To rule out the possibility that membrane association of cyPrP is an artifact because of high levels of cyPrP expression, we tested whether cyPrP is membrane-associated in 1D4 transgenic mice. In this line of transgenic mice, a very low protein level of cyPrP was detected, and the progression of neurodegeneration was much slower compared with 2D1 mice (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Because these mice were generated on the wild-type mouse background and the cyPrP transgene contains no easily recognizable epitope, we crossed cyPrP transgenic mice on to the PrP knock-out background. The newly generated transgenic mice expressing cyPrP on the PrP knock-out background developed a phenotype similar to that of 1D4 transgenic mice, specifically, degeneration of the cerebellar granular neurons but no detectable degeneration in other brain regions. 3X. Wang and J. Ma, unpublished results. PNS was prepared from the cerebella of these mice and subjected to iodixanol gradient separation. PrP knock-out mouse brain lysate was included in the immunoblot analysis as a negative control (Fig. 4A, lane C). Although it is expressed at a much lower level compared with transfected N2A cells, cyPrP in the transgenic mice was also membrane-associated, migrating to the top of the gradient (Fig. 4A). To determine which subcellular membrane cyPrP is associated with in the transgenic mice, we separated different neuronal membrane structures using differential centrifugation (24Nishiyama A. Endo T. Takeda S. Imamura M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Synaptophysin and synapsin I were used as markers for the separation (Fig. 4B). Synaptophysin is enriched in the LP2 fraction, representing a synaptic vesicle-enriched fraction (31Dunah A.W. Standaert D.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5546-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to LP2, synapsin I was also detected in the LP1 fraction, a fraction enriched with synaptosomal membranes (32Onofri F. Giovedi S. Vaccaro P. Czernik A.J. Valtorta F. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Benfenati F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12168-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Notably, cyPrP was detected in both LP1 and LP2 fractions, indicating that it is associated with synaptic membranes (Fig. 4B). In addition, cyPrP was also detected in the P3 fraction, a fraction enriched with light membranes and microsomes (24Nishiyama A. Endo T. Takeda S. Imamura M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 125: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, the localization of cyPrP in transgenic mice is similar to that in transfected N2A cells, namely the plasma and ER/microsomal membranes. Cerebellar Neurodegeneration Caused by cyPrP Does Not Correlate with Its Expression Level, Aggregation Status, or Membrane Association—Next, we investigated the relationship between the biochemical properties of cyPrP and neurotoxicity. The PrP promoter was used to drive expression of the cyPrP transgene in mice, and most intriguingly, despite broad pan-neuronal expression of this promoter (33Borchelt D.R. Davis J. Fischer M. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Regard J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sisodia S.S. Price D.L. Genet. Anal. 1996; 13: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the only detectable pathology occurred in the granular neurons of the cerebellum (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a comparison between cyPrP in the cerebellum and the rest of the brain might reveal the cellular basis for cyPrP-induced neurotoxicity. We first compared the aggregation status of cyPrP to determine whether it correlates with the development of neurotoxicity. Using mild detergent extraction followed by sedimentation, we found that almost all the endogenous PrP from a wild-type mouse was soluble (Fig. 5A). In contrast, cyPrP from both the cerebellum and the rest of the brain was aggregated, appearing in the pellet fraction. This result rules out the possibility that a specific neuronal environment induces cyPrP aggregation and leads to neurotoxicity. An alternative possibility could be that a higher level of cyPrP expression in the cerebellum is responsible for the rapid neurodegeneration. By using serial dilutions, we compared the protein level of cyPrP in the cerebellum to that in the rest of the brain (Fig. 5B). As we reported previously (19Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), cyPrP is expressed at a very low level in the brain of these transgenic mice. Quantification using a homozygous cyPrP transgenic mouse revealed that the levels of cyPrP expression in the cerebell"

In this study, the effects of cell-cell interactions on N-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycans) were investigated in GE11 epithelial cells. N-glycans were purified from whole cell lysates by hydrazinolysis and then detected by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the population of the bisecting GlcNAc-containing N-glycans, the formation of which is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), was substantially increased in cells cultured under dense conditions compared with those cultured under sparse conditions. The expression levels and activities of GnT-III but not other glycosyltransferases, such as GnT-V and α1,6-fucosyltransferase, were also consistently increased in these cells. However, this was not observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or MDA-MB231 cells, in which E-cadherin is deficient. In contrast, perturbation of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion by treatment with EDTA or a neutralizing anti-E-cadherin antibody abolished the up-regulation of expression of GnT-III. Furthermore, we observed the significant increase in GnT-III activity under dense growth conditions after restoration of the expression of E-cadherin in MDA-MB231 cells. Our data together indicate that a E-cadherin-dependent pathway plays a critical role in regulation of GnT-III expression. Given the importance of GnT-III and the dynamic regulation of cell-cell interaction during tissue development and homeostasis, the changes in GnT-III expression presumably contribute to intracellular signaling transduction during such processes.

It has been well known that sugar chains have various effects on the functional aspects of glycoproteins and play important roles in cell differentiation, adhesion, and proliferation (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4987) Google Scholar, 2Dwek R.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The sugar chains of glycoproteins are produced via catalysis by various glycosyltransferases. As a result, a specific structure is determined by the expression pattern of these enzymes. The expression of glycosyltransferases is regulated not only by physiological conditions, such as developmental stages, but by pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and tumorigenesis (3Kobata A. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 443-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The increasing body of evidence suggests that the structures of the glycan components, such as sialyl Lewis antigens (5Kannagi R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 491: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Lowe J.B. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 33-45Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), mucin-type O-glycans (7Fukuda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), or N-glycans (3Kobata A. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 443-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Dennis J.W. Pawling J. Cheung P. Partridge E. Demetriou M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 19: 414-422Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which are controlled by glycosyltransferases, greatly contribute to cell adhesion, cell invasion, and cancer metastasis. A malignant phenotype has been reported to be highly associated with N-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycan) containing β1,6-branching, which is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) 4The abbreviations used are: GnT-V, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V; GnT-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; Fut8, α1,6-fucosyltransferase; PA, pyridylaminated; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; E4-PHA, erythroagglutinating isolectin; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight. by transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to a β1,6 mannose in N-glycans (8Dennis J.W. Pawling J. Cheung P. Partridge E. Demetriou M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 19: 414-422Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that GnT-V activities and β1,6-branched N-glycan levels are increased in highly metastatic tumor cell lines (9Asada M. Furukawa K. Segawa K. Endo T. Kobata A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1073-1080PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pochec E. Litynska A. Amoresano A. Casbarra A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 7: 1-3Google Scholar). Conversely, cancer metastasis is greatly suppressed in GnT-V knock-out mice (11Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GnT-V is strongly associated with cancer metastasis. In contrast to GnT-V, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) has been found to play an important role in the suppression of metastasis. GnT-III catalyzes the attachment of a GlcNAc to a core mannose of N-glycan via a β1,4-linkage to form the bisecting GlcNAc structure (Fig. 4A), which does not serve as substrate for GnT-V to form a β1,6-branch (12Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Schachter H. Narasimhan S. Gleeson P. Vella G. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1983; 61: 1049-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, GnT-III has been proposed to be antagonistic to GnT-V. In fact, lung metastasis of highly metastatic mouse melanoma B16 cells, in which GnT-V activities are much higher than those in other cell types, are significantly suppressed by overexpression of the GnT-III gene (14Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an enhancement in cell-cell adhesion through the prolonged turnover of E-cadherin on the cell surface was reported in these GnT-III transfectants (15Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13811-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the overexpression of GnT-V results in decreased N-cadherin clustering on the cell surface and therefore the down-regulation of cadherin-associated cell-cell adhesion (16Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52412-52424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the remodeling of N-glycan structures modified by glycosyltransferases function to modulate cell adhesion and cancer metastasis. The cadherins are a superfamily of adhesion molecules that function in cell recognition, tissue morphogenesis, and tumor suppression (17Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1169-1180PubMed Google Scholar). E-cadherin is the prototypical member of these calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules and mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion. The loss of E-cadherin expression or function in epithelial carcinoma has long been thought to be a primary reason for the disruption of tight epithelial cell-cell contacts and the release of invasive tumor cells from the primary tumor (18Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). E-cadherin serves as a widely acting suppressor of invasion and growth of epithelial cancers, and its functional elimination represents a key step in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype for many tumors. Indeed, E-cadherin is found in epithelia, where it promotes the formation of tight cell-cell associations known as adherens junctions. In contrast, N-cadherin is found primarily in neural tissues and fibroblasts, where it is thought to mediate a less stable and more dynamic form of cell-cell adhesion (19Hazan R.B. Qiao R. Keren R. Badano I. Suyama K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Therefore, cell-cell adhesion is believed to be both temporally and spatially regulated during development. The issue of whether or not cell-cell interaction affects N-glycan structures in a reverse manner is a subject of debate. In this study, we investigated this issue using a dense or sparse culture model, and found that bisected N-glycans were dramatically induced in cells under conditions of a dense culture through an E-cadherin involved pathway. Cell Cultures—Epithelial GE11 cells, derived from β1 integrin knock-out embryonic stem cells (20Gimond C. van Der Flier A. van Delft S. Brakebusch C. Kuikman I. Collard J.G. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts of Fut8+/+ and Fut8–/– were previously established in our laboratory (21Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A. Shapiro S.D. Lopez-Otin C. Kuwaki T. Okabe M. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and MDA-MB231 cells were maintained under the same conditions. Cells at 5 × 106 and 5 × 105 were plated on 15-cm dishes for a dense culture and a sparse culture, respectively, followed by incubation for 4 days. Cell densities were confirmed by phase-contrast observations, as shown in Fig. 1 Expression Plasmid and DNA Transfection—Human E-cadherin cDNA was first cloned, and then p-E-cadherin-ECFP-N for E-cadherin fused to ECFP was prepared by inserting the cDNA fragment encoding human E-cadherin into the 5′ end of the cDNA fragment encoding ECPF in pECFP-N1 (Invitrogen). All of the constructs used here were confirmed by sequencing. p-E-cadherin-ECFP-N1 or pECFP-N1 was transfected into MDA-MB231 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The stable transfectants were selected by G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). Preparation of Pyridylaminated (PA) N-Linked Oligosaccharide from Cells—Cells were cultured and harvested at the indicated times. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed by sonication and then lyophilized. The N-glycans were liberated from glycoproteins by hydrazinolysis at 100 °C for 10 h. After reacetylation and lyophilization, the reducing ends of the N-glycans were labeled with 2-aminopyridine (Nacalai Tesque). Excess 2-aminopyridine was removed with a cellulose cartridge glycan preparation kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). Analysis of N-Glycans by the Reversed and Normal Phase HPLC—The PA N-glycans prepared from cells were analyzed on a reversed phase HPLC system (Shimazu Co., Japan) using an ODS80-TM column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 55 °C using 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) as solvent A and the same buffer containing 1% 1-butanol as solvent B. The column was pre-equilibrated with 4% solvent B, and after injection of a sample, the PA N-glycans were separated by means of a linear gradient of 4–25% of solvent B for 60 min. The eluents were then subjected to a normal phase HPLC for further analysis. An Amide 80 TM column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh) was used, and elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile as solvent A and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in MilliQ water as solvent B. The column was pre-equilibrated with 0% solvent B, and after injection of a sample, the PA N-glycans were separated by a linear gradient of 0–100% solvent B for 50 min. PA N-glycans were detected by a fluorescence detector (Shimazu) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. Glycosidase Digestion for N-Glycans—The PA N-glycans were sequentially digested at 37 °C with sialidase (Nacalai Tesque), β-galactosidase, and fucosidase (Seikagaku Co., Japan) in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0). After the digestion, the mixture was boiled for 3 min, and the supernatant, after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC, as described above. Analysis of N-Glycan Structures by Mass Spectrometry—N-Glycans treated with dialidase were purified by reverse and normal phase HPLC and then subjected to mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. Mass measurements were carried out using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a pulsed ion extraction system (Reflex IV; Bruker-Daltonik GmbH, Germany). All spectra were obtained using the reflectron mode with a delayed extraction of 200 ns and were the result of the signal averaging of 200 laser shots. For sample preparation, a 0.5-μl volume of the matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid; 10 g/liter in 30% ethanol) was deposited on the stainless steel target plate and allowed to dry. Then 0.5 μl of appropriately diluted analyte solution was used to cover the matrix on the target plate and allowed to dry. Finally, 0.5 μl of matrix solution was added to the deposited sample/matrix mixture on the target plate and allowed to dry. Structural analyses of oligosaccharides were achieved by a multistage tandem mass spectral matching strategy using a MALDI-quadrupole ion trap-TOF mass spectrometer (AXIMA-QIT; Shimadzu, Japan) (22Kikuchi N. Kameyama A. Nakaya S. Ito H. Sato T. Shikanai T. Takahashi Y. Narimatsu H. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1717-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferase Activity Assays—Cells were grown to 30, 80, and 100% confluence, respectively, and then harvested. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed by sonication. The protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by means of a BCA protein assay kit, and the same amounts of proteins were used as the source for the GnT-III and GnT-V activity assays as described previously (23Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the Fut8 activity assay, a cell lysate was incubated with a biantennary N-glycan labeled with pyridylaminoethylsuccinamyl as an acceptor substrate and reaction mixture as described previously (24Inamori K. Endo T. Gu J. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Fujii S. Iwasaki H. Narimatsu H. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Noda K. Gao C.X. Nakahara S. Kitada T. Suzuki K. Yoshihara H. Yoshikawa K. Kawano K. Tonetti M. Kasahara A. Hori M. Hayashi N. Ide Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2337-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The substrate we used was GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6(GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA, which was produced according to Hase et al. (25Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). For each assay, 100 pmol of the substrate (in 100 μl of total reaction solution) were utilized. The specific activity was expressed as pmol of N-acetylglucosamine transferred/h/mg of proteins (23Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PCR for mRNA Expression Analysis—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and real time PCR was performed in a Smart Cycler II (Takara Bio). The sequences of the sense and antisense primers of mouse GnT-III were 5′-CGAGGACACCACCGAGTATT-3′ and 5′-ACTCGTGGTTGACGTTGATG-3′, respectively. The β-actin mRNA was used as a control in PCR runs. The product sizes obtained by the PCR were 350 bp for mouse GnT-III and 700 bp for β-actin. Quantitative PCR was performed by monitoring the real time increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Gene-specific primers were designed by Takara Bio, and the sequences of sense and antisense primers of mouse GnT-III were TCAACGCCATCAACATCAAC and CCTTCGAGTACATCCGCCAC, respectively. The mean number of cycles to the threshold (CT) of fluorescence detection was calculated for each sample, and the results were normalized to the mean CT of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for each sample tested. Relative expression levels of GnT-III are expressed as the -fold increase in the dense culture. For detection of mRNA in MDA-MB231 cells, the primers of human GnT-III were used: 5′-AAGACCCTGTCCTAT-3′ for sense and 5′-GTTGGCCCCCTCAGG-3′ for antisense (26Ihara H. Ikeda Y. Koyota S. Endo T. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The product size obtained by the PCR was 345 bp for human GnT-III. This detection was also confirmed by PCR using plasmid DNA containing human and rat GnT-III as controls. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Lectin Blot Analysis—Cells cultured under different conditions as indicated were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton-X, 150 mm NaCl, aprotinin, leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (2.5 mg of protein) was incubated with anti E-cadherin monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, and protein G beads (20 μlin 50% slurry) were then added, followed by incubation for another 2 h at 4 °C with a rotator. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with a lectin for a lectin blot analysis or an antibody for immunoblot analysis. Perturbation of E-cadherin-mediated Interactions by EDTA or a Neutralized Anti-E-cadherin Antibody—GE11 cells (1 × 107) were plated on 15-cm dishes and cultured in the presence or absence of EDTA at a final concentration of 1 or 0.5 mm. After incubation for 2 days, the cells were harvested for analysis of GnT-III activity, mRNA expression, and N-glycan structures. On the other hand, GE11 cells (4 × 105) were plated on 3.5-cm dishes and incubated for 2 days with or without a neutralized anti-E-cadherin antibody (ECCD-1 clone; Takara Bio) at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the activities of GnT-III were then examined. In order to investigate the effects of cell-cell interactions on N-glycan biosynthesis, we compared N-glycans obtained from cells cultured under dense or sparse culture conditions. GE11 cells were selected as a model cell to reduce the possible influence of β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion, since GE11 cells are derived from β1 integrin knock-out embryonic stem cells (20Gimond C. van Der Flier A. van Delft S. Brakebusch C. Kuikman I. Collard J.G. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, cells cultured under sparse conditions have adequate space available for cell spreading. In contrast, cells cultured under dense conditions have no space for full spreading, resulting in a reduction in cell size, as confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy. Different Patterns of N-Glycans Released from Cells Cultured under Dense and Sparse Cultures—N-Glycans were liberated from glycoproteins by hydrazinolysis, and the reducing ends of N-glycans were then labeled with 2-aminopyridine. The N-glycans purified with cellulose-Sepharose were digested with sialidase and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, a peak eluting at 67 min was dramatically increased in the dense culture, compared with that in the sparse culture (Fig. 2, A and B). We digested the mixture with some glycosidases to confirm whether it corresponded to an N-glycan. The peak eluted at 67 min was shifted to 60 and 39 min after additional digestion with β-galactosidase (Fig. 2C) or β-galactosidase plus fucosidase (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the peak corresponds to a complex type of sugar chain. To elucidate the structure of the peaks, the elution pattern of those peaks with several standard N-glycans was compared by reversed phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3B, the peaks that eluted at 67, 60, and 39 min correspond to bisected biantennary N-glycans, G(Gn)GF-bi-PA, Gn(Gn)GnF-bi-PA, and Gn(Gn)Gn-bi-PA, respectively, suggesting that bisecting GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharide levels are increased in cells cultured under dense conditions. The peak that eluted at 64 min might not be an N-glycan, because digestion with glycosidases could not make it shift.FIGURE 3MALDI MS spectra of PA desialylated N-glycans. The PA N-glycans released from the cells (A, GE11; C, Fut8+/+; D, Fut8–/–) cultured in the different conditions were digested with sialidase and then purified by a reversed phase and normal phase HPLC. The mixtures of purified PA N-glycans were subjected to MALDI MS for analysis of N-glycan profiles.

Kameyama A. Nakaya S. Ito H. Sato T. Shikanai T. Takahashi Y. Narimatsu H. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1717-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To obtain oligosaccharide profiles in this study, the N-glycans were purified by reverse and normal phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3, mass spectra of desialylated N-glycans were obtained from GE11 cells cultured under the two different conditions of cell density. The N-glycan profiles of GE11 cells cultured under high and low cell density conditions are clearly different. Carbohydrate compositions of the nine major peaks in the MS spectra (Fig. 3A) are summarized in Table 1. The peak intensities of (M + Na)+ for neutral oligosaccharides reflect the relative concentrations of the constituents of a mixture over the mass range from m/z 1000 to 2400 for MALDI-TOF MS (27Naven T.J. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In high density culture conditions, the intensities of peaks 2, 3, and 6, which contain two HexNAc residues on the N-glycan core structure, are decreased, whereas peaks 4, 5, and 7 with three HexNAc residues are increased, compared with those for the low cell density culture condition, suggesting that the oligosaccharides were extended by one HexNAc in GE11 cells cultured under dense conditions. Structural analyses of these peaks with multistage tandem mass spectral matching were performed (22Kikuchi N. Kameyama A. Nakaya S. Ito H. Sato T. Shikanai T. Takahashi Y. Narimatsu H. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1717-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the peaks (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4987) Google Scholar, 2Dwek R.A. Biochem.

The data reveal that peaks 5 and 7, which were increased under high cell density conditions, corresponded to peaks 1 and 2 with an added bisecting GlcNAc, respectively. This accounts for the most significant difference in the N-glycans between the low and high cell densities of GE11 cells, GGF-bi-PA of peak 2, and G(Gn)GF-bi-PA of peak 7. The three peaks (3Kobata A. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 443-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E.

Symp. 2002; 69: 33-45Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) could not be identified by the spectral matching strategy, which might be due to their being a mixture of isomeric structures. Some peaks (m/z 2304.97, 2347.00, and 2369.97) observed from m/z 2300 to m/z 2400 in the spectrum of high density GE11 cells might have arisen from nonoligosaccharide matter, since these could not be matched by a GlycoMod search (28Cooper C.A. Gasteiger E. Packer N.H. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These MS results correspond to reversed phase HPLC results described above, strongly suggesting that bisecting GlcNAc is increased as cell-cell interactions increase in GE11 cells.TABLE 1Carbohydrate compositions and relative intensities of the major peaks in the spectra of GE11 cellsPeak numberm/zaAll peaks were observed as (M + Na)+ ions.CompositionRelative intensityObserved (low, high)TheoreticalLowHigh%%11741.58, 1741.601741.64Hex2HexNAc2Man3GlcNAc225.429.521887.64. 1887.681887.69Hex2HexNAc2dHex1Man3GlcNAc212.54.731903.63, 1903.681903.69Hex3HexNAc2Man3GlcNAc24.32.641928.69, 1928.701928.72Hex1HexNAc3dHex1Man3GlcNAc23.45.851944.68, 1944.701944.74Hex2HexNAc3Man3GlcNAc24.45.762049.73, 2049.762049.75Hex3HexNAc2dHex1Man3GlcNAc24.62.272090.71, 2090.742090.77Hex2HexNAc3dHex1Man3GlcNAc24.89.882106.73, 2106,762106.77Hex3HexNAc3Man3GlcNAc210.06.992252.81, 2252.842252.83Hex3HexNAc3dHex1Man3GlcNAc24.03.4a All peaks were observed as (M + Na)+ ions. Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether the change in N-glycans with an increase in cell-cell interactions is specific to epidermal cells like GE11 cells or not, we composed the same cell culture models using embryonic fibroblasts of Fut8+/+ and Fut8–/–, derived from wild type and Fut8 knock-out mice (21Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A.

No significant differences in N-glycan profiles were found in Fut8+/+ (Fig. 3C) as well as in Fut8–/– cells (Fig. 3D) between low and high density culture conditions. This result indicates that an increase in bisected N-glycans with increasing cell-cell adhesion may be specific for epidermal cells and not for fibroblasts. It is also noteworthy that the N-glycans released from Fut8–/– cells do not contain any core fucose, compared with those from wild type cells, demonstrating that Fut8 is a unique glycosyltransferase that transfers a core fucose to N-glycans. Enhancements in Cell Densities are Concomitant with Increased Activities of GnT-III but Not Fut8 and GnT-V—To investigate the underlying mechanism for the enhanced expression of bisected N-glycans, GnT-III activities were examined. Interestingly, GnT-III activities were increased in a cell density-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). The GnT-III activities in cells cultured under dense conditions were ∼8-fold higher than those in cells cultured under sparse condition. In previous studies, we found that forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, enhanced GnT-III at the transcriptional level (29Sultan A.S. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Tsukada Y. Taniguchi N. J.

Here we have found a differential subcellular distribution of the alkyl-lysophospholipid edelfosine in leukemic and solid tumor cells that leads to distinct anticancer responses. Edelfosine induced rapid apoptosis in human leukemic cells, including acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat and Peer cells, but promoted a late apoptotic response, preceded by G2/M arrest, in human solid tumor cells such as cervix epitheloid carcinoma HeLa cells and lung carcinoma A549 cells. c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-3 were accordingly activated at earlier times in edelfosine-treated Jurkat cells as compared with drug-treated HeLa cells. Both leukemic and solid tumor cells took up this alkyl-lysophospholipid and expressed the two putative edelfosine targets, namely cell surface Fas death receptor (also known as APO-1 or CD95) and endoplasmic reticulum CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. However, edelfosine was mainly located to plasma membrane lipid rafts in Jurkat and Peer leukemic cells and to endoplasmic reticulum in solid tumor HeLa and A549 cells.

Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis results predominantly via the Kennedy or CDP-choline pathway (8Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following its uptake into the cell, choline is phosphorylated by choline kinase, and then CCT catalyzes the transfer of choline from phosphocholine to cytidine 5′-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), which is subsequently utilized by choline phosphotransferase along with diacylglycerol to form PtdCho (9Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CCT has long been recognized as a key enzyme controlling the PtdCho biosynthetic pathway, acting as a rate-limiting and regulatory step for PtdCho biosynthesis (9Kent C. Prog.

Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with 1 mg/ml of RNase A and 20 μg/ml of propidium iodide at room temperature. The proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was then quantitated by flow cytometry in a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer.

The PCR reaction profile was as follows: 95 °C for 30 s; 65 °C (fas and β-actin) or 52°C (cctα) for 30 s; 72 °C for 90 s. After 30 cycles, the expected PCR products (670 bp for fas, 507 bp for cctα, and 254 bp for β-actin) were size fractionated onto a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Western Blot—Cells (4-5 × 106) were lysed with 60 μl of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of aprotinin, 20 μg/ml of leupeptin). Proteins (35 μg) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, blocked with 5% (w/v) powder defatted milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 90 min at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with C2.10 anti-116-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase monoclonal antibody (1:3000 dilution, BD Biosciences), CM1 anti-18-kDa active caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution, BD Biosciences), C-20 anti-48-kDa Fas rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), SM1/23 anti-48-kDa Fas monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Bender MedSystems), F-17 anti-42-kDa CCTα goat polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or AC-15 anti-42-kDa β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution, Sigma). Signals were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Edelfosine Uptake—Drug uptake was measured as previously described (5Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L.

Edelfosine was from INKEYSA (Barcelona, Spain), and stock solutions were prepared as described previously (5Mollinedo F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Gajate C. Martin-Martin B. Benito A. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1320-1328PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]edelfosine (specific activity, 42 Ci/mmol) was synthesized by tritiation of the 9-octadecenyl derivative (Amersham Biosciences). Solid Phase c-Jun Amino-terminal Kinase (JNK) Assay—A fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and c-Jun (amino acids 1-223) was used as a substrate for JNK as described previously (21Gajate C.

The experimental conditions used have been shown to enable specific binding of JNK to the c-Jun amino-terminal domain (22Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were resolved in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Lipid Raft Isolation—Lipid rafts were isolated from 3-7 × 107 cells by nonionic detergent lysis and centrifugation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as described (19Gajate C. Mollinedo F.

Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and 20 μl of each fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Location of GM1-containing lipid rafts was determined using cholera toxin (CTx) B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) as described previously (24Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N.

Proteins were identified using specific antibodies: anti-48-kDa Fas (C-20) and anti-46-kDa JNK1 (C-17) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-29-kDa Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) (clone-1) monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-120-kDa Fas death domain-associated protein (Daxx) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Alexis Corp., Lausen, Switzerland), and anti-22-kDa caveolin rabbit polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Anti-JNK1 antibody reacted with both JNK1 and JNK3, leading to the two bands observed by Western blotting. Cell Transfection and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were transfected with 3 μg of a plasmid encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted red fluorescence protein (erRFP) (26Klee M. Pimentel-Muiños F.X.

Pimentel-Muiños (Centro de Investigación del Cáncer, Salamanca, Spain), using the jetPEI™ reagent (Qbiogene), and then treated for 3 h with 20 μm edelfosine fluorescent analog PTE-edelfosine (all-[E]-1-O-[15′-phenylpentadeca-8′,10′,12′,14′-tetraenyl]-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine) (7Gajate C.

Colocalization of the distinct fluorochromes was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) and a digital camera (ORCA-ER-1394; Hamamatsu). Lipid rafts were visualized using the raft marker fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cholera toxin (FITC-CTx) B subunit as described previously (7Gajate C. Del Canto-Janez E. Acuña A.U.

PtdCho Biosynthesis—Cells (2-3 × 106) were washed with PBS and incubated with 1 μCi/ml of [methyl-14C]choline chloride (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min in fetal calf serum-free culture medium. Labeled cells were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in the presence or absence of edelfosine in complete culture medium for the indicated times. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and pelleted for extraction of lipids (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Briefly, the pellet was extracted with a mixture of 0.125 ml of chloroform, 0.25 ml of methanol, and 0.1 ml of water. After 10 min at room temperature, 0.125 ml of chloroform and 0.125 ml of water were added. The tubes were shaken vigorously and then centrifuged to recover the lower organic and upper aqueous layers. Organic layers were dried under a stream of nitrogen, taken up in 20-40 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), applied to silica gel G-60 thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck), and developed with a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (60:30:8:5, v/v). Aqueous layers were evaporated at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 20-40 μl of ethanol/water (1:1, v/v), and spotted onto silica gel G-60 thin-layer chromatography plates that were developed in 95% ethanol/2% NH4OH (1:1, v/v) to separate water-soluble choline metabolites. Radioactive lipids were visualized using Fujifilm BAS-MS phosphorimaging and identified using internal controls. Appropriate authentic standards (100 μg) of PtdCho, choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline were also run in parallel, and their location was ascertained by iodine staining or Dragendorff reagent (Sigma). Spots corresponding to labeled PtdCho, choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline were scraped from the plates, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical Analyses—Unless otherwise indicated, the results given are the mean (± S.E.) of the number of experiments indicated. Statistical evaluation of the effect of edelfosine on PtdCho biosynthesis was performed by Student's t-test. Differences in the Induction of Apoptosis in Edelfosine-treated Leukemic and Solid Tumor Cells—Human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat and Peer cells (Fig. 1A), as well as human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells (data not shown), underwent rapid apoptosis upon treatment with 10 μm edelfosine (>16% apoptosis following 6 h of drug treatment). However, cancer cell lines derived from human malignant solid tumors, such as cervix epitheloid carcinoma HeLa and lung carcinoma A549 cells, underwent first an arrest in G2/M before the onset of a late apoptotic response (Fig. 1A). This G2/M arrest preceding apoptosis was also evidenced by time lapse videomicroscopy in a variety of solid tumor cells. 5F. Mollinedo, unpublished observations. In addition, the ectopic expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene in HeLa cells prevented apoptosis but led to an arrest of cells in G2/M after treatment with edelfosine (data not shown). Edelfosine also triggered a persistent activation of JNK, a signaling pathway required for edelfosine-induced apoptosis (28Gajate C. Santos-Beneit A. Modolell M. Mollinedo F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Ruiter G.A. Zerp S.F. Bartelink H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verheij M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2457-2463PubMed Google Scholar), before the onset of apoptosis in both leukemic Jurkat cells and solid tumor HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Edelfosine-induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase-3 activation (30Gajate C. Santos-Beneit A.M. Macho A. Lazaro M. Hernandez-De Rojas A. Modolell M. Munoz E. Mollinedo F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found activation of this caspase in edelfosine-treated cells, as assessed by cleavage of procaspase-3 into the p18 active form and cleavage of the typical caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, using a polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody that recognized the 18-kDa subunit of active caspase-3, but not the 32-kDa procaspase-3, and an anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase monoclonal antibody that detected both the 116-kDa intact form and the 85-kDa cleaved form of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Fig. 1C). In keeping with the above timing differences in edelfosine-induced apoptosis between leukemic and solid tumor cells, we found an earlier JNK and caspase-3 activation in Jurkat cells as compared with HeLa cells (Fig. 1, B and C). CCT and Fas Expression and Drug Uptake in Leukemic and Solid Tumor Cells—Because CCT, corresponding to CCTα, and Fas have been suggested as two putative edelfosine targets, we asked whether differences in expression of these two molecules could explain the different behavior of leukemic and solid tumor cells following edelfosine treatment. Western blot (Fig. 2A) and reverse transcription PCR (Fig. 2B) analyses demonstrated that Jurkat, Peer, HeLa, and A549 cells expressed both CCT and Fas at both mRNA and protein levels, even though CCT protein levels were somewhat more abundant in solid tumor cells and Fas protein in leukemic cells. Immunofluorescence flow cytometry of intact cells also indicated that Fas was present in the cell surface of both leukemic and solid tumor cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, both kinds of cell types incorporated edelfosine, although A549 and HeLa solid tumor cells took up higher amounts of the drug than Peer and Jurkat leukemic cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, the four tumor cell lines studied here fulfilled the two major requirements for edelfosine-induced apoptosis, namely ability to take up the drug and presence of the putative edelfosine targets Fas and CCT (2Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Curr. Drug. Metab. 2002; 3: 491-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Edelfosine Is Not Differentially Metabolized in Tumor Cells—A hypothetical different rate of drug metabolism could account for the differences in the final apoptotic outcome between leukemic and solid tumor cells. However, edelfosine is metabolically a very stable compound because of the ether bonds present in its molecule structure (2Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Curr. Drug. Metab. 2002; 3: 491-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Mollinedo F. Gajate C. Martin-Santamaria S. Gago F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 3163-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); accordingly, we found that the molecule remained largely intact (>98%) after 24 h of incubation of either Jurkat or HeLa cells with [3H]edelfosine as assessed by thin-layer-chromatography (data not shown). This lack of drug metabolism is in agreement with previous estimates showing that 98% of edelfosine remained unmodified in tumor cells in culture after 24 h of incubation (31Magistrelli A. Villa P. Benfenati E. Modest E.J. Salmona M. Tacconi M.T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar). On these grounds, the lack of drug metabolism precludes the involvement of any putative distinct metabolic process for the drug in the differential action of edelfosine on both"

DOHH is a HEAT-repeat protein with eight tandem helical hairpins in a symmetrical dyad. It contains two potential iron coordination sites (one on each dyad) composed of two strictly conserved His-Glu motifs. The purified human recombinant DOHH was a mixture of active holoenzyme containing 2 mol of iron/mol of DOHH and inactive metal-free apoenzyme. The two species could be distinguished by their different mobilities upon native gel electrophoresis. The DOHH apoenzyme exhibited markedly reduced levels of iron and activity. DOHH activity could be restored only by the addition of Fe2+ to the apoenzyme but not by other metals including Cd2+,Co2+,Cr2+,Cu2+,Mg2+,Mn2+,Ni2+, and Zn2+. The role of the strictly conserved His-Glu residues was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of any single amino acid in the four His-Glu motifs with alanine abolished the enzyme activity. Of these eight alanine substitutions, six, including H56A, H89A, E90A, H207A, H240A, and E241A, caused a severe reduction in the iron content. Our results provide strong evidence that Fe(II) is the active-site-bound metal critical for DOHH catalysis and that the strictly conserved His-Glu motifs are essential for iron binding and catalysis. Furthermore, the iron to DOHH stoichiometry and dependence of iron binding on each of the four conserved His-Glu motifs suggest a binuclear iron mediated reaction mechanism, distinct from that of other Fe(II)-dependent protein hydroxylases, such as prolyl 4-hydroxylase or lysyl hydroxylases.

In the first step deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the NAD-dependent cleavage and transfer of the aminobutyl moiety of the polyamine spermidine to the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue to form an intermediate, deoxyhypusine (Nϵ-4-amnobutyllysine) residue (2Wolff E.C.

Because of these similarities, DOHH had been assumed to be a member of the super family of Fe(II) and 2-oxoacid-dependent dioxygenases.

In the case of DOHH, however, neither the addition of the three cofactors of DSBH enzymes, Fe2+, ascorbic acid, and α-ketoglutarate, enhanced the activity of the partially purified rat testis enzyme nor could the release of 14CO2 from α-keto[14C]glutarate be detected with the same enzyme (5Abbruzzese A. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3085-3089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the inhibition of DOHH activity in cells by known iron chelators was shown to be overcome by the addition of either Fe2+ or Fe3+ in HeLa cell extracts (22Csonga R. Ettmayer P. Auer M. Eckerskorn C. Eder J. Klier H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), there has been no definitive evidence on the identity of the metal involved in DOHH catalysis. Thus, the relationship between the DOHH and DSBH enzymes has remained obscure.Recently our group has identified and cloned the yeast DOHH gene (YJR070C) (by screening a S. cerevisiae GST open reading frame library (29Phizicky E.M. Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Xing F. Shull N.P. Van Slyke C. Montagne R.K. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) and also the human DOHH gene (4Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). DOHH homolog exists in all eukaryotes as a single gene in each species, and the amino acid sequence is highly conserved. Examination of the sequence alignment of DOHH revealed that this enzyme belongs to a family of HEAT-repeat proteins, named for human huntingtin (H), elongation factor 3 (E), a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (A), and the target of rapamycin (TOR), that are commonly involved in protein-protein interactions (30Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In these proteins the HEAT motif, composed of an α-helical hairpin (a pair of α-helices) of roughly 50 amino acids, is tandemly repeated to form superhelical structures. Computer modeling of DOHH predicted a structure consisting of eight HEAT repeats in a symmetrical dyad of four HEAT motifs connected by a variable region, a structure that is totally different from the β jelly roll structures of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoacid-dependent dioxygenases. The model predicts that the N- and C-terminal halves of DOHH form a symmetric shell-like structure with four conserved His-Glu pairs potentially contributing to metal chelation (4Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, this homology-based model represents only an approximate structure for the protein and its possible metal interactions.In an effort to validate the proposed model and to gain insight into the reaction mechanism of DOHH, we performed structural analyses of the wild type and mutant enzymes by CD spectroscopy and investigated the roles of iron and the conserved His-Glu residues in DOHH catalysis. Our results demonstrate that the four strictly conserved His-Glu pairs indeed constitute the iron coordinating active site for DOHH. Furthermore, we present definitive evidence that Fe(II), but not Fe(III) or other divalent transition metals, is the critical metal for DOHH catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsl-Glutathione (GSH) was purchased from Sigma, glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Biosciences, thrombin cleavage capture kit was from Novagen, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science. [1,8-3H]Spermidine·3HCl (∼20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Precast Tris-glycine and NuPAGE (Bis-Tris) gels, MOPS running buffer, and Simply Blue staining solution were purchased from Invitrogen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. The bacterial expression vector (pGEX-4T-3/hDOHH) expressing human DOHH was previously described (4Park J.H. Aravind L.

The radiolabeled deoxyhypusine-containing protein, human eIF5A([3H]Dhp) was prepared in an in vitro deoxyhypusine synthase reaction using human eIF5A precursor, eIF5A(Lys), and [1,8-3H]spermidine as described previously (31Park J.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32683-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.MethodsSite-directed Mutagenesis—Human recombinant mutant DOHH enzymes with a single amino acid replaced with alanine (H56A, E57A, H89A, E90A, H207A, E208A, H240A, and E241A) and four double mutant enzymes with His-Glu pair replaced with an Ala-Ala pair (H56A/E57A, H89A/E90A, H207A/E208A, and H240A/E241A) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The bacterial vector encoding human wild type DOHH as a GST fusion protein, pGEX-4T-3/hDOHH, was used as a template for PCR, and the primer sets were designed for substitution of His or Glu with alanine. The entire open reading frame of the mutated DOHH was sequenced for confirmation of the intended mutation. The mutated plasmids were introduced into BL21(DE3)-competent cells for overexpression of the mutant enzymes.Overexpression and Purification of the Human Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant DOHH—The selected clones were grown in 120 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced at a density of 0.6 (OD600 nm) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 2 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2.4 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free) and lysed by sonication using an ultrasonic processor. After centrifugation of the lysate at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the clarified supernatant was rotated with 0.6 ml of GSH-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The resins were washed with buffer B (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl) 3 times and divided into two tubes. One-half was used for preparation of GST fusion enzymes by elution with buffer C (50 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm GSH, final pH 8.0). The other half of the resin was treated with thrombin using the thrombin cleavage capture kit to release free DOHH enzymes. The enzyme was equilibrated in buffer A for activity assays, in HPLC metal-free water for metal analysis, or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for analysis of CD spectra.Large scale preparation of wild type DOHH (WT1) and apoenzymes, WTa1 and WTa2, was carried out as follows. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pGEX-4T-3/hDOHH were grown in 6 liters of Superbroth at 37 °C. When the cell density reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the clarified supernatant was incubated with GSH-Sepharose (30 ml) by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was packed into a column and washed with 500 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm DTT. The resin was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer D (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT) containing 1000 units of thrombin and incubated 2 h at 4 °C to release DOHH. Thrombin was removed by passing the DOHH solution over benzamidine resin, and any residual thrombin was inactivated by treatment with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, resulting in WT1. For the WTa1 preparation, 4 mm EDTA was included in the sonication buffer. DOHH released from the GSH resin was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Human recombinant DOHH migrated as one major peak with a leading edge shoulder. The early fractions of this peak were pooled, concentrated, and designated as WTa1, later shown to contain very low levels of iron (0.02 mol/mol). A second apoenzyme sample, WTa2, was prepared by overnight dialysis of WT1 against 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5. The enzyme precipitated after dialysis in the acidic citrate buffer and the precipitated protein, after redissolving in buffer A, was found to contain only 0.02 mol iron/mol of protein.Analysis of Secondary Structures of DOHH by Circular Dichroism— Circular dichroic spectra were measured in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using quartz cuvettes thermostatted at 25 °C. Far ultraviolet spectra were measured from 260 to 190 nm, with four scans at 50 nm/min, time constant of 1 s, bandwidth of 1 nm, and slit width of 500 μm using 200 μl of solution in a 1-mm path length cuvette. Protein concentrations were in the range 100–200 μg/ml. Visible spectra were measured from 600 to 250 nm with a 1-cm path length cuvette. The protein concentration was 2.7 mg/ml. The instrument was continually flushed with nitrogen and was calibrated every 2 weeks with a solution of ammonium (–)-10-camphorsulfonate. Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically assuming that a 1 mg/ml solution has an absorbance of 0.657 at 280 nm. Data were converted into mean residue ellipticities using a mean residue weight of 109. Estimates of secondary structure were made using the CONTIN program (32Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar).DOHH Assay—A typical DOHH reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm DTT, 25 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1–2 pmol of the radiolabeled protein substrate (2–4 × 104 dpm), human eIF5A([3H]Dhp), and enzyme (cell lysate or 0.02–3 μg of purified enzyme) in 20 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 500 μg of carrier bovine serum albumin was added to each sample followed by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 18 h. The content of [3H]hypusine and [3H]deoxyhypusine was determined after ion exchange chromatographic separation as described earlier (24Clement P.M. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Wolff E.C. Kleinman H.K. Park M.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Park M.H. Liberato D.J. Yergey A.L. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12123-12127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of the Metal Content of DOHH—The buffers for the wild type DOHH and the mutant enzymes were prepared using metal-free HPLC water. To remove extraneous metals, protein solutions were exchanged with either HPLC water or with 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.5, pretreated with CHELEX 100 resin. The HPLC water or the Tris buffer was also analyzed for any metal contamination. The protein samples were analyzed for metal content (Cadmium, Cobalt, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Nickel, and Zinc) using inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry, Thermo Finnigan Element1 or Element2 (conducted by Dr. Ted Huston, W. M. Keck Elemental Geochemistry Laboratory, Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan).Separation of DOHH Apoenzyme and Holoenzyme by Native Gel Electrophoresis and Their Identification by Amino Acid Sequencing—DOHH holo- and apoenzymes were separated by analytical native gel electrophoresis on precast 8–16% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) at 4 °C using a Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, at 125 V. Samples were applied after 30 min of pre-electrophoresis. For amino acid sequencing, WT1 was separated as above except that a neutral Tris-glycine running buffer, pH 7.2, was used. The proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and briefly stained using Ponceau S dye solution (0.1%). Protein bands were excised for amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation (CBER, FDA, Bethesda, MD). For identification of active enzyme bands, the enzyme (4 μg) was separated by electrophoresis as above, and the lane containing DOHH was sliced in 2.0-mm thickness. Half of each slice was stained with Simply Blue stain (Invitrogen), and the other half was minced, and protein was extracted with 50 μl of 50 mm Tris·HClpH7.5, 1 mm DTT. After incubation at 4 °C for 18 h, 10 μl of extract was used for activity assays. To determine the metal content, the holo- and apoenzymes were isolated in liquid fractions by preparative gel electrophoresis of WT1 (1 mg) using Mini Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). 0.2-ml fractions were collected, and proteins in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, native gel electrophoresis, and for DOHH activity. Appropriate fractions of each protein peak were pooled and used for metal analysis.RESULTSThe Helical Structure of DOHH Wild Type and Mutant Enzymes—We have previously proposed that the DOHH structure would consist of eight HEAT repeats in a symmetrical dyad of four HEAT motifs connected by a variable region (1Park M.H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 4Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In an effort to validate the super helical structure of DOHH, its secondary structure was determined by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 1). The purified human recombinant wild type enzyme (WT1) displayed a CD spectra typical of an α-helix-rich protein (Fig. 1) and was found to contain 77 ± 1% α-helix, 0 ± 2% β-sheet, 5 ± 1% turn, and 18 ± 1% remainder. This experimentally determined α-helical content is in close agreement with the calculated value obtained from the predicted HEAT-repeat model (76–78%) of DOHH.DOHH contains four characteristic, strictly conserved His-Glu motifs that were proposed as the metal binding sites. To investigate the role of these residues in structure, metal binding, and catalysis, we generated mutant enzymes with substitution of the His-Glu pairs with Ala-Ala pairs and also mutants with the eight His or Glu residues individually replaced with alanine. Alanine substitution was chosen because it effectively negates side-chain effects and was predicted not to alter the secondary structure of main chains. As expected, all of the mutant enzymes with alanine substitution of the conserved His-Glu residues gave CD spectra similar to that of the wild type DOHH (data not shown). Furthermore, the CD spectrum of the wild type apoenzyme, WTa1, was also similar to that of the iron-containing enzyme WT1 (data not shown). These findings suggest that the α-helical secondary structure of DOHH does not depend on the conserved His-Glu motifs or metal binding.Activities and Metal Content of the Wild Type DOHH and Mutant Enzymes; Identification of Fe(II) as the Catalytic Metal for DOHH—Purified human recombinant DOHH catalyzed the conversion of deoxyhypusine-containing eIF5A, eIF5A(Dhp), to the hypusine-containing protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). The pH dependence activity measurement indicates that the purified recombinant enzyme has optimal activity at pH 8–8.5 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Time (A), concentration (B), and pH (C) dependence of the DOHH reaction. DOHH reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 2.5 × 104 dpm of labeled substrate protein. The hypusine formed is that from half of the reaction mixture. The nonlinearity of the reaction in A and B is due to depletion of the substrate protein. In A, 0.2 μg of purified human recombinant enzyme was used, and the pH of the reaction was 7.5. In B, the reaction time was 60 min at pH 7.5. In C, 0.2 μg of enzyme was used, and incubation was 1 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the metal content of the wild type DOHH (purified by one-step affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose followed by cleavage of the GST tag) was measured by inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry, iron was found to be the major metal. In the early preparations of wild type enzyme, its content varied from 0.7 to 1.3 mol/mol (not shown). The variation in the iron content in different preparations of wild type enzyme appears to be due to a gradual dissociation of iron during purification and due to the differences in the extent of buffer exchange or dialysis before the metal analysis. Although a low level of Zn2+ was detected in some DOHH preparations, of the nine metals analyzed (Cadmium, Cobalt, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Nickel, and Zinc), no metal other than iron was consistently found to be associated with DOHH at a significant level (>0.07 mol/mol).The importance of iron in DOHH activity is evident from the reduction or loss of activity upon removal of enzyme-bound iron. Compared with the activity of WT1 (the wild type enzyme purified by one-step affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose), WTa1, prepared using a lysis buffer containing 4 mm EDTA followed by gel filtration, and WTa2, prepared from WT1 by removal of iron by extensive dialysis in acidic sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5, were found to contain a very low level of iron (0.02 mol of iron/mol of DOHH) (Fig. 3A). Both preparations (WTa1 and WTa2) showed a marked reduction in DOHH activity (Fig. 3B). The addition of ferrous ion (2 μm) increased the activity of a normal wild type DOHH preparation (WT1) and restored the activities of WTa1 and WTa2 enzymes to a large extent, indicating that the lack of iron was the cause for the reduced activities of the two apoenzyme preparations.FIGURE 3Iron content (A) and DOHH activities (B) of the wild type and mutant enzymes. A, the iron content was determined for WT1, WTa1, and WTa2 and 12 mutant enzymes using ∼100 μgof purified proteins. B, the DOHH reaction was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild type enzymes (WT1, WTa1, and WTa2) were used at 0.1 μg with or without 2 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate. The 12 mutant enzymes (M1, H56A; M2, E57A; M3, H89A; M4, E90A; M5, H207A; M6, E208A; M7, H240A; M8, E241A; DM1, H56A/E57A; DM2, H89A/E90A; DM3, H207A/E208A; DM4, H240A/E241A) were assayed at 0.3- and 3.0-μg levels (bars shown are for 3.0 μg only). hDOHH, human DOHH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi"

A proteolytic fragment of the apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer in the nucleus (Acinus), which is generated by caspase cleavage, has been implicated in mediating apoptotic chromatin condensation prior to DNA fragmentation. Acinus is also involved in mRNA splicing and a component of the apoptosis and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex. To study the role of Acinus for apoptotic nuclear alterations, we generated stable cell lines in which Acinus isoforms were knocked down by inducible and reversible RNA interference. We show that Acinus is not required for nuclear localization and interaction of the other ASAP subunits SAP18 and RNPS1; however, knockdown of Acinus leads to a reduction in cell growth. Most strikingly, down-regulation of Acinus did not inhibit apoptotic chromatin condensation either in intact cells or in a cell-free system. In contrast, although apoptosis proceeds rapidly, analysis of nuclear DNA from apoptotic Acinus knockdown cells shows inhibition of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Our results therefore suggest that Acinus is not involved in DNA condensation but rather point to a contribution of Acinus in internucleosomal DNA cleavage during programmed cell death.

Our results therefore suggest that Acinus is not involved in DNA condensation but rather point to a contribution of Acinus in internucleosomal DNA cleavage during programmed cell death. Activation of a family of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases, called caspases, is central to the cellular process of apoptosis or programmed cell death (1Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K.

Activated caspases execute cell death via cleavage of specific target proteins, which results in characteristic cytoplasmic and nuclear morphological alterations (3Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Whereas cytoplasmic changes include cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing, cleavage of the nuclear lamina, oligonucleosomal laddering of DNA, and condensation of chromatin are the typical nuclear alterations of apoptosis (4Kerr J.F.

One major factor involved in the apoptotic oligonucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA is the caspase-activated DNase (CAD), 2The abbreviations used are: CAD, caspase-activated DNase; ICAD, inhibitor CAD; ASAP, apoptosis and splicing-associated protein; LDH, lactate dehydroxygenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFGE, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; RT, reverse transcription; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RNAi, RNA interference; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. 2The abbreviations used are: CAD, caspase-activated DNase; ICAD, inhibitor CAD; ASAP, apoptosis and splicing-associated protein; LDH, lactate dehydroxygenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PFGE, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; RT, reverse transcription; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RNAi, RNA interference; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. which in healthy cells exists as a dimer bound to its inhibitor, ICAD (8Liu X.

Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). During apoptosis ICAD is cleaved by active caspase-3 leading to release and activation of CAD. Activated CAD cleaves nuclear DNA at the boundaries between nucleosomes and produces the oligonucleosomal DNA ladder characteristic for apoptotic cells (10Nagata S. Nagase H. Kawane K. Mukae N. Fukuyama H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation by CAD has been also implicated in apoptotic chromatin condensation, because in many cases elimination of CAD activity impairs condensation of chromatin (12Zhang J. Liu X.

Because chromatin condensation at the nuclear periphery can still be observed in the absence of CAD activity, additional factors involved in apoptotic chromatin condensation have been proposed (13Sakahira H.

Another target protein of caspases during apoptosis implicated in nuclear changes is the apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer in the nucleus (Acinus) (20Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Acinus is expressed in different isoforms, which are most likely generated by alternative splicing. During apoptosis Acinus is cleaved by caspase-3 and a still unknown protease to produce a 23-kDa fragment (p23) that is contained in all described nonapoptotic isoforms of Acinus. Importantly, Acinus-p23 has been reported to mediate apoptotic chromatin condensation prior to DNA fragmentation in an in vitro system utilizing permeabilized cells (20Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y.

Cleavage of Acinus might also be involved in nonapoptotic functions of caspases, e.g. during terminal erythroid differentiation, consistent with a potential role in enucleation during erythropoiesis (21Schwerk C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Zermati Y. Garrido C. Amsellem S. Fishelson S. Bouscary D. Valensi F. Varet B. Solary E. Hermine O. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments Acinus was identified as a component of functional spliceosomes and as a subunit of a novel apoptosis and splicing-associated protein (ASAP) complex (23Schwerk C. Prasad J. Degenhardt K. Erdjument-Bromage H. White E. Tempst P. Kidd V.J. Manley J.L. Lahti J.M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Zhou Z.

Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1231-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition to Acinus, the ASAP complex is composed of RNPS1, a general activator of RNA splicing, and SAP18, which has been originally identified as part of the Sin3-histone deacetylase complex (23Schwerk C. Prasad J. Degenhardt K. Erdjument-Bromage H. White E. Tempst P. Kidd V.J. Manley J.L. Lahti J.M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, ASAP has also been identified as part of the exon junction complex, a multiprotein complex that is deposited at exon-exon junctions during RNA splicing (28Tange T.O. Shibuya T. Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2005; 11: 1869-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest that Acinus might be involved in both apoptosis and pre-mRNA processing, which are not necessarily exclusive. Accordingly, Acinus is located in nuclear compartments, termed interchromatin granule clusters, which are thought to function as storage sites for splicing factors (29Saitoh N. Spahr C.S. Patterson S.D. Bubulya P. Neuwald A.F. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3876-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To address the role of Acinus during apoptosis in more detail, we report here the consequences of down-regulation of the nonapoptotic isoforms of Acinus employing an inducible RNA interference (RNAi) system. Knockdown of Acinus causes a slow growth phenotype in HeLa cells. However, depletion of Acinus did not inhibit apoptotic chromatin condensation in vivo as well as in vitro. Interestingly, although activation of caspases and cleavage of substrates proceeded rapidly, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was inhibited in the Acinus knockdown cells. Our results point to a physiologically significant contribution of Acinus to the activity of apoptotic nucleases or their access to DNA during apoptosis. Plasmid Construction—A 19-nucleotide oligonucleotide targeted against nucleotides 3121-3140 of the Acinus mRNA (5′-GAGGCCTTCTGGATTGACA-3′) was designed using the workstation software from OligoEngine (Seattle, WA). The 64-nucleotide short hairpin RNA sense primer 5′-GATCCCCGAGGCCTTCTGGATTGACATTCAAGAGATGTCAATCCAGAAGGCCTCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGAGGCCTTCTGGATTGACATCTCTTGAATGTCAATCCAGAAGGCCTCGGG-3′ were annealed and ligated into the pSUPERIOR vector (OligoEngine) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue Culture, Transfection, and Biological Reagents—HeLa T-REx cells stably expressing the tetracycline repressor were obtained from Invitrogen. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, supplemented with 10% tetracycline-reduced fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all from PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria), and 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the transfected cells were selected using geneticin (G418 solution; PAA Laboratories GmbH). Staurosporine was obtained from Sigma, and recombinant human TNF-α with a specific activity of 4 × 107 units/mg was from Knoll AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Monoclonal antibodies against Mcl-1 and PARP were purchased from Pharmingen and those against c-FLIP were from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). An antibody against RNPS-1 (27Mayeda A. Badolato J. Kobayashi R. Zhang M.Q. Gardiner E.M. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was a gift from Akila Mayeda. The antibody against Acinus has been described before (23Schwerk C. Prasad J. Degenhardt K. Erdjument-Bromage H. White E. Tempst P. Kidd V.J. Manley J.L. Lahti J.M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Goat antibodies recognizing caspase-3 were obtained fromR&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Rabbit antibodies against SAP18 and ICAD were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against phospho-H2A.X (Ser-139) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Knockdown of Acinus and Survival Assay—Knockdown of Acinus in the HeLa-A3121 stable cell lines was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen). Cells transfected with the empty pSUPERIOR vector control were treated similarly. Maximal RNA interference and knockdown of Acinus in the A3121 cells were observed after 4-5 days of tetracycline treatment. For experimental analysis, A3121 and pSUPERIOR cells were maintained in tetracycline for 72 h or extended periods. For measurement of cell numbers, cells were either counted or 1 × 104 cells were seeded into 96-well plates in triplicate and were serially diluted 1:1. After 8 days cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and 20% methanol for 20 min and washed extensively. Stained cells were solubilized with 33% acetic acid, and the absorbance was measured at 560 nm. Cell viability after staurosporine treatment was determined by measurement of the release of lactate dehydroxygenase (LDH) employing a cytotoxicity detection kit following the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitations—Extracts for immunoprecipitation were prepared as follows: 1 × 107 cells were collected, and the cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. The supernatant or cytosolic fraction was collected after centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 400 mm, and the sample was incubated on ice for 30 min. The sample was freeze-thawed, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants used as input material for immunoprecipitations. SAP18 antibodies were bound to 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm KCl. The beads were incubated for 12 h with 100 μl of the input material at 4 °C. Following four washes with buffer C containing 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40, protein complexes were eluted from the beads with 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cell Extracts, Western Blotting, and Caspase Assays—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in a high salt buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture. The protein content was determined, and equal amounts of proteins were subsequently separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (4-15% gradient gels) and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and then immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C using the respective primary antibody. Caspase-3 activity in apoptotic cells was determined by incubating cell lysates with 50 μm of a fluorogenic substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT. The release of aminomethylcoumarin was measured by fluorometry using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 475 nm. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted from 6 × 105 cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The amount of total RNA was spectrophotometrically determined. 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified in a one-step reaction using the TITANIUM One-step RT-PCR kit (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For amplification of Acinus, primers targeting the following sequences at the C-terminal end of Acinus-L (product size, 326 bp) were used: forward primer 5′-CAGATCGTTCAGAAAGAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGGGTGGGCGCCGC-3′. For the amplification of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (product size, 329 bp), the following primer pair was used: forward primer 5′-GTGGAAGGACTCATGACCACAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGGTGCTCAGTGTAGCCCAG-3′ DNA Laddering Assays—DNA for detection of apoptotic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was prepared according to the protocol of Hirt (30Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells seeded in 60-mm dishes were washed with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysing solution containing 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and after overnight incubation at 4 °C, the precipitated salt and SDS were pelleted at 25,000 rpm for 20 min in an ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. DNA laddering was then analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)—Plugs for PFGE were prepared using the CHEF mammalian genomic DNA plug kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PFGE was performed using the Gene Path System (Bio-Rad). 1% certified megabase-agarose (Bio-Rad) horizontal gels were run at 14 °C with program no. 18 for the separation of 50 kb to 1 Mb DNA fragments for 19.5 h. In Vitro Chromatin Condensation Assays—Cytoplasmic extracts for in vitro chromatin condensation assays were prepared as described (31Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) with slight alterations. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and harvested by scraping from the tissue culture dishes. After one more wash with PBS, cells were suspended with cold buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA) and resuspended in 1.5 volume of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA) containing 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitor mixture. After swelling on ice for 30 min, the cells were lysed by douncing. Subsequently, nuclei and cell debris were spun down at 1500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was spun again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. In the final supernatant the potassium acetate concentration was adjusted to 110 mm. For permeabilization, cells were rinsed twice with buffer B and then treated with buffer B containing 2 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml digitonin, and 1 μg/ml DAPI for 45 min at room temperature, followed by two washing steps with buffer B containing 2 mm DTT. For in vitro chromatin condensation assays 25 μl of reaction mixture was added to the permeabilized cells and sealed with a coverslip. The reaction mixture contained 300 μg of cytoplasmic extract, 5 μm phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm ATP and, where indicated, 1 μg of recombinant caspase-3. Control reactions were performed in the absence of cytoplasmic extract. The reactions were incubated for 3 h at 37°C and analyzed using an Axiovert135 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with OpenLab software (Improvision, Tübingen, Germany). Stable Vector-mediated, Inducible, and Reversible Knockdown of Acinus—To achieve an inducible knockdown of Acinus, we stably transfected HeLa T-REx cells with a tetracycline-regulated pSUPERIOR RNAi construct (A3121), which was directed against a sequence contained in all described isoforms of Acinus. As experimental control, the empty pSUPERIOR plasmid was stably introduced into HeLa T-REx cells. After selection of cells with stable integration of the plasmids, individual clones were analyzed for down-regulation of Acinus. Significant knockdown of both the long and short isoform of Acinus was detected in three individual clones on the level of protein (Fig. 1a)aswell as RNA (Fig. 1b) after 48-72 h of induction of RNA interference with tetracycline when compared with a control clone containing only the empty vector. The three clones exhibited comparable results in all analyses presented below. Because the reduction of target proteins in RNAi experiments is directly related to protein turnover rates, we examined the stability of Acinus by treatment of cells with cycloheximide. As can be seen in Fig. 1c, Acinus as well as the ASAP subunit SAP18 displayed a rather slow turnover rate when compared with the Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1 or the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP-s. Thus, maximal reduction of Acinus requires induction of RNAi over a longer period of time. This was confirmed by examination of three independent long term tetracycline-treated Acinus knockdown clones, which allowed reduction of Acinus isoforms to >95% (Fig. 1d). We reproducibly observed that also in absence of tetracycline the amounts of Acinus in HeLa-A3121 cells were lower compared with the control cells, indicating that some background RNAi occurred even in noninduced cells (Fig. 1d and data not shown). Additionally, it is noteworthy that knockdown of Acinus led to a slight but reproducible reduction of SAP18, an interaction partner of Acinus, in all three clones (Fig. 1d). Reduction of subunits of a multiprotein complex after knockdown of another subunit has been described before (32Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Acinus was reversible, because removal of tetracycline restored Acinus expression (Fig. 1e). Subsequently experiments were performed with long term tetracycline-treated cells to achieve a maximum reduction of Acinus isoforms. Additionally, cells induced for RNAi against Acinus for 72 h were used to demonstrate that results obtained with the knockdown cells are not because of secondary effects caused by long term depletion of Acinus. Acinus Is Not Required for Maintaining a Nuclear SAP18-RNPS1 Complex—Nuclear ASAP complexes are composed of the subunits SAP18, RNPS1, and distinct Acinus isoforms (23Schwerk C. Prasad J. Degenhardt K. Erdjument-Bromage H. White E. Tempst P. Kidd V.J. Manley J.L. Lahti J.M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine whether depletion of Acinus influences the cellular localization of the other ASAP subunits as well as the interaction between RNPS1 and SAP18, we generated cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from HeLa-pSUPERIOR and HeLa-A3121 cells cultured in the absence and presence of tetracycline. Western blot analysis showed that components of the ASAP complex are exclusively detectable in the nuclear fraction under all conditions investigated, indicating that Acinus is not required for nuclear localization of SAP18 and RNPS1 (Fig. 2). To determine whether an interaction between SAP18 and RNPS1 is maintained in the absence of Acinus, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments employing an antibody directed against SAP18. Significantly, although comparable amounts of RNPS1 were co-immunoprecipitated with SAP18 under all conditions, virtually no Acinus isoforms could be detected by Western blotting in the eluates from the immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with HeLa-A3121 cells induced with tetracycline for 72 h, although due to less complete knockdown small amounts of Acinus isoforms co-immunoprecipitated with SAP18 (data not shown). These results implicate that an interaction between SAP18 and RNPS1 persists after depletion of Acinus isoforms. Induction of Acinus Knockdown Leads to a Slow Growth Phenotype—One of the first observations when analyzing the RNAi clones was a clear reduction of cell growth after induction of Acinus knockdown by treatment of HeLa-A3121 cells with tetracycline. The growth characteristics of HeLa-A3121 cells cultured in the presence and absence of tetracycline compared with HeLa-pSUPERIOR cells are shown in Fig. 3a. To allow a quantification of cell growth, we performed serial dilutions of three independent Acinus knockdown clones as well as pSUPERIOR control cells in the presence and absence of tetracycline. An evaluation of cell growth after crystal violet staining and subsequent densitometric analysis is shown in Fig. 3b. Addition of tetracycline caused a significant reduction of cell growth in three independent HeLa-A3121 clones, but not in HeLa-pSUPERIOR control cells. Noteworthy, the reduced cell growth of the Acinus knockdown cells was not because of induction of cellular senescence, as determined by a senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay (data not shown). Caspase Activation and Substrate Cleavage Proceed Rapidly in Acinus Knockdown Cells—In its original description Acinus had been identified as a factor involved in nuclear apoptotic processes (20Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To analyze whether knockdown of Acinus has a general influence on the progress of apoptosis, we produced whole cell extracts from HeLa-pSUPERIOR and HeLa-A3121 cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline. The cells had been treated with the apoptosis inducer staurosporine for different amounts of time. Because a hallmark of apoptosis is the activation of caspases, we employed a substrate assay to determine caspase-3-like activity in the cell extracts. As can be seen in Fig. 4a, caspase-3-like proteases were rapidly activated in Acinus knockdown cells with substrate cleavage clearly detectable already after 1.5 h of staurosporine treatment. A close inspection of the progress of substrate cleavage indicated that even a slight acceleration of caspase activation might have occurred. We next investigated whether activation of caspases was accompanied by cleavage of target proteins in Acinus knock-down cells. Analysis of the caspase substrates PARP (Fig. 4b) and ICAD (Fig. 4c) by Western blotting confirmed cleavage during the progress of apoptosis, which paralleled the activation of caspases seen in the substrate assay, again indicating a slight acceleration of cell death might have occurred in the Acinus knockdown cells. For instance, whereas only partial PARP cleavage was detectable in the control or noninduced HeLa-A3121 cells 2 h after staurosporine treatment, Acinus knockdown cells revealed complete PARP cleavage already after 1.5 h of treatment, accompanied by significant loss of the full-length form of ICAD. Significant lactate dehydroxygenase release was detected after 24 h (Fig. 4d), showing that the cells died after incubation with staurosporine. Apoptotic Chromatin Condensation Is Not Inhibited by Depletion of Acinus—Condensation of nuclear chromatin is a phenomenon observed late during apoptosis following activation of caspases and cl"
https://openalex.org/W2141430858,"To find novel cytoplasmic binding partners of the α1D-adrenergic receptor (AR), a yeast two-hybrid screen using the α1D-AR C terminus as bait was performed on a human brain cDNA library. α-Syntrophin, a protein containing one PDZ domain and two pleckstrin homology domains, was isolated in this screen as an α1D-AR-interacting protein. α-Syntrophin specifically recognized the C terminus of α1D- but not α1A- or α1B-ARs. In blot overlay assays, the PDZ domains of syntrophin isoforms α, β1, and β2 but not γ1 or γ2 showed strong selective interactions with the α1D-AR C-tail fusion protein. In transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, full-length α1D- but not α1A- or α1B-ARs co-immunoprecipitated with syntrophins, and the importance of the receptor C terminus for the α1D-AR/syntrophin interaction was confirmed using chimeric receptors. Mutation of the PDZ-interacting motif at the α1D-AR C terminus markedly decreased inositol phosphate formation stimulated by norepinephrine but not carbachol in transfected HEK293 cells. This mutation also dramatically decreased α1D-AR binding and protein expression. In addition, stable overexpression of α-syntrophin significantly increased α1D-AR protein expression and binding but did not affect those with a mutated PDZ-interacting motif, suggesting that syntrophin plays an important role in maintaining receptor stability by directly interacting with the receptor PDZ-interacting motif. This direct interaction may provide new information about the regulation of α1D-AR signaling and the role of syntrophins in modulating G protein-coupled receptor function.

Three α1-AR subtypes have been cloned (α1A-, α1B-, and α1D-AR) and display differences in sequence homology and affinities for subtype selective ligands (1Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Upon agonist stimulation, all three α1-AR subtypes signal through Gαq/11 to increase phospholipase C activity and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (1Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Hague C. Chen Z. Uberti M. Minneman K.P. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies using α1-AR transgenic and knock-out mice have now revealed that all three α1-AR subtypes are important for the regulation of blood pressure (2Hague C. Chen Z. Uberti M.

Therefore, it remains unclear if specific functional differences exist between the α1-AR subtypes. Increasing evidence now suggests that α1-AR subtypes display differences in their ability to interact with specific protein binding partners. The first α1-AR subtype-selective binding partner identified was tissue transglutaminase II, which selectively associates with α1B- and α1D-ARs (4Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A.

Therefore, these differential interactions may contribute to subtype-specific differences between the members of the α1-AR family. Previously, the α1D-AR was the least studied of the α1-AR subtypes due to difficulties in obtaining significant cell surface expression and poor signaling in heterologous systems. Recent studies have reported that this is due to the primary intracellular localization of this receptor (10Chalothorn D. McCune D.F. Edelmann S.E. Garcia-Cazarin M.L. Tsujimoto G. Piascik M.T. Mol.

However, it remains unknown if there are any α1D-AR accessory proteins involved in α1D-AR function and/or expression. In this study, we have identified several closely related syntrophin family isoforms (α, β1, and β2) as novel α1D-AR binding partners using a combination of yeast two-hybrid screening and biochemical techniques. We report that syntrophins directly interact with α1D-ARs through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction. The specificity of this association and its potential role in regulating α1D-AR expression and signaling were examined. Materials and Reagents—Materials used in this study were obtained from the following sources. Components for yeast two-hybrid screening (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA): YPD agar and YPD broth (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA); 425–600 μm glass beads (acid-washed, G8772), anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell culture media: trypsin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), fetal bovine serum, Lipofectamine 2000, 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen); goat anti-mouse κ HRP-conjugate (Southern Biotechnology Associate, Birmingham, AL); human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA); n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem); QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); ProTran nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell); ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); HRP-conjugated S protein (Novagen, San Diego, CA); mouse anti-syntrophins antibody (MA1–745, Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Plasmid pGBKT7/α1D-C-tail (aa 480–572) was used as bait to screen a human brain pretransformed cDNA library (in pACT2) by using the standard yeast mating protocol stated in the manual. Yeast were plated on high stringency selective medium (SD/–Leu/–Trp/–His/–Ade) and incubated for 7 days at 30 °C. Positive colonies were restreaked on selective medium (SD/–Leu/–Trp/–His/-Ade). Yeast DNA extracts were obtained by using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit supplemented with 250 μl of 425–600 μm glass beads in buffer P1 by vortexing for 5 min. Library plasmid DNA was rescued from positive colonies by transforming yeast DNA extracts into Escherichia coli TOP10F′ cells and selected by 30 μg/ml ampicillin. Meanwhile, yeast DNA extracts were used as the template for PCR using MATCHMAKER 5′AD and 3′AD LD-insert screening amplimers as primers and subjected to further sequence analysis. To test the specificity of the interaction, isolated library cDNAs were co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 together with a bait plasmid, either pGBKT7/α1D-C-tail, empty vector pGBKT7, or other plasmids as indicated. Transformed yeast were subjected to growth tests on high stringency selective medium. Plasmid Construction—Mouse α-syntrophin in pBluescript II SK(–) was kindly given by Dr. Stanley Froehner (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). α-Syntrophin in pDT mammalian expression plasmid was constructed by cloning an α-syntrophin fragment from pBluescript/α-syntrophin into HindIII/BamHI sites of pDT vector. The N-terminal FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged α1-AR constructs were constructed as previously described (12Pupo A.S. Uberti M.A. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 462: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Vicentic A. Robeva A. Rogge G. Uberti M. Minneman K.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The α1D-AR construct with the PDZ-interacting motif substituted with alanine residues was generated by PCR using the full-length α1D-AR as template and the primers CAACCGCCACCTGCAGACCGTCACCAACTA (forward) and GCCGACTACAGCAACCTAGCAGCAGCAGCTGCTTAAACGCGTGCT (reverse), digested with AgeI and MluI, and ligated with HA-Ntrα1D construct (Δ1–79 truncation) (12Pupo A.S. Uberti M.A. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 462: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to replace the corresponding normal C-terminal domain. The resultant α1D-AR construct was sequenced to confirm the alanine substitution at the PDZ-interacting motif. The chimeric α1B-AR construct with the α1D-AR C terminus was constructed by the following. A silent mutation forming an EcoRI site (GAATTC) was introduced to the conserved EFK motifs at the α1B-AR (1062G→A) and the α1D-AR construct (1224G→A), respectively. The C-terminal regions of those two mutated constructs were swapped by EcoRI and MluI to generate the C-terminal chimeric receptor constructs. Fusion Protein Construction—To construct GST-tagged receptor C-terminal fusion protein plasmids, β1-C-tail (the C-terminal 100 aa of the human β1-AR (17Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) and α1D-C-tail (the C-terminal 93 aa of the human α1D-AR) were amplified by PCR and then subcloned into pGEX-4T1 using the EcoRI and XhoI sites. To construct hexahistidine-tagged and S protein-tagged PDZ domain fusion protein plasmids, α-Syn-PDZ (mouse α-syntrophin, 79–228 aa) was amplified by PCR and then inserted into pET30a at the BamHI and XhoI sites, whereas β1-Syn-PDZ (mouse β1-syntrophin, 106–252 aa), β2-Syn-PDZ (human β2-syntrophin, 111–265 aa), γ1-Syn-PDZ (mouse γ1-syntrophin, 52–201 aa), and γ2-Syn-PDZ (mouse γ2-syntrophin, 68–215 aa) constructs were prepared by PCR and inserted into pET30a at the EcoRI and XhoI sites. PSD95-PDZ3 (rat PSD 95, 307–446 aa) and membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-2 (MAGI2)-PDZ1 (human MAGI2, 446–571 aa) were generated as previously described (17Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Blot Overlay Assays—The interaction between the GST-tagged receptor C-terminal fusion proteins and His6/S-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins was assayed via blot overlay assays. 2 μg of purified His6-tagged syntrophin PDZ domain fusion proteins were run on a 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel for 1.5–2 h at 125 V and then transferred to ProTran nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) consisting of 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature (RT), subsequently incubated with 25 nm GST-tagged α1D-C-tail fusion proteins containing 2% nonfat milk for at least 1 h at RT, washed 3 times with TBST, incubated at RT with monoclonal anti-GST antibody, washed 3 times with TBST, and then incubated with a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. After 6 washes with TBST, bands were visualized with ECL. PSD95-PDZ3 and MAGI2-PDZ1 fusion proteins were used as controls. In other experiments 2 μg of purified GST or GST fusion proteins as indicated were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and overlaid with 25 nm His6/S-tagged indicated PDZ domain fusion proteins. Interaction was detected by HRP-conjugated S protein and ECL. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 105 units/liter penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For transient transfection, 8 μg of indicated plasmid DNA was mixed with Lipofectamine2000 and serum-free medium at RT for 20 min and added to HEK293 cells growing in a 150-mm tissue culture plate. Cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection for further experimentation. For stable transfection cells were selected in the presence of 400–800 μg/ml Geneticin. Membrane Preparation—For radioligand binding, cells grown on 150-mm tissue culture plates were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and membrane preparations were prepared as previously described (18Chen Z.

For immunoprecipitation, cells were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and membrane preparations were prepared as previously described (13Uberti M. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Membrane preparations were solubilized by 2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the supernatant was incubated with either anti-FLAG affinity gel or anti-HA affinity matrix in 0.2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside prepared in 1× buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA) with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 3 μm pepstatin, 3 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μm aprotinin, and 3 μm leupeptin) overnight at 4 °C. An aliquot of 50 μl of supernatant was incubated with 4× Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) to examine expression of proteins in the solubilized fraction. The next day the affinity gel/matrix was collected by centrifugation, washed with 1× buffer 3 times at 4 °C, and eluted with an equal volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated samples were run on 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST buffer at RT, incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:600) or anti-HA-mouse antibody (1:5000) at RT, washed with TBST and detected with ECL or incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000) and then detected with ECL. For overexpression of α-syntrophin with HF-α1D-AR and ΔPDZ-HF-Ntrα1D-AR, immunoprecipitation was done as previously described (19Balasubramanian S. Teissere J.A. Raju D.V. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding—Receptor density was determined by saturation binding assays as previously described (18Chen Z. Rogge G. Hague C. Alewood D. Colless B. Lewis R.J. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35326-35333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 3H-Labeled Inositol Phosphate (InsP) Formation—Receptor function in transfected HEK293 cells was measured by [3H]inositol phosphate (InsP) formation upon NE stimulation as previously described (18Chen Z.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35326-35333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 10–4 m carbachol was used as a control. Data Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of results obtained from the indicated number of observations. For saturation binding assays, KD and Bmax were calculated by nonlinear regression using Prism (GraphPad). α-Syntrophin Is a Specific Binding Partner for the α1D-AR C Terminus—To identify novel α1D-AR-associated proteins, a human α1D-AR partial C terminus (α1D-C-tail) was used as bait to screen a human brain pretransformed cDNA library. From a total of 3 × 105-independent diploids screened, 9 positive clones were obtained. One positive clone was identified as a gene fragment of human α-syntrophin (hα-syn). This fragment contained an intact PDZ domain and is displayed in schematic form in Fig. 1. The α1D-AR is known to contain a putative PDZ-interacting motif at the distal end of its C-tail (568RETDI572) that is highly homologous to the conserved PDZ-interacting motif ((K/Q/R)E(S/T)X(V/I)) previously demonstrated to be recognized by syntrophins (20Gee S.H. Madhavan R. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gee S.H. Quenneville S. Lombardo C.R. Chabot J.

Biol. 2004; 343: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The specificity of the interaction between hα-syn and α1D-C-tail was confirmed by further yeast two-hybrid analysis. The hα-syn library construct was co-transformed into yeast strain AH109 with individual baits α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-C-tails. Transformed yeast containing the indicated bait and hα-syn (Fig. 2A) were subjected to growth tests on selective medium. As shown in Fig. 2B, only yeast co-transformed with hα-syn and α1D-C-tail were able to grow on high stringency selective medium. These findings suggest that hα-syn specifically interacts with the C terminus of α1D- but not α1A-or α1B-ARs.FIGURE 2α-Syntrophin specifically interacts with the C terminus of α1D-ARs in yeast. A, yeast strain AH109 co-transformed with the α-syntrophin library clone, and either the indicated receptor C-terminal constructs (α1A, α1B, and α1D) or vector was streaked on a mating medium (SD/–Leu/–Trp). B, yeast streaked on A were restreaked on a high stringency-selective medium (SD/–Leu/–Trp/–His/–Ade).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) α1D-AR C-tail GST Fusion Proteins Specifically Associate with Purified Syntrophin Isoforms—Five syntrophin isoforms have been cloned (α, β1, β2, γ1, γ2), each containing a highly homologous PDZ domain (23Piluso G. Mirabella M. Ricci E. Belsito A. Abbondanza C. Servidei S. Puca A.A. Tonali P. Puca G.A. Nigro V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15851-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine the interaction specificity of the α1D-C-tail with different syntrophin isoforms, blot overlay assays were performed using hexahistidine (His6)/S protein-tagged syntrophin PDZ domains and α1D-C-tail GST fusion proteins. The PDZ domain fusion proteins were immobilized on membranes and overlaid with GST-tagged α1D-C-tail fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, GST-α1D-C-tail interacted robustly with α-, β1-, and β2-syntrophins and weakly associated with γ2-syntrophin. The third PDZ domain from PSD95 (PSD95-PDZ3) and the first PDZ domain from MAGI2-PDZ1 were used as negative controls. As expected, the α1D-C-tail did not associate with PSD95-PDZ3 or MAGI2-PDZ1. Next, we performed a reverse blot overlay to confirm our previous findings. GST-tagged α1D-C-tail fusion proteins were immobilized on membranes and overlaid with individual PDZ domain fusion proteins (Fig. 4A). Consistent with our previous experiment, the α1D-C-tail was found to specifically interact with the PDZ domains of the α, β1, and β2 isoforms of syntrophin. In addition, the α1D-C-tail did not associate with PSD95-PDZ3 and MAGI2-PDZ1, whereas consistent with previous reports (17Xu J. Paquet M. Lau A.G. Wood J.D. Ross C.A. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that the β1-AR C terminus (β1-C-tail) associated with both of these PDZ domains (Fig. 4B). Therefore, these studies suggest that the α1D-C-tail selectively associates with the α, β1, and β2 isoforms of syntrophin.FIGURE 4Different syntrophin isoforms recognize the α1D-C-tail in blot overlay assays. A, 2 μg of purified GST proteins or GST-tagged α1D-Ctail fusion proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and overlaid with 25 nm concentrations of the indicated PDZ domain fusion protein. B, 2 μg of purified GST proteins, GST-tagged β1-tail, or α1D-C-tail fusion proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and overlaid with 25 nm concentrations of the indicated PDZ domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Syntrophin Isoforms Co-immunoprecipitate with α1D-ARs in HEK293 Cells—Because the α-syntrophin PDZ domain was found to specifically interact with the α1D-C-tail in yeast (Fig. 2B) and in blot overlay assays (Figs. 3 and 4), we next determined whether full-length α1D-AR and syntrophins might associate in intact cells. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with α-syntrophin and a single N-terminal FLAG-tagged α1-AR subtype. Cells were harvested, and membrane preparations were solubilized and immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG affinity matrix. Immunoprecipitation of receptors was resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, and syntrophins were detected by the pan-specific syntrophin antibody that is able to recognize α, β1, and β2 syntrophins (24Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, untransfected HEK293 cells exhibit endogenous syntrophin immunoreactivity that is somewhat enhanced by α-syntrophin transfection. Syntrophin co-immunoprecipitated with full-length α1D-ARs but not with the other two α1-AR subtypes. These data confirm that α1D-ARs and syntrophins can interact in a cellular context. The α1D-AR Interacts with Syntrophins through Its C-tail in HEK293 Cells—Because the α1D-AR C-tail was shown to interact with α-syntrophin in yeast, we further tested whether the receptor C-tail is the major determinant for this interaction in mammalian cells, utilizing a chimeric α1B-AR with the α1D-AR C-tail (FLAG-α1B/D-ARs). This C-tail chimeric receptor showed similar pharmacological properties and Gαq/11/Ca2+ signaling to the wild type α1B-AR (data not shown). Because HEK293 cells endogenously express syntrophins (Fig. 5, left lane), cells were only transfected with FLAG-α1B-ARs, FLAG-α1D-ARs, and FLAG-α1B/D-ARs. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged receptors followed by detection for syntrophins showed that syntrophins were associated with α1D-ARs and α1B/D-ARs but not with α1B-ARs (Fig. 6), suggesting that the α1D C-tail plays an important role in its interaction with syntrophins, probably through the PDZ-interacting motif. Mutation of the PDZ-interacting Motif Affects α1D-AR Receptor Expression and Signaling—To determine whether the α1D-AR/syntrophin interaction might be involved in regulating α1D-AR function, the PDZ-interacting motif at the α1D-AR C-tail was substituted with alanine residues (568RETDI572 → 568AAAAA572) to disrupt its interaction with syntrophins, and the function of the receptors without (HA-Ntrα1D) or with the mutated PDZ-interacting motif (ΔPDZ-HA-Ntrα1D) was examined by measuring accumulation of InsPs upon NE stimulation. N-terminal-truncated α1D-ARs (Ntrα1D-AR) were used to ensure sufficient expression, since truncation does not affect receptor pharmacological or signaling properties but dramatically increases functional receptor expression on the cell surface (11Hague C. Chen Z. Pupo A.S. Schulte N. Toews M.L. Minneman K.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Pupo A.S. Uberti M.A. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 462: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In control experiments, HA-Ntrα1D was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with syntrophins when transfected in HEK293 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7, HEK293 cells stably expressing each receptor construct had similar basal InsP formations. Cells expressing HA-Ntrα1D showed a sequential increase in InsP production with increasing concentrations of NE (10–7 and 10–4 m). However, those cells expressing ΔPDZ-HA-Ntrα1D barely showed any increase over the basal even at 10–4 m NE compared with HA-Ntrα1D. Both cell lines showed similar InsP formation when challenged with 10–4 m carbachol to stimulate endogenously expressed muscarinic cholinergic receptors, suggesting the difference in InsP formation by NE was specific to the transfected receptors. To test whether this dramatic decrease in signaling is caused by a difference in receptor expression, saturation binding assays with the α1-AR specific radioligand 125I-labeled BE were performed (Fig. 8A). The receptor densities were 1916 ± 41 fmol/mg of protein for cells expressing HA-Ntrα1D and 301 ± 29 fmol/mg for those with ΔPDZ-HA-Ntrα1D. Because the heterologously expressed α1D-AR has been found to show a dramatic discrepancy between protein expression level and receptor density, probably due to its intracellular localization (14Hague C.

ΔPDZ-HA-Ntrα1D was expressed at a much lower level (nearly undetectable) compared with HA-Ntrα1D, suggesting that the poor receptor density was caused by impaired protein expression.

The three apoE isoforms differ from each other only by a single amino acid substitution involving cysteine-arginine replacement at residues 112 and 158, i.e. apoE2 (Cys112/Cys158), apoE3 (Cys112/Arg158), and apoE4 (Arg112/Arg158) (Fig. 1A). Genetically, the APOE-ϵ4 allele is associated with both familial late-onset and sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and atherosclerosis (2Greenow K. Pearce N.J. Ramji D.P. J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Lane R.M. Farlow M.R. J.

Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). AD patients carrying the APOE-ϵ4 allele have more profound deposition of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) in their brains than those carrying APOE-ϵ2 and APOE-ϵ3 alleles (5de la Torre J.C. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Farrer L.A. Cupples L.A. Haines J.L. Hyman B. Kukull W.A. Mayeux R. Myers R.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Risch N. van Duijn C.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 278: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considerable evidence supports the view that apoE4 increases the risk of AD by accelerating the plaque formation and by impairing the neurons. ApoE4 appears to modulate amyloid precursor protein processing and Aβ production through both the LDL receptor-related protein pathway and domain interaction (7Ye S. Huang Y. Mullendorff K. Dong L. Giedt G. Meng E.C. Cohen F.E. Kuntz I.D. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18700-18705Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Strong correlation of APOE-ϵ4 allele with dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, the major underlying mechanism of coronary heart disease, has been demonstrated (8Gregg R.E. Brewer Jr., H.B. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: B28-B32PubMed Google Scholar). Human apoE4 represents a dual risk factor for these two major degenerative diseases. ApoE contains two independently folded domains (N-terminal domain, residues 20-165, and C-terminal domain, residues 225-299) that are separated by a large nonstructural segment (9Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The four helices in the N-terminal domain are amphipathic (10Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the N-terminal domain of apoE isoforms have been determined by x-ray crystallography (11Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 12Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol.

Structure. 1994; 2: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which showed that this domain is arranged as an anti-parallel, elongated four-helix bundle. The C-terminal domain, which is predicted to contain three helices, is less well known. The first two helices, comprising residues 203-223 and residues 225-266, are class A type, and the third helix, consisting of residues 268 to 289, is a G* helix (9Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The G* helix and part of the end of the second helix may play a key role in lipid binding and lipid interaction in apoE-containing lipoproteins (14Sparrow J.T. Sparrow D.A. Fernando G. Culwell A.R. Kovar M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the lipid-free state, full-length apoE exists as a stable tetramer, and the C-terminal domain is responsible for tetramerization (15Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE4 is one of the major proteins associated with Aβ plaques (16Wisniewski T. Castano E.M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1030-1035PubMed Google Scholar, 17Puglielli L. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The role of apoE in the molecular pathogenesis of AD might be related to its isoform-specific interactions with lipids or Aβ aggregates. The N terminus of apoE, containing a region spanning from residues 140 to 150 (His-Leu-Arg-Lys-Leu-Arg-Lys-Arg-Leu-Leu-Arg), is rich in basic amino acids and is involved in apoB/E receptor binding (18Innerarity T.L.

Most of the basic amino acids in the vicinity of residues 136-158 are not involved in salt bridges and are on the solvent-accessible surface (13Wilson C. Mau T. Weisgraber K.H. Wardell M.R. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ApoE in VLDL promotes the catabolism of VLDL to LDL (8Gregg R.E. Brewer Jr., H.B. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: B28-B32PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE-deficient (apoE(-)) mice exhibit elevated plasma cholesterol because of impaired VLDL metabolism and develop atherosclerosis spontaneously (21Palinski W. Ord V.A. Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To correlate the structural variation between apoE4 and apoE3 isoforms and their functional disturbances, we have expressed full-length, N-terminal, and C-terminal truncated apoE proteins tailored to interrupt the potential domain or segment interactions (22Chou C.Y. Lin Y.L. Huang Y.C. Sheu S.Y. Lin T.H. Tsay H.J. Chang G.G. Shiao M.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Using analytical ultracentrifugation coupled with continuous size distribution analysis, we have demonstrated previously that apoE3-(72-299) consists of only one major species (with a sedimentation coefficient of 5.1). ApoE4-(72-299) displays a wider and more complicated species distribution. The two major species of monomer and tetramer distribution are maintained in the case of apoE3-(1-231) and apoE4-(1-231). In this study, we further elucidate the de-aggregation of different apoE3 and apoE4 protein in the presence of dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC). DHPC has the chemical structure of phospholipids and exists in solution as monomers in equilibrium with micelles comprising ∼40 molecules (the critical micelle concentration is 12.7-14.3 mm) (23Tausk R.J. Karmiggelt J. Oudshoorn C. Overbeek J.T. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 1: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Burns R.A. Jr-Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3100-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Besides sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were also used to calculate the equivalent molar mass of different apoE3 and apoE4 proteins in PBS and in the presence of lipid. Together, global analysis of both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium data gave very reliable results on the aggregational states of apoE proteins in different solvent systems. Furthermore, we report the functional studies of these isoform-specific, domain-truncated apoE proteins, including the interaction with lipid vesicles, binding with apoB/E receptor in HepG2 cells, and the cholesterol-lowering effects in apoE(-) mice. Our results provide novel evidence to correlate the structure variation of apoE3 and apoE4 to their biochemical functions and possible pathophysiologic consequences in atherosclerosis and AD. Plasmids—The pET-29a(+) (Novagen) vectors with a C-terminal His tag sequence (Ser2-His6) were used. The construction of pET-apoE3, pET-apoE3-(41-299), pET-apoE3-(72-299), pET-apoE3-(1-191), pET-apoE3-(1-231), pET-apoE3-(1-271), and those of apoE4 vectors was described previously (22Chou C.Y. Lin Y.L. Huang Y.C. Sheu S.Y. Lin T.H. Tsay H.J. Chang G.G. Shiao M.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The human apoE3-(72-166) cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR, and the forward primer was 5′-AAACATATGAAGGCCTACAAATCGGA, whereas the reverse primer was 5′-AACTCGAGGGCCCCGGCCT. The NdeI-XhoI-digested apoE3-(72-166) cDNA was then ligated to the 5.2-kb NdeI-XhoI fragment from pET-29a(+). In turn, this resulted in a 5.5-kb pET-apoE3-(72-166) vector. Site-directed mutagenesis (25Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar) was used to construct pET-apoE4-(72-166). The forward primer was 5′-GAGGACGTGCGCGGCCGCCTG and the reverse primer was 5′-AGGCGGCCGCGCACGTCCTCC. The pET-apoE3-(72-166) vectors were used as templates, and the primers were used to mutate the Cys112 codon to Arg112 codon for apoE4 by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were checked by autosequencing analysis. Purification of the Full-length, N-terminal, and C-terminal Truncated ApoE Proteins—The procedure of protein induction and purification was described previously (22Chou C.Y. Lin Y.L. Huang Y.C. Sheu S.Y. Lin T.H. Tsay H.J. Chang G.G. Shiao M.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) were used for the protein expression of apoE3 and apoE4 proteins. The others were expressed by the strain of BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). Typical yields of the apoE3 and apoE4 proteins were 5 mg and those of apoE3 and apoE4 N- or C-terminal truncated proteins were 5-20 mg after purification from 1 liter of E. coli culture medium. The purified proteins were buffer-changed by Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with the molecular mass cutoff at 10 kDa. After repeating the concentration-dilution procedure five times, the elution buffer had been fully replaced by PBS (pH 7.3). Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiment was performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Fullerton, CA). Briefly, samples (380 μl) and reference (400 μl) solutions were loaded into 12-mm double-sector Epon charcoal-filled centerpieces and mounted in an An-50 Ti rotor. Experiments were performed at 20 °C with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm. Absorbance of the sample at 280 nm was monitored in a continuous mode time interval of 360-480 s and a step size of 0.003 cm. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a continuous size distribution model by using the SEDFIT (26Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 27Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) program as described previously (22Chou C.Y. Lin Y.L. Huang Y.C. Sheu S.Y. Lin T.H. Tsay H.J. Chang G.G. Shiao M.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All size distributions were solved and regularized on a confidence level of p = 0.68 (Fig. 1, B-D) or 0.95 (Fig. 2) by maximum entropy, the best fitted average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/f0), and a resolution N of 200 sedimentation coefficients between 0.1 and 20.0 S. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Experiments were performed with six-channel Epon charcoal-filled centerpieces. Three different samples (0.10-0.12 ml) were loaded into the sample channels, and 0.11-0.13-ml buffers only were loaded into the reference channels. The cells were then loaded into the rotor and run at speed of 6,000, 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 rpm each for 14-18 h at 20 °C. Ten A280 nm scans with time interval of 8-10 min were measured for every different rotor speed to check the status of sedimentation equilibrium (SE). In our studies, all apoE proteins can achieve equilibrium state after 14 h. The scans at different rotor speeds (multispeed equilibrium data) were then globally fitted to a noninteracting discrete species model assuming a single species by using SEDPHAT (28Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) with Equation 1, AR=cr0ϵdexpM(1-ν¯ρ)ω22RT(r2-r02)(Eq. 1) in which r denotes the distance from center of rotation; r0 is an arbitrary reference radius; ω is the angular velocity; T is the absolute temperature of the rotor; R is the gas constant; ν¯ is the partial specific volume; ρ is the solvent density; ϵ is the extinction coefficient; d is the optical path length, and cr0 is the concentration at the reference radius. At each channel, a single base-line parameter was included as a floating parameter common to all rotor speeds. The time invariant and radial invariant noise were also fitted for the better fitting quality. Global analyses of combined sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity data were conducted with SEDPHAT using hybrid local continuous distribution and global discrete species model (29Schuck P. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2005: 26-50Google Scholar) with Equation 2, a(r,t)≅∑iC(i)c1(si,Mi,r,t)+∑j∫smin,jsmax,jc(j)(s)c1(s,(f/f0)w,j,r,t)ds(Eq. 2) in which cj(s) denoting the population of species with sedimentation coefficients in different nonoverlapping intervals Ij = |smin,j, smax,j| that can be characterized by separate frictional ratios, in combination with discrete species at loading concentration ci (in signal units) with s values si outside the intervals Ij. The discrete species are described by Lamm equation solutions, each with the two parameters s and M, and are not connected to the determination of (f/f0)w,j for the continuous segments. In our studies, the resolution of the local c(s) was set to zero to switch it off. Only multiple discrete species analysis was used. DMPC Turbidity Clearance Assay—Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), purchased from Sigma, was dissolved in a 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol solution. The solvent was evaporated overnight under a nitrogen stream to form a thin film on the walls of a 13 × 100-mm glass tube. The clearance buffer (PBS with 3.5% KBr and 0.1 mm EDTA) was then added into the tube and vortexed vigorously for 2 min. Dilution to 0.5 mg/ml resulted in a turbid suspension of multilamellar vesicles (mLV) with an absorbance of ∼0.9 at 325 nm. The solubilization of DMPC mLV by apoE proteins was determined according to modified procedures (30Li X. Kypreos K. Zanni E.E. Zannis V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10406-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, apoE (250 μg) was added to DMPC mLV solution (0.5 mg/ml) in a quartz cuvette, which was preincubated at 24 °C in a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Lambda 35) with water-circulated temperature control. The contents were mixed within 10 s by repeated pipetting. The vesicle solubilization was monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 325 nm. Experiments were repeated at least twice, and similar results were obtained. According to Segall et al. (32Segall M.L. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Anantharamaiah G.M. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1688-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the time courses for clearance were fitted by nonlinear regression to the monoexponential Equation 3, Y=A·e-k·t+C(Eq. 3) or the biexponential Equation 4, Y=A·e-k1·t+B·e-k2·t+C(Eq. 4) where Y is the absorbance at 325 nm, and k, k1, or k2 are the rate constants for different kinetic phases of the solution clearance. A and B are the changes in turbidity for different phases (pool sizes); t is time, and C is the remaining turbidity at the completion of the reaction. Slight differences in the initial absorbance for each time course are corrected by normalizing these values to 1 and treating all others as the fractions of this initial turbidity. Preparation of 3H-LDL—Unlabeled cholesterol (0.1 mg, dissolved in 1.0 ml of n-hexane) was added to a clean glass vial and dried under a stream of nitrogen to form a thin cholesterol film on the surface of 2-cm-high wall in a glass vial. [7-3H]Cholesterol (125-250 μCi in ethanol) (Amersham Biosciences) was added and dried under nitrogen. Human LDL (1.4 mg/ml protein) of 1-2 ml was added and incubated at 37 °C for 22 h. Finally, the 3H-LDL was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The upper layer and trace insoluble in the bottom were discarded. The middle clear solution containing 3H-LDL was transferred into a clean tube and sealed under nitrogen. Radioactivity of a small portion of 3H-LDL (10 μl) was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). LDL Receptor Binding Assay—The procedure was modified from previous studies (33Krempler F. Kostner G.M. Friedl W. Paulweber B. Bauer H. Sandhofer F. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Lundberg B.B. Suominen L.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2) (1.5 × 105) were cultured into a 1-cm diameter well in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After a 48-h incubation, cells of 50-60% confluence were washed three times with PBS and then incubated in the serum-free medium for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. When the assay began, the cells were cooled on ice for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with DMEM containing 50 μg/ml 3H-LDL, and different receptor-binding competitors (apoE) at 4 °C for 2 h. The medium was removed followed by washing three times with chilled PBS. Cells were released from the well surface by 0.2 ml of trypsin-EDTA, pipetted into a clean vial with 2 ml of 1:3 (v/v) saturated KOH/ethanol solution, and incubated at 56 °C for 2 h. Seven milliliters of n-hexane was then added into the vial for dissolving cholesterol and dried under nitrogen to form a thin film on the vial walls. Finally, every vial was added with 10 ml of Aquasol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the radioactivity was determined. In Vivo Cholesterol-lowering Effect—The ability of apoE proteins to lower plasma cholesterol in vivo was assayed by injection of proteins into apoE(-) mice (Animal Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan). Male apoE(-) mice, 6 months old, were maintained in the specific pathogen-free animal house with a 12-h light-dark cycle. The fasting plasma total cholesterol level of each apoE(-) mouse 1 day before apoE protein injection, in the range of 650-750 mg/dl (∼2.88 × 10-5 mol per 20-g mice, whose total blood volume is about 8% of the body weight) (35Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar, 36Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S.

Anim. 2000; 29: 47-53Google Scholar), was used as its own control. The cholesterol content of VLDL + LDL of an animal was estimated to be about 2.88 × 10-5 mol. For each VLDL particle (∼2000 cholesterol included) to accommodate at least one apoE molecule, the required amounts of injected proteins were estimated to be 490 μg for apoE, 420 μg for apoE-(41-299), 370 μg for apoE-(72-299), and 390 μg for apoE-(1-231). Animals were randomly assigned for each group (n = 6-8) and were injected from tail veins with 200 μl for all protein solution in PBS. By determining the concentration of total cholesterol before and 24 h after injection, the cholesterol-lowering effect was determined. Because the original concentration of cholesterol associated with VLDL + LDL was high and the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol in apoE(-) mice remained approximately constant (about 50 mg/dl) (35Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar), the plasma cholesterol-lowering effect was mainly contributed by apoE proteins to accelerate VLDL clearance in the plasma. Self-aggregation of ApoE Proteins Determined by Size Distribution Analysis—ApoE3, apoE4, and their truncated proteins were chosen for this study. Fig. 1A shows the model structure of apoE protein with different colors representing the truncated regions. Our previous study (22Chou C.Y. Lin Y.L. Huang Y.C. Sheu S.Y. Lin T.H. Tsay H.J. Chang G.G. Shiao M.S. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has elucidated the structural variation in apoE3 and apoE4 with respect to the N-terminal and C-terminal truncations. In this study, the protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was used to make clear that the structural variation of apoE3 and apoE4 is at the same tendency. ApoE3 and apoE4 proteins showed the similar size distribution patterns by continuous c(s) size distribution analysis (Fig. 1B). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the best fitting to the continuous size distribution model was 0.00578 for apoE3 and 0.00551 for apoE4. The grayscale patterns of residual bit maps showed a high quality fitting (Fig. 1, B-D, insets). The best fit f/f0 was 1.21 for apoE3 and 1.28 for apoE4. After calculating the integral area by SEDFIT, apoE3 could be resolved into five major species at s = 2.1 (3%), 4.9 (13%), 6.6 (35%), 8.6 (24%), and 10.8 (13%) and those of apoE4 were s = 1.7 (4%), 4.8 (19%), 6.3 (36%), 7.9 (21%), and 9.6 (9%). Their large components (s > 11), which were lower in content and broader in distribution, were calculated as a single region. ApoE3 and apoE4 had similar percentage of larger species (s > 11), namely 12% for apoE3 and 11% for apoE4. Compared with the simplicity in size distribution of apoE3-(72-299), apoE4-(72-299) existed in a more complicated and aggregated pattern (Fig. 1C). The r.m.s.d. of the best fitting was 0.00440 for apoE3-(72-299) and 0.00453 for apoE4-(72-299). The best fit f/f0 was 1.56 for apoE3-(72-299) and 1.44 for apoE4-(72-299). The species of apoE3-(72-299) appeared at s = 1.9 (11%), 5.2 (66%), 6.7 (21%), and 8.9 (3%), and larger species (s > 10, 1%) whereas those of apoE4-(72-299) appeared at s = 2.2 (4%), 5.4 (25%), 7.1 (35%), 8.9 (17%), and 10.8 (12%), and s > 12.0 (8%). When residues 232-299 were truncated, the two major species (s = 2.2 and 5.0) were maintained for both apoE3-(1-231) and apoE4-(1-231) (Fig. 1D). However, the contents of these two species were different between the two isoforms (apoE3-(1-231), 43% for s = 2.2 and 42% for s = 5.0 versus apoE4-(1-231), 29% for s = 2.0 and 53% for s = 4.9). Both apoE3-(1-231) and apoE4-(1-231) had a minor species at s = 6.9, whose content was 9% for apoE3-(1-231) and 11% for apoE4-(1-231). The r.m.s.d. of the best fitting was 0.00617 for apoE3-(1-231) and 0.00611 for apoE4-(1-231). The f/f0 of the best fit was 1.58 and 1.46 for apoE3-(1-231) and apoE4-(1-231), respectively. Monte-Carlo statistical analysis (supplemental Fig. 1S) demonstrated that the peaks in the size distribution were robust against noise, indicating that they were not because of reported oscillations from noise-induced artifacts in the regularization (26Schuck P.

Dissociation of ApoE Proteins in the Presence of Dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine Micelles—Because apoE proteins are intimately involved in lipid metabolism, it is ultimately important to assess the state of association of various apoE-truncated constructs in the presence of lipids, especially phospholipids. The commonly employed DMPC mLV lipid bilayer model system is too big for sedimentation studies. We chose to use the short acyl chain DHPC micellar system to address this important issue. The distributions calculated for different apoE proteins (initial concentration was 0.5 mg/ml) in the presence of 50 mm DHPC are shown in Fig. 2. All apoE proteins showed significant protein dissociation by DHPC. Each protein appeared as a major species at s = 1.6-2.2 (79, 73, 65, 75, 85, and 64% for apoE3, apoE4, apoE3-(72-299), apoE4-(72-299), apoE3-(1-231), and apoE4-(1-231), respectively). The r.m.s.d. of the best fitting to size distributions were from 0.00645 (apoE3-(72-299)) to 0.00977 (apoE4). Although the residual bit maps (Fig. 2, A-C, insets) showed some minor nonhomogeneous grayscale, the fitting quality was still reliable. In addition, the best fit f/f0 values"

We have analyzed the pre-steady state binding of Ku with various DNA duplex substrates and identified a redox-sensitive Ku-DNA interaction. Pre-steady state analysis of Ku DNA binding was monitored via intrinsic Ku quenching upon binding DNA and revealed that, under fully reduced conditions, binding occurred in a single-step process. Reactions performed under limited reduction revealed a two-step binding process, whereas under fully oxidized conditions, we were unable to detect quenching of Ku fluorescence upon binding DNA. The differential quenching observed under the different redox conditions could not be attributed to two Ku molecules binding to a single substrate or Ku sliding inward on the substrate. Although only modest differences in Ku DNA binding activity were observed in the stoichiometric anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies, as a function of redox conditions, a dramatic difference in the rate of Ku dissociation from DNA was observed. This effect was also induced by diamide treatment of Ku and could be abrogated by dithiothreitol treatment, demonstrating a reversible redox effect on the stability of the Ku-DNA complex. The redox-dependent alteration in Ku-DNA interactions is manifested by a redox-dependent alteration in Ku structure, which was confirmed by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry analyses. The results support a model for the interaction of Ku with DNA that is regulated by redox status and is achieved by altering the dissociation of the Ku-DNA complex.

Cells have developed two major pathways in which to remove such damage, homologous recombination and NHEJ (1Iliakis G. Wang H. Perrault A.R. Boecker W. Rosidi B. Windhofer F. Wu W. Guan J. Terzoudi G. Pantelias G. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2004; 104: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The Ku autoantigen is an essential component of the NHEJ pathway. Ku shows a high affinity for double strand DNA termini (2Devries E. Vandriel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and once bound to the DNA end, increases the affinity of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) for the DNA termini (3Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To accommodate the large 469-kDa DNA-PKcs, Ku translocates inward on the DNA in an ATP-independent manner, ultimately forming the active DNA-PK complex (3Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Turchi J.J. Henkels K.M. Zhou Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Activated DNA-PK then phosphorylates target proteins, including Artemis (5Poinsignon C. de Chasseval R. Soubeyrand S. Moshous D. Fischer A. Hache R.J.G. de Villartay J.P. Eur. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), all of which participate in either signaling events in response to DNA damage or completing the repair process. The crystal structure of free Ku and the Ku-DNA complex has been solved and reveals a novel DNA binding structure comprising a base, two pillars, and a bridge through which the duplex DNA can thread (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The Ku70 and -80 subunits share minimal sequence homology, yet adopt similar three-dimensional structures, with each subunit contributing to the base, pillars, and bridge (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). This ring-like structure of Ku provides the structural basis for the DNA termini requirement for binding as well as the energy-independent ability of Ku to slide along a duplex DNA. In the absence of DNA, the same general structure is observed, suggesting that the ring is preformed and not generated as a result of binding to the DNA termini (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The Ku-DNA co-crystal structure reveals no direct contact with the nucleobases but contain a number of hydrophobic amino acids positioned within the major groove of the duplex DNA termini and basic amino acids that interact with the phosphate backbone (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Photo cross-linking studies of Ku with duplex DNA have revealed a series of potential contacts that orient the Ku dimer with the 70-kDa subunit positioned closer to the terminus and the 80-kDa subunits positioned internally (3Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Yoo S. Kimzey A. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20034-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This geometry of the Ku dimer can be explained by the Ku70 subunit acidic region that potentially restricts the duplex DNA from entering the Ku dimer from the Ku70 face. This region may also serve to limit the internal sliding activity of Ku. In vitro analysis of Ku binding has been assessed using a variety of assay systems. The requirement for DNA termini was established relatively early and was demonstrated in filter binding assays (10Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of a large number of DNA structures is consistent with Ku displaying a high affinity for duplex DNA termini (11Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13Bianchi A. deLange T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Once bound to a DNA terminus, Ku also has the ability to slide or translocate along the DNA duplex (2Devries E. Vandriel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the absence of the DNA-PKcs subunit, multiple Ku molecules can thread onto a single DNA duplex, and the number of Ku dimers bound is a function of DNA length. Once bound, the dissociation from the duplex, as a result of the ring structure, requires Ku to slide off the end of the DNA. The mechanism and regulation of this dissociation is largely unclear, especially in the context of NHEJ, where dissociation must occur prior to ligation of the DNA termini. Using a series of fluorescence-based assays, there was limited cooperativity observed in the Ku-DNA binding interaction (14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is minimal interaction of the Ku dimers when bound to a DNA. These solution-based assays also demonstrate that, under moderate ionic strength, binding was stoichiometric such that minimal dissociation was observed (15Arosio D. Costantini S. Kong Y. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42826-42835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ATP and Mg2+ were found not to have major influences on binding (15Arosio D. Costantini S. Kong Y. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42826-42835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), yet dithiothreitol (DTT) has been demonstrated to increase binding activity in EMSAs, suggesting that the interaction with DNA may be regulated by redox conditions (16Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated a link between redox stress and the NHEJ pathway. This connection has been demonstrated in cells where increased oxidative stress results in decreased DNA-PK activity and where decreased oxidative stress increased DNA-PK activity (17Boldogh I. Roy G. Lee M.S. Bacsi A. Hazra T.K. Bhakat K.K. Das G.C. Mitra S. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The redox effect on NHEJ was later shown to involve autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs (18Bacsi A. Kannan S. Lee M.S. Hazra T.K. Boldogh I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), consistent with the importance of autophosphorylation on DNA-PK activity and NHEJ (19Reddy V.R. Ding Q. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K.

Regulation of redox stress via genetic mutation has also been found to influence DNA DSB repair (21Ayene I.S. Koch C.J. Tuttle S.W. Stamato T.D. Perez M.L. Biaglow J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Ku protein reveals a decrease in DNA-binding activity as a function of oxidative stress (22Ayene I.S.

To further investigate the effect of redox on Ku structure and function, we employed the intrinsic fluorescence of Ku and the subsequent quenching that occurs upon binding to DNA to assess the kinetics of binding. In addition to defining the pre-steady state kinetic interaction of Ku with duplex DNA, we identified a mechanism of redox regulation of Ku binding and demonstrated that the regulation is dependent on a conformational change that influences the Ku-DNA fluorescence and dissociation rate. DNA Substrates and Protein—Oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in Table 1. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), gel-purified by preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and annealed to the appropriate complement.

Reactions were excited at 280 nm, and fluorescence emission was measured using a 350-nm-long pass cut on filter (LG-350 from Corion, Franklin, MA). A constant Ku concentration of 25 nm was used with varying concentrations of DNA (as indicated in figure legends) to determine kinetic binding. Equal volumes of Ku and DNA were prepared in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl and were rapidly mixed at 24 °C. Traces represent an average of 12-14 individual shots. Kinetic data were fit to either a single exponential or double exponential decay using Sigmaplot software to determine kobs values. Rate constants were determined by plotting kobs values and using linear regression analysis in Sigmaplot, where the slope is the rate of association (kon), and the y-intercept is the rate of dissociation (koff). Each point represents the average ± S.D. from five individual experiments. EMSAs—EMSAs were performed in 20-μl reactions in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. Each reaction contained 500 fmol of 32P-labeled 30-bp duplex DNA with the indicated concentrations of Ku that had been dialyzed either in the presence or absence of DTT, Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Reactions were mixed and loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) screen and quantified using ImageQuant software. Fluorescence Polarization—Fluorescence polarization experiments were performed using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Varian). Reactions were performed in a volume of 0.5 ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and DTT as indicated. Saturation curves were obtained by titrating Ku into reactions containing 10 nm fluorescein-labeled duplex DNA ends in the presence or absence of 1 mm DTT and measuring anisotropy at each Ku concentration. Fluorescence excitation was at 495 nm and emission was read at 515 nm, both having bandwidths set to 5 nm. The Ku-DNA binding is represented as the r value and was calculated as described previously (24Andrews B.J. Turchi J.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Heparin Trap—To determine rates of Ku dissociation from the DNA duplex, we employed a heparin trap assay. The Ku preparation was added to 0.5-ml reactions containing the fluorescein-labeled DNA substrate. The DNA concentration used was based on DNA termini and was 10 nm for all dissociation experiments. Pre-treatment of Ku with 2 mm diamide or 5 mm DTT was performed for 15 min at room temperature. Following formation of the Ku-DNA complex, heparin (10 μg) was added, and the change in anisotropy was measured at fixed intervals over a 15-min time frame. At each time point, 2-5 independent readings were taken with parallel and perpendicular polarizers, and the calculated r values were averaged to give the value for that time point. Each dissociation experiment was performed three times, and the average ± S.D. is presented in Fig. 6. Limited Proteolysis—7.5 μg of purified Ku was analyzed in reactions containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl with or without the addition of 1 mm DTT. The reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min prior to the addition of 12.8 or 32 ng of bovine trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) and then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to a concentration of 1%, and the samples were heated to 90 °C for 5 min and loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein was detected with Coomassie Blue. Mass Spectrometry and Peptide Mapping—7.5 μg of Ku was subjected to limited proteolysis as described above. The reactions were terminated by heating to 90 °C for 5 min, and the samples were processed via PepClean™ C-18 spin columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were dried and suspended in 20 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. 2 μl of each sample was mixed with 100 fmol of a standard, insulin-oxidized B chain (3,494.65 Da mass) prior to application onto a gold ProteinChip® array (Ciphergen). CHCA was used as the matrix and was prepared as a saturated, aqueous solution that contained 50% acetonitrile and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. A total of 1.5 μl of CHCA matrix was applied to the chip and allowed to completely dry. A trypsin control was spotted alone to identify any nonspecific peaks associated from autocatalysis during each experiment. A Protein Biology System II mass spectrometer (Ciphergen) was used for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The machine was externally calibrated each time prior to use with the following peptides (Sigma) and their corresponding m/z values: human angiotensin II (1,046.54), P14R synthetic peptide (1,533.86), human ACTH-(18-39) (2,465.20), and bovine insulin-oxidized B chain (3,494.65). Each individual chip spot was analyzed with a protocol that ionized five times over 20 different areas. Spot positions were warmed with two laser shots at an intensity of 145 with the sensitivity set at 10, followed by four laser hits at an intensity of 150. The source voltage was set at 20,000 V and detector voltage at 1,900 V. Masses were collected up to 8000 Da with optimization from 1000 to 5000 Da. All mass spectra collected represent the sum of the data from 100 laser shots. Selection of peaks from raw spectra was done qualitatively using a cutoff of 2.5 for the signal-to-noise ratio. Peptide masses from data were matched with expected masses from the Ku80 (P13010) or Ku70 (P12956) subunit on the ExPASy Peptide Mass program. Matches were made up to ±3 Da relative to the observed peptide mass, taking into account enzymatic missed cut sites. LC-Q MS/MS Analysis—Following limited proteolysis, peptides were processed through C-18 spin columns, dried down, and suspended in 10 μl of 1% formic acid. Peptides were separated via reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a 0.1 × 150-mm EVEREST 5 μm, 30-nm C-18 capillary column (Vydac). The column was equilibrated and samples loaded on the column in buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid). Peptides were eluted with linear gradient from 0 to 60% buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid) over 60 min at 0.5 microliters/min. The eluate was analyzed directly using a standard orthogonal μ electrospray source and peptides detected with an LCQAdvantage ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). Individual Ku peptides were identified from their MS/MS spectra using the MASCOT search algorithm. The interaction of Ku with DNA has been analyzed using a number of systems including EMSA, surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence-based assays. The Ku structure provides a unique model for studying DNA-protein interactions, where a preformed ring in Ku encounters a DNA terminus and the duplex DNA threads through the ring. The kinetics of this interaction has not been studied and presents a novel model system for analysis of protein-DNA interactions. Ku was purified to apparent homogeneity from insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (25Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Turchi J.J. Henkels K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13861-13867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Intrinsic Ku fluorescence was assessed and revealed an excitation maximum at 280 nm and a broad emission centered at 350 nm, consistent with Trp fluorescence (data not shown). These data are consistent with a previous report of Ku fluorescent properties and demonstrate that the presence of the N-terminal His tag on the p70 subunit does not alter the intrinsic Trp fluorescence (14Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M. Di Marco S. Baldini G. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9741-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ku fluorescence was reduced ∼20% upon binding to DNA, and this signal was monitored to determine the kinetics of the Ku-DNA interaction. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the Ku-DNA binding reactions was assessed by stopped-flow analysis. In these experiments, a fixed concentration of Ku is rapidly mixed with DNA, and the change in Ku fluorescence is monitored on a millisecond time frame. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the optimal level of Ku and the time base in which to measure the interaction (data not shown). From these experiments, it became apparent that a change in the initial steady state level of Ku fluorescence was observed over time in dilute solutions. To circumvent this variation, it was determined that Ku must be diluted immediately prior to use, after which the signal was stable. Under the proper conditions, the Ku fluorescence signal was stable over a 20-s time frame when mixed with buffer alone (data not shown). During these experiments, it also became evident that the addition of DTT to the reactions resulted in a dramatically different quenching effect observed upon the interaction of Ku with DNA. In reactions supplemented with 1 mm DTT, the addition of a double strand 30-bp DNA resulted in a rapid quenching of fluorescence within 100 ms and was observed to fit to a single exponential decay, suggesting that binding under these conditions is a simple one-step interaction (Fig. 1, top trace). In DNA binding reactions performed, where the only reducing agent present was contributed from the buffer in which Ku was dialyzed such that the concentration was below 120 μm DTT, a more complex interaction was observed (Fig. 1, middle trace). Binding of Ku to DNA observed under these limited reducing conditions did not fit a single exponential decay but instead fit a double exponential decay. To determine whether this phenomenon was a result of the reducing activity of DTT, we substituted β-mercaptoethanol for DTT and analyzed the kinetics of Ku binding. The result from this experiment is presented in Fig. 1, bottom trace, and shows a single exponential decay similar to that observed for DTT-containing reactions. These results suggest that the oxidation-reduction state of Ku influences its interaction with DNA or the ability to detect the interaction via intrinsic fluorescence. One interpretation of the two-step process observed in the binding reactions performed under the limited reducing conditions is that the second step represents a second binding event on the same DNA. Considering Ku can encompass 20 bp of duplex DNA, the second event on the 30 bp would be expected to be slower as a result of steric hindrance on such a short DNA substrate. To test this hypothesis, reactions were performed using a 75-bp duplex DNA to which a second binding event would be expected to occur at the same rate as the first event, and therefore quenching under both conditions would be expected to fit a single exponential. The results presented in Fig. 2A demonstrate that, under the fully reduced conditions (top trace), binding does fit a single exponential. However, in the limited reducing reaction conditions (Fig. 2A, bottom trace), the data again fit a double exponential decay. An alternative explanation for the double exponential decay is that the slow step may represent Ku sliding along the DNA duplex. To determine whether sliding accounts for the double exponential decay, a duplex hairpin DNA substrate (21/34) identical to that used to determine the Ku DNA co-crystal was employed (8Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The interaction of Ku with this DNA substrate is restricted to a single terminus, and the limited length restricts sliding along the duplex. Using this substrate in pre-steady state quenching revealed again that, under limited reducing conditions (Fig. 2B, bottom trace), the data fit well to a double exponential decay, whereas in fully reduced conditions (Fig. 2B, top trace), a single exponential decay was observed. This data demonstrates that the Ku sliding cannot account for the different kinetic patterns observed as a function of redox state. This substrate also restricted binding to a single Ku molecule and confirms that the second event observed in the kinetic analyses is not a result of a second Ku molecule binding to the DNA. In our standard Ku preparations, the final pool is dialyzed versus buffer containing 1 mm DTT. Depending on the concentration and amount required for preparation of the binding reactions, the final DTT concentration in those reactions that were not supplemented ranged from 27.2 to 109.2 μm depending on the preparation. To determine whether this low concentration of DTT was having any effect on the binding, we purified Ku and split the final pool, half being dialyzed versus standard buffer and the other half versus buffer without DTT. These preparations were employed in the binding reactions, and in reactions with no DTT present, there was no quenching observed upon mixing Ku with the DNA (data not shown). The addition of DTT to a concentration of 1 mm restored the quenching, with the interaction fitting a single exponential decay (data not shown). The inability to detect quenching of Ku under the fully oxidized conditions could either be a result of Ku not binding the DNA or binding occurring but not quenching the fluorescent signal. Therefore, EMSAs were performed to assess binding (Fig. 3). Although decreased binding was observed under the oxidized conditions, binding was still easily detected. Quantification of the results revealed a 60% decrease in binding under the fully oxidized conditions compared with the moderately reduced conditions (data not shown). The DNA binding activity of the oxidized Ku could be restored by the addition of 1 mm DTT to the binding reaction, whereas the addition of DTT to the moderately reduced Ku had a negligible effect in the EMSA assay (data not shown). The ability to detect Ku binding DNA under the fully oxidized conditions in a solution-based assay was confirmed by measuring anisotropy of a fluorescein-labeled DNA as a function of Ku binding. Results presented in Fig. 4A show anisotropy of reactions with (open circles) and without (closed circles) DTT. The results again demonstrate that, in the absence of DTT, there is a modest decrease in Ku binding and a smaller maximum r value obtained. These data demonstrate that the inability to detect Ku quenching when mixed with DNA under non-reducing conditions is not a result of inefficient DNA binding to Ku. The anisotropy data also suggest that the size of the Ku-DNA complexes formed under the non-reducing conditions is smaller. Considering the 30-bp substrate can accommodate two Ku molecules per DNA, the difference in size could be a single Ku bound to the DNA under the non-reducing conditions and two Ku molecules bound under the fully reduced conditions. To determine whether this was in fact the case, binding analyses were performed with the 21/34 hairpin DNA substrate to which only one Ku molecule can bind. The results are presented in Fig. 4B and demonstrate, under non-reducing conditions (filled circles), the r maximum is larger than that observed under fully reduced conditions (open circles). These data are consistent with the oxidized Ku occupying more space, and"
https://openalex.org/W2054001378,"Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) is a novel microbial rhodopsin recently discovered in the freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120. This protein most likely functions as a photosensory receptor as do the related haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsins. However, unlike the archaeal pigments, which are tightly bound to their cognate membrane-embedded transducers, ASR interacts with a soluble cytoplasmic protein analogous to transducers of animal vertebrate rhodopsins. In this study, infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the molecular mechanism of photoactivation in ASR. Light adaptation of the pigment leads to a phototransformation of an all-trans/15-anti to 13-cis/15-syn retinylidene-containing species very similar in chromophore structural changes to those caused by dark adaptation in bacteriorhodopsin. Following 532 nm laser-pulsed excitation, the protein exhibits predominantly an all-trans retinylidene photocycle containing a deprotonated Schiff base species similar to those of other microbial rhodopsins such as bacteriorhodopsin, sensory rhodopsin II, and Neurospora rhodopsin. However, no changes are observed in the Schiff base counterion Asp-75, which remains unprotonated throughout the photocycle. This result along with other evidence indicates that the Schiff base proton release mechanism differs significantly from that of other known microbial rhodopsins, possibly because of the absence of a second carboxylate group at the ASR photoactive site. Several conformational changes are detected during the ASR photocycle including in the transmembrane helices E and G as indicated by hydrogen-bonding alterations of their native cysteine residues. In addition, similarly to animal vertebrate rhodopsin, perturbations of the polar head groups of lipid molecules are detected.

Microbial rhodopsins form a large family of photoactive membrane proteins that mediate ion transport and photosensory reception in Archaea, eubacteria, and lower eukaryotes (1Spudich J.L. Yang C.S.

These pigments all have seven transmembrane α-helices and a retinylidene chromophore covalently bound to a lysine residue on the C-terminal helix G via a protonated Schiff base. Photon absorption causes an isomerization of the chromophore and induces subsequent changes within the protein structure, giving rise to a sequence of intermediate states with distinct absorption maxima. The kinetics of the overall photocycle, which culminates in the recovery of the ground state, is related to the protein function. Proton pumps such as bacteriorhodopsin (BR) 3The abbreviations used are: BR, bacteriorhodopsin; PR, proteorhodopsin; ASR, Anabaena sensory rhodopsin; FT, Fourier transform; FTIR, FT infrared; NR, Neurospora rhodopsin. and proteorhodopsin (PR) return to the initial state within tens of milliseconds, whereas the photocycles of archaeal photosensory receptors SRI and SRII are slower by at least an order of magnitude. In the latter case, the longer photocycles reflect their long lived M and O intermediates, which are signaling states for activation of their cognate transducer proteins (6Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several new members of the microbial rhodopsin family have been discovered recently through genome sequencing studies (3Bieszke J.A. Braun E.L. Bean L.E. Kang S. Natvig D.O. Borkovich K.A. Proc.

Science. 2004; 304: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Of special interest is Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) from the freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120. This protein has a slow photocycle, typical of sensory proteins, and does not exhibit light-induced proton pumping, consistent with a signaling rather than transport function (7Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast to archaeal sensory rhodopsins, which transmit the light-induced signals through interaction with integral membrane transducer proteins (HtrI and HtrII), a small (14 kDa) soluble protein appears to be a transducer for ASR (7Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the 14-kDa putative transducer occurs in a dicistronic operon with the gene encoding the ASR apoprotein. The co-expression of these genes in Escherichia coli cells accelerates the ASR photocycle, which has been attributed to a physical interaction between the two proteins supported by in vitro binding measurements (7Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 9Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14663-14668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ASR has two spectrally distinct species containing different ratios of all-trans and 13-cis chromophore with the dark-adapted state containing predominantly (∼80%) all-trans-retinal in contrast to BR, which has approximately equal amounts of the all-trans- and 13-cis-retinal in the dark-adapted state (9Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14663-14668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An atomic-resolution structure of the pigment containing both the dark-adapted and light-adapted forms has been recently obtained by x-ray diffraction of lipidic cubic phase crystals (10Vogeley L.

To further investigate the conformational changes of ASR during its photocycle, we have applied Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. Previously, this approach has been successfully applied to a number of microbial rhodopsins including BR (11Rothschild K.J. Zagaeski M. Cantore W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kawanabe A. Jung K.-H. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12287-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we used millisecond rapid scan time-resolved FTIR combined with FT-Raman spectroscopy to examine the late photocycle and the light-dark adaptation process in this pigment. Although structural changes of the retinal chromophore during the all-trans photocycle are very similar to those of other microbial rhodopsins, many of the light-induced protein changes, especially proton transfer reactions, appear to be significantly different. Protein Expression and Purification—Mutations at codons encoding cysteine at the protein residue positions 134, 137, and 203 were introduced into asr by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) using oligonucleotide primers coding for serine at each of the three cysteine-coding positions. The mutagenesis was conducted on the pMS710 plasmid (7Jung K.H. Trivedi V.D. Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) containing full-length asr with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of the three mutant proteins were performed as described previously (9Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14663-14668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in BL21 E. coli cells. Similar procedures were used to prepare the purified ASR mutant protein D75E. Proteoliposome Reconstitution—Purified C-terminally His-tagged Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (10Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Science. 2004; 306: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was reconstituted in E. coli polar lipids (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) at a 1:10 protein-to-lipid (w/w) ratio. Lipids initially dissolved in chloroform were dried under argon and resuspended in the dialysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) to which octyl glucoside was added to the final concentration of 1%. The lipid solution was incubated with the octyl glucosidesolubilized protein for 1 h on ice and dialyzed against the dialysis buffer with three buffer changes every 24 h. The reconstituted protein was centrifuged for 15 min and resuspended in the sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Rapid Scan Time-resolved FTIR Difference Spectroscopy—Protein films were prepared by depositing 5–10 μl of the proteoliposome suspension onto a polished 2-mm thick, 25-mm diameter CaF2 window (Wilmad, Buena, NJ) and drying the sample under a gentle stream of argon. Films were rehydrated via the vapor phase and then sealed in a temperature-controlled IR cell (Model TFC, Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY) using a second CaF2 window. Spectra were recorded with a BRUKER IFS 66 v/s FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Germany) at 5 °C as described previously (21Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) at 4-cm–1 spectral resolution and 240-kHz scanner velocity corresponding to the data acquisition window of 18 ms. Each time-resolved spectrum represents an average of four individual time slices collected in the 25–85-ms time range after initiation of the photocycle. The difference spectra were produced by subtracting the reference (dark) spectrum recorded 100 ms before the laser photoexcitation from the spectra recorded after excitation. The negative bands in the difference spectra arise from the vibrations of molecular groups in the protein dark state, and the positive bands arise from the photointermediates. FT-Raman Spectroscopy—Protein samples were prepared similar to those used for FTIR measurements. Spectra were collected on a Bruker RFS 100/S instrument using 180° scattering geometry. The excitation wavelength of the Nd:YAG laser was 1064 nm, and the excitation energy was 100 milliwatts. For each spectrum, 1000 scans were averaged at 4 cm–1 spectral resolution. Structural Changes of the ASR Retinylidene Chromophore during Dark to Light Adaptation Are Reversed from Those of Bacteriorhodopsin—Previous data from x-ray crystallography, UV-visible spectroscopy, and retinal extraction studies have demonstrated that unphotolyzed ASR can exist in a combination of two distinct states depending on preillumination conditions (9Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14663-14668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Science. 2004; 306: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the dark, the ASR chromophore exists predominantly in an all-trans configuration, whereas illumination with orange light (580 nm) leads to a predominantly 13-cis form. We recorded the FTIR difference spectra of ASR under conditions that favored the transition from the dark- to light-adapted state (Fig. 1, top trace) and compared it to that of the light to dark transition in BR (bottom trace) (25Dollinger G. Eisenstein L. Lin S.L. Nakanishi K. Termini J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6524-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Roepe P.D. Ahl P.L. Herzfeld J. Lugtenburg J. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5110-5117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two spectra are remarkably similar. In particular, bands in the retinal fingerprint region found at 1168, 1200, 1215, and 1253 (–) cm–1 in light-adapted BR, which contain contributions from various stretching modes of the all-trans/15-anti chromophore (27Smith S.O. Braiman M.S. Myers A.B. Pardoen J.A. Courtin J.M.L. Winkel C. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3108-3125Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) are also present in dark-adapted ASR at 1167, 1196, 1212, and 1245 cm–1. Positive bands found at 1182 and 1230 cm–1 in the dark-adapted BR are assigned to the 13-cis, 15-syn chromophore (28Smith S.O. Pardoen J.A. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 804-819Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and also appear in the light-adapted ASR spectrum at 1179 and 1232 cm–1. A strong peak near 1342 cm–1 in BR, which is indicative of the 15-syn chromophore configuration (26Roepe P.D. Ahl P.L. Herzfeld J. Lugtenburg J. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5110-5117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is found at 1338 cm–1 in ASR. In the ethylenic stretching region peaks are detected at 1543/1532 cm–1 (+/–) in ASR and at 1536/1524 cm–1 (+/–) in BR. The upshift in frequency in both proteins reflects a blue-shift in the chromophore wavelength of maximum absorption. In particular, an empirical inverse correlation is observed for almost all microbial rhodopsins between the retinylidene chromophore stretching frequency (1500–1600 cm–1) and its wavelength of maximum visible absorption (λmax) (29Aton B. Doukas A.G. Callender R.H. Becher B. Ebrey T.G. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2995-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the dark-adapted form of ASR, which contains predominantly an all-trans/15-anti-retinal species, is converted by light adaptation to a blue-shifted form with an increased amount of a 13-cis/15-syn species. Strikingly, this is opposite to BR in which light adaptation produces a red-shifted pigment with all-trans/15-anti-retinal species. This conclusion strongly supports earlier studies based on visible UV absorption and retinal extraction (9Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14663-14668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Vogeley L. Sineshchekov O.A. Trivedi V.D. Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Luecke H. Science. 2004; 306: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, it provides information about the state of isomerization around the Schiff base bond. In contrast to the intense chromophore peaks, few bands appear in the ASR and BR difference spectra that can be ascribed to the protein vibrations. In fact, the only strong band in the amide I region (1600–1700 cm–1), which is characteristic of protein backbone changes, appears at 1642 cm–1. However, a band at this frequency is assigned to the protonated Schiff base stretching vibration on the basis of FT-Raman and isotope-labeling experiments (see below), in agreement with its position in ASR spectra obtained at low temperature (24Furutani Y. Kawanabe A. Jung K.-H. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12287-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore these data indicated that the structural transitions during light adaptation involve primarily the retinylidene chromophore and do not produce large conformational changes in the protein structure between the two states. The Photocycle of the All-trans-retinal Form of ASR Is Detected by Time-resolved FTIR Spectroscopy—The photochemical reaction cycle of ASR was measured by time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy in the millisecond time range using pulsed photoexcitation provided by a 532 nm Nd-YAG laser. A major negative band, which arises from the depleted initial state(s) of ASR, is evident at 1537 cm–1 (Fig. 2, top). This band is assigned to the all-trans/15-anti-retinal species based on several factors. (i) A band at a similar frequency (1534 cm–1) is observed in the FT-Raman spectrum of ASR measured in the dark (Fig. 2, inset), which contains predominantly the all-trans/15-anti species. (ii) The 1537 cm–1 peak falls midway between the 1532 cm–1 peak assigned in the dark-light difference spectrum to all-trans/15-anti form and 1543 cm–1 peak assigned to the 13-cis/15-syn form. However, if spectral overlap is taken into account the peaks at 1532 and 1537 cm–1 would be much closer. (iii) Because of the short duration of the laser pulse (∼6 ns), no contributions from secondary photoreactions of ASR photointermediates are expected in the spectra. The predominance of the all-trans/15-anti form of retinal in the photocycle of ASR recorded by time-resolved FTIR is also indicated by bands appearing in the stretch fingerprint region (1150–1400 cm–1). Negative bands at 1164, 1196, 1214, and 1245 cm–1 (Fig. 3, top) are all indicative of the all-trans-retinal configuration. For example, similar bands also appear in the all-trans photocycles of NR (1166, 1200, 1211, and 1244 cm–1) (21Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and SRII (1163, 1200, and 1242 cm–1) (19Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36556-36562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These frequencies also closely match peaks observed in the FT-Raman spectrum of ASR (Fig. 3, bottom), which mainly reflects retinal vibrations because of the preresonance enhancement phenomena in analogy to BR (30Rath P. Krebs M.P. He Y.-W. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, on the basis of bands appearing in the ethylenic and fingerprint regions we cannot eliminate smaller contributions from the 13-cis/15-syn photocycle. For example, a negative shoulder at 1548 cm–1 and a small negative band at 1184 cm–1 present in both FTIR and FT-Raman spectra may be because of photoisomerization of the 13-cis/15-syn form (28Smith S.O. Pardoen J.A. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 804-819Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The All-trans Photocycle of ASR Contains M and O Photointer-mediates—As seen in Fig. 2, along with the negative 1537 cm–1 band, positive bands appear near 1567 and 1523 cm–1. The 1567 cm–1 peak is characteristic of the M-intermediate of BR (λmax = 412 nm) as well as most other microbial rhodopsins. The weak intensity of this band is typical of a deprotonated Schiff base retinylidene chromophore (31Gerwert K. Siebert F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 805-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second band at 1523 cm–1 reflects the late-photocycle red-shifted O intermediate (λmax near 600 nm), which is also observed in many microbial rhodopsins including BR, SRII, and NR. In the case of ASR, the assignment of the 1537 (–), 1567, and 1523 (+) cm–1 bands to the chromophore ethylenic modes is confirmed by their 5–10 cm–1 down-shift when the normal retinal is replaced by a C15D isotope-labeled retinal (Fig. 2, bottom) as previously observed in BR (27Smith S.O. Braiman M.S. Myers A.B. Pardoen J.A. Courtin J.M.L. Winkel C. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3108-3125Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). No significant changes in the relative intensity of these bands were observed between the early and late time points (data not shown). The positive 1176 cm–1 peak found in this region most likely reflects the all-trans chromophore of an O-like intermediate similar to BR (32Smith S.O. Pardoen J.A. Mulder P.P.J. Curry B. Lugtenburg J.

Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Such a band is also found in the late photocycle spectra of NR and SRII at 1176 and 1179 cm–1, respectively (21Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Furutani Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Wada A. Ito M. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5204-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, unlike these pigments, no strong positive band is detected near 1187 cm–1, that would be characteristic of the N-like photointermediate with a 13-cis chromophore (28Smith S.O. Pardoen J.A. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 804-819Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 35Bousche O. Braiman M. He Y.W. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol.

One possible explanation is that the positive intensity in this region is canceled by an overlapping negative band near 1184 cm–1. Assignment of the Schiff Base C=N Stretch Vibration Indicates Hydrogen Bonding Similar to BR—Using a retinal isotope label along with FTIR difference and FT-Raman spectroscopy we were able to conclusively assign the stretching mode of the protonated Schiff base in ASR. The FT-Raman spectrum exhibits a major peak at 1655 cm–1 along with a smaller shoulder at 1642 cm–1 (Fig. 2, inset). Substituting deuterium for hydrogen at the C-15 position of the retinal affects only the 1642 cm–1 component by causing its disappearance. The remaining 1655 cm–1 band most likely reflects the strong Amide I vibration of the protein, which is found at the same frequency in the absolute absorption FTIR spectrum (data not shown). A downshift of the negative band at 1642 cm–1 to near 1632 cm–1 is also observed in the FTIR difference spectrum of C15D retinal-containing ASR (Fig. 2) confirming its assignment to the Schiff base vibration. The 1642 cm–1 peak also disappears in the spectrum of ASR hydrated with D2O; however analysis in this case is complicated by the shift of other bands most likely arising from the protein Amide I backbone difference vibrations, which are affected by the H/D substitution (data not shown). We therefore assign the 1642 cm–1 band to the Schiff base stretching mode in the ASR dark state in agreement with an earlier study (24Furutani Y. Kawanabe A. Jung K.-H. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12287-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The similar frequency of the ASR Schiff base mode to that of BR (26Roepe P.D. Ahl P.L. Herzfeld J. Lugtenburg J. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5110-5117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) along with the similar downshift of this mode upon NH to ND substitution in both room temperature (data not shown) and low temperature studies (36Furutani Y. Kamada K. Sudo Y. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2909-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicates that the hydrogen bond strength of the Schiff base is similar in BR and ASR. The Schiff Base Counterion Asp-75 Is Unprotonated during the Late Photocycle—The stretching vibration of protonated carboxylic acid side chains in proteins is found in the 1700–1780 cm–1 region (37Parker F.S.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For example, in the FTIR difference spectrum of BR, a strong positive band appears near 1760 cm–1 in the M-intermediate (11Rothschild K.J. Zagaeski M. Cantore W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reflecting a transfer of the proton from the Schiff base to its counterion Asp-85 (39Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Marti T. Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This band downshifts slightly (∼5cm–1) in the N and O intermediates reflecting environmental changes of Asp-85, which deprotonates during the O decay (14Gerwert K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Bousché O. Sonar S. Krebs M.P. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar bands near 1760 cm–1 are also observed in the M, N, and O intermediates of other microbial rhodopsins including SRII, NR, and PR (18Bergo V. Spudich E.N. Scott K.L. Spudich J.L.

In contrast, the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin does not exhibit such a band because the homologous counterion is replaced by the chloride anion (40Rothschild K.J. Bousché O. Braiman M.S. Hasselbacher C.A. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2420-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the band is absent also in SRI in which the homologous aspartyl residue is protonated in the dark state and does not function as a Schiff base counterion (41Rath P.

Whereas pathways for its generation are firmly established in vertebrates, the presence and function of the relevant synthetic enzyme in insects and other protostomes is unknown. In this study, we characterize the first functional CMP-sialic acid synthase (DmCSAS) from any protostome lineage expressed from a D. melanogaster cDNA clone. Homologous genes were subsequently identified in other insect species. The gene is developmentally regulated, with expression first appearing at 12–24 h of embryogenesis, low expression through larval and pupal stages, and greatly enriched expression in the adult head, suggesting a possible role in the central nervous system. Activity of the enzyme was verified by an increase in in vitro and in vivo CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid levels when expressed in a heterologous host. Unlike all known vertebrate CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CSAS) proteins that localize to the nucleus, the D. melanogaster CSAS protein was targeted to the Golgi compartment when expressed in both heterologous mammalian and insect cell lines. Replacement of the N-terminal leader sequence of DmCSAS with the human CSAS N-terminal sequence resulted in the redirection of the chimeric CSAS protein to the nucleus but with a concomitant loss of enzymatic activity. The localization of CSAS orthologs to different intracellular organelles represents, to our knowledge, the first example of differential protein targeting of orthologs in eukaryotes and reveals how the sialylation pathway diverged during the evolution of protostomes and deuterostomes.

The localization of CSAS orthologs to different intracellular organelles represents, to our knowledge, the first example of differential protein targeting of orthologs in eukaryotes and reveals how the sialylation pathway diverged during the evolution of protostomes and deuterostomes. Sialic acids are a diverse family of negatively charged nine carbon 2-keto-3-deoxy sugars located at the termini of glycoproteins and glycolipids (1Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). More than 50 different types of naturally occurring sialic acids have been identified, with the most abundant sialic acid being N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). 2The abbreviations used are: Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; CSAS, CMP-sialic acid synthase; NLS, nuclear localization signal(s); RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HPAEC, high performance anion exchange chromatography; CNS, central nervous system; HsNDmC, chimeric D. melanogaster CSAS containing a human leader; DmNHsC, chimeric human CSAS containing Drosophila leader.2The abbreviations used are: Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; CSAS, CMP-sialic acid synthase; NLS, nuclear localization signal(s); RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HPAEC, high performance anion exchange chromatography; CNS, central nervous system; HsNDmC, chimeric D. melanogaster CSAS containing a human leader; DmNHsC, chimeric human CSAS containing Drosophila leader. Sialic acid can be present as a monomer or in a polymeric form at the termini of glycoconjugates and can be attached to acceptors in either an α(2,6), α(2,3), or α(2,8) linkage, which is determined by the specificity of different sialyltransferases (1Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). In mammals, the presence of sialic acid on proteins regulates their circulatory half-life, and sialic acids serve as ligands for endogenous lectins of the inflammatory and immune responses (2Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). The sialylation pattern of lipids and proteins displayed on the cell surface regulates cell-cell interactions in normal development, and altered patterns are associated with tumorigenesis and oncogenic transformations in vertebrates (1Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar, 3Fukuda M.

The regulated presence or absence of polysialic acid polymers on the neural cell adhesion molecule is required for proper establishment of the vertebrate embryonic nervous system (5Cunningham B.A. Hoffman S.

A. 1983; 80: 5762-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and is associated with changes in neuronal plasticity that occur during learning and memory (7Kiss J.Z. Muller D. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 12: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expression of sialic acids is widespread in the deuterostome lineage (vertebrates, ascidians, and echinoderms). Furthermore, certain pathogenic and commensal bacteria, viruses, and fungi are found to contain sialic acid as well (8Corfield A.P. Schauer R. Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1982: 196-200Google Scholar). On the other hand, sialic acid has been more difficult to detect in the protostome lineage (annelids, arthropods, and mollusks) (8Corfield A.P. Schauer R. Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1982: 196-200Google Scholar, 9Warren L. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology. 1963; 10: 153-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, since sialic acid was first reported to be present in Drosophila melanogaster embryos using lectin histochemistry and immunostaining (10Roth J. Kempf A. Reuter G. Schauer R. Gehring W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11D'Amico P. Jacobs J.R. Tissue Cell. 1995; 27: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a number of other studies using biochemical and genomic approaches have supported the presence of sialic acids in insects. Sialic acid in both a α(2,6) and α(2,8) linkage was detected in the vacuoles of the Malpighian tubules of Philaenus spumarius (cicada) larvae using both histochemistry and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (12Malykh Y.N. Krisch B. Gerardy-Schahn R. Lapina E.B. Shaw L. Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas insect glycoproteins typically terminate with Man or GlcNAc in paucimannose, oligomannose, or hybrid structures (13Marchal I. Jarvis D.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), two insect cell lines, one from Pseudaletia unipuncta (A7S) and one from Danaus plexippus (DpN1) have been shown to produce more complex glycan structures on expressed recombinant proteins, and DpN1 was shown to produce some sialylated glycans as well (15Palomares L.A. Joosten C.E. Hughes P.R. Granados R.R. Shuler M.L. Biotechnol. Prog. 2003; 19: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additionally, Watanabe et al. (17Watanabe S. Kokuho T. Takahashi H. Takahashi M. Kubota T. Inumaru S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5090-5093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that when recombinant proteins were expressed in Trichoplusia ni (Tn-5B1-4) cells in the presence of a hexosaminidase inhibitor, some sialylated glycans were detected. Using the availability of the complete Drosophila genome (19Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. George R.A.

Expression of a functional D. melanogaster sialic acid 9-phosphate synthase (16Kim K. Lawrence S.M. Park J. Pitts L. Vann W.F. Betenbaugh M.J. Palter K.B. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and α(2,6)-sialyltransferase (18Koles K. Irvine K.D. Panin V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4346-4357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) provided genomic evidence for the presence of the sialic acid pathway in insects. In all known biological systems, sialylation of both lipids and proteins requires the metabolic generation of the sugar nucleotide CMP-Neu5Ac by a CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CSAS). The CMP-Neu5Ac is then transferred to an acceptor oligosaccharide in the Golgi apparatus by sialyltransferases (20Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified and characterized a single D. melanogaster ortholog (DmCSAS) of mammalian and bacterial CMP-sialic acid synthetases as further evidence for the presence of the sialylation pathway in insects. In contrast to the vertebrate CMP-sialic acid synthetases, which are comprised of an N-terminal catalytic domain and an additional carboxyl-terminal domain, DmCSAS includes only the catalytic domain, similar to some bacterial enzymes, such as that of Neisseria meningitidis. In this study, DmCSAS is shown to be functional both in vivo and in vitro by complementation of a mammalian cell line, LEC29.Lec32 (21Potvin B. Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30415-30421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which lacks CMP-sialic acid synthetase activity. Whereas mammalian CMP-sialic acid synthetase localizes to the nucleus (20Kean E.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Kean E.L. Munster-Kuhnel A.K. Gerardy-Schahn R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the D. melanogaster enzyme is found primarily in the Golgi apparatus. In accordance with their differing intracellular locations, the mammalian protein begins with an N-terminal sequence containing a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS), whereas the D. melanogaster protein begins with an N-terminal sequence rich in hydrophobic amino acids characteristic of a signal/anchoring sequence. The different compartmental locations observed for the mammalian and insect CMP-sialic acid synthetases represent, to our knowledge, the first example of functionally equivalent enzymes localizing to different compartments in different eukaryotes. The DmCSAS exhibits its highest levels of mRNA expression during 14–17 h of embryonic development, similar to that observed for the D. melanogaster sialyltransferase (18Koles K. Irvine K.D. Panin V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4346-4357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This occurrence is consistent with the finding of Roth et al. (10Roth J. Kempf A. Reuter G. Schauer R. Gehring W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) concerning the presence of sialic acid and polysialic acid in specific stages of Drosophila development. In contrast to the ubiquitous tissue distribution of human CMP-sialic acid synthetase (HsCSAS) (23Lawrence S.M. Huddleston K.A. Tomiya N. Nguyen N. Lee Y.C. Vann W.F. Coleman T.A. Betenbaugh M.J. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), expression of the D. melanogaster mRNA is observed predominantly in the head in adults. Gene Identification, Isolation of a cDNA Clone, and DNA Sequencing—A BLAST search was performed using the tBLASTn algorithm at NCBI with the amino acid sequence of either the bacterial CMP-sialic acid synthetase (NeuA) (GenBank™ accession number J05023) or the mouse CMP-sialic acid synthetase (MmCSAS) (GenBank™ accession number MMU6215) as the query sequence. Two genomic clones (AE003515 and AC015229) representing the same genomic sequence on chromosome 3L in band 76D8 had significant homology to the query sequence. In addition, a single corresponding cDNA, GenBank™ accession number RH14248, was obtained from the normalized head library. An alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of the DmC-SAS with other CMP-sialic acid synthetases suggested that this cDNA was truncated at the 5′ end, since translation from the first ATG would yield a protein lacking a highly conserved and functionally indispensable part of the protein. A full-length coding region of DmCSAS was obtained by RT-PCR using a forward primer derived from the genomic sequence using the nearest upstream ATG from the first ATG in the original cDNA and a reverse strand primer derived from the end of the coding region of the original cDNA. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA obtained by RT-PCR now included a region shared by all members of the CMP-sialic acid synthetase family as well as an N-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic amino acids, typical of secretory signal sequences. The forward primer (CSA4; all primers are given in Table 1) contained a BamHI site, a Kozak sequence (GCCATC), and sequence corresponding to the first eight codons of DmCSAS. The reverse strand primer (CSA6N) contained a HindIII site, two in frame stop codons, and sequence representing the last seven codons of DmCSAS. Total RNA prepared by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) from D. melanogaster (Oregon R, P2) 14–17-h dechorionated embryos treated with amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen) was used as the template. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 0.6 μg of template RNA with the 3′-SMART rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). 2.5 μl (of the 110-μl reverse transcription reaction) was introduced into a 50-μl PCR and amplified with Taq Gold using an Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler using the following cycle settings: 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; 72 °C for 10 min; hold at 4 °C. PCR reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The 776-bp product was subcloned into the baculovirus vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen). The DNA sequence of this construct, pBlueBac-DmCSAS4, was determined on both strands using BigDye terminators (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the Nucleic Acid/Protein Core Research Facility of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The DNA sequence of the cDNA matched the genomic sequence, except it lacked three introns of 52, 56, and 55 bp.TABLE 1Primers used for PCR amplification of human and Drosophila CSASPrimersSequencesForward primers CSA45′-CACTGGATCCGCCATCATGATAAAACTGAAACCGGCACT CS15′-CACTAAGCTTGCATTAATTTTGGCCAGGGGA CSA105′-CACTAGATCTGCCATCATGATAAAACTGAAACCGGCCACT HuCS15′-CACTAGATCTGCCATCATGGACTCGCTGGAGAAGGGG HuCS45′-GAAAATTGTCTGAGCAAGCCCCCGCACCTGGCAGCCCTA CSA125′-GGCCGAGGTGTGGAGAACGATATTCATGCATTAATTTTGGCCReverse strand primers CSA6N5′-AGTGAAGCTTTCACTATAACTCGGTTTTTGTTTCACT CS55′-AGTGAAGCTTCCAATCTTGGCGTCTTGGCCT CSA95′-AGTGGTCGACGTAACTCGGTTTTTGTTTCACTACT HuCS25′-AGTGGAATTCGTTTTTGGCATGAATTATTAACTTTTTC CSA135′-CAGGTGCGGGGGCTTGCTCAGACAATTTTCCGTGCACCC HuCS35′-TGCATGAATATCGTTCTCCACACCTCGGCCCTGGCC CSA115′-AGTGAAGCTTTCATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC CSA145′-AGTGGTCGACGGCTCAGACAATTTTCCGTGCACCC Open table in a new tab Amplification of Staged Drosophila cDNA Libraries, RNA, and cDNA—Total RNA was isolated from staged Drosophila or S2 cells as described. PCR was performed with either 1 μl of the head or larvalearly pupal cDNA libraries (obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project consortium), or RT-PCR was performed with staged total RNA as described (42Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Snisky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Crossref Google Scholar) using 0.6 μg of RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 20 μl, which was subsequently introduced into a 100-μl PCR. PCR was performed with the forward primer CS1 and reverse strand primer CS5 as described above, except that 31 cycles were performed. PCR of the Drosophila Rapid-Scan Expression panels (Origene, Gaithersburg, MD) was performed in 25-μl reactions using the same PCR conditions already described, except that 35 cycles were used. Each row of the panel contains different amounts of cDNA, from 1× (1 pg of first strand cDNA) to 1000× (1 ng of cDNA), and cDNA for each developmental stage and tissue has been normalized to yield equivalent amplification of a ribosomal protein, RP49. PCR in 48-well microtiter plates (panels) was performed using an Applied Systems GeneAmp 9600 thermal cycler. Construction of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP)-tagged Human and D. melanogaster CSAS and Human and D. melanogaster CSAS with Swapped Leader Sequences—To determine the intracellular localization of CSAS proteins, both the D. melanogaster CSAS and the human CSAS (23Lawrence S.M. Huddleston K.A. Tomiya N. Nguyen N. Lee Y.C. Vann W.F. Coleman T.A. Betenbaugh M.J. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) cDNAs were subcloned in plasmid pEGFP-N2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) to create a CSAS fusion protein with the eGFP. The resultant plasmids are called DmCSAS-GFP and HsCSAS-GFP. The coding region of DmCSAS was amplified by PCR of pBlueBac-DmCSAS4, using the forward primer, CSA10, containing a BglII site, an artificial Kozak sequence, and eight codons of DmCSAS and the reverse strand primer, CSA9, containing the last eight codons of DmCSAS, but not the stop codon, and an artificial SalI site. An extra C was added before the SalI site to keep the correct reading frame with eGFP. Similarly, the HsCSAS coding region was amplified by PCR using the forward primer, HsCS1, containing an artificial BglII site, a Kozak sequence, and the first seven codons of HsCSAS and the reverse strand primer, HsCS2, containing the last nine codons of HsCSAS, excluding the stop codon, an extra C, and an artificial EcoRI site. To determine the intracellular location of DmCSAS in Spodoptera frugiperda, the CSAS-GFP fusion protein was shuttled from the pEGFP vector into the baculovirus vector, pBlueBac4.5 by PCR amplification using the forward primer CSA10 and the reverse primer, CSA11 containing the last seven codons of GFP, two stop codons, and an artificial HindIII site. The resultant plasmid is called pBlueBac-DmCSAS-GFP. In order to ascertain whether the N-terminal sequences of both DmCSAS and HsCSAS were responsible for their distinct intracellular targeting, constructs were made that swapped the leader sequences of each protein with the other. An inspection of an alignment of many CSAS proteins (Fig. 1B), showed that eukaryotic CSAS proteins are longer than bacterial CSAS proteins at their N terminus and that these sequences are either rich in basic amino acids (mammalian), characteristic of NLS, or rich in hydrophobic amino acids (insects), characteristic of secretory signal sequences. We assigned sequences upstream of the start of the Escherichia coli CSAS in the alignment as “leader” sequences; thus, HsCSAS has a 40-amino acid leader, and DmCSAS has a 27-amino acid leader. A construct expressing the human CSAS protein with the D. melanogaster leader, DNHsC-GFP, was obtained by separately amplifying by PCR the leader of DmC-SAS using DmCSAS-GFP and the forward primer CSA10 and the reverse strand primer CSA13 containing eight codons of DmCSAS preceding the fusion point and five codons of HsCSAS past the fusion point and the nonleader fragment of HsCSAS using HsCSAS-GFP and the forward primer HsCS4 containing five codons of DmCSAS preceding the fusion point and eight codons of HsCSAS past the fusion point and the reverse strand primer, HsCS2. The resultant 113-bp leader fragment of DmCSAS was mixed with the 1207 bp downstream of the leader fragment of HsCSAS, which contain 30 nucleotides of complementarity, and amplified for 12 cycles with the outside primers, CSA10 and HsCS2, and the fused fragment was cloned into the BglII/EcoRI site of pEGFP-N2. Similarly, a construct expressing the D. melanogaster CSAS protein with the human leader, HsNDC-GFP, was obtained by separately amplifying by PCR the leader of HsCSAS using HsCSAS-GFP, the forward primer HsCS1, and the reverse strand primer HsCS3 (containing seven codons of HsCSAS upstream of the fusion point and five codons of DmC-SAS past the fusion point) and the downstream of leader fragment of DmCSAS using DmCSAS-GFP, the forward primer CSA12 (containing five codons of HsCSAS preceding the fusion point and nine codons of DmCSAS past the fusion point), and the reverse strand primer CSA9. The resultant 151-bp human leader was mixed with the 688-bp DmC-SAS downstream of leader fragment, which contained 30 nucleotides of complementarity, and amplified for 12 cycles using the outside primers HsCS1 and CSA9, and the fused fragment was cloned into the BglII/SalI site of pEGFP-N2. All final constructs were sequenced.FIGURE 1A, DmCSAS cDNA sequence. The DNA (top row) and amino acid (bottom row) sequences are shown. Note the presence of nine consecutive hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region (underlined), suggestive of a secretory signal sequence/anchoring domain. The truncated cDNA clone RH14248 starts at bp 36 and is predicted to encode a protein shorter by 61 N-terminal amino acids. B, comparison of the amino acid sequences of the DmCSAS, HsCSAS, MmCSAS, EcCSAS, and NmC-SAS CMP-sialic acid synthase proteins. The protein sequences of each were aligned using the Pile-up and Pretty box programs of GCG (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), which uses progressive pairwise alignments. Gaps introduced to maximize homology are shown as dots. Identical amino acids are represented by black boxes, and similar amino acids are represented by gray boxes. The DmCSAS shares 35.5% identity with the HsCSAS, 36.3% identity with the MmCSAS, and 30.4% identity with the EcCSAS. Note that the DmCSAS and NmCSAS are short (about 240 amino acids), whereas the EcCSAS and mammalian CSAS are long (about 430 amino acids). However, among distantly related CSAS proteins, only the first 240 amino acids are conserved.

It also serves as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis of cancer cells when aberrantly activated by genetic lesions of the PTEN tumor suppressor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and receptor tyrosine kinase overexpression. Here we have characterized and compared kinetic mechanisms of the three AKT isoforms. Initial velocity studies revealed that all AKT isozymes follow the sequential kinetic mechanism by which an enzyme-substrate ternary complex forms before the product release. The empirically derived kinetic parameters are apparently different among the isoforms. AKT2 showed the highest Km value for ATP, and AKT3 showed the highest kcat value. The patterns of product inhibition of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 by ADP were all consistent with an ordered substrate addition mechanism with ATP binding to the enzymes prior to the peptide substrate. Further analysis of steady state kinetics of AKT1 in the presence of dead-end inhibitors supported the finding and suggested that the AKT family of kinases catalyzes reactions via an Ordered Bi Bi sequential mechanism with ATP binding to the enzyme prior to peptide substrate and ADP being released after the phosphopeptide product. These results suggest that ATP is an initiating factor for the catalysis of AKT enzymes and may play a role in the regulation AKT enzyme activity in cells.

The kinase domain of AKT shares 45% identity (about 60% similarity) with that of protein kinase A and protein kinase C and thus was classified as a member of AGC protein kinase family. The importance of AKT in growth factor signaling was first demonstrated by showing that it is activated by PI 3-kinase in a PH domain-dependent fashion (12Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that AKT is activated by the phosphorylation of two critical residues as follows: Thr-308 (AKT1) in the kinase domain and Ser-473 (AKT1) in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (14Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt is triggered by the interaction between the lipid products of PI 3-kinase and the PH domain of AKT, which induces a conformational change in AKT exposing the activation segment of the kinase domain. This serves to recruit the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 to the proximity of the activation segment allowing the phosphorylation of Thr-308 (Thr-309 for AKT2 and Thr-305 for AKT3) (15Franke T.F.

The phosphorylation of Thr-308 only partially activates AKT; the phosphorylation of Ser-473 (Ser-474 for AKT2 and Ser-472 for AKT3) of the C-terminal hydrophobic motif completes the transition of AKT from inactive to a fully active conformation and stabilizes the protein in the active state (16Alessi D.R.

Although the Thr-308 kinase has been clearly shown to be PDK1, the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates Ser-473 has been in dispute. Recent studies suggested several candidate enzymes, including DNA-PKcs, ATM, and the mTOR-Rictor complex (22Feng J.H. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all three enzymes belong to the PI 3-kinase superfamily, which is consistent with the fact that the phosphorylation of Ser-473 is inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and LY294002. It is possible that the regulation of Ser-473 involves multiple activating complexes under different conditions and therefore offers another level of specificity in signaling. The physiological functions of AKT are executed through a wide range of downstream effectors involved in cell survival, cell proliferation, and cell growth (for reviews see Refs. 26Datta S.R.

A peptide library screening approach has further defined the preferred residues flanking the phosphorylation site (31Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R.

The studies of individual isoforms of AKT have not shown obvious substrate specificity among the isoforms (19Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

One possible explanation for the isoform-specific functions could simply be the differential tissue expression pattern of the AKT isoforms because tissues types where the major defect resides in the AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 knock-out mice somewhat correlate with the expression of a particular AKT isoform. However, isoform-specific phenotypes could not be completely explained by the tissue-specific expression pattern. For example, overexpression of AKT1 in adipocytes derived from AKT2–/– mouse embryo fibroblast cells was not able to rescue insulin response (37Bae S.S. Cho H. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49530-49536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, although both AKT1 and AKT3 gene deletion in mice led to a brain size reduction, AKT1 deleted mice only exhibited decreased cell number, whereas AKT3 deleted mice exhibited both decreased cell number and volume (36Easton R.M. Cho H. Roovers K. Shineman D.W. Mizrahi M. Forman M.S. Lee V.M.Y. Szabolcs M. de Jong R. Oltersdorf T. Ludwig T. Efstratiadis A. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Although AKT has been extensively studied in the last decade, the kinetic mechanism of its intrinsic kinase activity has not been described in detail. Thus there is little understanding of whether the enzyme catalytic properties of AKT contribute to the isoform-specific functions. One of the first detailed kinetic mechanistic studies on a protein kinase was described by Cook et al. (38Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and Whitehouse et al. (39Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prototype kinase in these studies was cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), an AGC family kinase with 50% homology in the kinase domain and structural similarity to AKT (20Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 21Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Both studies showed that the PKA kinase reaction follows a sequential mechanism by which a ternary complex is formed prior to the product release. However, the order of substrate addition has been in dispute. The study by Whitehouse et al. (39Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the substrate addition follows an ordered kinetic mechanism with ATP binding first to the enzyme, although Cook and co-workers (38Cook P.F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6802-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggested that the substrate addition is random with ordered release of products. In this study we have generated activated AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 and investigated their kinetic mechanism against an optimal synthetic peptide substrate. We have also obtained kinetic parameters of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 in their cellular complex to verify the results from in vitro purified enzymes. The implications of our results are further discussed.

Anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science (catalogue number 11583816). Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. All other general reagents were from Sigma. Enzyme Preparation—Full-length AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 cDNA were cloned into pFastBacHT baculovirus expression vector (catalogue number 10584-027; Invitrogen), which added a His6 tag to the N terminus of the AKT sequence. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the AKT cDNAs were generated using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) and used to infect Sf9 cells to produce cell pastes with recombinant AKT proteins. For all three isoforms, insect cell paste (60–100 g) was resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer per g (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1× Complete (Roche Applied Science)) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation in a Parr bomb. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g followed by 0.45-μm filtration. The filtered lysates were batch bound to Talon (Clontech), washed, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. For Akt3 and Akt1, Talon elution fractions were applied to a HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. For Akt1, peak fractions were concentrated and further purified on a Superdex 200 XK 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). For Akt2, Talon elution fractions were applied to a HiTrap Blue column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–2 m NaCl. Fractions containing Akt2 were pooled, diluted, and applied to a HiTrap Q HP column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified on a Superdex 200 XK 26/60 column. Each isoform of Akt was activated by PDK1 and MAPKAPK-2 as follows. Lipid vesicles were prepared by drying 200 μg (0.17 μmol) of PIP3 (AG Scientific), 1.68 μmol of PC, and 1.68 μmol of PS (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a siliconized glass tube in a SpeedVac. Lipids were resuspended in 1.68 ml of activation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) and freeze-thawed three times. The resulting suspension was extruded 15 times through a 0.1-μm membrane in a mini-extruder (Avanti). Akt (4 mg), PDK1 (0.4 mg), and p38-activated MAPKAPK-2 (0.4 mg) were added to 1.6 ml of PIP3/PC/PS vesicles. ATP and MgCl2 were added to 1 and 10 mm, respectively, and the final reaction volume was adjusted to 8 ml with activation buffer. The activation reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 1/19 volume of 20% Triton X-100 (1% final) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were diluted and applied to a HiTrap Q HP column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard. AKT Kinase Reaction—The kinase activity of AKT was measured by phosphorylating an optimal AKT peptide substrate identified from peptide library screening by Obata et al. (31Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) as follows: ARKRERTYS*FGHHA, where S* is the phosphorylation site. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (kinase reaction buffer), with the addition of activated AKT. The kinase reactions were performed ranging from 5 to 20 min and enzyme concentrations from 0.4 to 3.3 nm to determine linearity. The optimal concentration of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 in the reactions was determined to be 1.7, 3.3, and 1.7 nm, respectively. The reactions were initiated by adding the peptide substrate and [γ-33P]ATP/ATP in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and stopped by adding 100 μl of 5% phosphoric acid. Under these conditions, all initial velocity reactions utilized less than 10% of the substrates. For the measurement of the products, the total mixtures were transferred to phosphocellulose filter plates. The peptide substrates were captured by the phosphocellulose filter paper after vacuum application and washed three times by 1% phosphoric acid. The filter plates were counted by Wallac MicroBeta® liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Kinase Reaction of Immunoprecipitated AKT—Rat-1 fibroblast cells stably expressing myr-HA-AKT1, myr-HA-AKT2, and myr-HA-AKT3 were generated using pbabePuroL-AKT expression plasmids and were expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 3 μg/ml puromycin (selective agent). To prepare for the cell lysate, cells were washed by PBS and lysed on ice by the addition of a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (catalogue number 1873580; Roche Applied Science). Clear lysate was isolated from cell debris by a refrigerated bench-top centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 15 min. To specifically pull down the myr-HA-AKT complex, lysates were diluted to a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) at a 1:1 ratio, applied to a Reacti-Bind™ protein G plate coated with anti-HA antibody, allowed to bind for 1.5 h at room temperature, and washed three times in TBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by a final wash with kinase reaction buffer. The kinase reactions were initiated by adding 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing peptide and [γ-33P]ATP/ATP in the indicated amount. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and stopped and counted as described above. Data Analysis—Kinetic data were fitted to equations using the iterative minimum χ2 nonlinear regression method of Leatherbarrow (44Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit,Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar) and converted into double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots. All kinetic studies were performed in duplicate when using purified enzymes and in quadruplicate when using the immunoprecipitated enzymes. The equations for kinetics analysis were as described by Cleland (45Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 8: 104-137Crossref Google Scholar, 46Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 12: 173-187Crossref Google Scholar, 47Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 12: 188-196Crossref Google Scholar) and Segel (48Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). For single substrate kinetics measurements (Equation 1), ν=Vmax·[S]/(Km+[S])Eq. 1 For the discrimination between sequential and ping-pong mechanism of two-substrate kinetics, data were fitted into Equations 2 and 3, ν=Vmax/(Ka/[A]+Kb/[B]+Kia·Kb/[A][B]+1)(sequential)Eq. 2 and ν=Vmax/(Ka/[A]+Kb/[B]+1)(ping-pong)Eq. 3 For the determination of enzyme inhibition mechanism, data were fitted into Equations 4, 5, 6, ν=Vmax·[S]/{Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]}(competitive)Eq. 4 ν=Vmax·[S]/{Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S](1+[I]/Ki)}(noncompetitive)Eq. 5 and ν=Vmax·[S]/{Km+[S](1+[I]/Ki)}(uncompetitive)Eq. 6 In these equations, v represents the measured velocity; Vmax is the maximum velocity; A, B, and S are substrates; Ka, Kb, and Km are the Michaelis constants for A, B, and S; Kia is the dissociation constant for A; Kib is the dissociation constant for B; and Ki is the inhibitor constant. For the determination of interaction between the two substrate sites, data were fitted into Equation 7, ν=Vmax/(αKa/[A]+αKb/[B]+αKia·Kb/[A][B]+1)Eq. 7 where the α factor indicates whether or not the two sites are independent (48Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). When α = 1, there is no interaction, and the two substrates are independent. When α < 1, the two substrate sites interact with each other with positive cooperativity; the binding of one substrate increases the affinity of the other substrate. When α > 1, the two substrate sites interact with each other with negative cooperativity; the binding of one substrate decreases the affinity of the other substrate. Initial Velocity Studies—The three AKT isoforms AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 were His-tagged and expressed in an Sf9 cell baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity. The AKT proteins were activated by PDK1 in the presence of PIP3 and subsequently by MAPKAPK-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reactions were driven to saturation by excess ATP to allow maximum activation of AKT. The activated AKT proteins were re-purified, quantified, and examined by Western analysis as shown in Fig. 1. All three isoforms were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity (Fig. 1A). The Thr-308 and Ser-473 sites were phosphorylated to similar levels across the isoforms with a subtle difference as follows: the highest percentage being in AKT2 followed by AKT1 and AKT3 (Fig. 1B). Two-substrate site kinetics of the forward reactions was performed using these enzymes in the absence of added products. Initial velocities were measured in a matrix of varied ATP concentration and peptide substrate concentrations, and the data were fitted to the equations for sequential and ping-pong mechanism (see Equations 2 and 3 under “Experimental Procedures”) to distinguish between the two mechanisms. The double-reciprocal plots of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 two-substrate kinetics all best fitted to the pattern of a typical sequential mechanism where the plots of one substrate at varied concentrations of the other one converged to the left of the y axis (Fig. 2), whereas if the reactions followed the ping-pong mechanism, the plots should have been parallel lines with the same slope factors. These results suggest that the catalysis of AKT enzymes requires the formation of a ternary complex of the enzyme with the two substrates before product release. The kinetic constants obtained from the two-substrate kinetic studies were summarized in Table I, part A.TABLE 1Comparison of the Kinetic constants of AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3A.

This finding is similar to what has been observed for PKA in its kinetic study (39Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the crystal structure study with protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) and ATP (49Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The two-site interaction factor α was determined using the rapid equilibrium sequential model (see “Experimental Procedures,” Equation 7; Table 1, part A). In the case of AKT1 and AKT3, binding of one substrate increased the binding of the other substrate. However, for AKT2, the binding of one substrate decreased the binding of the other substrate, although the degree of interaction was within 2-fold. It is important to note that the interaction factor was determined from purified recombinant proteins tested in vitro; it is possible that the direction and the degree of the interaction can be modulated by other AKT-interacting proteins, possibly providing a mechanism for the feedback regulation of AKT activity. Unexpected from the high degree of homology in the kinase domains, different AKT isoforms showed d"

We have shown previously that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) enhances the rate of neutrophil apoptosis at early time points via a mechanism involving both TNF receptor (TNFR) I and TNFRII. Here we reveal a marked but consistent variation in the magnitude of the pro-apoptotic effect of TNFα in neutrophils isolated from healthy donors, and we show that inhibition of cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN) using actinonin, bestatin, or inhibitory peptides significantly enhanced the efficacy of TNFα-induced killing. Notably, an inverse correlation is shown to exist between neutrophil APN activity and the sensitivity of donor cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of cell surface APN appears to interfere with the shedding of TNFRI, and as a consequence results in augmented TNFα-induced apoptosis, cell polarization, and TNFα-primed, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated respiratory burst. Of note, actinonin and bestatin had no effect on TNFRII expression under resting or TNFα-stimulated conditions and did not alter CXCRI or CXCRII expression. These data suggest significant variation in the activity of APN/CD13 on the cell surface of neutrophils in normal individuals and reveal a novel mechanism whereby APN/CD13 regulates TNFα-induced apoptosis via inhibition of TNFRI shedding. This has therapeutic relevance for driving neutrophil apoptosis in vivo. Neutrophil apoptosis plays a central role in the resolution of granulocytic inflammation.

Neutrophil apoptosis is critical to the resolution of acute inflammation and the prevention of granulocytes-mediated tissue injury (1Whyte M.K. Meagher L.C. MacDermot J. Haslett C. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), host tissue damage is thought to arise in part from ineffective clearance of neutrophils because of either delayed apoptosis or impaired phagocytic clearance. Neutrophils undergo constitutive apoptosis when aged in vitro, and this provides an ideal model to study the regulation of apoptotic thresholds in vivo. The cytokine TNFα 3The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; TNFR, TNF receptor; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; APN, aminopeptidase N; AP, aminopeptidases; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; IL, interleukin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PAF, platelet-activating factor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; sTNFR, soluble TNFR; pNa, p-nitroanilide; RT, reverse transcription. is unique in its ability to act both as a neutrophil-priming agent and as an inducer of apoptosis. As a priming agonist TNFα is able to enhance greatly the ability of other inflammatory mediators (such as fMLP and IL-8) to induce degranulation and respiratory burst activity (10Bajaj M.S. Kew R.R. Webster R.O. Hyers T.M. Inflammation. 1992; 16: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TNFα also stimulates apoptosis in a subpopulation of neutrophils between 1 and 6 h in culture (11Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Salamone G. Giordano M. Trevani A.S. Gamberale R. Vermeulen M. Schettinni J. Geffner J.R. J.

Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα therefore appears to be one of the very few natural ligands capable of inducing early neutrophil apoptosis, and an ability to enhance this effect may have important therapeutic implications in the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. Aminopeptidases (AP) catalyze the removal of amino acids from peptide substrates and play an important role in protein maturation, hormone regulation, and the degradation of biologically active proteins and peptides (13Taylor A. Peltier C.Z. Torre F.J. Hakamian N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One of the most widely studied AP is the 967-amino acid protein termed aminopeptidase N (APN). This peptidase is identical to the cell surface antigen CD13 (14Look A.T. Ashmun R.A. Shapiro L.H. Peiper S.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and displays activity toward an array of substrates, including the enkephalins, bradykinin, bacterial derived chemotactic peptides, tachykinins, and the cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 (15Sekine K. Fujii H. Abe F. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Van Der Velden V.H.J. Hulsmann A.R. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD13 is involved in cell surface antigen processing through the “trimming” of HLA class II- or class I-bound peptides on antigen-presenting cells (17Larsen S.L. Pedersen L.O. Buus S. Stryhn A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Amoscato A.A. Prenovitz D.A. Lotze M.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4023-4032PubMed Google Scholar, 19Huschak G. Zur N.K. Stuttmann R. Riemann D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 134: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). AP have also been reported to play an important role in the evolution of the inflammatory response, because they are responsible for the formation of leukotriene B4 from leukotriene A4 (20Orning L. Krivi G. Bild G. Gierse J. Aykent S. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16507-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP inhibitors, such as actinonin and bestatin, have been reported to have anti-tumor effects through augmentation of the host immune system (21Talmadge J.E. Lenz B.F. Pennington R. Long C.

Pharmacother. 1991; 45: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More relevant to the present study, bestatin has been shown to induce apoptosis through inhibition of cell surface APN (15Sekine K. Fujii H. Abe F. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Ezawa K. Minato K. Dobashi K. Biomed.

Fujii H. Abe F. Nishikawa K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In light of previous findings that AP inhibitors augment apoptosis in cancer cells exposed to TNFα (27Sekine K. Fujii H. Abe F. Nishikawa K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that neutrophils, which express high levels of cell surface AP (28Marotti T. Balog T. Munic V. Sobocanec S. Abramic M. Neuropeptides. 2000; 34: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 29Macey M.G. McCarthy D.A. Newland A.C. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 967-972PubMed Google Scholar), may also demonstrate this effect. We have shown previously that the pro-apoptotic effect of TNFα requires, unusually, co-ligation of both TNFRI and TNFRII (11Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that NF-κB plays a key role in regulating the cytotoxic efficacy of this cytokine (30Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S. Farrow S.N. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4309-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Here we show that a range of biological and chemical inhibitors of APN amplify TNFα-induced signaling in neutrophils, in particular that they augment TNFα-induced apoptosis, TNFα-induced priming, and respiratory burst activation (as indicated by an increase in fMLP-stimulated superoxide anion generation), and TNFα-induced shape change. This effect is mediated via the ability of APN inhibitors to prevent the shedding of cell surface TNFRI with no effect on TNFRII or CXCR1/2 expression or cleavage. We have further demonstrated the ability of different priming agents to affect APN activity and for this to subsequently dictate the efficacy of TNFα-stimulated apoptosis. Moreover, the marked inter-donor variation we now report for TNFα-induced neutrophil apoptosis is shown to correlate with the individual neutrophil APN activity. These data suggest that neutrophil cell surface APN/CD13 activity is a key determinant of TNFRI expression and function and that variation in APN/CD13 activity dictates the efficacy of TNFα-induced neutrophil apoptosis. Isolation of Human Neutrophils—Neutrophils were purified by dextran sedimentation and discontinuous plasma Percoll™ gradients (31Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Purified cells were resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% autologous serum and 50 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin. Neutrophils were cultured in the presence or absence of actinonin (100 μm), bestatin (100 μm), azide-free CD13 blocking antibody (8 μg/ml; WM15), or PAF (1 μm) with or without TNFα (10 ng/ml). Assessment of Neutrophil Apoptosis in Vitro—Neutrophils were harvested at the time points indicated, cyto-centrifuged, fixed in methanol, and stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa (Merck), and the morphology was examined by oil immersion light microscopy. Apoptotic neutrophils were defined as those with darkly stained pyknotic nuclei (300 cells counted/slide and 3 slides per experimental condition and time point) (32Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was also assessed by FACS with FITC-labeled recombinant human annexin V and propidium iodide staining (33Cowburn A.S. Cadwallader K.A. Reed B.J. Farahi N. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 2002; 100: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the studies examining the effect of caspase inhibition on TNFα-induced apoptosis, neutrophils were preincubated (20 min) with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (30 μm) in the presence or absence of actinonin (0.1 mm) prior to the addition of vehicle control or TNFα for 6 h. Caspase-3 activity was measured by colorimetric substrate reaction (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neutrophil Shape Change—Neutrophils were preincubated in the presence or absence of actinonin (0.1 mm) or CD13 antibody (8 μg/ml) for 20 min in Dulbecco's PBS; fMLP (100 nm, positive control) or TNFα (12 ng/ml) were then added for 30 min. The incubations were stopped with an equal volume of ice-cold glutaraldehyde (final concentration 1.6% (v/v)). The effect of actinonin and CD13 blocking antibody on neutrophil polarization was assessed by FACS analysis as detailed previously (34Qu J. Hosoi K. Shimojima T. Oi T. Ikeda K. J. Periodontal. Res. 1995; 30: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Neutrophil Respiratory Burst Activity—Respiratory burst activity was assessed by measuring the generation of superoxide anion using superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as described previously (11Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APN Activity—Cell surface AP activity was determined as the rate of amide bond hydrolysis of alanine p-nitroanilide substrate (Sigma). Alanine-p-nitroanilide (final concentration 2 mm) was incubated with 1 × 106 cells at 37 °C for 30 min. Amide bond hydrolysis was quantified by p-nitroanilide absorbance at 405 nm, corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate, and converted to mm/min. For the APN inhibitor studies actinonin (0.1 mm), bestatin (0.1 mm), and CD13 blocking antibody (8 μg/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with or without TNFα. In studies utilizing PAF (1 μm), neutrophils were preincubated for 5 min prior to APN inhibitor or TNFα incubation. APN RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy column (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). RNA (2 μg) was transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) and 50 units of reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). PCR amplification was performed using specific primer sets for CD13 (sense, 5′-ACG CCA CCT CTA CCA TCA TC; antisense, 5′-AGC ACC ACC TCC TTG TTC TC, 304-bp product). For control reactions, a specific primer set for β-actin (sense, 5′-GTG GGG CGC CCC AGG CAC CA; antisense, 3′-CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG CAG CAC GAT TTC, 548-bp product) was used. PCR (28 cycles) was performed using 2 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and imaged with ethidium bromide under UV light. Measurement of TNFRI/II and CXCR1/2 Cell Surface Expression—Neutrophils (1 × 106 cells per condition) were preincubated with actinonin or bestatin (both at 0.1 mm) for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS. For TNFRI and TNFRII expression, this incubation was followed by a 30- (TNFRI) or 60-min (TNFRII) exposure to TNFα (10 ng/ml). In the case of CXCR1 and -2 studies, the preincubation with AP inhibitors was followed by 1 h of incubation with either IL-8 (500 ng/ml) or TNFα (50 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of bestatin. The cells were centrifuged at 256 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then incubated with optimal concentrations of FITC-conjugated anti-TNFRI, TNFRII, CXCR1, or anti-CXCR2 antibodies (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK) for 40 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended for analysis on a FACS (BD Biosciences). CellQuest software was used for gating and analysis of cell population. Soluble TNFRI/II ELISA—Cell supernatants were obtained from the above series of experiments by analyzing the cell surface expression of TNFRI/II and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at –80 °C until analysis. ELISA for sTNFRI and sTNFRII were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. With the exception of the substrate, to enable continuous analysis during development, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, was added, and the plates were read at 405 nm in an automated plate reader (3550; Bio-Rad). Results were analyzed using a standard curve generated in parallel with each assay (Microplate Manager software; Bio-Rad). The lower level of sensitivity of the sTNFRI assay was 10 pg/ml and for the sTNFRII assay was 15 pg/ml. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Isolated neutrophils (2 × 107) were preincubated in the presence or absence of actinonin (0.1 mm) and Z-VAD-fmk (30 μm) for 20 min prior to TNFα stimulation for 4 h. Neutrophils were pelleted and washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with the buffer provided by the assay manufacturer. The assay was completed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the substrate cleavage was analyzed at 405 nm in an automated plate reader (3550; Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—All data represent the mean (±S.E.) of (n) separate experiments unless otherwise stated. Differences between groups were assessed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc analysis with Tukey's multiple comparisons and Student's t test using Graph-pad Prism software. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. We and others have reported previously on the unique property of TNFα to induce neutrophil apoptosis at early time points (11Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Takeda Y. Watanabe H. Yonehara S. Yamashita T.

Immunol. 1996; 40: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This early (6 h) pro-apoptotic effect of TNFα (10 ng/ml) is confirmed in this study, but examination of the magnitude of the response in neutrophils isolated from 12 different donors identified a very broad effect (mean 18.5% and range 6.8–34.3%) (Fig. 1A). Neutrophil isolations were regularly analyzed for basal shape change and fMLP-induced superoxide anion generation to ensure minimal cell priming because this is recognized to affect the cells ability to respond to TNFα (11Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the extent of the TNFα response for an individual was determined in three donors spanning the response range and was found to be highly reproducible (Fig. 1B). The AP inhibitors, actinonin, and bestatin have been shown to inhibit a wide variety of cytosolic, secretory, and cell surface APs, including APN (37Scornik O.A. Botbol V. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Tieku S. Hooper N.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1725-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Sekine et al. (15Sekine K. Fujii H. Abe F. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have shown previously that AP inhibitors, such as bestatin, induce apoptosis of human leukemic cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner as well as inhibiting cell growth. Their findings pointed to the involvement of an intracellular AP because blocking CD13 on the surface of leukemic cells with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody had no effect on apoptosis. Culturing isolated human neutrophils for 6 h with the AP inhibitors actinonin, bestatin, or the blocking peptide to CD13 alone had no effect on the basal rate of neutrophil apoptosis at any inhibitor concentration used (Fig. 2A). However, a combination of the apoptotic agent TNFα and actinonin (0.1 mm) resulted in a significant augmentation of TNFα-induced killing effect at 6 h from 16 ± 2to30 ± 2% (p < 0.05, n = 6) (Fig. 2A). The AP inhibitor bestatin also augmented TNFα killing to an identical extent (p < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 2A). To support these data we repeated the experiments using an azide-free CD13 blocking antibody (WM15) (Fig. 2A). These experiments revealed that blocking the CD13 active site also significantly increased TNFα-stimulated neutrophil apoptosis (28.7 ± 1.8%, p < 0.05, n = 3). In order to confirm augmented TNFα-induced neutrophil apoptosis, annexin V staining was assayed by FACS analysis. Fig. 2B is a representative quartet that shows no effect of actinonin on basal annexin V staining (and hence apoptosis) at 6 h, whereas TNFα-induced apoptosis increased from 15 to 32% after 6 h of culture with actinonin. An AP activity assay was devised to determine the efficacy and optimal concentration of AP inhibitors required to inhibit whole cell surface APN. A concentration response for actinonin gave an IC50 of 3.1 μm with a maximal effective concentration of 0.1 mm; bestatin gave an IC50 of 10 μm and a maximal effective concentration of 1 mm, although 0.1 mm was used throughout this study to avoid cell toxicity. Cell surface AP activity was significantly inhibited by all three agents, actinonin (18.8 ± 2.9 μm/min/106 cells, p < 0.001), bestatin (12.2 ± 3.1 μm/min/106 cells, p < 0.001), and CD13 blocking antibody (31.0 ± 3.1 μm/min/106 cells, p < 0.001) when compared with control (53.5 ± 7.8 μm/min/106 cells, p < 0.001, n = 6) (Fig. 2C). TNFα did not affect AP activity either in control or AP inhibitor-treated cells. The protease inhibitors leupeptin (50 μm), aprotinin (0.3 μm), and pepstatin (50 μm) alone or in combination with actinonin did not alter the rate of alanine-pNa hydrolysis supporting the specificity of the APN inhibition assay (data not shown). Any agent that affects the priming or activation state of human neutrophils may influence (in a specific or nonspecific manner) cell survival or apoptosis pathways. To investigate whether actinonin or bestatin exerted such effects, we assessed neutrophil superoxide anion generation and shape change responses because these are highly sensitive markers of neutrophil priming and activation status (34Qu J. Hosoi K. Shimojima T. Oi T. Ikeda K. J. Periodontal. Res. 1995; 30: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Neutrophils undergo characteristic shape change (polarization) when challenged with chemotactic agents under nongradient conditions. Using the light scattering properties of primed and activated neutrophils compared with unprimed cells, actinonin and bestatin were shown to have no discernible effect on neutrophil shape change compared with control cells(Fig.3A). However, TNFα resulted in a characteristic concentration-dependent shape change response with the maximal effect at 10 ng/ml, and more importantly, the blocking antibody for CD13 induced a significant leftward shift in the TNFα concentration-response curve. Actinonin also enhanced TNFα-stimulated shape change, but to a lesser degree (Fig. 3A). Its well known that priming of neutrophils with TNFα and subsequent stimulation by the prototypic bacterial formyl peptide fMLP trigger an intense activation of the NADPH oxidase. Superoxide anion generation was determined by measuring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c (11Murray J. Barbara J.A. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of the AP inhibitors or CD13 blocking antibody. Again, the AP inhibitors/blocking antibody alone or in combination with TNFα or fMLP had no effect on superoxide anion generation compared with the relevant controls (Fig. 3B). However, actinonin/blocking antibody caused a significant increase in the TNFα- and fMLP-stimulated superoxide anion response. Z-VAD-fmk, used at concentrations of 30 μm, which is considered to be specific for caspase inhibition (39Cowburn A.S. White J.F. Deighton J. Walmsley S.R. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 2005; 105: 2970-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), caused a near complete loss of the pro-apoptotic effect of TNFα at 6 h. In addition, the augmented apoptosis response observed in the presence of actinonin was also inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Z-VAD-fmk inhibited whole cell caspase-3 activity stimulated by TNFα also and that augmented by actinonin (4 h) to levels below that of control (Fig. 4B). Actinonin alone did not stimulate caspase-3 activity. Sekine et al. (15Sekine K. Fujii H. Abe F. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1999; 13: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have suggested previously that AP inhibitors could induce apoptosis through processing of caspase-3 to its active form. In neutrophils, however, AP inhibitors alone had no effect on basal apoptosis and failed to activate caspase-3 (data not shown). A robust activation of caspase-3 was however observed with TNFα, in keeping with the annexin V and morphology data, and was enhanced further in the presence of AP inhibitors. These data indicate that the augmentation of TNFα-induced neutrophil apoptosis by AP inhibitors is a caspase-dependent process, but the inhibitors alone have no effect on basal caspase-3 processing. Dri et al. (40Dri P. Gasparini C. Menegazzi R. Cramer R. Alberi L. Presani G. Garbisa S. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2165-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) demonstrated TNFα induced shedding of both the TNFRI and -RII and that a membrane-bound, nonmatrix metalloprotease was involved in this process. The possibility that actinonin or bestatin may exert their effects on apoptosis through inhibition of a membrane-bound AP such as APN/CD13 and a novel interaction with TNFRI or TNFRII therefore warranted investigation. If APN was involved in shedding or internalization of TNFRI or TNFRII then the presence of an AP inhibitor or blocking mAb may maintain receptor integrity at the neutrophil cell surface and thereby enhance TNF receptor signaling. Analysis of TNFRI cell surface expression using flow cytometry, following incubation with actinonin alone, showed a small but significant increase in receptor expression compared with control (p < 0.01, n = 6) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, TNFRII cell surface expression was not affected by actinonin (data not shown). Neutrophils incubated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 30 min showed significant loss of both TNFRI and TNFRII compared with untreated neutrophils; however, this was not influenced by the presence of actinonin (Fig. 5A). These experiments were also repeated following 20 min of stimulation with TNFα, where TNFRI loss is less complete. Nevertheless, actinonin still did not influence TNFRI surface expression (control 12.1 ± 1.0 (mean fluorescence), TNFα 7.9 ± 0.9, actinonin 14.6 ± 1.0, TNF/actinonin 9.2 ± 1.6; n = 5). However, fMLP (an agonist that induces TNFRI shedding only)-induced TNFRI shedding was completely inhibited by actinonin (Fig. 5A, inset). To assess further the potential effects of APN on TNFR shedding, soluble TNFRI/II was assayed in parallel using the supernatants generated in the TNFRI/II surface expression studies. Although actinonin did not affect the quantity of sTNFRI under control conditions (actinonin, 39.3 ± 7.5 pg/ml; control, 46.9 ± 8.5 pg/ml) (Fig. 5B), the APN inhibitor caused a marked reduction in the TNFα-stimulated increase in sTNFRI (TNFα, 135.5 ± 14.1 pg/ml; TNFα + actinonin, 76.5 ± 12 pg/ml; p < 0.001; n = 6). fMLP-stimulated shedding of TNFRI was also complemented by analysis of sTNFRI, indicating the ability of actinonin to inhibit TNFRI shedding (data not shown). The levels of sTNFRII under control or TNFα-stimulated conditions were unaffected by incubation with actinonin (Fig. 5C). These data, together with the capacity for AP inhibitors and blocking antibodies to enhance an array of TNFα-mediated neutrophil responses, suggest that these compounds enhance the efficacy of TNFα-mediated apoptosis through modulation of TNFRI expression. We have shown previously that the pro-apoptotic effect of TNFα requires co-ligation of both TN"

Pseudomonas aeruginosa LigD consists of a central ATP-dependent ligase domain fused to a C-terminal polymerase domain and an N-terminal phosphoesterase (PE) module. The PE domain catalyzes manganese-dependent phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase reactions at the 3′ end of the primer strand of a primer-template. The phosphodiesterase cleaves a 3′-terminal diribonucleotide to yield a primer strand with a ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 terminus. The phosphomonoesterase converts a terminal ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 or deoxyribonucleoside 3′-PO4 of a primer-template to a 3′-OH. Here we report that the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase activities are both dependent on the presence and length of the 5′ single-strand tail of the primer-template substrate. Although the phosphodiesterase activity is strictly dependent on the 2′-OH of the penultimate ribose, it is indifferent to a 2′-OH versus a2′-H on the terminal nucleoside. Incision at the ribonucleotide linkage is suppressed when the 2′-OH is moved by 1 nucleotide in the 5′ direction, suggesting that LigD is an exoribonuclease that cleaves the 3′-terminal phosphodiester. We report the effects of conservative amino acid substitutions at residues: (i) His42, His48, Asp50, Arg52, His84, and Tyr88, which are essential for both the ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase activities; (ii) Arg14, Asp15, Glu21, and Glu82, which are critical for 3′-phosphatase activity but not 3′-ribonucleoside removal; and (iii) at Lys66 and Arg76, which participate selectively in the 3′-ribonuclease reaction. The results suggest roles for individual functional groups in metal binding and/or phosphoesterase chemistry.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa LigD consists of a central DNA ligase catalytic domain (Lig) fused to a C-terminal polymerase domain (Pol) and an N-terminal phosphoesterase module (PE) (5Zhu H. Shuman S. J.

These activities could contribute to the error-prone character of NHEJ in vivo (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence in mycobacteria implicates the Pol activity of LigD as the direct agent of the high incidence of +1 frameshift mutations at blunt ends during NHEJ in vivo (8Zhu H. Nandakumar J.

The LigD Pol domain, which is structurally related to archaeal DNA primases (8Zhu H. Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J. Wang L.K. Glickman M.S. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), catalyzes two types of primer extension synthesis reactions in vitro: (i) templated fill-in of a 5′-overhang and (ii) nontemplated addition of single nucleotides at a blunt end (5Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 418-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Pol domain can use either rNTPs or dNTPs as substrates for the primer extensions. The 187-amino acid PE domain of Pseudomonas LigD was described initially as a nuclease capable of resecting a short tract of 3′-ribonucleotides on a primer-template substrate to the point that the primer strand had a single 3′-ribonucleotide remaining (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The failure to digest into the DNA strand beyond this point reflects a stringent requirement for a 2′-OH group on the penultimate nucleoside of the primer strand (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ribonucleotide resection activity is the result of two component steps: (i) the 3′-terminal nucleoside is first removed to yield a primer strand with a ribonucleoside 3′-PO4 terminus; (ii) the 3′-PO4 is hydrolyzed to a 3′-OH. The 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase activities are both dependent on manganese (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The PE domain also catalyzes manganese-dependent hydrolysis of the 3′-PO4 of an all-DNA primer-template substrate (7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), signifying that the 2′-OH of the terminal nucleoside is not required for the phosphomonoesterase reaction. LigD preferentially cleaves the 3′-PO4 of a duplex primer-template substrate rather than a single-stranded DNA of identical composition (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PE domain of LigD has no apparent structural or mechanistic similarity to previously characterized nucleases or 3′-phosphatases. Thus, we speculated that it exemplifies a novel phosphoesterase family (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An initial alanine scan of 16 residues of Pseudomonas LigD identified six side chains (His42, His48, Asp50, Arg52, His84, and Tyr88) as essential for both the 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase activities, five residues (Arg14, Asp15, Glu21, Gln40, Glu82) that were important for 3′-phosphatase activity, but not 3′-ribonucleoside removal, and two amino acids (Lys66 and Arg76) that were required selectively for the 3′-ribonuclease (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the active sites for the ribonuclease and phosphatase functions overlap but are not identical. Here we conduct further studies of the substrate specificity of the PE domain, focusing on the contributions of the template DNA strand to the remodeling of the 3′ end of the primer strand. We find that the single-strand tail of the template strand accelerates the rate of the ribonucleotide resection and 3′-phosphatase reactions by factors of 20 and 28, respectively, with optimal activation occurring when the tail length is 8–12 nucleotides. By varying the sugar at the end of a primer strand containing a single penultimate ribonucleotide, we show that the phosphodiesterase reaction does not depend on a terminal 2′-OH. By varying the position of the single ribonucleotide, we demonstrate that LigD acts specifically at the terminal phosphodiester. Furthermore, we characterize the effects of 26 conservative mutants in the 13 amino acids of the PE domain that were implicated via alanine scanning in the phosphodiesterase or phosphomonoesterase reactions. The present findings emphasize the unique structural and mechanistic features of LigD vis à vis other 3′-processing enzymes. PE Domain Mutants—Missense mutations were introduced into the pET-PaeLigD-PE plasmid as described previously (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol.

The inserts of the mutant plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Induction of protein expression with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, preparation of soluble bacterial lysates, and purification of the His10-tagged PE proteins by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography were performed as described (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 200 mm imidazole eluate fractions containing the PE domain were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. 3′-Ribonuclease Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer D10R2 strand was annealed to a 4-fold excess of unlabeled complementary 24-mer, 20-mer, 16-mer, or 12-mer DNA strands to form the primer-templates depicted in Fig. 1A. The 3′-ribonuclease reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 50 nm 5′ 32P-labeled D10R2 primer-template, and 5 μm LigD PE domain were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched by adjusting the mixtures to 7 mm EDTA and 31% formamide. The products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 40-cm 18% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. 3′-Phosphatase Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled, 3′-phosphate-terminated D9R1-p strand was prepared by digesting a 5′ 32P-labeled D9R3 primer oligonucleotide with ribonuclease A as described (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The labeled D9R1-p oligonucleotide was annealed to a 4-fold excess of an unlabeled complementary 24-mer DNA strand. The 3′-phosphatase reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 50 nm 5′ 32P-labeled D9R1-p primer-template (see Fig. 3C), and 5 μm LigD PE domain were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched with EDTA/formamide. The products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above. The extent of conversion of the 3′-PO4 oligonucleotide to the slower migrating 3′-OH product was determined by scanning the gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imaging apparatus. DNA 3′-Phosphatase Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled, 3′-phosphate-terminated D11-p strand (5′-pCAATTGCGACCp) was annealed to a 4-fold excess of unlabeled complementary 24-mer, 20-mer, 16-mer, or 12-mer DNA strands to form the primer-templates depicted in Fig. 1C. The DNA 3′-phosphatase reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 50 nm 5′ 32P-labeled D11-p primer-template, and 5 μm LigD PE domain were incubated at 37 °C.

The products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis and quantified as described above. 3′-Ribonuclease and 3′-Phosphatase Activities at a Primer Terminus Depend on the 5′ Single-strand Tail of a Template DNA Strand—Pseudomonas LigD prefers to remodel the recessed 3′ ends of the primer strand of a duplex primer-template substrate compared with a single-strand of identical composition (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The substrate for the 3′-ribonuclease reaction consists of a 12-nucleotide 5′ 32P-labeled primer strand (D10R2, composed of 10 deoxynucleotides and a 3′-terminal diribonucleotide) annealed to a 24-mer DNA strand to form a 12-bp duplex with a 12-nucleotide 5′ tail (Fig. 1A, left panel). To gauge the contributions, if any, of the single-strand tail to the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity, we annealed the D10R2 primer to a series of incrementally shortened template strands to form substrates with 8- or 4-nucleotide 5′ tails attached to identical 12-bp duplex segments (Fig. 1A, middle panels), and a substrate consisting only of the 12-bp duplex with no single-strand tail (Fig. 1A, right panel). We examined the kinetics of the reaction of the LigD PE domain with this set of primer-templates under conditions of enzyme excess (Fig. 1A). The labeled D10R2 strand of the 12-mer/24-mer substrate was converted first to a 3′-phosphorylated species, D10R1-p, which was then converted to a more slowly migrating 3′-OH end-product, D10R1 (Fig. 1A). The rate of the 3′-phosphodiesterase reaction was quantified in Fig. 1B by plotting the sum of the D10R1-p and D10R1 reaction products (expressed as the fraction of total radiolabeled material) as a function of time. The reaction was completed in 10 min and the data fit to a single exponential with an apparent rate constant of 0.01 s–1, which agrees with value reported previously (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The extent of substrate decay and the distribution of the reaction products were essentially unchanged for the primer-template containing an 8-nucleotide 5′ tail (Fig. 1, A and B). However, further shortening of the tail to 4 nucleotides slowed both the conversion of D10R2 to D10R1-p and the appearance of the dephosphorylated D10R1 end-product (Fig. 1A); the apparent rate constant for the phosphodiesterase step (0.0018 s–1) was slowed by a factor of 5.5 compared with the substrates with longer 5′ tails (Fig. 1B). The reaction of the PE domain with the blunt-end 12-bp duplex was even more feeble, and there was virtually no D10R1 end product formed at a time when ∼60% of the input primer had been converted to D10R1-p (Fig. 1, A and B). We estimated a phosphodiesterase rate constant of 0.00053 s–1 for the 12-bp duplex, which indicated that the 5′ tail accelerates the rate of 3′-ribonucleoside removal by a factor of 20. The 3′-phosphatase step can be studied in isolation using a substrate composed of a 5′ 32P-labeled 11-mer DNA strand with a 3′-PO4 terminus (D11-p) annealed to a 24-mer DNA strand to form the primer-template shown in Fig. 1C. This molecule, which has a 13-nucleotide 5′ tail attached to an 11-bp duplex, was rapidly converted by excess PE domain to a single D11 product (Fig. 1C). The reaction was complete in 2–5 min and attained 77% of the end point value in 1 min. From this datum, we calculated a DNA 3′-phosphatase rate constant of 0.025 s–1, which agreed with the value reported previously (7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Annealing of the D11-p strand to complementary 20-mer, 16-mer, and 12-mer strands yielded a series of primer-templates containing an 11-bp duplex segment and 5′ tails of 9, 5, or 1 nucleotide (Fig. 1C). Whereas the rate and extent of 3′-dephosphorylation of the D11-p/20-mer primer template was identical to that of the D11-p/24-mer, shortening the tail to 5 nucleotides in the D11-p/16-mer substrate caused a 2.5-fold decrement in the rate constant to 0.01 s–1 (Fig. 1C). When the 5′ tail was retracted to only 1 nucleotide in the D11-p/12-mer duplex, the rate was reduced more dramatically, to 0.00088 s–1. The kinetic profile for 3′ dephosphorylation of the D11-p/12-mer duplex was almost identical to that observed for removing the 3′-phosphate from the D11-p strand alone (Fig. 1C). These data underscore that the 5′ tail accelerates the rate of the DNA 3′-phosphatase reaction by a factor of 28. To our knowledge, the strong dependence of the 3′-phosphatase activity of LigD on a complementary template strand with a 5′ tail has not been noted previously for other biochemically characterized polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase enzymes, which include bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (Pnkp) (9Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), mammalian Pnkp (10Bernstein N.K. Williams R.S. Rakovszky M.L. Cui D. Green R. Karimi-Busheri F. Mani R.S.

Chem. 1964; 239: 242-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the DNA 3′-phosphatase reaction of mammalian Pnkp is equally effective on nicked or gapped double-stranded substrates or with single-stranded oligonucleotides of lengths varying from 3 to 21 nucleotides (10Bernstein N.K. Williams R.S. Rakovszky M.L. Cui D. Green R. Karimi-Busheri F. Mani R.S. Galicia S. Koch C.A. Cass C.E. Durocher D. Weinfeld M. Glover J.N.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Yeast Tpp1, although unable to dephosphorylate a 3′-PO4-terminated single strand, is equally adept at removing the 3′-PO4 from an internal nick or gap in duplex DNA, a recessed 3′ end of a 5′-tailed primer-template, or a blunt DNA duplex with no single-strand tail (11Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15073-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The phosphatase component of T4 Pnkp hydrolyzes a 3′-PO4 from either single-stranded polynucleotides or free 3′-mononucleotides (9Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5120-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Mycobacteriophage and vibriophage Pnkp enzymes also hydrolyze a 3′-mononucleotide substrate (13Zhu H. Yin S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26358-26369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3′-Phosphodiesterase Activity Does Not Require a Terminal 2′-OH—Whereas the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of LigD is strictly dependent on a 2′-OH of the penultimate nucleoside (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the role of the terminal 2′-OH has not been tested. To address this issue, we exploited a new primer strand, D10RD, composed of 10 deoxynucleotides, a single penultimate ribonucleotide, and a 3′-terminal deoxynucleotide. D10RD differs from the standard D10R2 primer only insofar at it lacks a terminal 2′-OH group. 5′ 32P-labeled D10R2 and D10RD were annealed to a complementary 24-mer strand to form the primer-templates depicted in Fig. 2A. The differences in the terminal sugar resulted in a difference in electrophoretic mobility of the strands, whereby D10RD migrated slightly ahead of D10R2 (Fig. 2A, – lanes). Both substrates were converted quantitatively by the LigD PE domain to the D10R1 end-product (Fig. 2A, + lanes). To more finely compare how well the LigD PE domain processes these substrates, we performed an enzyme titration experiment shown in Fig. 2B. The extent of product formation increased with PE concentration. At limiting enzyme levels, the products consisted of a mixture of D10R1-p and D10R1 strands. At the highest level of enzyme, nearly all the substrate was converted to D10R1. The titration profiles were virtually identical for the D10R2 and D10RD substrates. We conclude that cleavage of the 3′-phosphodiester linkage is indifferent to a ribose versus deoxyribose sugar on the departing 5′-OH nucleoside. LigD Measures and Cleaves the Terminal Ribonucleotide Phosphodiester—We showed previously that LigD could resect 2 ribonucleotides from the 3′ end of a D9R3 primer-template to form a D9R1 end product (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The kinetic analysis of the processing of the D9R3 substrate was complicated by the fact that a potential reaction intermediate, D9R2-p, comigrated with the D9R1 end product. Thus, we could not distinguish between two alternative reaction schemes in which: (i) LigD initially incises the phosphodiester of the terminal (rC)p(rC) dinucleotide to release cytidine and leave the 11-mer D9R2-p, which is converted to D9R1-p, and then dephosphorylated to form the D9R1 end-product; or (ii) LigD initially cleaves at the second phosphodiester from the 3′ terminus to release a diribonucleotide and leave the 10-mer D9R1-p, which is then dephosphorylated to D9R1. The key mechanistic issue is whether LigD is obliged to cleave the terminal phosphodiester. We addressed this question by using primer strand D9RD2, which consists of nine 5′-deoxynucleotides, a single ribonucleotide, and two 3′-terminal deoxynucleotides (Fig. 2A). The D9RD2 primer-template contains a single potential cleavage site for the LigD phosphodiesterase, which is phased 1 nucleotide inward from the 3′ end compared with the D10RD substrate (Fig. 2A). Whereas D10RD was quantitatively processed by the PE domain, the D9RD2 was highly refractory, such that 91% of the primer strand remained intact (Fig. 2A). Scant amounts of two products were formed (denoted by the arrowheads in Fig. 2A) that migrated ahead of D10R1 and apparently correspond to D9R1-p and D9R1. We surmise that the LigD phosphodiesterase active site is poised specifically over the terminal ribonucleoside phosphodiester and is not very effective at reaching inward by one nucleotide to cleave a penultimate ribonucleoside phosphodiester. Thus, we designate LigD as a 3′-exonuclease that releases 5′-OH mononucleoside products. Structure-Activity Relationships at Residues Essential for 3′-Phosphodiesterase and Monoesterase Activity—Six amino acids were identified previously as essential for both the 3′-ribonuclease and 3′-phosphatase functions. Alanine mutations at His42, His48, Asp50, Arg52, and His84 abolished activity and mutation of Tyr88 reduced ribonuclease and phosphatase activity to 7% and ≤1% of wild-type, respectively (6Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25973-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because limited tryptic digestion of the Ala mutant proteins revealed a pattern of resistant fragments that was virtually identical to that of the wild-type PE protein, it was inferred that the six essential residues are not critical for global folding (7Zhu H. Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33707-33715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rather, we proposed that they are catalytic residues at a shared active site that perform functions common to both the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase reactions. To illuminate structure-activity relationships for the six putative active site residues, we introduced two conservative substitutions at each position. Histidine was replaced by asparagine and glutamine, aspartate by glutamate and asparagine, arginine by lysine and glutamine, and tyrosine by phenylalanine and serine. The wild-type PE domain and the 12 conservative mutants were produced in E. coli as His10 fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis verified that the preparations were enriched to the same extent with respect to the PE polypeptide, which, as noted previously, migrated anomalously at ∼30 kDa (predicted size: 24 kDa) (Fig. 3A). Mutational effects on 3′-ribonucleotide resection were gauged by analysis of the reaction of the PE protein with the 32P-labeled D10R2 primer-template under conditions of enzyme excess. Wild-type PE quantitatively converted the labeled strand to a 3′-OH end product, D10R1 (Fig. 3B). The H42N, H42Q, H48N, H48Q, D50E, D50N, R52K, R52Q, H84N, and H84Q mutants were virtually inert. We conclude that His42, His48, Asp50, Arg52, and His84 are strictly essential for the 3′-phosphodiesterase function of LigD. Whereas the Y88S mutant displayed feeble 3′-ribonucleotide resection activity resulting in the formation of the D10R1-p intermediate only, the Y88F mutant consumed all of the input substrate to generate predominantly D10R1-p and only a small amount of the D10R1 end product (Fig. 3B). The results emphasize that the aromatic ring of Tyr88, not the hydroxyl, is the relevant contributor to the 3′-phosphodiesterase reaction, although a role for the tyrosine hydroxyl in the 3′-phosphatase step is suggested. Mutational effects on the 3′-phosphatase were assayed directly by reacting the PE proteins with a 32P-labeled D9R1-p primer-template under conditions of enzyme excess (Fig. 3C). Wild-type PE converted nearly all of the input D9R1-p labeled strand to a slower migrating D9R1 species. All 12 mutants were virtually inert in the isolated 3′-phosphatase reaction (Fig. 3C). (The trace amounts of radiolabeled oligonucleotide comigrating with the D9R1 species were present at similar levels in a control reaction from which PE domain was omitted; data not shown). Thus, His42, His48, Asp50, Arg52, and His84 are strictly essential for the 3′-phosphomonoesterase and the 3′-phosphodiesterase. Coordination of the manganese cofactor and stabilization of the transition state on the reactive phosphate are the likely essential contributions of the enzyme to both the phosphodiesterase and phosphomonoesterase reactions. We speculate that Arg52 coordinates the reactive phosphate and stabilizes the extra charge developed on a presumptive associative transition state. The finding that lysine could not functionally substitute for Arg52 suggests that this side chain makes a bidentate contact with two of the phosphate oxygens. Any of the essential histidines are also candidates to contact the reactive phosphate, although it might be thought that a simple hydrogen bond between a histidine and the phosphate could have been attained by conservative substitutions with asparagine or glutamine (which mimic the histidine Nδ and Nϵ, respectively). We suggest instead that His42, His48, and His84, together with Asp50, comprise a coordination complex for the manganese ion(s) that are required for catalysis. Aspartates are routine components of the metal-binding sites of many enzymes involved in phosphoryl tran"

The dynamic degradation of 5-HT metabolites in 5-HT-containing nervous system tissues is monitored by capillary electrophoresis with wavelength-resolved laser-induced native fluorescence detection in an effort to investigate known and novel 5-HT catabolic pathways. Tissue samples from wild type mice, genetically altered mice, Long Evans rats, and cultured differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells, are analyzed before and after incubation with excess 5-HT. From these experiments, several new compounds are detected. One metabolite, identified as 5-hydroxyindole thiazoladine carboxylic acid (5-HITCA), has been selected for further study. In 5-HT-incubated central and enteric nervous system tissue samples and differentiated PC-12 cells, 5-HITCA forms at levels equivalent to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, via a condensation reaction between l-cysteine and 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde. In the enteric nervous system, 5-HITCA is detected without the addition of 5-HT. The levels of l-cysteine and homocysteine in rat brain mitochondria are measured between 80 and 140 μm and 1.9 and 3.4 μm, respectively, demonstrating that 5-HITCA can be formed using available, free l-cysteine in these tissues. The lack of significant accumulation of 5-HITCA in the central and enteric nervous systems, along with data showing the degradation of 5-HITCA into 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde, suggests that an equilibrium coupled to the enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase type 2, prevents the accumulation of 5-HITCA. Even so, the formation of 5-HITCA represents a catabolic pathway of 5-HT that can affect the levels of 5-HT-derived compounds in the body.

The majority of this research has involved the central nervous system, where imbalances in 5-HT levels have been linked to various diseases, including Parkinson, Huntington, Alzheimer, Alzheimer-like dementia, anxiety, and depression (1Osborne N.N. Hamon M. Neuronal Serotonin. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., London1988Google Scholar), and its regulation depends on a multitude of 5-HT receptors and neurochemical pathways (2Murphy D.L. Andrews A.M. Wichems C.H. Li Q. Tohoda M. Greenberg B. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1998; 59: 4-12PubMed Google Scholar). Other 5-HT functions within the brain involve learning and memory (3Buhot M.C. Martin S. Segu L. Ann. Med. 2000; 32: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 4Casadio A. Martin K.C. Giustetto M. Zhu H. Chen M. Bartsch D. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

Neurosci. 2003; 4: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). However, neither 5-HT nor its effects are limited to the central nervous system; 5-HT is found in most smooth muscles in the body and is responsible for the induction of the contractile responses of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and genito-urinary systems (6Dhasmana K.M. Zhu Y.N. Cruz S.L. Villalon C.M. Life Sci. 1993; 53: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Specifically, researchers estimate that 95% of the approximate 10 mg of 5-HT in the human body is produced in the enteric nervous system, which includes both the peripheral nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as the 5-HT-secreting enterochromaffin cells of the gut lining (7Kim D.Y. Camilleri M. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 95: 2698-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the enteric nervous system, 5-HT fulfills all criteria necessary for classification as a neurotransmitter (8Gershon M.D. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 13: 15-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Imbalances in 5-HT levels within the enteric nervous system have been observed in association with various disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, and gastric ulcer formation (6Dhasmana K.M. Zhu Y.N. Cruz S.L. Villalon C.M. Life Sci. 1993; 53: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Orlicz-Szczesna G. Zabel M. Jakoszewski J. Z. Mikrosk. Anat. Forsch. 1989; 103: 504-514PubMed Google Scholar). Our focus is to gain insight into the pathways by which 5-HT is catabolized and the compounds into which it is converted. Because of its high biological potency, tight regulation of 5-HT levels in specific nervous system regions is necessary, and 5-HT catabolism plays an important role in this regulation. Because 5-HT conversion into these other compounds affects the overall levels of 5-HT, formation of these conversion products can be a fundamental factor in 5-HT regulation. Scheme 1 represents the main 5-HT metabolic pathways and enzymes; however, these represent only a subset of the pathways of 5-HT metabolism, as other lower abundance serotonin metabolites, such as 5-HT sulfate, are known. In immune response pathways, compounds such as formyl 5-HT and 5-hydroxykynuremine (10Stone T.W. Darlington L.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) are additional serotonin metabolic products. Research performed in the 1950s to track the metabolism of radiolabeled tryptophan demonstrated a number of unknown 5-HT metabolites, proposed to result from additional branches of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) pathway (11Undenfriend S. Titus E. Weissbach H. Peteson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 217: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). MAO exists in two forms, MAOa and MAOb (12Shih J.C. Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar); the former is the primary form of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 5-HT, although, in the absence of MAOa, MAOb takes over the 5-HT conversion process. With a more in-depth understanding of this, and other potential tissue-specific 5-HT catabolic pathways, it may be possible to develop methods for controlling serotonergic levels in a tissue-specific manner. In this study, we identify unique 5-HT metabolites by analyzing 5-HT-producing tissues, before and after incubation with exogenously applied 5-HT. Specifically, we monitor 5-HT metabolite formation within the central nervous system, intestines, and differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells using a custom capillary electrophoresis (CE) system, observing numerous putative 5-HT metabolites. One particular unknown is observed to elute with regularity, and at a surprisingly high fluorescence intensity, comparable with that of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Using CE with a wavelength-resolved laser-induced native fluorescence (LINF) detection system and mass spectrometry (MS), we identify this particular component as 5-hydroxyindole thiazolidine carboxylic acid (5-HITCA) and explore the mechanism of its formation. The formation of 5-HITCA was previously reported (13Singh S. Dryhurst G. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 2667-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Susilo R. Damm H. Rommelspacher H. J. Neurochem. 1988; 6: 1817-1824Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Susilo R. Rommelspacher H. Hofle G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) when 5-HT was added to homogenized brain tissues and levels of 5-HITCA were shown to markedly increase upon the addition of exogenous l-cysteine (l-Cys). We demonstrate here that in the presence of 5-HT, 5-HITCA is formed in different quantities dependent on the brain region being studied, the levels can be similar to the levels of 5-HIAA in these tissues, and that it forms without exogenously added l-Cys. Furthermore, we investigate the pathways for its formation and demonstrate that it can be detected natively in homogenized enteric nervous system samples. Data measuring the fate of exogenous 5-HITCA as a function of time provides evidence that the compound is not detected natively in the central nervous system due to an equilibrium between it and 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde (5-HIAL). Earlier reports (15Susilo R. Rommelspacher H. Hofle G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) suggest that a C-S lyase is responsible for the conversion of 5-HITCA to 5-HIAA. However, our findings support the premise that an equilibrium, continuously pulled in the direction of 5-HIAL, is responsible for the conversion of 5-HITCA to 5-HIAA. Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma at analytical grade or higher, with no further purification. Modified Gray's balanced salt solution (mGBSS) was previously described (16Xian Z. Hrabetova S. Moskowitz S.I. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Young S.R. Nimmrich V.C. J. Neurosci.

Chem. 2002; 373: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was employed for these studies. In short, ∼3 nl of sample was injected electrokinetically (2.5 kV) into a capillary of 50-μm inner diameter/150-μm outer diameter. Analyte molecules leaving the capillary entered a sheath flow cuvette where they were excited by 257 nm radiation from a frequency-doubled argon-ion laser; fluorescence was collected at a right angle and focused onto a spectrograph/CCD to obtain complete emission spectra. Indoles were identified based on migration time and fluorescence emission profiles as compared with those of known standards. Quantitation was performed using fluorescence intensities of known standard concentrations. Borate buffer (pH 8.8) was prepared for CE by dissolving 3.0 g of boric acid (H3BO3) and 9.2 g of sodium borate (Na2B4O7·10 H2O) in 1.0 liter of ultrapure water (Milli-Q water filtration system; Millipore, Bedford, MA). CE-LIF with On-column Detection—A laboratory-assembled CE system with single-channel laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection with 350-356 nm excitation was employed for the separation and quantitation of thiols (see Ref. 23Kim W.S. Dahlgren R.L. Moroz L.L. Sweedler J.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5614-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar for further details on the CE system). Injections took place at 8 kV (12 μA) for 8 s, corresponding to a 7.6-nl injection volume, and separations were performed at 20 kV (40-42 μA) on a 50-μm inner diameter/365-μm outer diameter column. For this separation, the CE running buffer consisted of 30 mm sodium borate, prepared by dissolving 0.03 g of boric acid (H3BO3) and 0.97 g of sodium borate decahydrate (Na2B4O7·10H2O) in 100 ml of ultrapure water (Millipore), adjusted to pH 9.85 ± 0.05 with 0.1 m NaOH (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ). Unless otherwise noted, all tissue samples were diluted to a final density of 0.097 g/ml (by wet weight) in mGBSS and homogenized by hand using a 0.1-ml microtissue grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). Following incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and frozen immediately on dry ice. Supernatant from each sample was thawed and analyzed via CE-LINF. Mouse Brain Samples—Cerebellum, olfactory bulb, cortex, striatum, raphe nuclei, and pineal gland brain samples from adult C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) were obtained. For control samples, 50 μl of homogenate was incubated with 50 μl of mGBSS; for experimental samples, 50 μl of homogenate was incubated with 50 μl of 0.4 mm 5-HT HCl. Incubation was for 1 h at room temperature, protected from light. l-Cys incubation was done with 50 μl of homogenate, 25 μl of 0.8 μm 5-HT HCl, and 25 μl of 200 μm l-Cys. (For pineal and raphe nuclei, the volumes were 10 μl.) MAOa Knock-out Mouse Brain Samples—Entire brains from both MAOa knock-out (Tg8) and wild type (C3H) mice (24Cases O. Seif I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. DeMaeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) from the colony at the University of Southern California were removed, frozen immediately, and shipped on dry ice to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, for measurements; the cerebellum, cortex, striatum, and olfactory bulb were dissected and homogenized at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Homogenates were separated into 50-μl aliquots and then incubated with 50 μl of 0.2 mm 5-HT HCl for 1 h at room temperature, protected from light. (For olfactory bulb, volumes were 20 μl.) Rat PC-12 Cells—Rat PC-12 cells were cultured in 35 × 10-mm tissue culture dishes (Fisher Scientific) in RPMI 1640 medium (Cambrex, Baltimore, MD) containing 0.75% horse serum, 0.25% fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Cambrex). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-enriched, humidified atmosphere. To attain differentiation, cells were maintained in medium containing tetradecanoylphorbol-1,3-acetate or dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 2-3 days. PC-12 cell cultures were homogenized using a t-shaped glass rod. For undifferentiated cells, and those differentiated using chemicals, 6.6 μl of homogenate was incubated with 33.3 μl of 800 μm 5-HT HCl for 4 h with rotation at room temperature, protected from light. Samples were subsequently analyzed via CE-LINF. Intestinal Samples—Duodenum, jejunum, and illeum small intestinal tissues were surgically removed from decapitated C57BL/6 adult mice (Harlan) and Long Evans rats (Harlan), then rapidly transferred to chilled mGBBS. Prior to experimental sampling or treatments, tissues were cleared of contents and rinsed in fresh mGBSS. Sections were cut into equal lengths of ∼1 cm and wet weight measurements taken to normalize CE-LINF measures between experimental groups. For initial investigations, sections were incubated in experimental solutions (180 μl volume) in constant darkness for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, tissue sections were rinsed in mGBSS and homogenized (as above), unless otherwise stated. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 s. For CE-LINF measurements, supernatants were decanted and subsequently filtered using Microcon centrifugation filters (3000 Da molecular mass cut-off; Millipore). In subsequent experiments designed to search for catabolite formation, both with and without the addition of exogenous 5-HT, tissues were first homogenized and then added to an equal volume of 400 μm 5-HT HCl solution or mGBSS. These incubations occurred at room temperature, protected from light, for a period of 1, 12, and 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and frozen at -20 °C; all samples were thawed and analyzed by CE-LINF within 12 h of the end of the 24-h incubation. Isolation of 5-HITCA—Long Evans rat brain striatum homogenate (0.12-0.13 g/ml final density) was incubated with 5-HT (0.35 mm) and daidzin, an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (25Keung W.M. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2198-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (0.18 mm average concentration) for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min (8,500 × g) and the supernatant filtered through Microcon centrifugation filters (3000 Da molecular mass cut-off, Millipore). The filtrate was loaded into a small molecule trap and injected into an Aqua C18 column (2.0 × 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with 5-μm particles and 20-nm pore size. A uniform flow rate of 80 μl/min, and solvents A (100% H2O, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% acetic acid (v/v)), and B (90% acetonitrile, 10% H2O, 0.014% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.08% acetic acid (v/v)) were employed. After an isocratic separation at 0% B for 10 min, a gradient was developed as follows: 0 to 6% B over 3 min, 6 to 22% B over 23 min, and 22 to 80% B over 10 min. The eluant was split such that ∼20% of the volume was analyzed by an LCQ Deca electrospray ionization (ESI)-ion trap (IT)-MS (Thermo, San Jose, CA), whereas the remaining sample was fractionated using a Gilson FC 203B fraction collector (Gilson Inc., Middletown, WI). Fractions were analyzed using CE-LINF to locate 5-HITCA, based on migration time and fluorescence spectrum. ESI-IT-MS—The ESI-IT-MS experiments employed a spray voltage of 4.3 kV, a capillary temperature of 180 °C, a capillary voltage of 43 V, and a tube lens offset of 10 V. Sheath and auxiliary gas flows of 60 and 30 units, respectively, were utilized. Accurate Mass Measurements—A quadrupole time-of-flight-(QTOF)-MS (Micromass Q-TOF Ultima, Waters, Milford, MA), fitted with a nanoESI source, was employed. About 5 μl of 5-HITCA was loaded into a Picotip (2-μm tip diameter, New Objective, Woburn, MA). The low and high quadrupole mass resolutions were set at 10. The cone, spray, and collision voltages were 35 V, 1.2 kV, and 10 eV, respectively. Accurate masses were obtained by combining ∼50 spectra, performing Savitzky-Golay smoothing (with ±3 smoothing windows and 2 smoothing cycles), and centroiding the data using the Masslynx software (Waters, Milford, MA). For centroiding, the minimum peak width at half-height was set to two channels and the top 80% of the peak was centered using a resolution of 5,000. The Elemental Composition calculator in Masslynx was used to evaluate compositions based on the mass entered. Enzyme Inactivation—Six hemispheral cortical slices were cut from isolated brains of decapitated Long Evans rats. Samples were homogenized in 150 μl of mGBSS, with single-slice hemisphere homogenate from each animal either heated in a dry-bath incubator at 95 °C for 5 min, or treated with 33% acetonitrile, to inactivate 5-HT metabolic enzymes. Control samples were kept in mGBSS at room temperature. After cooling the heated homogenates to room temperature, 150 μl of 800 μm 5-HT HCl was added to each vial and allowed to incubate for 4 h while protected from light. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and frozen overnight for analysis the following day. Enzyme Inhibition—Cortical slices were homogenized in 0.4 ml of mGBSS and aliquoted into 11 vials with 0.02 ml of homogenate in each vial. Various concentrations, ranging from 0.01 to 5.00 μm of the following inhibitors, were added to the homogenate for preincubation: clorgyline for inhibition of MAOa, daidzin for inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), and deprenyl for inhibition of MAOb. Times for preincubation varied from 5 min to 1 h. Following preincubation with the inhibitors, 5-HT was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and incubated for 4 h at room temperature, protected from light. Samples were centrifuged and frozen until ready for analysis. All reactions were performed in mGBSS. An equimolar final concentration of indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAL) and dl-homocysteine, l-Cys, or glutathione were mixed to achieve final concentrations of ∼3 μm for each reagent. For measurement of the N-acetylcysteine reaction, ∼200 μm IAL was mixed with ∼200 μm N-acetylcysteine. Each sample was mixed by Vortex (Vortex Genie-2, VWR Scientific, Bohemia, NY). Reaction mixtures were allowed to sit a room temperature for 15 min and then analyzed via CE-LINF and MS. Mitochondria were isolated from rat brain by modification of two established procedures (26Almeida A. Medina J.M. Brain Res. 1997; 764: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 1-16Google Scholar). After separation by centrifugation, the pellets containing the mitochondrial fractions were rinsed free of EDTA and sucrose by re-suspending them in mGBSS three times after removal of the supernatant. Concentrations of homocysteine and l-Cys were then determined using the CE-LINF with on-column detection. In initial studies, 5-HITCA was synthesized enzymatically via the conversion of 5-HT to 5-HIAL. Human MAOa supersomes were obtained from GenTest (Woburn, MA). The enzyme was kept frozen at -80 °C until use, at which time it was thawed in a 37 °C water bath; 50 μl of enzyme (0.005 μg/ml) was added to pre-mixed vials of 5-HT HCl (16.7 μm to 167 mm) and l-Cys (33.3 μm to 333 mm). Incubations were performed for 2, 4, and 6 h at 37°C, protected from light. Upon completion of the incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3-6 min and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The presence of 5-HITCA was then confirmed via CE-LINF and samples were combined for isolation of the synthesized 5-HITCA by high performance liquid chromatography. All 5-HITCA was combined and concentrated via SpeedVac to ∼200 μl, separated into 50-μl aliquots, then frozen. For later studies, synthetic 5-HITCA was obtained from the National Institute of Mental Health Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program (28Jin C. Burgess J.P. Gopinathan M.B. Brine G.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006; 47: 943-946Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Purified 5-HITCA, synthesized using MAOa, was used for these experiments. One 50-μl vial was diluted with 150 μl of mGBSS. Tissue samples from mouse cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb were homogenized to a final density of 0.097 g/ml in mGBSS. Homogenate was then separated into 40-μl aliquots and either heated at 98 °C for 10 min or left at room temperature. 40 μl of 5-HITCA solution was then added to each sample and incubated at room temperature, protected from light, for 1, 12, or 24 h. Control samples contained only 5-HITCA, or homogenate and mGBSS. Immediately upon termination of incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, and kept frozen at -20 °C until thawed for analysis via CE-LINF. The Central Nervous System—The cerebellum, cortex, olfactory bulb, and in some cases, the raphe nuclei, pineal, and striatum, from rat and mouse brains were homogenized and incubated with 5-HT, resulting in the appearance of known 5-HT metabolites, including N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and 5-HIAA. A subset of these data, shown in Fig. 1, was taken from rat brain striatum. One unknown peak, identified as 5-HITCA, was observed in quantities comparable with 5-HIAA. The compound was found to form most abundantly in the cerebellum, with the amount of 5-HITCA production across the central nervous system regions studied shown in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Upon 5-HT incubation of rat central nervous system homogenate samples, 5-HITCA levels were measured across various brain regions. Levels were the highest in the cerebellum (n = 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Differentiated PC-12 Cells—As shown in Fig. 3, following incubation of differentiated PC-12 cells with 5-HT, the catabolites NAS, 5-HIAA, and 5-HITCA were observed. Control samples of non-differentiated PC-12 cells incubated with 5-HT did not form these compounds. To eliminate oxidation of 5-HT and thereby emphasize enzymatically formed compounds, antioxidants were added to some of the incubation mixtures. Formation of 5-HITCA occurred in the presence of the anti-oxidants, ascorbic acid and trolox (a water-soluble vitamin E analog). The Enteric Nervous System—Incubation experiments with 5-HT were performed using various regions of the small intestine from Long Evans rat and C57BL/6 mice. Upon incubation of intact tissues with excess 5-HT, we observed several unknown CE-LIF peaks that appeared or increased upon 5-HT incubation (see Fig. 4). In addition to these potential metabolites, the appearance of 5-HITCA and 5-HIAA (the end products of the MAO pathway) were observed in homogenized tissues treated with excess 5-HT. Jejunum samples, homogenized with mGBSS (and no exogenous 5-HT), showed formation of 5-HITCA (data not shown). The high abundance and reproducible presence of this particular unknown warranted its structural characterization. The peak, a negatively charged component at pH 8.8, was isolated by liquid chromatography. When the unknown fraction was subjected to ESI-IT-MS, a singly charged peak at m/z 279 (nominal molecular mass of 278 Da) was observed. High resolution scans showed an isotopic distribution indicative of a molecule containing a single sulfur atom. Further structural information was obtained from collisionally induced disassociation of the peak, resulting in two prominent fragment ions, m/z 134 and 148, as shown in Fig. 5A, suggesting that the compound was 5-HITCA. To confirm the characterization, the peak was analyzed by nanoESI-QTOF-MS to obtain an accurate mass for elemental composition determination. In this case, a common O-ring contaminant, a fragment of the plasticizer, di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (29Verge K.M. Agnes G.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), served as an ideal internal standard for mass calibration. The di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate contaminant was resolved from 5-HITCA (Fig. 5B), whereby the observed mass of the contaminant was 279.1665 Da, an error of +0.0069 from the predicted value of 279.1596 Da. Based on this mass shift, 5-HITCA has an accurate mass of 279.0874 - 0.0069 Da = 279.0805 Da. This confirmed the composition to be C13H15N2O3S1, representing a 0.6 ppm error from the observed value. Additionally, MS was utilized to ensure that the compound synthesized chemically and enzymatically for use in the 5-HITCA incubations studies was identical to the compound identified in biological samples as 5-HITCA.

https://openalex.org/W2058840052,"The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) tumor suppressor of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) regulates major apoptotic and growth-suppressive pathways. In APL, PML is involved in a chromosomal translocation generating the PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) fusion protein. Two missense mutations in the remaining PML alleles have been identified, which give rise to a truncated cytoplasmic PML protein (Mut PML). APL patients carrying these mutations display resistance to retinoic acid (RA) and very poor prognosis. Here we show that Mut PML associates with the cytoplasmic regions we refer to as PML-cytoplasmic bodies (PML-CBs). Mut PML interacts with PML-RARalpha in PML-CB and potentiates PML-RARalpha-mediated inhibition of RA-dependent transcription. Remarkably, Mut PML stabilizes PML-RARalpha and inhibits differentiation induced by pharmacological doses of RA. A mutant form of PML-RARalpha that accumulates in the cytoplasm inhibits RA-dependent transcription and differentiation, thus suggesting that cytoplasmic localization of PML-RARalpha may contribute to transformation. Finally, we show that the bcr3 PML-RARalpha form is predominantly cytoplasmic and accumulates in PML-CBs. Taken together, these findings reveal novel insights into the molecular mechanisms contributing to APL."

We previously showed that dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) involved in TCR-induced calcium inflow were selectively expressed in Th2 cells. In this report, we studied whether cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) activation was implicated in the regulation of DHPR-dependent calcium response and cytokine production in Th2 lymphocytes. The contribution of cGMP in Th2 signaling was supported by the following results: 1) TCR activation elicited cGMP production, which triggered calcium increase responsible for nuclear factor of activated T cell translocation and Il4 gene expression; 2) guanylate cyclase activation by nitric oxide donors increased intracellular cGMP concentration and induced calcium inflow and IL-4 production; 3) reciprocally, guanylate cyclase inhibition reduced calcium response and Th2 cytokine production associated with TCR activation. In addition, DHPR blockade abolished cGMP-induced [Ca2+]i increase, indicating that TCR-induced DHP-sensitive calcium inflow is dependent on cGMP in Th2 cells. Th2 lymphocytes from PKG1-deficient mice displayed impaired calcium signaling and IL-4 production, as did wild-type Th2 cells treated with PKG inhibitors.

For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) facilitates Gata-3-mediated chromatin remodeling at Th2 cytokine loci (11Yamashita M. Shinnakasu R.

This TCR signaling complex, called signalosome, integrates signaling pathways into transcriptional events (12Mowen K.A. Glimcher L.H. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). One of these pathways is orchestrated by the second messenger calcium. Activated phospholipase C γ1 cleaves phosphatidylinositol (4, 5)-biphosphate into inositol (1, 4, 5)-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG leads to protein kinase C and Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (13Spitaler M. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), whereas IP3 mobilizes intracellular calcium stores. Calcium mobilization is followed by a calcium inflow through calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels (reviewed in Ref. 14Winslow M.M. Neilson J.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Once dephosphorylated by calcineurin, a calcium-activated phosphatase, NFAT translocates to the nucleus and binds together with other transcription factors to target genes, including cytokine genes (discussed in Ref. 12Mowen K.A. Glimcher L.H. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Intracellular calcium concentration was reported to be higher in resting Th2 lymphocytes than in other T cell subsets. Only low calcium concentration increase was measured in activated Th2 lymphocytes (3Singh R.A. Zang Y.C. Shrivastava A. Hong J. Wang G.T. Li S. Tejada-Simon M.V. Kozovska M. Rivera V.M. Zhang J.Z. J.

All aspects of animal care were approved by our institutional review board for animal experimentation. The calcium channel antagonist R(+) Bay K 8644, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 8-bromoguanosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), and 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) were purchased from Sigma. The hamster anti-mouse TCR H57–597 mAb (27Kubo R.T. Born W. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Pigeon M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2736-2742PubMed Google Scholar) was from BD Biosciences. Nicardipine was from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). LY-83,583, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, and spermine NONOate, a nitric oxide (NO) donor, were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The inhibitors of PKG(KT5823 and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS), of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (H-89), of PDE3 (trequinsin), of PDE4 (Ro-20-1724), and of PDE5 (zaprinast) were purchased from Calbiochem and cyclosporin A from Sandoz (Rueil Malmaison, France).Th2 Cell Differentiation—CD4+ T cells from DO11.10 mice (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ATGC, Noisy Le Grand, France), 1% pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were stimulated with irradiated BALB/c spleen cells and OVA 323–339 peptide (0.3 μm). For Th2 skewing, IL-4 (10 ng/ml) + anti-interferon γ Ab (10 μg/ml) were added to the primary culture. CD4+ T cells from wild-type and PKG1–/– mice (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated on plate-bound anti-TCR (3 μg/ml) + anti-CD28 mAbs (2 μg/ml) in Th2-polarizing conditions as above. On day 3–4 after stimulation, cells were split 1:3 with fresh medium. Viable T cells were recovered on Ficoll-Hypaque and restimulated in the same conditions every 7 days for 3 weeks.To analyze cytokine production, T cells were distributed (2.5 × 104 cells/well) into 96-well flat-bottom plates containing either antigen-presenting cells (2.5 × 104 cells/well) + OVA peptide in the absence of exogenous cytokines and antibodies or plate-bound anti-TCR mAb (1 μg/ml) (28Savignac M.

Cytokine release was quantified by ELISA in supernatants collected 24 h later. cGMP intracellular concentration was determined by using ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (cGMP Enzymeimmunoassay Biotrak System; Amersham Biosciences).Analysis of Intracellular Calcium Concentration—T cells were preincubated for 12 h with or without inhibitors, washed, loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (28Savignac M.

Three-round primed Th2 cells were cultured on plate-bound anti-TCR (5 μg/ml) + anti-CD28 (3 μg/ml) mAbs in the presence or in the absence of PKG inhibitors (KT5823 or Rp-8-pCPTcGMPS). Alternatively, cells were stimulated with either spermine NONOate (1 mm) or 8-BrcGMP (200 μm) for 4 h. Cells were then collected and plated onto Lab-Tek chambers (Calbiochem). They were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Staining was performed with mouse anti-NFATc1 mAb (BD Biosciences) for 45 min. After extensive washing, NFATc1 was revealed using Alexa-488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were additionally treated with RNaseA (Sigma) for 10 min, and nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. Samples were mounted and examined with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a ×63 Plan-Apochromat objective (1.4 oil). We evaluated two parameters: the nuclear versus cytoplasmic NFAT ratio, analyzed by the ImageJ analysis software (NIH), and the percentage of cells that display NFAT nuclear translocation (defined as the frequency of cells in which nuclear/cytoplasmic NFAT ratio was superior to mean + 3 S.D. of the ratio in unstimulated cells).IL-4 mRNA Quantification—Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using poly(dT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). IL-4 and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) mRNA were measured by real-time quantitative PCR using an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. PCR was performed with the PCR SYBR Green sequence detection system (PerkinElmer). Primers for IL-4 were 5′-CGGTGAACTGAGGAAACTCTGTAG-3′ and 5′-CACGGTGCAGCTTCTCAGTG-3′ and for HPRT 5′-CTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCTCG-3′ and 5′-TGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGGGCA-3′. IL-4 mRNA was normalized to HPRT mRNA and quantified relative to mRNA expression in unstimulated Th2 cells.Flow Cytometric Analysis of IL-4 and IL-5 Intracellular Cytokine Synthesis—Th2 cells were stimulated on plate-bound anti-TCR mAb in the absence or in the presence of either nicardipine or LY-83,583 (10 μm). After 12 h of culture, cells were collected, resuspended at 106/ml, and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml, Sigma) + ionomycin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma) for 4 h. Two hours before cell harvest, 10 μg/ml of brefeldin A (Sigma) was added. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland). Intracytoplasmic staining was performed as previously described (33Openshaw P. Murphy E.E. Hosken N.A. Maino V. Davis K. Murphy K. O'Garra A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing and 10 min of incubation in saponin medium alone, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IL-4 (11B11) or anti-mouse IL-5 (TRFK5) antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed first in saponin buffer and then with phosphate-buffered saline to allow membrane closure. Data were collected on 20,000 CD4+ cells on an XL Coulter cytometer (Coultronics, Margency, France) and analyzed using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).PCR Analysis—PCR conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 21 (β actin) or 40 cycles (for PKG1). Primers for β actin were 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC and 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG and for PKG1 were 5′-ATTGTATGTACCCCGTGGAAT and 5′-TTGGTGAGTCTTCTCGGGTAA.Western Blot Analysis—5 × 106 cells were lysed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/6 ml of buffer (Roche Diagnostics), aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (1 μg/ml, each), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate sodium, and 1 mm NaF. Lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm to remove insoluble material. Protein content was measured using a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples (40 μg/lane) were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were saturated and incubated overnight with anti-PKG1α/β Ab (Santa-Cruz). Blots were developed with a rabbit anti-goat Ab and then a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab and the enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences).Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Overall differences between variables were initially shown by using a Kruskal-Wallis test and subsequently confirmed by the Mann-Whitney U test.RESULTScGMP Induces a Calcium Response, NFAT Translocation to the Nucleus, and IL4 Gene Expression in Th2 Lymphocytes—In B lymphocyte, cGMP was shown to be responsible for DHPR activation and subsequent calcium influx upon B cell receptor stimulation (21Sadighi Akha A.A. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because we have recently shown that Th2 cells expressed DHPR (18Savignac M. Gomes B. Gallard A. Narbonnet S. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Paulet P. Mariame B. Druet P. Saoudi A. Fournie G.J. Guery J.C. Pelletier L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5206-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of cGMP in TCR-induced DHP-sensitive calcium response in these cells. DO11.10 cells were differentiated along the Th2 pathway by three weekly stimulations with antigen-presenting cells loaded with the OVA 323–339 peptide in the presence of IL-4 + anti-interferon γ antibody (18Savignac M. Gomes B. Gallard A. Narbonnet S. Moreau M. Leclerc C. Paulet P. Mariame B. Druet P. Saoudi A. Fournie G.J. Guery J.C. Pelletier L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5206-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TCR stimulation for 2 (not shown) or 5 min (Fig. 1A) triggered a 2- to 4-fold increase in intracellular cGMP concentration, depending on the experiments. As assessed by microspectrofluorometry on Fura-2AM-loaded Th2 lymphocytes, cell-permeant 8-Br-cGMP promoted a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1B). Abolition of the cGMP-induced [Ca2+]i increase in the absence of extracellular calcium (not shown) or in the presence of the DHPR antagonist (nicardipine) pointed out that cGMP promoted a DHP-sensitive calcium inflow (Fig. 1B). 8-Br-cAMP, another cyclic nucleotide known to promote Th2 cytokine production, had no effect on Th2 cell calcium response (Fig. 1B).We then wondered whether the 8-BrcGMP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was sufficient to induce NFAT translocation to the nucleus. Th2 cells incubated for 4 h in the presence of 8-Br-cGMP exhibited a significant NFAT translocation as shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D). Depending on the experiments, NFAT was found to be translocated to the nucleus in 2–11% of resting Th2 lymphocytes, 30–50% of cGMP-treated cells, and 41–75% of anti-CD3 + anti-CD28-stimulated lymphocytes (not shown). Because Il4 gene expression is regulated by the calcium-dependent calcineurin pathway (9Kubo M. Kincaid R.L. Ransom J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19441-19446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed whether cGMP triggered Il4 gene expression. 8-Br-cGMP induced a strong IL-4 mRNA increase. The inhibitory effect of cyclosporin A testified to the involvement of calcium-calcineurin pathway (Fig. 1E). Contrasting with TCR-stimulated Th2 cells, IL-4 was not detected at the protein level in supernatants collected 24 h after cGMP stimulation (not shown). The lower calcium response (Fig. 1, C and D) and Il4 gene expression (Fig. 1E) induced by cGMP could account for this difference.An Inhibitor of Guanylate Cyclases, LY-83,583 Strongly Reduces Calcium Response and Type-2 Cytokine Production upon TCR Stimulation—[Ca2+]i increase induced by stimulation of Th2 lymphocytes with a combination of both anti-TCR and anti-CD28 mAbs was abolished by LY-83,583 (Fig. 2A). The calcium response was also inhibited either in the absence of extracellular calcium or in the presence of a DHPR antagonist (nicardipine) (Fig. 2A). Data were confirmed with another DHPR antagonist, R(+) BayK 8644 (not shown). Treatment of TCR-activated Th2 cells with LY-83,583 as well as nicardipine resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of IL-4 (Fig. 2B) and IL-5 (Fig. 2C) release. Intracellular IL-4 and IL-5 staining revealed that LY-83,583 and nicardipine dramatically reduced the number of IL-4- and IL-5-producing cells (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Guanylate cyclases and DHPR are involved in calcium signaling and Th2 cytokine production. A, Th2 lymphocytes were or were not treated with DHPR antagonist (nicardipine, 10 μm) or guanylate cyclase inhibitor (LY-83,583, 10 μm) overnight and were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM. Basal intracellular calcium concentration was recorded at the single cell level for ∼60 s. The arrow indicates addition of anti-TCR (1 μg/ml) + anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) mAbs. Experiments were performed in normal medium containing 0.5 mm calcium in the absence of inhibitor (medium w/o inhibitor) and in Ca2+-depleted extracellular medium ([Ca2+]ext = 0). Each curve represents the mean of 15–45 cells analyzed during one experiment and is representative of three independent experiments. B and C, Th2 cells were stimulated on plate-bound anti-TCR mAb (1 μg/ml) for 24 h with increasing concentrations of nicardipine or LY-83,583. IL-4 (B) and IL-5 (C) supernatant contents were determined by ELISA. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D., of two experiments performed in triplicate (*, p < 0.01 when compared with cells stimulated in the absence of drugs). D, Th2 lymphocytes were stimulated overnight on plate-bound anti-TCR mAb (1 μg/ml) in the absence or in the presence of either LY-83,583 (10 μm) or nicardipine (10 μm). Intracellular staining is shown of IL-4 (upper panels) and IL-5 (lower panels) in the absence (white areas) or in the presence of drugs (gray areas). One representative experiment of three is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NO Donors Generate cGMP, Increase [Ca2+]i, Induce NFAT Nuclear Translocation and IL-4 Production—The role of guanylate cyclases was further examined by using NO donors that activate soluble guanylate cyclases (34Braughler J.M. Mittal C.K. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12450-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SNP induced a 2-fold increase in intracellular cGMP concentration, in the same range as TCR stimulation did (Fig. 3A). NONOate, a more potent NO donor than SNP, induced a 10-fold increase in intracellular cGMP concentration when compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 3A). Zaprinast, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (known to specifically promote cGMP degradation), did not enhance cGMP production, indicating that cGMP degradation did not minimize cGMP production (Fig. 3A). Both NO donors, SNP and NONOate, triggered a sustained [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 3B). However, the calcium response induced by NONOate was more abrupt and higher than the one induced by SNP. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY-83,583 delayed and reduced SNP-induced calcium response (Fig. 3B). The SNP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was inhibited either in the absence of extracellular calcium or in the presence of DHPR antagonist nicardipine (Fig. 3B). SNP induced Il4 gene expression, which was abolished in the presence of cyclosporin A (Fig. 3C). We failed to detect any SNP-induced IL-4 protein secretion (not shown). According to its high potency to enhance cGMP production, NONOate induced NFAT nuclear translocation (Fig. 3D) in 60–70% of cells (not shown) and detectable IL-4 production (Fig. 3E). By contrast, the dose-dependent increase in IL-4 production triggered by NONOate was not observed in Th2 cells from PKG1–/– mice, suggesting a prominent role of PKG in mediating NONOate effect (Fig. 3E). Altogether, these data showed that guanylate cyclase activation resulted in cGMP production and a subsequent DHP-sensitive extracellular calcium inflow, responsible for IL-4 expression.FIGURE 3NO donors induce cGMP production, calcium response, and IL-4 expression in Th2 lymphocytes. A, DO11.10 Th2 cells were stimulated for 5 min either on plate-bound anti-TCR mAb (1 μg/ml), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 150 μm), or NONOate (300 μm) in the presence or in the absence of the PDE5 inhibitor zaprinast (10 μm). Cells were lysed, and intracellular cGMP content was determined by ELISA and normalized to total protein contents (*, p < 0.01 when compared with unstimulated cells). B, modulation was assessed of intracellular calcium concentration by NONOate or SNP (arrow, 300 and 150 μm, respectively) in Th2 cells pretreated or not with nicardipine or LY-83,583 (10 μm). 3 mm EGTA-containing extracellular medium was designated [Ca2+]ext = 0. Each curve represents the mean of 25–40 cells analyzed during one experiment and is representative of four independent experiments. C, Th2 cells were incubated with SNP (150 μm) for 6 h in the presence or in the absence of cyclosporin A (CsA, 0.1 μg/ml). Th2 cells stimulated on plate-bound anti-TCR mAb (1 μg/ml) were used as a positive control. IL-4 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to HPRT mRNA. Values were standardized relative to mRNA levels in unstimulated Th2 cells. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of two experiments performed in triplicate (*, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.005).

https://openalex.org/W1972326222,"Abstract Transcription of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vitamin H transporter gene VHT1 is enhanced by low extracellular biotin. Here we present the identification and characterization of Vhr1p as a transcriptional regulator of VHT1 (VHR1 (YIL056w); VHT1 regulator 1) and the identification of the cis-regulatory target sequences for Vhr1p in two yeast promoters. VHR1 was identified in a complementation screening of mutagenized yeast cells that had lost the capacity to express the gene of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the VHT1 promoter. Δvhr1 deletion mutants fail to induce VHT1 on low biotin concentrations. In yeast one-hybrid analyses performed with fusions of Vhr1p N-terminal and C-terminal fragments to the Gal4p activation domain or to the Gal4p DNA-binding domain, the Vhr1p N terminus mediated biotin-dependent DNA binding, and the Vhr1p C terminus triggered biotin-dependent transcriptional activation. The analyzed Vhr1p N-terminal fragment has previously been described as a domain of unknown function (DUF352). Deletion and linker scanning analyses of the VHT1 promoter revealed the palindromic 18-nucleotide sequence AATCA-N8-TGAYT as the vitamin H-responsive element. This sequence was identified also in the BIO5 promoter that is also transcriptionally activated on low biotin concentrations. Bio5p mediates the transport of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid across the yeast plasma membrane, a compound that is used as a precursor in biotin biosynthesis. Δvhr1 deletion mutants fail to induce BIO5 on low biotin concentrations. The presented data characterize Vhr1p as an essential component of the biotin-dependent signal transduction cascade in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2046493216,"The antibiotic avilamycin A is produced by Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57. Avilamycin belongs to the family of orthosomycins with a linear heptasaccharide chain linked to a terminal dichloroisoeverninic acid as aglycone. The gene cluster for avilamycin biosynthesis contains 54 open reading frames. Inactivation of one of these genes, namely aviX12, led to the formation of a novel avilamycin derivative named gavibamycin N1. The structure of the new metabolite was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR analysis. It harbors glucose as a component of the heptasaccharide chain instead of a mannose moiety in avilamycin A. Antibacterial activity tests against a spectrum of Gram-positive organisms showed that the new derivative possesses drastically decreased biological activity in comparison to avilamycin A. Thus, AviX12 seems to be implicated in converting avilamycin to its bioactive conformation by catalyzing an unusual epimerization reaction. Sequence comparisons grouped AviX12 in the radical S-adenosylmethionine protein family. AviX12 engineered with a His tag was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The iron sulfur cluster [Fe-S] present in radical AdoMet enzymes was detected in purified AviX12 by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Avilamycins are oligosaccharide antibiotics isolated from Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57. Along with everninomycins, curamycins, and flambamycins, they belong to the orthosomycin group of antibiotics (1Wright E.D. Tetrahedron. 1979; 35: 1207-1237Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Structural features of the avilamycins are a terminal dichloroisoeverninic acid moiety (Fig. 1, residue A) and a heptasaccharide chain consisting of d-olivose (residues B and C), 2-deoxy-d-evalose (residue D), 4-O-methyl-d-fucose (residue E), 2,6-di-O-methyl-d-mannose (residue F), l-lyxose (residue G), and eurekanate (residue H). Avilamycin A, the main compound produced by S. viridochromogenes Tü57, was shown to be active against many Gram-positive bacteria, including emerging problem organisms, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci (2Weitnauer G. Hauser G. Hofmann C. Linder U. Boll R. Pelz K. Glaser S.J. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Evernimicin (Ziracin), which is structurally very similar to avilamycin, was under investigation for approval by Schering-Plough. Due to side effects and its poor water solubility, further development was stopped in 2000 (2Weitnauer G. Hauser G. Hofmann C. Linder U. Boll R. Pelz K. Glaser S.J. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both avilamycin and evernimicin were shown to inhibit protein biosynthesis by binding to the 50 S ribosomal subunit of the bacterial ribosomes (4Belova L. Tenson T. Xiong L. McNicholas P.M.

Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that methylation of G2535 and U2479 in domain V of the 23 S rRNA confers resistance to avilamycin by preventing the antibiotic from binding to the ribosome (7Treede I. Jakobsen L. Kirpekar F. Vester B. Weitnauer G. Bechthold A. Douthwaite S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was in accordance with results obtained by footprinting avilamycin on Escherichia coli ribosomal subunits (8Kofoed C.B. Vester B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3339-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it is suggested that avilamycin interacts with the ribosomal A site and interferes with initiation factor IF2 and tRNA binding. The complete avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster containing 54 open reading frames was sequenced (9Weitnauer G. Mühlenweg A. Trefzer A. Hoffmeister D. Süssmuth R.D. Jung G. Welzel K. Vente A. Girreser U. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The corresponding genes were named avi. Based upon sequence similarities of the deduced proteins to enzymes of known function in the data base, a putative biosynthetic pathway for avilamycin has been proposed (9Weitnauer G. Mühlenweg A. Trefzer A. Hoffmeister D. Süssmuth R.D. Jung G. Welzel K. Vente A. Girreser U. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Gene disruption experiments with putative methyltransferase genes have led to new avilamycin derivatives with enhanced water solubility, named gavibamycins (2Weitnauer G. Hauser G. Hofmann C. Linder U. Boll R. Pelz K. Glaser S.J. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After deletion of aviB1 and aviO2, components of an incomplete pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex, an avilamycin derivative was obtained lacking the terminal acetyl residue at position C-4 of the eurekanate moiety of avilamycin A (10Treede I. Hauser G. Muhlenweg A. Hofmann C. Schmidt M. Weitnauer G. Glaser S. Bechthold A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is most likely that the biosynthesis of avilamycin starts with the formation of the unusual pentose l-lyxose. The next plausible steps toward formation of the heptasaccharide chain might be the unusual C1-C1 linkage between lyxose and mannose and subsequently the attachment of the eurekanate to the l-lyxose moiety. A knock-out mutation in aviE2, the gene encoding a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase involved in the biosynthesis of lyxose from glucose, led to the breakdown of avilamycin A biosynthesis, confirming the presumption of the start of avilamycin biosynthesis in the coupling of lyxose and mannose (11Hofmann C.

Inactivation of aviGT4, a putative glycosyltransferase, led to the formation of a new avilamycin derivative lacking the terminal eurekanate residue (11Hofmann C. Boll R. Heitmann B. Hauser G. Duerr C. Frerich A. Weitnauer G. Glaser S.J. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There still are genes with unknown function in the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster. One of these genes is aviX12, positioned in the center of the avilamycin biosynthetic gene cluster in proximity to methyltransferase and sugar biosynthetic genes (9Weitnauer G. Mühlenweg A. Trefzer A. Hoffmeister D. Süssmuth R.D. Jung G. Welzel K. Vente A. Girreser U. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). AviX12 shows no significant similarities to proteins of known function, but it contains a sequence motif typical for the radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; DTT, dithiothreitol; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; mT, millitesla(s). protein family. Members of this family are among others involved in oxidative processes and making AviX12 a good candidate for oxidative reactions in the avilamycin biosynthesis, such as the building of the methylene bridge at the terminal eurekanate moiety or the orthoester linkages. To gain insight into the function of AviX12, aviX12 was inactivated, and the structure of a new avilamycin derivative that accumulated in this mutant was determined. Our results indicated the involvement of AviX12 in the formation of the biologically active conformation of avilamycin A by catalyzing an unusual epimerization reaction. Furthermore, aviX12 was modified with a His tag and overexpressed in E. coli. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography, and the bound [Fe-S] cluster was characterized by means of EPR spectroscopy. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—DNA manipulation was carried out using E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF (Stratagene) as the host strain. Before transforming S. viridochromogenes strains, plasmids were propagated in E. coli ET 12567 (dam–, dcm–, hsdS, CmR) (12MacNeil D.J. Gewain K.M. Ruby C.L. Dezeny G. Gibbons P.H. MacNeil T. Gene. 1992; 111: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) to obtain unmethylated DNA. E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS (Stratagene) was used for heterologous protein expression experiment. E. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or liquid medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. S. viridochromogenes GW4 is a derivative of S. viridochromogenes Tü57, deficient in aviG4, a methyltransferase gene, leading to the production of gavibamycin A1 with a free phenolic hydroxy group (9Weitnauer G. Mühlenweg A. Trefzer A. Hoffmeister D. Süssmuth R.D. Jung G. Welzel K. Vente A. Girreser U. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Plasmids pBluescript SK– (pBSK–) (Stratagene) and pUC18 (New England Biolabs) were used for cloning. Plasmid pSP1 (13Pelzer S. Reichert W. Huppert M. Heckmann D. Wohlleben W. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 56: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), conferring erythromycin resistance, was a kind gift of Dr. S. Pelzer (Combinature-Biopharm AG, Berlin, Germany), and pSET152 (14Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Gene. 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), conferring apramycin resistance, was obtained from Eli Lilly & Co. (Indianapolis, IN). The construction of pSET-1cerm has been described elsewhere (15Hoffmeister D. Ichinose K. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). General Genetic Manipulation, PCR, and Sequence Analysis—Routine methods were performed as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Isolation of E. coli plasmid DNA, DNA restriction, DNA modification, and Southern hybridization were performed following the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Biosciences, Roche Diagnostics, Promega, and Stratagene). Streptomyces protoplast formation, transformation, and protoplast regeneration were performed as described previously (17Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces, A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotide primers were purchased at Qiagen-Operon GmbH. Computer-aided sequence analysis was done with the DNAsis software package (version 2.1, 1995; Hitachi Software Engineering). Data base searches were performed with the BLAST 2.0 program (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.H. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) on the server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD. Gene Inactivation of aviX12—AviX12 was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-CTACCTGGAATTCCTGCTGACC-3′ (aviX12F) and 5′-CAGCGCCGTCTAGAATCCGTAG-3′ (aviX12R) containing engineered EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The resulting fragment was isolated with the Nucleospin® Extract kit (Macherey Nagel), digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and ligated into pUC18 previously digested with the same enzymes, generating plasmid pUC-aviX12. The product was confirmed by DNA sequencing (4base lab GmbH). A unique SacII restriction site was altered by SacII restriction, subsequent treatment with T4 DNA polymerase, and religation. DNA sequencing confirmed the expected 2-bp deletion in aviX12, leading to frameshift mutation. After restriction with EcoRI and XbaI, the insert was transferred to plasmid pSP1 to generate IKX12. The inactivation construct was used to transform protoplasts of S. viridochromogenes GW4. Transformants were propagated in HA medium without erythromycin selection for 16 generations. Selection of erythromycin-sensitive colonies gave the double crossover mutant S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12. The deletion within the gene was confirmed by PCR. PCR fragments obtained from mutant S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12 using primers 5′-GCGCGAGCCGGAGAAGCCGGAGA-3′ (aviX12P-F) and 5′-TCTTGCGCAGCCCCTCGGCAACCA-3′ (aviX12P-R) could not be cleaved by SacII (Fig. 2a), whereas the PCR fragment obtained from S. viridochromogenes GW4 could be digested by SacII. Southern Hybridization—For Southern hybridization, genomic DNA from mutant and wild-type strains was completely digested with SacII, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences). The probe was a 1302-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment from IKX12 labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by the random priming method. Hybridization of the probe with DNA fragments on the nylon membrane was detected by the chromogenic method using procedures described by Roche Diagnostics. Complementation of Mutant S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12—To determine clearly that the mutation event affected only the desired gene and not other genes, aviX12 was ligated behind the ermE* promoter of pSET-1cerm, and the resulting complementation construct pSETerm-aviX12 was introduced by protoplast transformation into the ΔaviX12 mutant. The complementation led to restored gavibamycin production. Construction of pRSET-X12 Expressing AviX12—The aviX12 gene was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-AGCCGGAGCTGCAGGCCATATGACCCAG-3′ (X12ProtF) and 5′-CGTCTCGAATTCGTAGGTCTTGCGCAG-3′ (X12ProtR) containing engineered PstI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The product was isolated with the Nucleospin® Extract kit (Macherey Nagel), digested with PstI and EcoRI, and ligated into the T7 expression vector pRSETb (Invitrogen) previously digested with the same enzymes. The product pRSET-X12 was confirmed by DNA sequencing (4base lab). Expression and Purification of AviX12 (N-terminal His6-tagged)—For purification of expressed protein, E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene), carrying either pRSET-X12 with aviX12 or the pRSETb vector alone, were grown in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an A600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C. The cell pellet from the 100-ml culture was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The cells were broken by a single pass through a French pressure cell (Thermo Spectronic) at 700 pounds/square inch. After centrifugation, the supernatant fraction was used for the purification procedure. Protein was bound to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and loaded onto a column. The column was washed twice with washing buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 5 mm DTT. The protein was recovered with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 5 mm DTT). The imidazole was removed by passing the protein over a PD-10 (Sephadex™ G-25; Amersham Biosciences) desalting column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm DTT. Expression and purification of AviX12 was monitored by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel and 12% resolving gel) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The concentration of purified protein was estimated by the Bradford dye binding method (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the purified protein was determined by means of liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-MS. Isolation of Avilamycin Derivatives—Strains were grown in SG medium containing 2% glucose, 1% soy peptone, 0.1% CaCO3, 20 mm l-valine, and 1 ml of 0.1% CoCl2 solution for 72 h at 28 °C. Cultures were filtered, and the filtrate was extracted twice by ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness. The mycelium was broken with acetone and filtered again. After evaporation of the acetone, the mycelium was also extracted with ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness. Crude extracts from the filtrate and mycelium were combined and applied to a solid-phase extraction cartridge (SepPak C18; Waters Associates). The cartridge was eluted with 50 and 80% methanol. The 80% fraction contained ∼90% of the avilamycin derivatives. The evaporated and lyophilized fractions were redissolved in acetonitrile and water. Further isolation was performed on an Agilent 1100 system using a semipreparative column (Zorbax SB-C18; 5 μm, 9.4 μm × 150 mm). For elution, the following gradient profile was used: solvent A, 5 mm ammonium acetate in water; solvent B, acetonitrile, nonlinear gradient, 30–50% of B within 20 min at a flow rate of 3.5 ml/min. A mass-based fraction collector was used to isolate the avilamycin derivatives. The final isolation step was performed using a gel permeation column (Plgel, 5 μm; 100 Å, 300 × 7.5 μm; molecular weight < 4000). As the solvent, acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used. Again, a mass-based fraction collector was used to isolate the avilamycin derivatives. Biological Properties—The antimicrobial activity of the new derivative was determined by agar plate diffusion assay using Bacillus subtilis as the test strain. Susceptibility of staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci to different derivatives was determined by the microdilution test according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. Vancomycin was used as a standard to ensure the reliability of the determined minimum inhibitory concentrations. Structural Characterization of the New Gavibamycin Derivative Accumulated by S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12—High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrospray ionization-MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series system with an electrospray chamber and a quadrupole detector. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Zorbax SB-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm; Agilent) with a Zorbax SB-C18 precolumn (5 μm, 4.6 × 12.5 mm; Agilent). A nonlinear gradient from 20 to 70% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid over 22 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used. The column temperature was 23 °C, and the UV detection wavelengths were 254 and 300 nm. The chamber settings were drying gas flow, 12 liters/min; nebulization pressure, 50 pounds/square inch on the gauge; and drying gas temperature, 300 °C. The samples were analyzed in positive and negative scan mode with a mass range of 700–1500 Da. NMR analysis spectra were recorded on samples dissolved in 330 μl of Me2SO-d6 in SHIGEMI® NMR (Tokyo, Japan) tubes at a temperature of 295 K on a Bruker DMX 750-MHz NMR spectrometer of the Bavaria NMR Center in Garching, Germany. The following spectra have been used for the structure elucidation: 13C-1D, 13C-filtered nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (20Otting G. Senn H. Wagner G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 70: 500-505Google Scholar), correlated spectroscopy (21Rance M. Soerensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), heteronuclear single quantum coherence (22Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), and heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (23Summers M.F. Marzilli L.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4285-4294Crossref Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The spectra were analyzed using XWINNMR version 3.6 (Bruker) and SPARKY version 3. 3T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, personal communication. Spectroscopic Procedures—For UV-visible spectroscopy, A TIDAS-UVI/1001–1 diode array spectrometer with 512 diodes (J & M Analytische Mess-μ. Regeltechnik, EmbH, Aalen, Germany) was used for UV-visible spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded in the range from 200 to 600 nm in a buffer of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm DTT. The spectrum of a 1-ml aliquot of the preparation, as isolated, corresponded to the spectrum of the oxidized protein. The sample was mixed in a stirred optical cell with a few grains of sodium dithionite at room temperature while spectra were continuously recorded every 2 s. When there was no more spectral shift, the spectrum corresponded to the spectrum of the reduced protein. Spectra were processed using the Spectrachrom software package (J & M, Aalen, Germany). For EPR spectroscopy, the EPR spectra of the air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced preparation were recorded with an X-band spectrometer EMX 6/1 (Bruker) equipped with a helium flow cryostat (Oxford). Spectra were recorded at a 9.46-GHz microwave frequency, a modulation amplitude of 0.6 mT, time constant of 0.164 s, and scan rate of 17.9 mT/min. The optimal signal was measured at a temperature of 10 K and 1 milliwatt of microwave power. Computer simulations of the spectra were performed using the program SimFonia (Bruker), assuming no hyperfine interaction and gaussian line shape. Calculation of the Avilamycin Conformation—Possible conformers of avilamycin were identified in a two-step molecular modeling process. A low energy conformation was constructed and optimized within the ArgusLab program package (25Thompson M.A. Zerner M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 8210-8215Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 26Thompson M.A. Glendening D. Feller D.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 10465-10476Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) using a classical unified force field (27Casewit C.J. Colwell K.S. Rappé A.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10035-10046Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the relaxed molecule (by visual inspection), five C–O single bonds were identified that permit rotations of major fragments of the molecule around in steps of 120 degrees. The corresponding 35 = 743 rotamers have been generated and checked for a significant atomic overlap using the repulsive part of the Lennard-Jones potential applying standard van der Waals radii. The geometry of each of the conformers has been optimized by a combination of Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno and steepest descent techniques. The energy at the nine conformational minima has again been calculated using the unified force field referenced above. GenBank™ Accession Number—The GenBank™ accession number for the DNA sequence reported in this paper is AAK83189.1. Inactivation of aviX12—The inactivation of aviX12 was achieved by insertion of a frameshift mutation at a singular SacII restriction site central in aviX12 (Fig. 2a). As the wild-type strain for the inactivation experiment, S. viridochromogenes GW4 was chosen, a mutant carrying a deletion in the methyltransferase gene aviG4 leading to the production of gavibamycin A1 and A3 (Fig. 1). Protoplasts of S. viridochromogenes GW4 transformed with inactivation construct IKX12 were screened for a erythromycin-resistant phenotype. The strains selected were propagated without erythromycin selection. Two erythromycin-sensitive strains were examined by PCR; one of these proved the deletion of aviX12. This was verified by Southern hybridization (Fig. 2b). The mutant strain was designated S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12. HPLC analysis showed the production of new avilamycin derivatives in comparison to the wild-type strain. Identification of New Avilamycin Derivatives in S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12—For analysis of secondary metabolite formation, both wild type and the ΔaviX12 mutant were cultivated in production medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ethyl acetate extracts of the culture supernatants were analyzed by HPLC-UV and HPLC/electrospray ionization-MS. Gavibamycin A1 (1388 atomic mass units) and gavibamycin A3 (1390 u) were detected in extract of S. viridochromogenes GW4. In contrast, the ΔaviX12 mutant accumulated four new compounds with atomic mass units of 1376, 1374 (main compound), 1332, and 1262, respectively. The mass of the main compounds indicate the loss of a methyl group in comparison to the main compounds of the wild-type gavibamycin A1 (1388 atomic mass units) and gavibamycin A3 (1390 atomic mass units). The new compounds were named gavibamycin N1 (1374 atomic mass units) and gavibamycin N3 (1376 atomic mass units). The other two compounds could be related to a derivative missing in addition to the methyl group, the acetate moiety at the eurekanate (1332 atomic mass units), and a derivative missing additionally the isobutyryl group at the lyxose moiety (1262 atomic mass units), respectively. Structure Elucidation of the Gavibamycin A1 and A3 Derivatives—To elucidate the structure of the main compound of mutant S. viridochromogenes GW4-X12, this product was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The NMR analysis of the mutants in this study is based on the completed 1H and 13C resonance assignment of avilamycin A and avilamycin C (2Weitnauer G.

The samples under investigation were prepared by feeding the bacteria 13C-labeled l-methionine resulting in a partial 13C-labeling of the products. For gavibamycin N1, carbons C-27, C-34, C-43, and C-61 showed enhanced signal intensities because of the labeling (the nomenclature is given in Fig. 1). The unambiguous identification of these carbons was done by the analysis of the 13C-filtered nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy and the heteronuclear multiple bond coherence spectra. In Fig. 3, the resonances of atoms in the vicinity of C-37 (C-2 position in ring F) are shown in a section of the heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra of gavibamycin N1 and avilamycin A. In comparison to avilamycin A, two methyl groups (C-7 and C-41) are missing in gavibamycin N1. Surprisingly, this is the same labeling pattern found in gavibamycin I1 (2Weitnauer G. Hauser G. Hofmann C. Linder U. Boll R. Pelz K. Glaser S.J. Bechthold A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1403-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of the fact that it is very unlikely for an organism to have two enzymes with the same function, a further structural analysis was carried out. Careful HPLC-UV analysis revealed that both compounds showed different retention times under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a first step, all 1H and 13C chemical shifts of gavibamycins I1 and N1 were compared. No significant difference was observed, except for the atoms in the vicinity of C-37. In a second step, the 3JH,H couplings, which are directly linked to the dihedral angle of two hydrogens by the Karplus equation, were analyzed at the site of C-37. For the pair H-36/H-37 (the hydrogens bound to carbons C-36 and C-37, respectively) a 3J coupling of 8 ± 0.5 Hz was found for gavibamycin N1. This value is characteristic for an axial/axial orientation of H-36 and H-37 with respect to the ring. In contrast, for avilamycin A, a value of 3.5 ± 0.5 Hz was found for the 3JH-36,H-37 coupling, corresponding to an axial/equatorial orientation. This result indicated that a glucose is incorporated in gavibamycin N1 instead of a mannose in wild-type gavibamycin A1. Similar studies were carried out on the X12 mutation derivative with a molecular weight of 1332 atomic mass units. The conformation of H-36/H-37 was found to be axial/axial as for gavibamycin N1. Compared with gavibamycin N1 and avilamycin A, this compound is lacking the acetyl moiety in ring H, which is replaced by a hydrogen. This result is analogous to the changes reported for the mutations ITB1 and ITO2 (10Treede I. Hauser G. Muhlenweg A. Hofmann C. Schmidt M. Weitnauer G. Glaser S. Bechthold A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 400-406Crossr"
https://openalex.org/W1994863671,"Caldesmon is a component of smooth muscle thin filaments that inhibits the actomyosin ATPase via its interaction with actin-tropomyosin. We have performed a comprehensive transient kinetic characterization of the actomyosin ATPase in the presence of smooth muscle caldesmon and tropomyosin. At physiological ratios of caldesmon to actin (1 caldesmon/7 actin monomers) actomyosin ATPase is inhibited by about 75%. Inhibitory caldesmon concentrations had little effect upon the rate of S1 binding to actin, actin-S1 dissociation by ATP, and dissociation of ADP from actin-S1 x ADP; however the rate of phosphate release from the actin-S1 x ADP x P(i) complex was decreased by more than 80%. In addition the transient of phosphate release displayed a lag of up to 200 ms. The presence of a lag phase indicates that a step on the pathway prior to phosphate release has become rate-limiting. Premixing the actin-tropomyosin filaments with myosin heads resulted in the disappearance of the lag phase. We conclude that caldesmon inhibition of the rate of phosphate release is caused by the thin filament being switched by caldesmon to an inactive state. The active and inactive states correspond to the open and closed states observed in skeletal muscle thin filaments with no evidence for the existence of a third, blocked state. Taken together these data suggest that at physiological concentrations, caldesmon controls the isomerization of the weak binding complex to the strong binding complex, and this causes the inhibition of the rate of phosphate release. This inhibition is sufficient to account for the inhibition of the steady state actomyosin ATPase by caldesmon and tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W2120235466,"Transhydrogenase couples proton translocation across a membrane to hydride transfer between NADH and NADP+. Previous x-ray structures of complexes of the nucleotide-binding components of transhydrogenase (“dI2dIII1” complexes) indicate that the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH can move from a distal position relative to the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ to a proximal position. The movement might be responsible for gating hydride transfer during proton translocation. We have mutated three invariant amino acids, Arg-127, Asp-135, and Ser-138, in the NAD(H)-binding site of Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase. In each mutant, turnover by the intact enzyme is strongly inhibited. Stopped-flow experiments using dI2dIII1 complexes show that inhibition results from a block in the steps associated with hydride transfer. Mutation of Asp-135 and Ser-138 had no effect on the binding affinity of either NAD+ or NADH, but mutation of Arg-127 led to much weaker binding of NADH and slightly weaker binding of NAD+. X-ray structures of dI2dIII1 complexes carrying the mutations showed that their effects were restricted to the locality of the bound NAD(H). The results are consistent with the suggestion that in wild-type protein movement of the Arg-127 side chain, and its hydrogen bonding to Asp-135 and Ser-138, stabilizes the dihydronicotinamide of NADH in the proximal position for hydride transfer.

The transport of substances by proteins across membranes is important in many biological processes. In some cases the transport reaction is energetically coupled to a chemical transformation step. The coupling mechanism may involve large conformational changes within the transport protein (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar, 2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2003; 296: 1091-1098Crossref Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Sugita Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but how the transport and the chemical transformation reactions reversibly propagate the conformational change in individual proteins is the subject of intensive research. Transhydrogenase is found in the inner membranes of animal mitochondria and the cytoplasmic membranes of bacteria. It couples the transport of protons to the redox (hydride transfer) reaction between NAD(H) and NADP(H) as shown in Reaction 1. NADH+NADP++Hout+⇔NAD++NADPH+Hin+(Eq. 1) Under most physiological conditions, transhydrogenase is driven toward the reduction of NADP+ by NADH through the utilization of a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient (Δp) generated by the respiratory (or sometimes photosynthetic) electron transport chain. In different cells and tissues, the enzyme is responsible for producing the NADPH needed for either biosynthesis or glutathione reduction (4Ambartsoumian G. Dari R. Lin R.T. Newman E.B.

Acting together with the isocitrate dehydrogenases, transhydrogenase may also participate in the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (7Sazanov L.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A schematic of intact transhydrogenase is shown in Fig. 1. The dI 3The abbreviations used are: dI, the NAD(H)-binding component of transhydrogenase; Nic+, nicotinamide (oxidized form); AcPdAD+, acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form); dIII, the NADP(H)-binding component; dII, the membrane-spanning component; dI.R127A, dI protein in which Arg-127 is replaced with Ala, etc.; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; NAD(H), indicates both NAD+ and NADH etc. 3The abbreviations used are: dI, the NAD(H)-binding component of transhydrogenase; Nic+, nicotinamide (oxidized form); AcPdAD+, acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form); dIII, the NADP(H)-binding component; dII, the membrane-spanning component; dI.R127A, dI protein in which Arg-127 is replaced with Ala, etc.; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; NAD(H), indicates both NAD+ and NADH etc., component of the enzyme binds NADH; dIII binds NADP+, and dII spans the membrane. Intact transhydrogenase is a “dimer” of two dI-dII-dIII “monomers” (although there is variability in the polypeptide organization in different species). A hydride transfer site is located at the interface between dI and dIII of each monomer, some distance (>30 Å) from the proton translocation pathway through dII. It is thought that protonation/deprotonation reactions associated with translocation shift the enzyme monomers alternately between a conformation in which hydride transfer is blocked and one in which hydride transfer is allowed. A switch in proton access to the translocation machinery from one side of the membrane to the other is effected by conformational changes linked to the redox state of the bound NADP(H) (8Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Jackson J.B. White S.A. Brondijk T.H.C. Wikstrom M. Biophysical and Structural Aspects of Bioenergetics.

Tornroth S. Okvist M. Karlsson B.G. Rydstrom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Experiments showed that hydride transfer between the two nucleotides bound to transhydrogenase is direct and does not involve any intermediate redox steps (26Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27535-27538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of the dI2dIII1 complex indicate that conformational changes can occur in NAD(H) and the NAD(H)-binding pocket in the hydride transfer site (18Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Mather O.M. van Boxel G.I. White S.A. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10952-10964Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the different nucleotide conformations, the adenosine moiety of the nucleotide remains relatively fixed in its binding pocket, but the Nic(H) ring occupies different positions because of bond rotations in the linking pyrophosphate and ribose groups. In the “proximal” position, the NicH ring of NADH can align with the Nic+ of NADP+ to effect rapid, direct hydride transfer between the respective C-4(N) atoms. However in the “distal” position, the Nic+ and NicH rings are too far apart for hydride transfer. It was proposed that the change in conformation of the NAD(H) is important in gating the hydride transfer reaction during coupling to proton translocation. Charged and polar side chains of amino acid residues close to the Nic(H) rings appear to participate in the reaction in ways that are not yet clear. The invariant Arg-127 in the “RQD loop” (residues 126-136) 4Amino acid sequences are given with respect to the isolated dI and dIII proteins of R. rubrum transhydrogenase, as described (18Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 4Amino acid sequences are given with respect to the isolated dI and dIII proteins of R. rubrum transhydrogenase, as described (18Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). of R. rubrum dI is of particular interest because, in different x-ray structures, the orientation of its side chain changes in parallel with alterations in the position of the Nic(H) ring of bound NAD(H). These concerted movements affect sets of H-bond and van der Waals interactions between the arginine side chain, the nucleotide, and the side chains of other conserved amino acid residues at the hydride transfer site. Notable among these is the invariant Asp-135, which also contacts the Nic(H) ring in some structures, and which can interact with the invariant Ser-138. Asp-135 can also form an H-bond with invariant Gln-132; this residue can also interact with the Nic(H) ring of NAD(H) and also with the 2′-OH group of the Nic-ribose of the NADP(H) bound to dIII. The x-ray structures indicate that the side chain of Gln-132 may undergo changes in configuration, and mutation of this residue was found to inhibit hydride transfer (27van Boxel G.I. Quirk P. Cotton N.J.P. White S.A. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The emerging picture is of critical, local conformational changes at the hydride transfer site that are primary events in the reception/generation of the long distance conformational changes that couple the redox reaction to proton translocation (9Jackson J.B. White S.A. Brondijk T.H.C. Wikstrom M. Biophysical and Structural Aspects of Bioenergetics. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge2005: 376-393Google Scholar). In this study we describe the effects of mutating Arg-127, Asp-135, and Ser-138 on nucleotide binding affinity, the kinetics of hydride transfer, and the x-ray structure of the dI2dIII1 complexes. It is concluded that these amino acid residues have an important role in correctly positioning the Nic(H) ring of NAD(H) for hydride transfer. Recombinant dI, its mutant, dI.Q132N, dIII, and its mutant, dIII.E155W, from R. rubrum transhydrogenase were expressed from the plasmids pCD1 (28Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M.

The proteins were purified from the harvested cells by column chromatography and stored, as described in the earlier reports. The plasmid, pCD1, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene Quikchange kit and DNA primers supplied by AltaBioscience. The resulting new plasmids pGVB3, pGVB4, pGVB2, and pHB25 encoded dI.R127A, dI.R127M, dI.D135N, and dI.S138A, respectively. The DNA of all plasmids was sequenced to confirm there were no errors introduced by the PCR. The plasmids were then used to transform cells of E. coli C600. The cells were grown and induced, and the dI proteins were purified and stored, as described for wild-type and for dI.Q132N. Because the mutant proteins were inactive (see “Results”), fractions were selected during column chromatography by analysis using SDS-PAGE; the enriched fractions were easily detectable from the intense, stained band (PAGE Blue-83, Fluka) at ∼40 kDa. Typically, 100-200 mg of pure protein were obtained from 3.0 liters of bacterial culture. Protein concentration was determined by the microtannin procedure (31Mejbaum-Katzenellenb S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and is expressed as dI monomers unless otherwise stated. Before use, the dI proteins were thawed on ice and either used directly or concentrated in Vivaspin centrifugal filters (10-kDa cutoff). Similarly thawed dIII proteins were used directly or were concentrated in 5-kDa cut-off filters, and if indicated, they were treated completely to oxidize their bound nucleotide or to replace it with NADPH (13Venning J.D.

The cells were harvested, washed, and then disrupted in a French press in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (w/v) sucrose (chromatophore buffer). Everted membrane vesicles (chromatophores) were separated by differential centrifugation. The vesicles were diluted into chromatophore buffer and washed repeatedly by centrifugation until their transhydrogenation activity was lowered by >90%. This procedure removes the dI polypeptide of the transhydrogenase. The vesicles were stored at -20 ° in chromatophore buffer containing 50% (w/v) glycerol. The bacteriochlorophyll concentration of the vesicles was measured using the in vivo extinction coefficient of 140 mm-1 cm-1 at 880 nm (33Clayton R.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Steady-state transhydrogenation was measured (in the reverse direction, see Reaction 1) as the reduction of AcPdAD+ (an analogue of NAD+) by NADPH at 375 nm (ϵ = 6.1 mm-1 cm-1) on a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer. “Cyclic transhydrogenation” was measured as the reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADH in the presence of bound NADP+/NADPH. Binding affinities between dI and dIII and between dI and NADH were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (16Venning J.D. Rodrigues D.J. Weston C.J. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Errington N.

Before use, purified proteins were dialyzed for 3 h against 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 ° and then concentrated by filtration (see above). The binding of NADH to dI proteins was followed by the fluorescence change of Trp-72 at 310 nm with 280 nm excitation on a Spex Fluoromax with 4 nm slits (28Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow absorbance and fluorescence changes were recorded on an Applied Photophysics DX-17MV. The mixing dead time of the instrument was 1.31 ms (26Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27535-27538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reduction of AcPdAD+by NADPH was measured in absorbance mode at 375 nm (5 nm slits, 2 mm optical path length) during stopped-flow after 1:1 mixing. [4S-2H]NADPH (formerly described as [4B-2H]NADPH) was freshly prepared using 98% deuterated glucose (Aldrich), hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and was purified, as described (34Bizouarn T.

Biochem. 1972; 48: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed in parallel with [4S-1H]NADPH that was freshly prepared (with undeuterated glucose) and purified in the same way. The reduction of NADP+by NADH was measured by following the Trp fluorescence change in dI2(dIII.E155W)1 complexes on the DX-17MV. The excitation light was at 280 nm (selected with the instrument's monochromator, 9.3 nm slits), and the emission was collected through a WG305 cut-off filter. Previous experiments have shown that fluorescence changes from Trp-155 in dIII.E155W are dominant under these conditions; changes from nucleotides and from Trp-72 in dI are insignificant (36Venning J.D.

The (dI.S138A)2dIII1 complexes were crystallized from 22 to 24% 8K-PEG, 60-140 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100 mm Mes, pH 6.0 and 10% glycerol in the presence of 50 mm NADH and 5 mm NADPH. Crystals were ∼100 × 100 × 200 μm and took 4 days to reach full size. Complete data sets for all mutant complexes were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. For (dI.R127A)2dIII1 and (dI.S138A)2dIII1, data were collected to 2.6 and 3.2 Å, respectively, on beamline ID14.4, and for (dI.D135N)2(dIII.E155W)1 data were collected to 2.3 Å on beamline ID 14.2. The data were integrated and scaled using the programs MOSFLM (37Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCCP4 and ESF-EADBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 226Google Scholar), XDS (38Kabsch W. J. Appl.

The (dI.R127A)2dIII1 crystals had different cell dimensions to those of wild type, and initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (40Kissinger C.R. Gelhaar D.K.

The (dI.D135N)2(dIII.E155W)1 and (dI.S138A)2dIII1 crystals were isomorphous with wild-type dI2dIII1 complexes. Initially the wild-type structure was refined against the structure-factor amplitudes of the mutant crystals using rigid-body refinement in the program REFMAC5 (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

All the mutant dI proteins were produced at high levels in appropriately induced cells of E. coli, and they displayed similar elution profiles to wild-type dI during purification by column chromatography. The dI component of transhydrogenase can be removed from everted membrane vesicles of R. rubrum by repeated centrifugation washing (32Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Fisher R.R. Guillory R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separated supernatant and membrane fractions are devoid of transhydrogenase activity, but addition of either native or recombinant wild-type dI to the depleted membranes leads to complete recovery (28Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). None of the mutant dI proteins gave a significant increase in the transhydrogenation rate upon addition to dI-depleted membranes. When transhydrogenation was partially restored to depleted membranes with a low concentration of wild-type dI, the subsequent addition of any of the mutant proteins led to inhibition. Fig. 2A shows illustrative data for dI.D135N; data for other mutants are shown in supplemental Figs. S1A and S2A. These results indicate that the dI mutants can bind to exposed dII/dIII sites on the cytoplasmic face of the bacterial membranes but that these amino acid substitutions compromise the activity of the resultant enzyme. In dI2dIII1 complexes, the steady-state rates of forward and reverse transhydrogenation are extremely slow and therefore difficult to measure accurately; they are profoundly limited by the rates of product NADPH (or NADP+) release (12Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, steady-state “cyclic” transhydrogenation catalyzed by complexes made from wild-type dI and dIII is fast. The cyclic reaction involves reduction of NADP+ by NADH, followed by oxidation of NADPH by AcPdAD+, and does not require release of either NADP+ or NADPH from the dIII-binding site (44Hutton M.N. Day J.M. Bizouarn T. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The dI2dIII1 complexes are made simply by mixing the two proteins. Mixtures of any of the dI.R127M, dI.R127A, dI.D135N, or dI.S138A proteins with wild-type dIII were unable to catalyze the cyclic reaction at significant rates. However, the addition of any of the mutant dI proteins to wild-type complex inhibited the rate of reaction. Fig. 2B presents data for dI.D135N, and data for other mutants are shown in supplemental Figs. S1B and S2B. The results indicate that the mutant proteins can displace the wild-type dI from binding sites on dIII (to give an inactive complex) and again establishes their structural integrity. The binding reactions between dI mutants and wild-type dIII were also investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry. The heat changes recorded during additions of mutant dI (dI.R127A, dI.R127M, dI.D135N and dI.S138A) to a solution of dIII were very similar to those observed with wild-type protein (16Venning J.D.

As in other eukaryotes, it begins with the binding of an origin recognition complex (ORC) to chromatin. ORC consists of a stable core complex including subunits Orc2-Orc5 associated with less stably bound subunits Orc1 and Orc6 (1Vashee S. Simancek P. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. J. Biol.

Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar) and allows Cdt1 to load the hexameric Mcm complex (composed of Mcm2-Mcm7) (reviews in Refs. 6Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 7Biamonti G. Paixão S. Montecucco A. Peverali F.A. Riva S. Falaschi A.

Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).At the beginning of S-phase, pre-RCs are converted into active replication forks under the guidance of protein kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2. This process requires the origin binding of several additional initiation factors, including Mcm10 and Cdc45, which together initiate a series of events that ultimately lead to origin unwinding, recruitment of replicative DNA polymerases, and the establishment of replication forks (6Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar).Although the order of the reactions appears to be well established, many mechanistic details have yet to be worked out, and for that purpose it would be useful to possess an in vitro replication system with completely soluble proteins and a biochemically amenable DNA template. A highly successful replication system with soluble constituents is based on extracts from Xenopus eggs. The key components are a membrane-free cytoplasmic extract (for the chain-elongating functions) and a highly concentrated nuclear extract (for initiator proteins) (10Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The system replicates either frog sperm chromatin or protein-free plasmid DNA and has been and still is very successful in investigations into the events leading to pre-RC formation (11Hyrien O.

The Xenopus egg extract contains high amounts of initiator proteins such as ORC and Mcm proteins, stored for subsequent rounds of cell divisions in early embryogenesis. It therefore differs from the situation in proliferating adult mammalian cells with their limited amounts of ORC.In vitro replication systems with cytosolic mammalian cell extracts, using simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA as template, and a viral protein, T antigen, as initiator have been used since the mid-1980s (18Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 19Stillman B.

Virol. 1983; 48: 481-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have been extremely successful in identifying many of the mammalian proteins required for replicative chain elongation (reviews in Refs. 22Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 23Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, the cytosolic cell extract is the source for the main chain-elongating functions, whereas SV40 T antigen is the single initiator protein that targets a unique origin site in the viral genome where it unwinds the DNA double strand and then functions as a helicase at the emerging replication forks (review in Ref. 24Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).Much research has been done to establish in vitro replication systems entirely dependent on soluble proteins from proliferating mammalian cells in culture (25Pearson C.E. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Nielsen T.O. Todd A. Price G.B. Gene. 1994; 151: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Berberich S. Trivedi A. Daniel D.C. Johnson E.M. Leffak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 92-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Optimal DNA synthesis in these systems requires a cytosolic extract and a high salt nuclear extract and allows semiconservative replication of plasmid DNA (with eukaryotic DNA inserts), although to an extent that is only 1–3% of that achieved with T antigen and SV40 DNA under similar biochemical conditions. This is quite plausible because the initiator T antigen is added in high amounts to the incubation mixtures and does not need to interact with other proteins for the recognition and the unwinding of the viral origin. In contrast, the dozen or so cellular initiator functions are inevitably diluted when extracted from the nuclei of cultured cells and assemble on one of many possible sites on the plasmid template where they must interact in a highly complex manner before they are ready to initiate a replication round.With these limitations in mind we decided to investigate whether ORC and other components of the pre-RC are necessary for replication initiation in vitro. We used an in vitro system with proteins extracted from proliferating HeLa cells. The template was a plasmid, pEPI-1, that replicates as an autonomous unit (“episomally”) in mammalian cells and has no specific origin and ORC binding site in vivo (28Schaarschmidt D. Baltin J. Stehle I.M. Lipps H.J. Knippers R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We performed immunodepletions and showed that Orc proteins and Mcm proteins are indeed active components in a high salt nuclear extract. Endogenous ORC, but not recombinant ORC, is able to complement a nuclear extract immunologically depleted of Orc proteins. The main conclusion was that the in vitro system appeared to be sufficiently robust to investigate questions related to replication initiation in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa S3 cells were grown to semiconfluency on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% fetal calf serum. For synchronization, cells were first subjected to a double thymidine block (29Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and then released for 2 h (for cells in S-phase) or for 15.5 h (for cells in G1 phase). Cell cycle phases were verified by flow cytometry (not shown).Preparation of Cell Extracts—Soluble proteins were prepared according to Gruss (30Gruss C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells on plastic dishes were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mm sucrose, and washed twice with buffer A. They were then kept for 10 min on ice in a small volume of buffer A and disrupted in a type S Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to prepare the S100 extract (10–15 μg of protein/μl), which was stored in aliquots at –70 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed in buffer A and then kept in buffer A containing 450 mm potassium acetate for 90 min on ice. After preclearing (12,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 1 h to prepare the S300 extract (3–8 μg of protein/μl), which was stored in aliquots at –70 °C.Cell and chromatin fractionations were performed as described (29Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Extracts were further separated by 10–50% sucrose gradient centrifugation (45,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman TLA45 rotor at 4 °C). Fractions were concentrated by Vivaspin Concentrator (Vivascience) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.Immunoprecipitations with affinity-purified antibodies against human Orc1, Orc2 (29Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and Mcm3 protein were performed as previously described (31Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Control antibodies were nonspecific rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) from Sigma.In Vitro Replication—As templates we used plasmids pEPI-1 and its derivatives pEPI-UPR and pEPI-EX9 (28Schaarschmidt D. Baltin J. Stehle I.M. Lipps H.J. Knippers R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) purified by CsCl equilibrium centrifugation. Preparation and use of T antigen were exactly as described previously (30Gruss C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). We performed preincubations in a total volume of 35 μl with S300 nuclear extract (16 μg) and pEPI-1 DNA (160 ng) at 2 mm ATP and 80 mm potassium acetate in buffer A plus 1 μlof Complete, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science), as protease inhibitor. Replication was initiated by the addition of the S100 extract (45 μg), 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.6 μg/μl of creatine kinase, 30 mm potassium acetate, 80 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 100 μm dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 30 μm dATP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (ICN) in a total volume of 50 μl. Incubation was at 37 °C for 60 min (if not stated otherwise) and then stopped by 30 μl of stop mix (60 mm EDTA, 2% SDS). DNA was extracted by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform treatment followed by ethanol precipitation.Recombinant ORC—Open reading frames of human Orc1, Orc4, and Orc6 were cloned into the multiple cloning site of pBlueBacHis2 (Invitrogen) to generate amino terminal His-tagged proteins. Human Orc2, Orc3, and Orc5 were cloned into pVL (Invitrogen). SF-9 insect cells were cotransfected with linearized Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis or BaculoGold virus DNA and the Orc clones according to the Invitrogen protocol. High titer virus stocks were raised from single plaque isolates.For the expression of ORC, High-Five insect cells were coinfected with all six recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 6. The cells were harvested after 3 days and the recombinant proteins purified as described by Vashee and co-workers (32Vashee S. Cvetic C. Lu W. Simancek P. Kelly T.J. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The eluate from nickel-agarose was further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation (10–30% glycerol) in buffer OBB2 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Tween 20, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm mercaptoethanol). Centrifugation was at 45,000 rotations/min for 16 h at 4 °C in the Beckmann SW55 rotor. Fractions with Orc were stored in aliquots at –70 °C. For some experiments, His-Orc1 was dephosphorylated with 400 units of λ-phosphatase/10 pmol of recombinant Orc1 in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs) for 90 min at 30 °C.DNA Binding—For nitrocellulose binding assays, pEPI-1 was linearized by BamHI restriction and end labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The 400-μl binding reaction contained 50 ng of labeled DNA in OPB2F-buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Tween 20, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 100 ng/μl of bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP where indicated) and different amounts of recombinant ORC. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, the mixture was passed through nitrocellulose filters (BA45; Schleicher and Schuell), washed with OPB2, dried, and quantitated in a scintillation counter.The principle of the target-bound DNA binding assay has been described by Hinzpeter and co-workers (33Hinzpeter M. Fanning E. Deppert W. Virology. 1986; 148: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, pEPI-1 was digested with NcoI, BglII, and BamHI to create fragments that were end labeled as just described. Recombinant SV40 large T antigen and native or recombinant Orc proteins and complexes were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal or monospecific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose. 100 μl of binding buffer containing 50 ng of labeled DNA, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, 6 μg/ml of cytosolic extract, and increasing amounts of herring sperm DNA as competitor were added to the beads and incubated for 30 min on ice. After a short centrifugation, beads were washed twice with binding buffer and protein-DNA complexes were eluted in Laemmli buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by autoradiography and Western blotting.RESULTSA Nuclear Extract Is Required for Plasmid Replication in Vitro—The template used in these studies is the plasmid pEPI-1 (Fig. 1A), which is known to replicate semiconservatively as an independent unit in a onceper-cell cycle manner in several mammalian cell lines in vivo (28Schaarschmidt D. Baltin J. Stehle I.M. Lipps H.J. Knippers R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The sequence elements, essential for episomal replication and mitotic segregation, are the strong cytomegalovirus promoter and a matrix attachment region. The plasmid also contains the SV40 origin which is, however, dispensable for replication in vivo (35Jenke A.C. Stehle I.M. Herrmann F. Eisenberger T. Baiker A. Bode J. Fackelmayer F.O. Lipps H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11322-11327Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) but convenient for the in vitro studies reported below because it facilitates control experiments with the SV40 initiator protein, T antigen.Accordingly, pEPI-1 was incubated with T antigen and a soluble S100 extract under in vitro replication conditions. It yielded replication products of various topological forms of circular DNA as well as a broad spectrum of high molecular weight replicative intermediates as previously described (30Gruss C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Most replication products were resistant to DpnI, which only cleaves DNA that is methylated on both strands (as the parental pEPI-1 that had been produced in bacteria), indicating that the DNA was either hemimethylated or unmethylated and had therefore undergone at least one round of replication in vitro. The controls here were incubations with T antigen alone and with the S100 extract alone. The latter incubation yielded some labeled DNA that was, however, degraded by DpnI and therefore was due to repair DNA synthesis (Fig. 1B). The results were in agreement with earlier studies and demonstrated that T antigen is an efficient initiator and that the soluble S100 extract contains all the major functions required for replicative chain elongation.Next, we replaced T antigen by a nuclear extract (S300 extract) from HeLa cells as a potential source for initiator proteins and performed in vitro incubations under the same conditions as in Fig. 1B. We obtained DpnI-resistant replication products with the electrophoretic properties of open circular form II and linear form III DNA (Fig. 1C). The replication products were resistant to DpnI and also to MboI (not shown), which cleaves only unmethylated DNA, indicating that the labeled DNA was the product of one round of replication. The amount of label incorporated into DpnI-resistant DNA was only 1–2% of that incorporated in the T antigen-dependent reaction. Therefore, to visualize the replication products, longer exposure times were necessary with the consequence that the DpnI-sensitive products of repair synthesis are more prominent in Fig. 1C than in Fig. 1B.However, the main conclusion from Fig. 1C is that the S300 nuclear extract contained important replication-initiating functions. These could include Orc proteins because Orc1 and Orc2 were present in the nuclear extract but not in the soluble S100 extract (Fig. 1D). Mcm3 and other Mcm proteins (not shown, but see Ref. 31Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were also present in the nuclear extract. An equal fraction of Mcm3 additionally appeared in the S100 extract of soluble proteins (Fig. 1D). This was expected because it is known that during all cell cycle phases a considerable fraction of Mcm proteins is free in the nucleus and not bound to chromatin (31Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).We have performed many experiments to characterize the replication system. In Fig. 2, we present some of the results. A first and important point is that replication in vitro was optimal when both the soluble S100 and the nuclear S300 extract were from S-phase cells. In contrast, almost no replication was observed when both extracts were from G1 phase cells. Interestingly, it was more important that the nuclear extract, rather than the soluble extract, was from S-phase cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that a crucial component of the initiating activity in the nuclear extract must be modified during the G1 to S-phase transition. The nature of this component and its modification are presently not known. We also found that the supercoiled form of pEPI-1 was the preferred template and that the open circular form II DNA and the linear form III DNA functioned poorly or not at all as templates (not shown).FIGURE 2Biochemical analysis of the cell-free in vitro replication system. A, pEPI-1-DNA was replicated for 1 h in vitro using soluble (S) or salt-extracted nuclear (N) protein extracts from synchronized cells. G1 and S-phase cell extracts were investigated. B, effect of aphidicolin on the in vitro reaction. The pEPI-1 plasmid was replicated in vitro in the presence of increasing amounts of aphidicolin (5–60 μm). As a control, assays were performed under standard conditions (lane 1) and in the presence of Me2SO (lane 2), the solvent of aphidicolin. C, labeled replication products were isolated after 30 and 120 min of incubation time and linearized by NheI restriction. They were then denatured in 300 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA and investigated by alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (30 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA; 0.5 V/cm for 16 h) and autoradiography. Marker DNA was stained by ethidiumbromide after renaturation. D, femptomoles of [α-32P]dATP incorporation as a function of time. DpnI-resistant replication products were counted by scintillation counter and blotted against time of incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, DNA synthesis was absolutely dependent on ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (not shown) (27Berberich S. Trivedi A. Daniel D.C. Johnson E.M. Leffak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 92-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was sensitive to aphidicolin (Fig. 2B) and insensitive to dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (not shown) (27Berberich S. Trivedi A. Daniel D.C. Johnson E.M. Leffak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 92-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicating that replicative DNA polymerases are involved in the in vitro replication reaction. We also found that α-amanitin and RNase H treatment had no effect on in vitro DNA replication (not shown), excluding the possibility that RNA polymerase-dependent RNA synthesis or residual RNA could provide the primers for the in vitro synthesis of DNA.When the products of ongoing replication were investigated after denaturation on alkaline-agarose gels, we detected short labeled DNA strands (200–1000 bases) and larger DNA strands, which we interpret as lagging and leading strands. The shorter (lagging) strands were converted to unit-length units when replication ceased (Fig. 2C). Indeed, even under optimal conditions, DNA replication in vitro was slow and rather inefficient (Fig. 2D), replicating just one in a few hundred plasmid templates.The limiting factor responsible for the inefficient reaction must be in the nuclear extract, because the soluble extract with the replicative elongation functions was highly efficient in T antigen-directed replication in vitro (see Fig. 1B). A plausible explanation is that the necessary initiator proteins such as ORC and Mcm proteins and others are present in dilute quantities in the nuclear extract. Consequently, the probability that the various components of pre-RC meet and assemble properly on pEPI-1 will be rather low. Below, we first show that Orc1 and Orc2 as well as Mcm3 are indeed required for replication initiation in vitro and then report on our attempts to rescue an immunodepleted nuclear extract by exogenous proteins.Orc1, Orc2, and Mcm3 Are Required for in Vitro Replication—As shown in Fig. 1, Orc1 and Orc2 (and other Orc proteins, not shown) are present in the nuclear extract, as is that fraction of Mcm3 (and other Mcm proteins, not shown) that is bound to chromatin in replication-competent cells. We investigated whether these pre-RC proteins were needed for in vitro DNA replication and performed depletion experiments with affinity-purified antibodies (Fig. 3A). Nuclear extracts depleted of Orc1, Orc2, and Mcm3 were completely inactive in initiating in vitro DNA replication, whereas nuclear extracts treated in parallel experiments with unspecific antibodies were fully active (Fig. 3B). In nuclear extracts, Orc1 and Orc2 are components of multisubunit ORC subcomplexes (see below), just as Mcm3 is always a component of one of several subcomplexes with other Mcm proteins (6Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). We conclude therefore that ORC and Mcm proteins participate in replication initiation in vitro.FIGURE 3The system depends on replication initiation factors Orc1, Orc2, and Mcm3. A, immunoprecipitations with antibodies against Orc1 (α-Orc1), Orc2 (α-Orc2), Mcm3 (α-Mcm3) and with nonspecific control antibodies (IgG). Input (I), nuclear extract before immunoprecipitation; supernatant (S), remaining proteins after treatment with antibodies and protein A-Sepharose; and immunoprecipitates (P) were analyzed in Western blots with specific antibodies. B, effect of the depletion of replication initiation proteins on the in vitro replication reaction. The pEPI-1 plasmid was replicated in vitro using Orc1-, Orc2-, or Mcm3-depleted nuclear extracts. As a control, nuclear extract was incubated with control antibodies (IgG).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An interesting point here is that the S100 extract contains the soluble fraction of Mcm proteins that is not bound to chromatin (see Fig. 1D). However, this fraction of unbound Mcms is unable to substitute for the chromatin-bound Mcm3 in the nuclear extract and cannot induce DNA replication in vitro (Fig. 3).Recombinant ORC Fails to Complement Depleted Nuclear Extract—We have tried to complement the depleted nuclear extracts with recombinant proteins. We prepared recombinant ORC by cotransfecting insect cells with six baculovirus clones expressing the six common ORC subunits. The resulting complex was extracted via the histidine tags of some of the subunits and further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugations. The five largest of the six subunits form a stable Orc1–5 subcomplex that sedimented with ∼9 S as expected if each subunit were present in one copy each. The sixth subunit, Orc6, was not part of the complex but sedimented independently as a monomeric protein (Fig. 4A). This result agrees with the findings of others who have reported that Orc6 only weakly interacts with the Orc1–5 subcomplex (1Vashee S. Simancek P. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. J. Biol.

The homologous or analogous 16 amino acids in YS11 were replaced with alanine; nine of the substitutions slowed the growth of yeast cells.

Mutations of seven YS11 amino acids (Ser77, Met80, Arg88, Tyr97, Pro130, Ser132, and Arg136) whose homologs or analogs in S17 are within hydrogen bonding distance of nucleotides in 16 S rRNA did not affect binding.

Apparently, proximities alone do not define either the amino acids or the nucleotides that are important for recognition. Ribosomes translate genetic information carried in mRNAs into proteins. The chemistry of protein synthesis is based in the rRNAs, whereas the ribosomal proteins facilitate the folding of the rRNAs during biogenesis and stabilize the optimal conformation of the mature particle (1Stern S. Powers T. Changchien L.M. Noller H.F. Science. 1989; 244: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In accord with this premise, mutations in ribosomal proteins that affect protein synthesis are most often in rRNA-binding sites (3Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 208-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), hence the importance of a description of the nature of the interaction of nucleotides in rRNAs with amino acids in ribosomal proteins. In addition, an analysis of the interactions may help to uncover general principles that govern the association of the proteins and the RNA and to define the details of ribosome assembly. Of particular importance are the primary binding ribosomal proteins, those that are defined by their ability to bind individually and stoichiometrically to rRNA in in vitro reconstitution of the subunits; these proteins condense the rRNA and create binding sites for the remainder of the ribosomal proteins (4Traub P. Nomura M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 34: 575-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). There is extensive information on rRNA-binding sites for prokaryotic ribosomal proteins (5Mueller F.

There has been progress recently in this undertaking, facilitated by the application of genetics to the analysis; by the development of in vitro assays for the binding of the proteins to rRNA; and most significant, by the identification of the rRNA-binding sites of homologous prokaryotic ribosomal proteins revealed in the atomic structure of ribosomal subunits. We have sought to determine the chemistry of the interaction of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal protein YS11 with nucleotides in 18 S rRNA (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). YS11 was selected because its homolog in Escherichia coli, S17 (EcS17), 3The abbreviations used are: EcS17, E. coli S17; TtS17, T. thermophilus S17; H11, helix 11; KT-11, kink-turn motif in helix 11; MBP, maltose-binding protein. is a primary binding protein (21Held W.A. Ballou B. Mizushima S. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3103-3111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). YS11 is essential, and homologs are found in ribosomes of all species, including T. thermophilus (22Folley L.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What is known of this family of proteins is inferred mainly from studies in bacteria: EcS17 is on the surface of the small subunit that abuts the large subunit (23Stern S. Changchien L.M. Craven G.R. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), is essential for assembly of the particle (24Herzog A. Yaguchi M. Cabezon T. Corchuelo M.C. Petre J. Bollen A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 171: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and has been implicated in the maintenance of translational accuracy (25Bollen A. Cabezon T. de Wilde M. Villarroel R. Herzog A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Yaguchi M. Wittmann H.G. Cabezon T. DeWilde M. Villarroel R. Herzog A. Bollen A. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of T. thermophilus 30 S ribosomal subunits, ribosomal protein S17 (TtS17), the homolog of YS11, makes extensive contacts with the highly conserved irregular helix 11 (H11; nucleotides 240–286) in domain I (nucleotides 1–560) of 16 S rRNA. A subset of nucleotides in H11 forms a kink-turn motif designated KT-11 (27Klein D.J. Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). This helix-internal loop-helix has an unusual conformation caused by a kink in the phosphodiester backbone of one strand that bends the helix axis by 120° (27Klein D.J. Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). KT-11 is one of two conserved kink-turn motifs in the 30 S subunit (28Lescoute A. Leontis N.B. Massire C. Westhof E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2395-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); both interact with ribosomal proteins (27Klein D.J. Schmeing T.M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4214-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds, non-polar contacts, and electrostatic interactions between amino acids and nucleotides can be derived from proximities in the atomic structures of the ribosomal subunits, but their importance to the structure and function of the ribosome and to the economy of the cell can come only from genetic and biochemical experiments (29Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). What is needed to define the subset of contacts that have functional relevance is best determined from the phenotype of mutations of nucleotides in rRNA and of amino acids in ribosomal proteins. The primary binding site of YS11 is in domain I of 18 S rRNA, and the nucleotides important for recognition are located in the KT-11 motif and in the terminal loop of H11 (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Guided by the three-dimensional structure of TtS17 and 16 S rRNA in the T. thermophilus 30 S ribosomal subunit, we used reverse genetics and biochemical assays to determine the amino acids in YS11 that are important for the recognition of nucleotides in rRNA. Yeast and Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Haploid S. cerevisiae strain LSF325 is a derivative of LSF327 in which the chromosomal ribosomal protein gene YS11-A was disrupted and replaced with a URA3 gene; haploid strain LSF326 is a derivative of LSF327 in which the chromosomal ribosomal protein gene YS11-B was disrupted and replaced with a LEU2 gene (22Folley L.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the genotypes of these and related strains, see Table 1. Plasmid pLFY204 has the YS11-A gene between the BamHI and SalI sites in a CEN vector with a TRP1 selectable marker (22Folley L.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this plasmid was used for complementation. Plasmid pMALc2-YS11-B has the YS11-B open reading frame fused to the open reading frame of a maltose-binding protein (MBP) between the BamHI and SalI sites in the pMALc2 vector. This plasmid was used for the expression of recombinant wild-type and mutant YS11 proteins. E. coli DH5α cells (Stratagene), the hosts for the plasmids, were grown in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/ml) and/or ampicillin (50 mg/ml).TABLE 1S. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeLSF327MATa ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1LSF325MATa ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3LSF326MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-b::LEU2LSF306MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A (wild-type)JD031MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(S77A)JD033MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(M80A)JD034MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(R82A)JD035MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(R88A)JD036MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(Y97A)JD037MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(R103A)JD038MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(K105A)JD039MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(N106A)JD040MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(R129A)JD041MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(P130A)JD042MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(S132A)JD043MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(K133A)JD044MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(T134A)JD045MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(R136A)JD046MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(N138A)JD047MATα ade2 leu1-12 trp1-1 ura3-1 ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2+ pLFY204-YS11-A(K151A) Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis of Ribosomal Protein YS11 Genes—Mutagenesis at specific sites in plasmids pMALc2-YS11-B and pLFY204 (carrying YS11-A) was performed using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene). A diploid strain from a cross of LSF325 and LSF326 was transformed with pLFY204 (obtained from DH5α cells) with the relevant mutations, and the effect on yeast viability and growth was assessed following sporulation and tetrad dissection. Growth of Yeast Strains—Yeast cells were grown either in YPD liquid medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose) or in Ura-/Leu-/Trp- selective medium (0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids in 2% glucose to which 20 mg/liter adenine was added). The cultures were incubated with agitation at 30 °C, and the absorbance at 600 nm was determined at 60-min intervals. The doubling time was calculated from the growth curve, i.e. the increase in absorbance as a function of time. Yeast Transformation, Sporulation, and Tetrad Dissection—Transformation of yeast cells was performed as described (18Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A diploid strain produced by a cross of LSF325 and LSF326 was transformed with either wild-type or mutant pLFY204 plasmids, and the effect on yeast viability and growth was assessed following sporulation and tetrad analysis. The viability of the spores was determined by replica plating on Ura-/Leu-/Trp- selective medium; incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 2–10 days. Successful complementation of the ys11 null mutant (ys11-a::URA3 ys11-b::LEU2) with pLFY204 produced Ura+Leu+Trp+ spores, which were viable when grown in Ura-/Leu+/Trp+ selective medium. The viable cells were grown in YPD medium, and the doubling time was determined as described above. Preparation of Plasmids Encoding YS11 and Expression and Purification of the MBP-YS11 Fusion Protein—A cDNA encoding ribosomal protein YS11 was generated by PCR from a yeast cDNA library; MBP-YS11 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pMALc2-YS11-B and purified as described (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Preparation of Domain I of Yeast 18 S rRNA—Domain I of 18 S rDNA (nucleotides 1–610) was amplified PCR from plasmid pNOY102, which has an S. cerevisiae rRNA operon; the DNA fragment was then inserted into plasmid vector pIBI30 adjacent to a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Internally radiolabeled domain I rRNA was synthesized by runoff transcription in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and purified (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Preparation of Truncated YS11 Protein Variants—We constructed derivatives of YS11 that lacked the N-terminal 65 residues (designated YS11ΔN65), the eight residues in the C terminus (YS11ΔC8), or both ends of the protein (YS11ΔN65ΔC8). The coding sequences for these truncated peptides were amplified by PCR from pMALc2-YS11-B. The BamHI and SalI restriction sites were incorporated into either the 5′-or 3′-end of each fragment to allow swapping with the wild-type YS11 coding sequence at the identical sites in pMALc2-YS11-B. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with these plasmids and screened for clones containing plasmids with the desired coding sequences. The resulting recombinant plasmids (pMALc2-YS11ΔN65, pMALc2-YS11ΔC8, and pMALc2-YS11ΔN65ΔC8) were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the truncated proteins were expressed and purified. The identity of the truncated YS11 variants was confirmed from the molecular weight determined by mass spectroscopy. The fold of the mutant proteins was assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Assay of Binding of YS11 to a Domain I Fragment of 18 S rRNA—Increasing concentrations of wild-type or mutant MBP-YS11 fusion protein (up to 4 μm) were mixed with a radioactive domain I fragment of 18 S rRNA (1 nm) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The binding reaction (10 μl) was performed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 30 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 unit/μl RNasin. The reaction mixture also contained 120 nm tRNA and 0.05 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific binding of rRNA to protein. The reaction mixture was spotted in a single drop onto a nitrocellulose filter (13 cm2; Millipore Corp.) that had been soaked in the binding buffer. As many as 12 samples from a single experiment were placed on a filter, assuring the exposure of all to uniform filtration conditions. The binding reaction was stopped by filtration with gentle suction. The nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) were washed with 40 ml of the binding buffer and dried at room temperature. The binding of MBP-YS11 to rRNA was quantified with a Storm 860 PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences). The binding data were processed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and fitted to two-component binding isotherms using KaleidaGraph Version 3.0 software (Synergy Software). The Kd and S.E. were obtained from a least square fit of the binding data. The average difference in replicate experiments in which the Kd was determined was ±11%. The amount of background RNA retention was determined by filtration in the absence of MBP-YS11 and was subtracted from the experimental values. Samples containing MBP and RNA but not YS11 were filtered to determine the level of nonspecific binding. An aliquot of each reaction mixture was spotted onto a filter to measure the input of radioactive RNA. The Kd for the binding of mutant YS11 to RNA and the value relative to that for the binding to wild-type YS11 were determined in the same experiment. Preparation of YS11 Mutants—Because YS11 binds predominantly to domain I of yeast 18 S rRNA (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), it was likely that the amino acids important for the interaction would be among those in close proximity to that domain. There are 16 amino acids in YS11 whose homologs or analogs in TtS17 are within hydrogen bonding distance (3.4 Å) of nucleotides in domain I (11Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M. Jr-Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Each of the 16 residues was replaced with alanine, and the effect of the mutations on cell viability and growth and on the binding of mutant YS11 to a domain I fragment of 18 S rRNA was evaluated. Ribosomal protein YS11 has 156 residues, whereas TtS17 has 105. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of TtS17 and YS11 revealed that the latter has 65 additional residues at the N terminus and 15 fewer at the C terminus (Fig. 1). In 83 amino acid comparisons, there are 33 identities (40%) and 15 conservative changes or 58% similarity. In an alignment of TtS17 and EcS17 (data not shown), there is 48% identity and 58% similarity. In a simultaneous alignment of the amino acid sequences of TtS17, YS11, and EcS17, the C-terminal 23 residues of TtS17 (positions 83–105) are missing in EcS17, and 15 of the 23 residues are missing in YS11 (data not shown). Nonetheless, data from biochemical experiments indicate that EcS17, despite lacking the C-terminal residues, interacts predominantly with H11 in domain I rRNA (5Mueller F. Brimacombe R. J. Mol.

Biol. 1988; 200: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), as do TtS17 and YS11 (11Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons W.M. Jr-Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This indicates that the additional C-terminal residues in TtS17 do not make physiologically significant contacts with H11 and indicates perhaps why they are not conserved in YS11 and EcS17. It appears that the amino acid residues that are important for recognition of and for binding to domain I are largely, if not exclusively, among the N-terminal 83 residues of TtS17. Not surprisingly, this is the region of the greatest identity to amino acids in YS11 and EcS17, and this is where most of the residues that were mutagenized are located. Effect of Mutations in YS11 on Cell Growth—Ribosomal protein YS11 is essential for cell viability (22Folley L.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lethal phenotype of a strain in which both copies of the YS11 gene are disrupted can be complemented successfully with a copy of either a YS11-A or YS11-B gene. Because most ribosomal YS11 is the product of transcription of the YS11-A gene (22Folley L.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was chosen for complementation. The YS11-A gene was replaced with URA3, and the YS11-B gene with LEU2; the resulting strains, LSF325 and LSF326, respectively, were crossed (Table 1). The diploid strain was transformed with a YS11-A gene in the pLFY204 vector carrying a TRP+ selectable marker and sporulated. The YS11-A gene has been mapped to chromosome IV, and YS11-B to chromosome II (22Folley L.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the genes segregate independently during meiosis. Thus, when transformation is with pLFY204, one-quarter of the spores of the diploid strain are expected to grow on Ura-/Leu-/Trp- selective plates. The nucleotides in yeast 18 S rRNA important for YS11 recognition were determined previously (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). What we assessed here is the contribution of amino acids in YS11 to the interaction with rRNA. We made a strong assumption that the structure of TtS17 in T. thermophilus 30 S ribosomal subunits can be used to interpret the biochemical and genetic results obtained in our experiments. This assumption is favored by the conservation of the sequence of amino acids in YS11 and TtS17 and that of nucleotides in 18 S and 16 S rRNAs in the two species. Sixteen amino acids whose homologs or analogs in TtS17 are in close proximity to nucleotides in domain I rRNA were replaced with alanine, and the rescue of the null strain by plasmids harboring a single mutation was assessed (Table 2). Of the 16 single substitutions, one was lethal (N106A), and eight had a slow growth phenotype (R82A, R103A, K105A, R129A, K133A, T134A, N138A, and K151A). Mutations of seven residues (Ser77,Met80, Arg88, Tyr97, Pro130, Ser132, and Arg136) did not affect growth despite their homologs or analogs in T. thermophilus being within 3.4 Å of nucleotides in domain I.TABLE 2Doubling times of S. cerevisiae strains with mutations in a plasmid-borne copy of the YS11-A geneYS11Doubling time in YPD mediummin ± S.E.aThe S.E. was calculated from values in replicate experimentsWild-type YS11106 ± 4Mutations of amino acids that contact nucleotides in KT-11YS11-S77A105 ± 7YS11-R103A304 ± 16YS11-N106ALethalYS11-T134A211 ± 10YS11-K151A243 ± 9Mutations of amino acids that contact nucleotides in the lower stem-loop of H11YS11-M80A102 ± 5YS11-R82A173 ± 8YS11-R129A195 ± 8YS11-P130A111 ± 4YS11-S132A109 ± 7YS11-K133A353 ± 19Mutations of amino acids that contact nucleotides outside of H11YS11-R88A104 ± 3YS11-Y97A105 ± 4YS11-K105A166 ± 9YS11-R136A103 ± 3YS11-N138A176 ± 6a The S.E. was calculated from values in replicate experiments Open table in a new tab Contribution of Amino Acids in YS11 to Binding to 18 S rRNA—Next, we sought to determine whether an effect on the binding to rRNA could account for the growth phenotype of mutations in YS11. A fragment of S. cerevisiae 18 S rDNA corresponding to domain I was cloned and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase. The domain I rRNA migrated in a single band on native polyacrylamide gels. The average pKa for eukaryotic ribosomal proteins is 11; hence, most, including YS11, are insoluble in the buffers (pH 7.0–8.0) used in experiments dedicated to the measurement of the binding of ribosomal proteins to rRNA. For this reason, YS11 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion with MBP. MBP does not bind to rRNA (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar); however, it has the advantage that it renders the MBP-YS11 fusion protein soluble and makes the binding experiments feasible. The affinity of recombinant wild-type and mutant MBP-YS11 fusion proteins for domain I rRNA was determined in a filter binding assay (Fig. 2). In this assay (20Dresios J. Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the concentration of radioactive RNA (nanomolar) was lower than that of the protein (micromolar), so the amount of complex formed was small compared with the amount of protein added. Under these conditions, the binding of wild-type MBP-YS11 to domain I had an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.13 μm, and ∼50% of the input of domain I rRNA was in complexes with MBP-YS11 (Table 3). We interpret the plateau of the binding isotherm, when ∼55% of the input rRNA is in complexes with YS11, as an indication that only that amount of the domain I fragment of 18 S rRNA is correctly folded. Given the size of the RNA fragment (610 nucleotides), the efficiency of the refolding can be considered to be good.TABLE 3Effect of amino acid substitutions or deletions in YS11 on the binding to domain I of yeast 18 S rRNAYS11KdMutant Kd/wild-type Kdμm ± S.E.aThe S.E. was calculated from a least square fit of the binding valuesWild-type YS110.13 ± 0.011.0Alanine substitutionsYS11-R82A0.29 ± 0.052.2YS11-R103ANDbA Kd could not be determined (cf.
