Conversely, longer carbon nanotubes have much better properties but are harder to process. Behabtu et al. (p. 182 ) combined the best of both worlds through scalable wet spinning method, in which they dissolved longer carbon nanotubes and then spun them into fibers that showed excellent strength, stiffness, and thermal conductivity."

Typically, actuators made from polymers can show large deformations, but cannot generate a lot of force. Ma et al. (p. 186 ; see the Perspective by Kim and Kwon ) describe a polymer composite based on a modified polypyrrole that expands in response to water absorption. The composite was able to generate large stresses and forces, and offered a high work density approaching those of the best conducting polymer electrochemical actuators. Magnetic nanoparticles incorporated into polymer films were used to control the locomotion of the actuator."

The ribosome is an extraordinarily sophisticated molecular machine, assembling amino acids into proteins based on the precise sequence dictated by messenger RNA. Lewandowski et al. (p. 189 ) have now taken a step toward the preparation of a stripped-down synthetic ribosome analog. Their machine comprises a rotaxane—a ring threaded on a rod—in which the ring bears a pendant thiol that can pluck amino acids off the rod; the terminal nitrogen then wraps around to form a peptide bond and liberate the thiol for further reaction. The system was able to link three amino acids in order from the preassembled rod."

The DNA damage repair protein, 53BP1, prevents nucleolytic processing of these breaks, but the proteins it partners with to do this are unknown (see the Perspective by Lukas and Luka s ). Di Virgilio et al. (p. 711 , published online 10 January), using mass spectroscopy–based methods, and Zimmermann et al. (p. 700 , published online 10 January), using a telomere-based assay, identify Rif1 as a 53BP1 phosphorylation- and DNA damage–dependent interaction partner. Mice with a B cell–specific deletion in Rif1 showed impaired immunoglobulin class switching. Rif1-deficient cells exhibited extensive 5′-3′ resection at DNA ends, with enhanced genetic instability. Thus, Rif1 partners with 53BP1 to promote the proper repair of double-stranded DNA breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2083356397,"Size Affects Shape Porous molecular framework materials can adopt a different phase when guest molecules absorb and uniformly distort the framework. Usually the framework returns to its original shape when the guests desorb. Sakata et al. (p. 193 ) noted that because surface stress drives this process, it might be avoided in smaller crystals. Indeed, a flexible porous coordination polymer, [Cu 2 (dicarboxylate) 2 (amine)] n , could retain the structure induced by guest molecules such as methanol if crystallites were made sufficiently small (submicrometer scale) and did so to a greater degree as the crystallite dimensions decreased."

https://openalex.org/W2022093637,"Recent data indicate that the nutrients available to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inside its host cell are restricted in their diversity. Fatty acids and cholesterol appear more favored; however, their degradation can result in certain metabolic stresses. Their breakdown can generate propionyl-CoA, which gives rise to potentially toxic intermediates. Detoxification of propionyl-CoA relies on the activity of the methylcitrate cycle, the methylmalonyl pathway, or incorporation of the propionyl-CoA into methyl-branched lipids in the cell wall. The current work explores carbon flux through these pathways, focusing primarily on those pathways responsible for the incorporation of propionyl-CoA into virulence-associated cell wall lipids. Exploiting both genetic and biochemical rescue, we demonstrate that these metabolic pressures are experienced by Mtb inside its host macrophage and that the bacterium accesses host fatty acid stores. The metabolism of these host lipids expands the acetyl-CoA pool and alleviates the pressure from propionyl-CoA. These data have major implications for our appreciation of central metabolism of Mtb during the course of infection."

In 2010, Cameron et al. (p. 953 , published online 10 January) recruited approximately 400 residents of Beijing who had been born either before the implementation of the policy (1975 and 1978) or after (1980 and 1983). Using economic games to measure trust, risk, and willingness to compete, they found that the post-1979 cohorts were less trusting and less willing to compete and also more risk averse."

Using a superconducting qubit placed in a microwave cavity, Hatridge et al. (p. 178 ) found that a series of partial measurements on a quantum system left the system in a pure state. Looking at the record of the actual measurements allowed the final state of a superconducting-based quantum system to be determined accurately. Such control is crucial for achieving full feedback control of a general quantum system."
https://openalex.org/W2106339147,"Circadian rhythm disturbances are observed in, e.g., aging and neurodegenerative diseases and are associated with an increased incidence of obesity and diabetes. We subjected male C57Bl/6J mice to constant light [12-h light-light (LL) cycle] to examine the effects of a disturbed circadian rhythm on energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the central pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) revealed an immediate reduction in rhythm amplitude, stabilizing at 44% of normal amplitude values after 4 d LL. Food intake was increased (+26%) and energy expenditure decreased (-13%), and we observed immediate body weight gain (d 4: +2.4%, d 14: +5.0%). Mixed model analysis revealed that weight gain developed more rapidly in response to LL as compared to high fat. After 4 wk in LL, the circadian pattern in feeding and energy expenditure was completely lost, despite continuing low-amplitude rhythms in the SCN and in behavior, whereas weight gain had stabilized. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis revealed complete abolishment of normal circadian variation in insulin sensitivity in LL. In conclusion, a reduction in amplitude of the SCN, to values previously observed in aged mice, is sufficient to induce a complete loss of circadian rhythms in energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity."

However, we know surprisingly little about the initiation of phage infection. Hu et al. (p. 576 , published online 10 January) used high-throughput cryo-electron tomography and sub-volume analysis to examine Escherichia coli minicells infected with both wild-type and mutant T7 bacteriophages. High-resolution views of phage structures at different stages of infection reveal the de novo formation of an extended tail by the ejection of internal head proteins, in order to form the channel for DNA transport into the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1998826816,"The abundance of siderophile elements in the mantle preserves the signature of core formation. On the basis of partitioning experiments at high pressure (35 to 74 gigapascals) and high temperature (3100 to 4400 kelvin), we demonstrate that depletions of slightly siderophile elements (vanadium and chromium), as well as moderately siderophile elements (nickel and cobalt), can be produced by core formation under more oxidizing conditions than previously proposed. Enhanced solubility of oxygen in the metal perturbs the metal-silicate partitioning of vanadium and chromium, precluding extrapolation of previous results. We propose that Earth accreted from materials as oxidized as ordinary or carbonaceous chondrites. Transfer of oxygen from the mantle to the core provides a mechanism to reduce the initial magma ocean redox state to that of the present-day mantle, reconciling the observed mantle vanadium and chromium concentrations with geophysical constraints on light elements in the core."
https://openalex.org/W2033326608,"Pupfish Speciation Evolution moves along phenotypic trajectories that can be visualized as a topographic landscape of multiple peaks of relatively high-fitness and low-fitness valleys. Martin and Wainwright (p. 208 ) examined the adaptive landscape of three species of Cyprinodon pupfishes. These species represent a recent adaptive radiation, each having moved into a difference niche within their specialized environment. Examining replicate hybrid transplants relative to parental types in high- and low-density enclosures, the authors recovered the specialist parental phenotypes and observed higher survival and growth. Thus, high density can drive multiple fitness peaks during the early stages of adaptive radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2013004928,"JMJD6 is reported to hydroxylate lysyl residues of a splicing factor, U2AF65. In this study, we found that JMJD6 hydroxylates histone lysyl residues. In vitro experiments showed that JMJD6 has a binding affinity to histone proteins and hydroxylates multiple lysyl residues of histone H3 and H4 tails. Using JMJD6 knock-out mouse embryos, we revealed that JMJD6 hydroxylates lysyl residues of histones H2A/H2B and H3/H4 in vivo by amino acid composition analysis. 5-Hydroxylysine was detected at the highest level in histones purified from murine testis, which expressed JMJD6 at a significantly high level among various tissues examined, and JMJD6 overexpression increased the amount of 5-hydroxylysine in histones in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results indicate that histones are additional substrates of JMJD6 in vivo. Because 5-hydroxylation of lysyl residues inhibited N-acetylation and N-methylation by an acetyltransferase and a methyltransferase, respectively, in vitro, histone 5-hydroxylation may have important roles in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription or chromosomal rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2108179560,"With more than half a billion individuals affected worldwide, obesity has reached pandemic proportions. Development of ""brown-like"" or ""brite"" adipocytes within white adipose tissue (WAT) has potential antiobesity and insulin-sensitizing effects. We investigated the role of cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling, focusing on cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKGI) in WAT. PKGI is expressed in murine WAT, primary adipocytes, and 3T3-L1. Treatment of adipocytes with cGMP resulted in increased adipogenesis, with a 54% increase in expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Lentiviral overexpression of PKGI further increased adipogenesis, whereas loss of PKGI significantly reduced adipogenic differentiation. In addition to adipogenic effects, PKGI had an antihypertrophic and anti-inflammatory effect via RhoA phosphorylation and reduction of proinflammatory adipokine expression. Moreover, PKGI induced a 4.3-fold increase in abundance of UCP-1 and the development of a brown-like thermogenic program in primary adipocytes. Notably, treatment of C57BL/6 mice with phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil (12 mg/kg/d) for 7 d caused 4.6-fold increase in uncoupling protein-1 expression and promoted establishment of a brown fat cell-like phenotype (""browning"") of WAT in vivo. Taken together, PKGI is a key regulator of cell size, adipokine secretion and browning of white fat depots and thus could be a valuable target in developing novel treatments for obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2098038381,"In our previous work, we found that feeding Lactobacillus johnsonii to BioBreeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats decreased the incidence of diabetes development. The aim of this study was to investigate host pathways affected by L. johnsonii, with specific focus on the rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Suspensions of L. johnsonii or an equal volume of vehicle were orally administered to BBDP rats. Tissue IDO was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, whereas tryptophan, kynurenine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations were quantified by HPLC and ELISA. IDO activity was also investigated using L. johnsonii culture cell-free supernatant (CFS) with affinity-purified IDO and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells. L. johnsonii feeding resulted in a 17% reduction in serum kynurenine compared with that in vehicle-fed controls, correlating with a 1.4-fold elevation in 5-HT levels. H₂O₂ produced by L. johnsonii abolished IDO activity in vitro, and L. johnsonii feeding resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in ileum lumen H₂O₂. L. johnsonii CFS significantly reduced IDO activity in HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells (47% reduction) compared with that in vehicle-treated controls, an effect abolished by catalase treatment. These data support the role of H₂O₂ in commensal bacteria-host interactions and highlight the influence of commensal bacteria-derived H₂O₂ on host physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2075846203,"Destination Specificity During brain development, some types of neurons migrate from where they are born to their final functional locations. Some neurons migrate radially, from the inside to the outside, while others migrate tangentially. Di Meglio et al. (p. 204 ) analyzed the migration of a group of tangentially migrating neurons in the hindbrain. Although these neurons all entered the same migratory stream, they each retained positional information such that their relative organization in the destination site reflected their original organization. Interactions between epigenetic signals and the genes encoding Hox transcription factors encoded the positional information and fine-tuned migration."
https://openalex.org/W2011853932,"Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant disease. Despite extensive research, the mechanism by which a mutant MODY gene results in monogenic diabetes is not yet clear due to the inaccessibility of patient samples. Induced pluripotency and directed differentiation toward the pancreatic lineage are now viable and attractive methods to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying MODY. Here we report, for the first time, the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients with five types of MODY: MODY1 (HNF4A), MODY2 (GCK), MODY3 (HNF1A), MODY5 (HNF1B), and MODY8 (CEL) with a polycistronic lentiviral vector expressing a Cre-excisable human ""stem cell cassette"" containing the four reprogramming factors OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and CMYC. These MODY-hiPSCs morphologically resemble human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), express pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA-4, and TRA-1-60, give rise to derivatives of the three germ layers in a teratoma assay, and are karyotypically normal. Overall, our MODY-hiPSCs serve as invaluable tools to dissect the role of MODY genes in the development of pancreas and islet cells and to evaluate their significance in regulating beta cell function. This knowledge will aid future attempts aimed at deriving functional mature beta cells from hPSCs."

It uses hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the production of strong oxidants including chlorine bleach and free radicals. A physiological defense against the inappropriate action of this enzyme has yet to be identified. We found that myeloperoxidase oxidized 75% of the ascorbate in plasma from ceruloplasmin knock-out mice, but there was no significant loss in plasma from wild type animals. When myeloperoxidase was added to human plasma it became bound to other proteins and was reversibly inhibited. Ceruloplasmin was the predominant protein associated with myeloperoxidase. When the purified proteins were mixed, they became strongly but reversibly associated. Ceruloplasmin was a potent inhibitor of purified myeloperoxidase, inhibiting production of hypochlorous acid by 50% at 25 nm. Ceruloplasmin rapidly reduced Compound I, the FeV redox intermediate of myeloperoxidase, to Compound II, which has FeIV in its heme prosthetic groups. It also prevented the fast reduction of Compound II by tyrosine. In the presence of chloride and hydrogen peroxide, ceruloplasmin converted myeloperoxidase to Compound II and slowed its conversion back to the ferric enzyme.

It is packaged in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and released into phagosomes when they ingest and kill bacteria (3Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J.

Myeloperoxidase is also released into the extracellular space as a result of incomplete phagosome closure and during chronic inflammation when neutrophils are activated and degranulate in the absence of infection.

Given the substantial potential of myeloperoxidase to exacerbate the oxidative stress associated with inflammation, it raises the question as to whether an endogenous inhibitor exists to limit its activity in the extracellular environment of neutrophils. As an analogy, α1-antitrypsin provides an important shield against the proteolysis elicited by neutrophil elastase, which is discharged along with myeloperoxidase when these inflammatory cells are stimulated (19Travis J.

The degree of inhibition also increased with increasing size of the peroxidase substrate (25Sokolov A.V. Ageeva K.V. Pulina M.O. Cherkalina O.S. Samygina V.R. Vlasova I.I. Panasenko O.M.

This suggested that binding of ceruloplasmin to myeloperoxidase hinders large substrates from accessing the active site of the enzyme. As a corollary, this result implies that ceruloplasmin is unlikely to be an effective inhibitor of the oxidation of either chloride or thiocyanate, which are small anions. As a result of these variable findings, ceruloplasmin has largely been ignored as a potentially important inhibitor of myeloperoxidase. Currently, there is no evidence to support ceruloplasmin functioning as an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase in vivo, and the mechanism of inhibition has yet to be conclusively determined. In the present study, we sought evidence for effective inhibition of myeloperoxidase by ceruloplasmin in blood plasma and aimed to clarify the mechanism by which this occurs. We show that myeloperoxidase is more active in promoting the oxidation of ascorbate in the plasma of ceruloplasmin knock-out mice than in wild type animals, suggesting that ceruloplasmin will attenuate the production of hypochlorous acid in vivo. Furthermore, using appropriate assays, we show that ceruloplasmin is a potent inhibitor of hypochlorous acid production. Purified myeloperoxidase was purchased from Planta (Austria). Its concentration was calculated from its heme absorbance (ϵ430 = 89,000 m−1 cm−1/heme). All concentrations are given per heme, so that the protein concentration of myeloperoxidase was always half this value. Hypochlorous acid (Sarah Lee, Auckland, New Zealand) concentrations were determined from its absorbance at 292 nm (pH 12, ϵ292 = 350 m−1 cm−1) (26Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Assays for the chlorination activity of myeloperoxidase.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Antibodies to myeloperoxidase and ceruloplasmin were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin biotin conjugate secondary antibodies were from Dako (Campbellfield, Australia). All other chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or BDH (Poole, UK). Wild type (Cp+/+)3Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Redox Reactions and Microbial Killing in the Neutrophil Phagosome.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 642-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar and homozygous ceruloplasmin knock-out (Cp−/−) mice (males and females) were originally a kind gift from Dr. Z. L. Harris and bred at the University of Pittsburgh. The mice are on a C57/BL6 background and back-crossed more than 12 generations. They were allowed food and water ad libitum and were kept on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh. Blood was taken from the mice into heparin-containing tubes (100 units/ml units), as described previously (27Shiva S. Wang X. Ringwood L.A. Xu X. Yuditskaya S. Annavajjhala V. Miyajima H. Hogg N. Harris Z.L. Gladwin M.T. Ceruloplasmin is a NO oxidase and nitrite synthase that determines endocrine NO homeostasis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Plasma ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity was measured in the knockouts and found to be <5% of the wild types. Plasma from Cp+/+ and Cp−/− mice (50 μl) was incubated with myeloperoxidase (25 nm) for 15 min prior to the addition of glucose oxidase (generating ∼5 μm/min hydrogen peroxide as measured by the Fox assay (28Wolff S.P. Ferrous ion oxidation in presence of ferric ion indicator xylenol orange for measurement of hydroperoxides.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1069) Google Scholar)). Ascorbate levels in the plasma were checked, and because all ascorbate had been lost during storage, 50 μm was added to all samples with the myeloperoxidase. Reactions were stopped after 5 min by the addition of an equal volume of perchloric acid (0.54 m) to precipitate proteins. Precipitated proteins were pelleted, and the supernatants were assayed for ascorbate by reverse-phase HPLC on a Synergi 4-μm column (Phenomenex) with electrochemical detection (29Vissers M.C. Lee W.-G. Hampton M.B. Regulation of apoptosis by vitamin C. Specific protection of the apoptotic machinery against exposure to chlorinated oxidants.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46835-46840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein from pooled plasma (1.4 liter from healthy volunteers) was sequentially precipitated with 30 and 55% ammonium sulfate. The second precipitate was dissolved in deionized water and then dialyzed against sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 5) prior to separation on DEAE-Sephadex at 4 °C. Protein was eluted from the column via a linear gradient from pH 5 to pH 4 using 50 mm sodium acetate containing 0.4 m NaCl. Fractions with absorbance at 610 nm (due to copper in ceruloplasmin) were pooled, and protein was precipitated as described above. Precipitated protein was dissolved in sodium acetate buffer (25 mm, pH 5, containing 1 m ammonium sulfate (buffer A)) and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column. A stepwise elution of proteins was carried out as follows; 100% A, 75% A, and 25% B (sodium acetate buffer (25 mm), pH 5), 50% A and 50% B, 25% A and 75% B, and 100% B. Fractions with absorbance at 610 nm were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and freeze-dried. The purified protein had a purity index of 0.042 (A610/A280) and was 80% pure. This is based on the purity index for pure ceruloplasmin of 0.052 (20Segelmark M. Persson B. Hellmark T. Wieslander J. Binding and inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO). A major function of ceruloplasmin?.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 108: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The protein was recognized by commercial antibodies to ceruloplasmin. Myeloperoxidase (30 μg, 6.8 μm), ceruloplasmin (30–150 μg, 3.9–19.5 μm), and mixtures of the two proteins were incubated in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7, containing 0.1 m NaCl) for 1 h prior to separation on an Alltech ProSphere 250 5-μm size exclusion column (7.8 × 300 mm). The mobile phase was phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7, containing 0.1 m NaCl), with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and detection at 280, 430, and 610 nm. The column was calibrated with the following protein standards: ferritin (440 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and horseradish peroxidase (44 kDa), which eluted at volumes of 6.8, 8.1, and 9 ml, respectively. When myeloperoxidase was separated from plasma proteins, its activity was monitored in fractions using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a reducing substrate as described previously (26Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Assays for the chlorination activity of myeloperoxidase.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The accumulation of blue product was detected at 650-nm oxidation over a 15-min incubation period. EDTA anti-coagulated plasma from a healthy donor was added to myeloperoxidase (100 nm) and incubated at room temperature with end over end mixing for three hours. Plasma alone was used as a control. Polyclonal anti-myeloperoxidase antibody was covalently bound to Protein G-Dynabeads following the manufacturer's instructions. 0.1% IPEGAL (octylphenyl-polyethylene glycol) was added to the plasma sample, followed by the beads. The sample was incubated at 4 °C with end over end rotation for 18 h. The beads were collected using a magnet and washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm phosphate and 140 mm Cl−) containing 0.1% IPEGAL. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3. The pH of the eluant was neutralized, and proteins were precipitated using 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, 20% (v/v) acetone, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Air-dried precipitates were resuspended in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). Interactions between myeloperoxidase and ceruloplasmin were investigated using a sandwich ELISA. In this assay, a standard curve was prepared with purified myeloperoxidase and used to determine the activity and protein levels in samples. Myeloperoxidase in buffer or 10-fold diluted plasma was captured by a monoclonal anti-myeloperoxidase antibody. Its enzyme activity was detected by adding hydrogen peroxide (20 μm) to Amplex Red (50 μm) in a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaBr. The plate was subsequently washed to remove peroxidase substrates and products. Myeloperoxidase protein was then probed using rabbit polyclonal anti-myeloperoxidase antibody coupled to goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-biotin conjugate and detected with an avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. To determine whether ceruloplasmin became bound to myeloperoxidase, mixtures of the two proteins were applied to the plate, and myeloperoxidase was captured as described above. The plate was washed thoroughly, and ceruloplasmin was then detected using a polyclonal antibody to ceruloplasmin as described above for myeloperoxidase. Formation of hypochlorous acid was measured in a discontinuous assay by capturing it with taurine and then detecting accumulated taurine chloramine (30Dypbukt J.M. Bishop C. Brooks W.M. Thong B. Eriksson H. Kettle A.J. A sensitive and selective assay for chloramine production by myeloperoxidase.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase (20 nm) was incubated in the presence or absence of ceruloplasmin (100 nm) and taurine (5 mm) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm sodium chloride (PBS) and diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA, 100 μm) for 5–60 min. Hydrogen peroxide (50 μm) was added to start the reaction. After sufficient time to consume ∼50% of the hydrogen peroxide (3–10 min), reactions were stopped by the addition of catalase (32 μg/ml), and taurine chloramine was quantified by measuring the oxidation TMB in the presence of iodide. Production of hypochlorous acid was also measured in a continuous assay by monitoring the oxidation of ascorbate at 265.5 nm (ϵ265 = 15,000 m−1 cm−1) (31Chesney J.A. Mahoney Jr., J.R. Eaton J.W. A spectrophotometric assay for chlorine-containing compounds.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by the addition of a bolus of hydrogen peroxide (50 μm) to a solution containing myeloperoxidase (20 nm), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 0.01%), and ascorbate (100 μm) in PBS with DTPA (100 μm) plus or minus ceruloplasmin. Initial rates were determined over the first 30 s of the reaction. In experiments in which the concentration of chloride was varied, isotonicity was kept constant by the addition of Na2SO4. The halogenation of NADH was also used as a measure of the rate of hypochlorous or hypobromous acid production by myeloperoxidase (32Auchère F. Capeillère-Blandin C. NADPH as a co-substrate for studies of the chlorinating activity of myeloperoxidase.Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase was incubated with ceruloplasmin as described above, in the presence of NADH (100 μm) and either chloride (140 mm) or bromide (1 mm). Hydrogen peroxide (50 μm) was added to start hypohalous acid production, and the initial rate of NADH chlorohydrin or bromohydrin formation was determined over the first 30 s of the reaction by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 275 nm (ϵ275 = 11,000 m−1 cm−1) (33Protz W.A.

Myeloperoxidase (5 nm) was incubated with serotonin (0–1 mm) with or without ceruloplasmin (100 nm) for 1 h at room temperature in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing DTPA (100 μm) and CETAC (0.01%). Reactions were started by the addition of a bolus of hydrogen peroxide (50 μm), and the rate of serotonin dimer formation was monitored at 317 nm (34Ximenes V.F. Maghzal G.J. Turner R. Kato Y.

When used, hydrogen peroxide (50 μm) was added for 3 min prior to the addition of SDS-PAGE non-reducing loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Samples were loaded onto 7.5% T acrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. In immunoprecipitation experiments, samples were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and silver-stained. New protein bands were excised, analyzed, and identified by mass spectrometry. All gels were run at 200 V constant for ∼50 min. SDS-PAGE protein bands were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (35Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M.

Sci. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Eluted peptides were dried and resolubilized in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.2% (v/v) formic acid. Samples were injected onto an Ultimate 3000 nanoflow ultra-HPLC system (Dionex Co.) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptides were separated on an in-house packed emitter tip C-18 column at 200–500 nl/min by a gradient from 5 to 80% acetonitrile, both in 0.2% (v/v) formic acid. The mass range was scanned between m/z 300 and 2000. For protein identification, MS/MS data were searched against the HumanRefSeq 2 (38,753 sequences; 18,818,966 residues) database using the Mascot search engine (see the Matrix Science Web site). An Agilent spectrophotometer was used to record spectra of myeloperoxidase (1 μm) between 350 and 700 nm at 15-s intervals after the addition of hydrogen peroxide (100 μm). Reactions were performed in PBS with methionine (1 mm) added to scavenge hypochlorous acid. When added, ceruloplasmin or human serum albumin was present at 10 μm. Single turnover kinetics were measured on an SX-20MV stopped flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK), using either a photomultiplier to follow single wavelengths or a photodiode array to follo"
https://openalex.org/W1967832429,"Linking Mass and Time The precision of atomic clocks is based on the transitions between two well-defined energy levels—the frequency of oscillation. We know from relativity that mass and energy are equivalent and from quantum mechanics that energy relates to frequency. Therefore, the ticking of a clock can be related, in principle, to the mass of a particle. The oscillation frequency of a particle is known as its Compton frequency and, because of the high frequency involved and stability of atoms, it has been argued that a clock linking mass and time would offer very high precision. Ordinarily, the Compton frequency is extremely high and not accessible to direct excitation. Lan et al. (p. 554 , published online 10 January; see the Perspective by Debs et al.) demonstrate the operation of a Compton clock exploiting a related parameter, the phase accumulation rate of cold cesium atoms. Using an atom interferometer and an optical frequency comb to bring the Compton frequency into an experimentally accessible regime, mass and time could be directly linked."
https://openalex.org/W1972905290,"Mammals have three homologous genes encoding proteins with hyaluronan synthase activity (Has1-3), all producing an identical polymer from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid. To compare the properties of these isoenzymes, COS-1 cells, with minor endogenous hyaluronan synthesis, were transfected with human Has1-3 isoenzymes. HAS1 was almost unable to secrete hyaluronan or form a hyaluronan coat, in contrast to HAS2 and HAS3. This failure of HAS1 to synthesize hyaluronan was compensated by increasing the cellular content of UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine by ∼10-fold with 1 mm glucosamine in the growth medium. Hyaluronan synthesis driven by HAS2 was less affected by glucosamine addition, and HAS3 was not affected at all. Glucose-free medium, leading to depletion of the UDP-sugars, markedly reduced hyaluronan synthesis by all HAS isoenzymes while raising its concentration from 5 to 25 mm had a moderate stimulatory effect. The results indicate that HAS1 is almost inactive in cells with low UDP-sugar supply, HAS2 activity increases with UDP-sugars, and HAS3 produces hyaluronan at high speed even with minimum substrate content. Transfected Has2 and particularly Has3 consumed enough UDP-sugars to reduce their content in COS-1 cells. Comparison of different human cell types revealed ∼50-fold differences in the content of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and UDP-glucuronic acid, correlating with the expression level of Has1, suggesting cellular coordination between Has1 expression and the content of UDP-sugars."
https://openalex.org/W1991508224,"Inteins are naturally occurring intervening sequences that catalyze a protein splicing reaction resulting in intein excision and concatenation of the flanking polypeptides (exteins) with a native peptide bond. Inteins display a diversity of catalytic mechanisms within a highly conserved fold that is shared with hedgehog autoprocessing proteins. The unusual chemistry of inteins has afforded powerful biotechnology tools for controlling enzyme function upon splicing and allowing peptides of different origins to be coupled in a specific, time-defined manner. The extein sequences immediately flanking the intein affect splicing and can be defined as the intein substrate. Because of the enormous potential complexity of all possible flanking sequences, studying intein substrate specificity has been difficult. Therefore, we developed a genetic selection for splicing-dependent kanamycin resistance with no significant bias when six amino acids that immediately flanked the intein insertion site were randomized. We applied this selection to examine the sequence space of residues flanking the Nostoc punctiforme Npu DnaE intein and found that this intein efficiently splices a much wider range of sequences than previously thought, with little N-extein specificity and only two important C-extein positions. The novel selected extein sequences were sufficient to promote splicing in three unrelated proteins, confirming the generalizable nature of the specificity data and defining new potential insertion sites for any target. Kinetic analysis showed splicing rates with the selected exteins that were as fast or faster than the native extein, refuting past assumptions that the naturally selected flanking extein sequences are optimal for splicing."

The human PINK1 is a ubiquitously expressed 581-amino acid protein with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), a transmembrane domain (TM), and a highly conserved Ser/Thr kinase domain with homology to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase family (2.Valente E.M.

Three forms of PINK1 protein are detected in normal cell culture conditions: the full-length form (∼63 kDa) and two cleaved forms (∼55 and ∼45 kDa). Mitochondrially localized PINK1 is processed at the N terminus by mitochondrial processing peptidase (11.Greene A.W. Grenier K. Aguileta M.A. Muise S. Farazifard R. Haque M.E. McBride H.M. Park D.S.

In addition, studies in Drosophila and mammalian systems indicate that human PINK1 is cleaved between amino acids Ala-103 and Phe-104 by presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease (12.Deas E.

In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is guided to the mitochondrial inner membrane through the general mitochondrial import machinery, followed by proteolytic processing by presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease and rapid degradation, resulting in low levels of endogenous PINK1. In contrast, full-length PINK1 is accumulated at the outer mitochondrial membrane upon treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), which dissipates the Δψm (13.Meissner C.

Previously, we and others showed that PINK1 functions in a common pathway with Parkin to maintain mitochondrial integrity and function. Remarkably, PINK1 and Parkin mutant flies exhibit similar phenotypes, including mitochondrial defects, muscle degeneration, locomotor defects, disrupted spermatogenesis, and a reduced number of DA neurons (18.Park J.

Moreover, in cultured cells, Parkin overexpression compensates for mitochondrial dysfunction induced by PINK1 deficiency, indicating that Parkin acts downstream of PINK1 and that this linear pathway is well conserved in both mammals and Drosophila (22.Lutz A.K.

PINK1 as a molecular checkpoint in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and integrity.Mol. Cells. 2012; 34: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that can change their shape, size, and subcellular localization depending on the cellular environment. These dynamic processes are regulated by fusion, fission, and transport, all of which are also linked to the maintenance of proper mitochondrial functions. There has been controversy over whether the PINK1/Parkin pathway modulates mitochondrial fusion or fission. Cells derived from PINK1-defective patients have small fragmented mitochondria (30.Wood-Kaczmar A. Gandhi S. Yao Z. Abramov A.Y. Miljan E.A. Keen G. Stanyer L. Hargreaves I. Klupsch K. Deas E.

Schapira A.H. Taanman J.W. Silencing of PINK1 expression affects mitochondrial DNA and oxidative phosphorylation in dopaminergic cells.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas PINK1 and Parkin overexpression promote mitochondrial aggregation in mammalian cells (32.Kim Y.

In Drosophila, PINK1 loss of function results in swelling or enlargement of mitochondria, and these defective phenotypes of the dPINK1-null flies are strongly suppressed by the overexpression of Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1), which promotes mitochondrial fission, or the down-regulation of Opa1 (optic atrophy 1) or Marf (mitochondrial assembly regulatory factor), which promote fusion of the inner mitochondrial or the outer mitochondrial membrane, respectively (33.Park J.

Parkin is translocated to depolarized mitochondria upon treatment with CCCP, and Parkin-labeled mitochondria are subsequently eliminated by autophagy (mitophagy) (16.Becker D. Richter J.

In this study, to investigate the consequences of PINK1 mutations, we selected 17 representative missense mutations and analyzed their effects on proteolytic processing and subcellular distribution of PINK1 and on Parkin mitochondrial translocation. Unexpectedly, PINK1 mutants exhibited normal protein stability and expression patterns and did not exhibit altered subcellular distributions under normal and damaged mitochondria conditions. However, Parkin was not localized to mitochondria in cells harboring PINK1 mutations within the kinase domain. These results were further confirmed in the Drosophila system. Taken together, the results of this study, in which we systemically analyzed the effect of PINK1 mutations in both in vitro and in vivo model systems, improve our understanding of how PINK1 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Anti-rabbit PINK1 (Novus Biologicals), anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Myc (DSHB, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-rat HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-mouse β-tubulin (DSHB), and anti-mouse tyrosine hydroxylase (Immunostar) antibodies were used for immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analyses. Anti-mouse MTC02 (Abcam) or anti-rabbit TOM20 (Santa Cruz) antibody and MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) were used to visualize mitochondria. CCCP is purchased from Calbiochem. Toluidin blue (Sigma) and Alexa 488-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) were used for staining of muscle fibers and mitochondria in fly tissue. For site-directed mutagenesis, a QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene) was used. For generation of mutations, a pcDNA3.1 zeo (+) hPINK1 WT 3×Myc construct was used as a template. Information about the primers used in the experiments is available upon request. HeLa, HEK293T, and PINK1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The transfection of expression plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) or PEI (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell and fly lysates were prepared in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) and subjected to immunoblots according to standard procedure. The blots were developed and visualized using LAS-4000 (Fuji Film). For immunocytochemistry, HeLa and PINK1 KO MEF cells were subcultured on 12-well culture plate coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Appropriately treated cells were washed one time with PBS and were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Then the cells were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS-T) and incubated in blocking solution (4% BSA and 1% normal goat serum in PBS-T) for 1 h. Primary antibodies were added to the blocking solution, and the cells were incubated for overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T three times, the cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 45 min at room temperature. The antibody-labeled cells were washed with PBS-T six times and were mounted with mounting solution (100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in 90% glycerol). The slides were observed with a LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). All of the immunostaining experiments with HeLa cells were conducted at least three times (n = 300). We have previously generated dPINK1B9, UAS-dPINK1WT, and UAS-dPINK13KD line (18.Park J. Lee S.B. Lee S. Kim Y. Song S. Kim S. Bae E. Kim J. Shong M. Kim J.M. Chung J.

The following fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: hs-gal4 and gmr-gal4. All flies were grown on standard cornmeal-yeast-agar medium at 25 °C. Details of the genotypes used in the experiments are available upon request. For generation of G426D and L464P dPINK1 mutant transgenic lines, a QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene) was used. dPINK1 GD and LP DNAs were subcloned into HA-tagged pUAST vector and injected into w1118 embryos. Flies were crossed and maintained at 25 °C. SEM images were analyzed by SUPRA 55VP (Carl Zeiss) in a variable pressure secondary electron mode. The samples embedded in Spurr's resin were trimmed and sectioned from the lateral side of the thorax (at a thickness of 4 mm and between 200 and 350 mm in depth), and the serial sections were then stained with toluidine blue dye. For streptavidin staining, fly thoraces after fixation were cut in half by dissecting vertically along the bristles in the middle of the thorax. Approximately 10 thoraces of 3- or 45-day-old flies were observed in light microscopy (Leica) for each genotype. For quantification, the percentages of male flies with normal wings at 3 or 45 days were measured (n > 100). ATP assays were carried out as previously described (33.Park J. Lee G. Chung J. The PINK1-Parkin pathway is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial remodeling process.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The quantitative levels of ATP were measured (n > 5). Flight assays were performed as previously described with 3- or 45-day-old males (n > 30) (33.Park J. Lee G. Chung J. The PINK1-Parkin pathway is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial remodeling process.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 45-day-old adult fly brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-TH antibody as described previously (18.Park J. Lee S.B. Lee S. Kim Y. Song S. Kim S. Bae E. Kim J. Shong M. Kim J.M. Chung J. Mitochondrial dysfunction in Drosophila PINK1 mutants is complemented by parkin.Nature. 2006; 441: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The samples were observed and imaged by LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). TH-positive neurons were counted under blinded conditions. For quantification of DA neurons, the first dorsolateral regions from 15 brains of each genotype were observed in a blind fashion to eliminate bias (n = 30). The statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for related samples. The p values calculated were pooled from three independent experiments. To understand how PD-linked mutations affect the function of PINK1 protein, we selected 17 missense mutations based on the high frequency of disease onset in patients carrying these mutations, the conservation of these amino acids in PINK1 across species, and the importance of these conserved residues in maintaining protein structure and PINK1 catalytic activity (Table 1) (6.Ibáñez P.

https://openalex.org/W2093255890,"Root rot fungi of the Heterobasidion annosum complex are the most damaging pathogens in temperate forests, and the recently sequenced Heterobasidion irregulare genome revealed over 280 carbohydrate-active enzymes. Here, H. irregulare was grown on biomass, and the most abundant protein in the culture filtrate was identified as the only family 7 glycoside hydrolase in the genome, which consists of a single catalytic domain, lacking a linker and carbohydrate-binding module. The enzyme, HirCel7A, was characterized biochemically to determine the optimal conditions for activity. HirCel7A was crystallized and the structure, refined at 1.7 Å resolution, confirms that HirCel7A is a cellobiohydrolase rather than an endoglucanase, with a cellulose-binding tunnel that is more closed than Phanerochaete chrysosporium Cel7D and more open than Hypocrea jecorina Cel7A, suggesting intermediate enzyme properties. Molecular simulations were conducted to ascertain differences in enzyme-ligand interactions, ligand solvation, and loop flexibility between the family 7 glycoside hydrolase cellobiohydrolases from H. irregulare, H. jecorina, and P. chrysosporium. The structural comparisons and simulations suggest significant differences in enzyme-ligand interactions at the tunnel entrance in the -7 to -4 binding sites and suggest that a tyrosine residue at the tunnel entrance of HirCel7A may serve as an additional ligand-binding site. Additionally, the loops over the active site in H. jecorina Cel7A are more closed than loops in the other two enzymes, which has implications for the degree of processivity, endo-initiation, and substrate dissociation. Overall, this study highlights molecular level features important to understanding this biologically and industrially important family of glycoside hydrolases."
https://openalex.org/W2165777769,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in Western countries and is diagnosed by the clinical appearance of yellow subretinal deposits called drusen. Genetic changes in immune components are clearly implicated in the pathology of this disease. We have previously shown that the purinergic receptor P2X7 can act as a scavenger receptor, mediating phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and insoluble debris. We performed a genetic association study of functional polymorphisms in the P2RX7 and P2RX4 genes in a cohort of 744 patients with AMD and 557 age-matched Caucasian control subjects. The P2X4 Tyr315Cys variant was 2-fold more frequent in patients with AMD compared to control subjects, with the minor allele predicting susceptibility to disease. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium was observed between Tyr315Cys in the P2RX4 gene and Gly150Arg in the P2RX7 gene, and these two minor alleles formed a rare haplotype that was overrepresented in patients with AMD (n=17) compared with control subjects (n=3) (odds ratio 4.05, P=0.026). Expression of P2X7 (wild type or variant 150Arg) in HEK293 cells conferred robust phagocytosis toward latex beads, whereas coexpression of the P2X7 150Arg with P2X4 315Cys variants almost completely inhibited phagocytic capacity. Fresh human monocytes harboring this heterozygous 150Arg-315Cys haplotype showed 40% reduction in bead phagocytosis. In the primate eye, immunohistochemistry indicated that P2X7 and P2X4 receptors were coexpressed on microglia and macrophages, but neither receptor was seen on retinal pigment epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that a haplotype including two rare variants in P2RX7 and P2RX4 confers a functional interaction between these two variant receptors that impairs the normal scavenger function of macrophages and microglia. Failure of this P2X7-mediated phagocytic pathway may impair removal of subretinal deposits and predispose individuals toward AMD.—Gu, B. J., Baird, P. N., Vessey, K. A., Skarratt, K. K., Fletcher, E.

Here, we aimed to characterize novel AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-activating compounds that have a much lower effective concentration than metformin. As a result, emodin, a natural anthraquinone derivative, was shown to stimulate AMPK activity in skeletal muscle and liver cells. Emodin enhanced GLUT4 translocation and [14C]glucose uptake into the myotube in an AMPK-dependent manner. Also, emodin inhibited glucose production by suppressing the expression of key gluconeogenic genes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, in hepatocytes. Furthermore, we found that emodin can activate AMPK by inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory complex I activity, leading to increased reactive oxygen species and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase activity. Finally, we confirmed that a single dose administration of emodin significantly decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in C57Bl/6J mice. Increased insulin sensitivity was also confirmed after daily injection of emodin for 8 days using an insulin tolerance test and insulin-stimulated PI3K phosphorylation in wild type and high fat diet-induced diabetic mouse models.

https://openalex.org/W2138258292,"A large body of evidence for G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization has accumulated over the past 2 decades. The smallest of these oligomers in vivo most likely is a dimer that buries 1000-Å(2) intramolecular surfaces and on stimulation forms a complex with heterotrimeric G protein in 2:1 stoichiometry. However, it is unclear whether each of the monomers adopts the same or a different conformation and function after activation of this dimer. With bovine rhodopsin (Rho) and its cognate bovine G-protein transducin (Gt) as a model system, we used the retinoid chromophores 11-cis-retinal and 9-cis-retinal to monitor each monomer of the dimeric GPCR within a stable complex with nucleotide-free Gt. We found that only 50% of Rho* in the Rho*-Gt complex is trapped in a Meta II conformation, while 50% evolves toward an opsin conformation and can be regenerated with 9-cis-retinal. We also found that all-trans-retinal can regenerate chromophore-depleted Rho*e complexed with Gt and FAK*TSA peptide containing Lys(296) with the attached all-trans retinoid (m/z of 934.5[MH](+)) was identified by mass spectrometry. Thus, our study shows that each of the monomers contributes unequally to the pentameric (2:1:1:1) complex of Rho dimer and Gt heterotrimer, validating the oligomeric structure of the complex and the asymmetry of the GPCR dimer, and revealing its structural/functional signature. This study provides a clear functional distinction between monomers of family A GPCRs in their oligomeric form."

The molecular signals underlying the behavior observed in BL-BCa group are largely unknown, although recent results indicate a prevalent increase in Wnt/β-catenin activity. Our immunohistochemistry study confirmed that SOX9, one of the BL-BCa signature genes, was expressed by most BL-BCa, and its expression correlated with indicators of poor prognosis. Importantly, BCa gene expression profiling strongly associated SOX9 with the expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway components, LRP6 and TCF4. In cancer cell lines, SOX9 silencing reduced cell proliferation and invasion, LRP6 and TCF4 transcription, and decreased Wnt/β-catenin activation. SOX9 expression was also increased by Wnt, indicating that SOX9 is at the center of a positive feedback loop that enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Consistently, SOX9 overexpression in BCa cell lines and transgenic SOX9 expression in breast epithelium caused increased LRP6 and TCF4 expression and Wnt/β-catenin activation. These results identify SOX9-mediated Wnt/β-catenin activation as one of the molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant Wnt/β-catenin activity in BCa, especially in the BL-BCa subgroup."

These responses are associated with extensive transcriptional changes, modulation of a chemokine/chemokine receptor gene signature, and activation of the pleiotropic inflammatory mediator, STAT3.

To determine the effects of 11β-HSD1 deficiency on atherosclerosis and its inflammation, atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-KO) mice were treated with a selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor or crossed with 11β-HSD1-KO mice to generate double knockouts (DKOs) and challenged with an atherogenic Western diet. 11β-HSD1 inhibition or deficiency attenuated atherosclerosis (74–76%) without deleterious effects on plaque structure. This occurred without affecting plasma lipids or glucose, suggesting independence from classical metabolic risk factors. KO plaques were not more inflamed and indeed had 36% less T-cell infiltration, associated with 38% reduced circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and 36% lower lesional vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Bone marrow (BM) cells are key to the atheroprotection, since transplantation of DKO BM to irradiated ApoE-KO mice reduced atherosclerosis by 51%. 11β-HSD1-null macrophages show 76% enhanced cholesterol ester export. Thus, 11β-HSD1 deficiency reduces atherosclerosis without exaggerated lesional inflammation independent of metabolic risk factors.

Current alternating access models for ATP-binding cassette exporter activity suggest that ATP binding at the two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains provides a power stroke for the conformational switch of the two membrane domains from the inward-facing conformation to the outward-facing conformation. In outward-facing crystal structures of the bacterial homodimeric ATP-binding cassette transporters MsbA from gram-negative bacteria and Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus, two transmembrane helices (3 and 4) in the membrane domains have their cytoplasmic extensions in close proximity, forming a tetrahelix bundle interface. In biochemical experiments on MsbA from Escherichia coli, we show for the first time that a robust network of inter-monomer interactions in the tetrahelix bundle is crucial for the transmission of nucleotide-dependent conformational changes to the extracellular side of the membrane domains. Our observations are the first to suggest that modulation of tetrahelix bundle interactions in ATP-binding cassette exporters might offer a potent strategy to alter their transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2161481916,"With age, the collagen content of the heart increases, leading to interstitial fibrosis. We have shown that CD44pos fibroblasts derived from aged murine hearts display reduced responsiveness to TGF-β but, paradoxically, have increased collagen expression in vivo and in vitro. We postulated that this phenomenon was due to the defect in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation in a setting of elevated circulating insulin levels and production that we observed in aging mice. We discovered that cultured fibroblasts derived from aged but not young cardiac MSCs of nonhematopoietic lineage displayed increased basal and insulin-induced (1 nM) collagen expression (2-fold), accompanied by increased farnesyltransferase (FTase) and Erk activities. In a quest for a possible mechanism, we found that a chronic pathophysiologic insulin concentration (1 nM) caused abnormal fibroblast differentiation of MSCs isolated from young hearts. Fibroblasts derived from these MSCs responded to insulin by elevating collagen expression as seen in untreated aged fibroblast cultures, suggesting a causal link between increased insulin levels and defective MSC responses. Here we report an insulin-dependent pathway that specifically targets collagen type I transcriptional activation leading to a unique mechanism of fibrosis that is TGF-β and inflammation-independent in the aged heart.—Cieslik, K.

To understand the regulatory mechanisms governing these widespread phenotypic changes, we conducted a high resolution methylomic and transcriptomic analysis of six major stages of human erythroid differentiation. We observed widespread epigenetic differences between early and late stages of erythropoiesis with progressive loss of methylation being the dominant change during differentiation. Gene bodies, intergenic regions, and CpG shores were preferentially demethylated during erythropoiesis. Epigenetic changes at transcription factor binding sites correlated significantly with changes in gene expression and were enriched for binding motifs for SCL, MYB, GATA, and other factors not previously implicated in erythropoiesis. Demethylation at gene promoters was associated with increased expression of genes, whereas epigenetic changes at gene bodies correlated inversely with gene expression. Important gene networks encoding erythrocyte membrane proteins, surface receptors, and heme synthesis proteins were found to be regulated by DNA methylation. Furthermore, integrative analysis enabled us to identify novel, potential regulatory areas of the genome as evident by epigenetic changes in a predicted PU.1 binding site in intron 1 of the GATA1 gene. This intronic site was found to be conserved across species and was validated to be a novel PU.1 binding site by quantitative ChIP in erythroid cells.

Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of methylomic and transcriptomic changes during erythroid differentiation and demonstrates that human terminal erythropoiesis is surprisingly associated with hypomethylation of the genome. Multiple regulatory mechanisms regulate the activation and suppression of the overall gene transcription in hematopoiesis. Transcription factors are important in activation and suppression of lineage-specific genes during stem cell commitment to defined lineages. Prevailing concepts suggest that demethylation of the proximal promoter regions of genes is critical for binding of transactivating factors for transcriptional initiation. Accumulated data indicate that during the early phase of blood cell development, promoter regions of transcription factors are hypomethylated, thus allowing direct binding of transcription factors. On the other hand, following lineage commitment and expansion, most blood cells undergo terminal differentiation where the expression of limited sets of genes is needed. Therefore, it would be expected that hypermethylation of promoter regions would occur with associated repression of the non-erythroid gene transcriptional programs. Hypermethylation is also expected during nuclear condensation and enucleation that is seen during terminal erythroid differentiation. Because there are no genome-wide studies of human erythropoiesis, we examined the changes in DNA methylation in primary erythroid cells representing all major stages of differentiation. Several experimental approaches are available to determine genome-wide DNA methylation levels. Most of these techniques are based on restriction enzyme digestion or DNA immunoprecipitation with antibodies that bind to methylated CpGs (1Esteller M. Cancer epigenetics.

We examined changes in methylation at multiple time points during terminal differentiation using a human erythroid in vitro model that is capable of generating every major stage of erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts in a dynamic fashion.

These data alter the prevailing notion of the need for increased methylation and an “inactive” genome in differentiated cells. Furthermore, the current study demonstrates the value of using epigenetic imprints to uncover novel transcription factors that were previously unknown to be important in functions associated with terminal differentiation events. CD34+ early stem/hematopoietic cells were purified from growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood of healthy donors purchased from All Cells Inc. Purified stem/progenitor cells were cultured in medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 15% human serum Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 2 units/ml EPO, and 50 ng/ml SCF. During the initial 7 days of culture, cells were fed on days 3 and 6 by adding an equal volume of fresh culture medium supplemented with growth factors. However, no new IL-3 was added after the initial addition on day 0, and the amount of SCF added to the fresh medium was gradually decreased at each feeding (day 3, 25 ng/ml; day 6, 10 ng/ml; day 8, 2 ng/ml). The amount of EPO added was 2 units/ml during each feeding. On day 7 of culture, cells were flow cytometry-sorted for CD71-positive (transferrin receptor) cells using a MoFlo high speed flow cytometer. The purity of the population isolated by this method was 98–99%. Sorted cells were cultured in the same medium as before with EPO and SCF, except the concentration of SCF was reduced to 2 ng/ml. Cells were fed one more time on day 10 of culture by adding an equal volume of fresh medium with only EPO (2 units/ml) during this final feeding. Cells were collected for DNA and RNA isolation on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 13, and 16 of culture. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to monitor commitment to the erythroid lineage and for continued erythroid differentiation using fluorochrome-conjugated CD71 and Glycophorin A, two surface proteins that are expressed in erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts, respectively.

HELP microarray data have been submitted to the GEO database. All microarray hybridizations were subjected to extensive quality control. Uniformity of hybridization was evaluated using a modified version of a previously published algorithm (4Thompson R.F. Reimers M. Khulan B. Gissot M. Richmond T.A. Chen Q. Zheng X. Kim K.

Validation of HELP microarray findings was carried out by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using EpiTyper by MassArray (Sequenom) on bisulfite-converted DNA as described previously (11Figueroa M.E.

MassArray primers were designed to cover the flanking HpaII sites for a given HpaII-amplifiable fragment as well as any other HpaII sites found up to 2,000 bp upstream of the downstream site and up to 2,000 bp downstream of the upstream site, in order to cover all possible alternative sites of digestion. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy minikits. Samples from the same cell preparations used for DNA isolation was used for RNA isolation. RNA integrity was corroborated with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. RNA (100 ng/μl; 3 μl) was submitted to the Genomics Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, for gene expression studies using the NimbleGen array (2006-10-26_Human_60mer_1in2) containing at least 10 (60-mer) probes designed for 37,364 genes from GenBankTM build 35. A comprehensive set of RNA expression profiles was obtained and used for analysis to correlate with our methylation profiling data. Signal intensities at each HpaII-amplifiable fragment were calculated as a robust (25% trimmed) mean of their component probe level signal intensities. Any fragments found within the level of background MspI signal intensity, measured as 2.5 mean absolute differences above the median of random probe signals, were categorized as “failed.” These failed loci therefore represent the population of fragments that did not amplify by PCR, whatever the biological (e.g. genomic deletions and other sequence errors) or experimental cause. On the other hand, “methylated” loci were so designated when the level of HpaII signal intensity was similarly indistinguishable from background. PCR-amplifying fragments (those not flagged as either methylated or failed) were normalized using an intra-array quantile approach wherein HpaII/MspI ratios are aligned across density-dependent sliding windows of fragment size-sorted data. The log2(HpaII/MspI) was used as a representative for methylation and analyzed as a continuous variable. For most loci, each fragment was categorized as either methylated (if the centered log HpaII/MspI ratio was less than zero) or hypomethylated (if, on the other hand, the log ratio was greater than zero). The data have been submitted to the GEO database. (GEO accession no. GSE44054.) Unsupervised clustering of HELP data by hierarchical clustering was performed using the statistical software R, version 2.6.2. A two-sample t test was used for each gene to summarize methylation differences between groups. Genes were ranked on the basis of this test statistic, and a set of top differentially methylated genes with an observed log -fold change of >1 between group means was identified. Genes were further grouped according to the direction of the methylation change (hypomethylated versus hypermethylated), and the relative frequencies of these changes were computed among the top candidates to explore global methylation patterns. Validations with MassArray showed good correlation with the data generated by the HELP assay. MassArray analysis validated significant quantitative differences in methylation for differentially methylated genes selected by our approach. Genomic coordinates were obtained from the HG18 build of the human genome from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) browser. Genomic regions 2 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start sites were annotated as promoters. 2-kb flanking regions around the edges of CpG islands were annotated as CpG shores. Transcription factor binding sites were obtained from the Yale transcription factor binding site (TFBS) database in the browser. Regions of 200 bp around the TFBS were used for overlap with differentially methylated regions. Using the Ingenuity (Redwood City, CA) Pathway Analysis software, enrichment of genes associated with specific canonical pathways was determined relative to the Ingenuity knowledge database at a significance level of p < 0.01. Transcription factor binding sites in the demethylated regions were determined by the HOMER algorithm (13Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N. Bertolino E. Lin Y.C. Laslo P. Cheng J.X. Murre C. Singh H.

Human CD34+ stem/early progenitors were cultured under defined conditions to enable commitment to erythroid lineage, expansion of erythroid progenitors, and subsequent terminal differentiation into reticulocytes by 16 days of culture (Fig. 1A). In this model, the first erythroid lineage-committed cells (burst forming unit-erythroid; BFU-E) are observed by day 3 of culture, and they continue to grow and reach proerythroblast/basophilic erythroblast stage by day 7 (Fig. 1). These basophilic erythroblasts continue to proliferate and by day 10 reach the orthochromatic stage of maturation. From the time of lineage commitment until very late stages of differentiation, the cells continue to transcribe globin genes and other erythroid-specific genes that ultimately characterize cells of red blood cell origin (15Wickrema A.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, these primary human cells are capable of extruding their nuclei during the terminal phase of differentiation to give rise to reticulocytes. Overall, this model is able to recapitulate the erythroid differentiation program in a stage-specific manner and therefore is ideal for following changes in epigenetic signaling leading to modification of the DNA landscape in a dynamic fashion. We used the HELP assay to interrogate global cytosine methylation changes at each stage of maturation during the stem cell to reticulocyte development program. Parallel gene expression analysis was conducted for transcriptomic analysis. Two independent sets of experiments were performed and analyzed. The analysis of methylome and transcriptome showed good correlations between the two biological replicates (Fig. 2A). The heat map based on Pearson's correlation demonstrated accumulation of epigenetic and transcriptomic changes during erythroid differentiation, with similarity in global expression and methylation profiles between proximate differentiation states (Fig. 2, A and B). Unsupervised clustering based on methylation profiles revealed that most striking changes occurred from the transition of early (days 0–7) to late (days 10–16) stages of erythropoiesis (Fig. 2C). Parallel gene expression analysis also revealed changes in gene expression between early and late stages of erythropoiesis, although the main shift in gene expression patterns was observed after day 10 of differentiation (Fig. 2D). This demonstrated that although both methylomic and transcriptomic changes occur during erythropoiesis, large scale changes in the epigenome precede similar changes in the transcriptome. Having demonstrated epigenetic dissimilarity between early and late erythroid cells, we next determined the qualitative epigenetic differences between these groups by performing a supervised analysis of the respective DNA methylation profiles. A volcano plot comparing the differences between mean methylation of individual loci between different stages of differentiation against the significance (log(p value) based on t test) of the difference was used to represent these data in Fig. 3A. We observed that progressive hypomethylation was seen during erythroid differentiation. The loss of methylation was particularly striking when compared between the early and late erythroid progenitors (Fig. 3A, last panel; differentially methylated loci in red had a false discovery rate of <0.1 after Benjamini Hochberg correction) and was significantly higher when compared with hypermethylation. (A two-tailed t test was used to compare significance of difference between hypo- and hypermethylated loci and demonstrated a p value of <0.0001). Although the hypomethylation affected all parts of the genome (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table 1), intergenic regions and gene bodies were found to be most significantly affected by loss of methylation (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, a greater proportion of CpG shores were also found to be affected by hypomethylation when compared with CpG islands, consistent with other recent observations implicating these genomic regions as targets of aberrant methylation in cancer (7Irizarry R.A. Ladd-Acosta C. Wen B. Wu Z. Montano C. Onyango P. Cui H. Gabo K. Rongione M. Webster M. Ji H. Potash J.B. Sabunciyan S. Feinberg A.P. The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo- and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Correlation with changes in gene expression showed that differentially hypomethylated regions correlated with changes in gene expression. Hypomethylation at promoters was associated with increased expression of genes in late stages of erythropoiesis (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, hypomethylation at gene bodies was associated with decreased expression of genes (Fig. 4B), consistent with recent reports that highlight this inverse association (8Ball M.P. Li J.B. Gao Y. Lee J.H. LeProust E.M. Park I.H. Xie B. Daley G.Q. Church G.M. Targeted and genome-scale strategies reveal gene-body methylation signatures in human cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that changes in DNA methylation at intragenic regions can regulate transcription by affecting transcription factor binding at enhancer regions. We mapped TFBS across the genome and studied the effect of epigenetic changes at these locations. Determination of the effect of differential methylation on global gene expression showed that changes at TFBS were associated with the greatest magnitude of changes in expression (Fig. 4C). Further analysis of all TFBS that were affected by hypomethylation and were associated with differentially expressed genes revealed that a large proportion of these sites were actually situated in gene bodies (Fig. 4D), suggesting that these intragenic regulatory areas are probably involved in regulating transcriptomic changes. In order to further confirm our findings, we performed the MALDI-TOF (MassArray, Sequenom) assay, which enabled us to quantitatively estimate the extent of methylation of selected loci in the genome. These experiments revealed a strong correlation with the findings of our HELP microarrays, further demonstrating that hypomethylation of various regulatory regions of the genome is an important phenomenon during the erythroid differentiation program (supplemental Fig. 1). Because epigenetic changes at TFBS were associated with transcriptomic changes, we wanted to determine whether these hypomethylated loci shared any common DNA motifs. A search for transcription factor binding motifs within differentially methylated loci (HOMER program) (13Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N. Bertolino E. Lin Y.C. Laslo P. Cheng J.X. Murre C. Singh H. Glass C.K. Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis-regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 576-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6335) Google Scholar) revealed significant overrepresentation of binding sites for many transcription factors. Among them, SCL, Myb, GATA2, NF1, and the NFY family of proteins are well known to participate in regulation of erythroid differentiation program and therefore likely to bind one or more of these predicted motifs. In addition, our analysis also revealed enrichment of binding motifs within the hypomethylated regions for multiple proteins that have not been implicated in regulation of the erythroid differentiation program (Table 1). Because genes corresponding to these proteins are expressed in these cells, according to our array data, it is likely that many of these proteins directly bind DNA and modulate the gene transcription program.TABLE 1Transcription factor binding sites enriched in demethylated regions"
https://openalex.org/W2060510631,"The cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) compose a subclass of intracellularly acting genotoxins produced by many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria that disrupt the normal progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Here, the intoxication mechanisms of CDTs from Escherichia coli (Ec-CDT) and Haemophilus ducreyi (Hd-CDT), which share limited amino acid sequence homology, were directly compared. Ec-CDT and Hd-CDT shared comparable in vitro DNase activities of the CdtB subunits, saturable cell surface binding with comparable affinities, and the requirement for an intact Golgi complex to induce cell cycle arrest. In contrast, disruption of endosome acidification blocked Hd-CDT-mediated cell cycle arrest and toxin transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, while having no effects on Ec-CDT. Phosphorylation of the histone protein H2AX, as well as nuclear localization, was inhibited for Hd-CdtB, but not Ec-CdtB, in cells expressing dominant negative Rab7 (T22N), suggesting that Hd-CDT, but not Ec-CDT, is trafficked through late endosomal vesicles. In support of this idea, significantly more Hd-CdtB than Ec-CdtB co-localized with Rab9, which is enriched in late endosomal compartments. Competitive binding studies suggested that Ec-CDT and Hd-CDT bind to discrete cell surface determinants. These results suggest that Ec-CDT and Hd-CDT are transported within cells by distinct pathways, possibly mediated by their interaction with different receptors at the cell surface."

Interligand NOEs (ILOEs) between small molecule ligands can be used as a powerful tool to aid and guide fragment-based drug discovery (13Chen J. Zhang Z. Stebbins J.L. Zhang X. Hoffman R. Moore A.

An NMR-based approach to reverse chemical genetics.Chemistry. 2006; 12: 2658-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). If two or more small molecules bind to a macromolecule in close proximity to each other, the strong negative ILOEs that develop in their bound complex geometries can be observed even in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of the target, provided there is a rapid exchange between the bound and free state (15Becattini B. Pellecchia M. SAR by ILOEs. An NMR-based approach to reverse chemical genetics.Chemistry. 2006; 12: 2658-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pairs of suspected weak inhibitors can be chosen as prospects for binding to a protein either based on structural characteristics or by screening chemical libraries. Protein-mediated ILOEs can then assist in pharmacophore identification and guide the design and synthesis of bidentate ligands using the weak binding fragments as building blocks. Two-dimensional NOESY techniques are the methods of choice to investigate structural relationships in large biological molecules, primarily because all of the data are collected at once, and the expected NOEs are large and negative. However, ILOEs between small molecules can be very weak and difficult to detect and differentiate because of chemical shift overlaps and background issues typical of two-dimensional NOESY experiments (16Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. One-dimensional NOE experiments using pulsed field gradients.J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Such issues can adversely limit the application of the method and the ability to obtain and interpret NOE data. Overcoming these limitations would require longer mixing times (beyond 500 ms), thereby excluding the early time points of the NOE buildup that are crucial for distance measurements. In partial mitigation of these issues, we sought to extend traditional ILOE NMR by use of the selective one-dimensional NOE technique pioneered by Shaka and co-workers (16Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. One-dimensional NOE experiments using pulsed field gradients.J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Stott K. Stonehouse J. Keeler J. Hwang T.-L.

Soc. 1995; 117: 4199-4200Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and later refined by Hu and Krishnamurthy (18Hu H. Krishnamurthy K. Revisiting the initial rate approximation in kinetic NOE measurements.J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 182: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, as opposed to the conventional steady state approach, the transient NOEs arising only from selectively inverted resonances are detected. Pairs of selective pulses and pulsed field gradients are used in a double pulsed field gradient spin echo (DPFGSE) sequence to cleanly select and invert specific resonances such that only those signals related to NOEs originating from the inverted signal are detected. Background and chemical shift overlap issues are therefore removed (16Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. One-dimensional NOE experiments using pulsed field gradients.J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Stott K. Stonehouse J. Keeler J. Hwang T.-L. Shaka A.J. Excitation sculpting in high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Application to selective NOE experiments.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 4199-4200Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Selective one-dimensional NOE experiments enable significantly increased sensitivity per unit of data collection time, effectively extending NOE detection and distance limits, and better supporting systems with short lifetimes. In addition, NOE buildup curves can easily be constructed to include shorter mixing times. In this article, we demonstrate the use of this technique for detecting ILOEs between two ligands bound to KasA. We have previously shown that TLM is a slow onset inhibitor of the KasA acyl enzyme (11Machutta C.A. Bommineni G.R. Luckner S.R. Kapilashrami K. Ruzsicska B. Simmerling C. Kisker C. Tonge P.J. Slow onset inhibition of bacterial β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases by thiolactomycin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6161-6169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the knowledge that TLM mimics the malonyl group of malonyl-AcpM, the second substrate in the ping-pong reaction catalyzed by KasA. Structural data suggest that TLM might bind to KasA in the presence of ligands that occupy the pantetheine-binding channel (19Luckner S.R. Machutta C.A. Tonge P.J. Kisker C. Crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis KasA show mode of action within cell wall biosynthesis and its inhibition by thiolactomycin.Structure. 2009; 17: 1004-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a pantetheine analog (PK940) and used ILOE NMR spectroscopy to analyze the interaction of this compound with TLM and KasA. Because malonyl-AcpM and TLM interact preferentially with the KasA acyl-enzyme, the C171Q KasA mutant was used for many of the experiments because this mutation has previously been shown to lead to structural changes in the active site that mimic acylation of Cys-171 (3Wang J.

Based on these studies, we then synthesized TLM analogs that have higher affinity for KasA than the parent compound. 5(R,S)-Thiolactomycin was obtained from Sigma. Chemicals for analog synthesis were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Enantiomerically pure 5(R)-TLM was synthesized using a reported protocol (6McFadden J.M.

C171Q KasA and wild-type KasA were expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 and purified as described previously (11Machutta C.A. Bommineni G.R. Luckner S.R. Kapilashrami K. Ruzsicska B.

C171Q KasA was exchanged into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride D2O, pD 8.5 buffer. 5(R,S)-TLM and PK940 were dissolved in the phosphate buffer to give final concentrations in the experiment of 8 and ∼4 mm, respectively. In the case of enantiomerically pure 5(R)-TLM, equimolar concentrations of the two ligands were used at ∼4 mm. The concentration of enzyme in the experiments was 30 μm. All NMR data were acquired on standard bore 700 or 900 MHz Bruker Avance NMR instruments at 15 °C using samples prepared in D2O solvents. The spectra were processed using Bruker TOPSPIN 2.1 software. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra were collected at 700 MHz over a range of mixing times (50–900 ms) using a spectral width of 7716.05 Hz in F2 and 2048 complex data points for an acquisition time of 0.133 s with a 2-s recycle delay. 256 points were collected in the indirect F1 dimension for a 0.0166-s acquisition time. 40 scans were collected per F1 increment, and F1 quadrature detection was achieved using the States-TPPI method (24Marion D.

Time domain data were apodized using squared sine bell functions in both dimensions and zero-filled in the indirect dimension to a final data matrix size of 1024 (F1) × 2048 (F2) after Fourier transformation. Selective one-dimensional DPFGSE NOE data were collected using a spectral width of 14005.6 Hz and 32768 complex data points for a 1.17-s acquisition time with a 2-s recycle delay. Selective Gaussian pulses of 120 ms were used to invert the target resonances in the PK940 methyl cluster to observe interligand transfer of NOEs to the TLM methyl groups (16Stott K. Keeler J.

Binding of TLM and the TLM analogs to KasA was quantified by monitoring changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the enzyme using 280-nm excitation and 337-nm emission as described (11Machutta C.A. Bommineni G.R. Luckner S.R. Kapilashrami K. Ruzsicska B. Simmerling C. Kisker C. Tonge P.J. Slow onset inhibition of bacterial β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases by thiolactomycin.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6161-6169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The data were collected using a Quanta Master fluorimeter (Photon Technology International) with excitation and emission slit widths of 4.0 and 8.0 nm, respectively. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO or buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.5) and titrated into 1 μm solutions of enzyme in the same Tris buffer. Titration curves were corrected for the inner filter effect, and the Kd values were calculated using the quadratic Morrison equation (Grafit 4.0). To quantify the slow onset binding kinetics of analogs to C171Q KasA, the fluorescence emission was monitored as a function of time for 40 min. The change in fluorescence intensity was fit to Equation 1 (11Machutta C.A. Bommineni G.R. Luckner S.R. Kapilashrami K. Ruzsicska B. Simmerling C. Kisker C. Tonge P.J.

Equation 3 (26Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis.2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York. 2000; Google Scholar) was then used to calculate the kon values. kobs=koff1+[I]Kiapp 1+[I]Kiapp(Eq. 2) Ki*=Ki1+konkoff(Eq. 3) Conflicting 1H NMR assignments have been reported for some of the TLM resonances in earlier literature (25Sasaki H. Oishi H. Hayashi T. Matsuura I. Ando K. Sawada M. Thiolactomycin, a new antibiotic. II. Structure elucidation.J. Antibiot. 1982; 35: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); therefore the 1H and 13C NMR spectra for TLM and TLM analogs were reassigned using values obtained from our 1H one-dimensional, 1H-1H COSY, 1H-13C Heteronuclear Multiple-Quantum Correlation, and Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation NMR data. These assignments agree with values presented in more recent literature (27Brown M.S. Akopiants K. Resceck D.M. McArthur H.A. McCormick E. Reynolds K.A. Biosynthetic origins of the natural product, thiolactomycin. A unique and selective inhibitor of type II dissociated fatty acid synthases.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 10166-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The methyl peaks of TLM at C6, C7, and C12 (Fig. 2) were assigned to the resonances at 1.41, 1.50, and 1.44 ppm respectively. For the PK940 ligand, nonprochiral assignments of the singlet proton peaks at 0.714 and 0.75 ppm were made to the geminal methyl groups at C9′ and C10′, and the doublet of doublets centered near 0.708 ppm was assigned to the terminal methyl protons at C1′ (Fig. 2). The overlap of the PK940 C1′ methyl resonance with the upfield C9′/C10′ methyl singlet hinders the analysis of the standard one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional NOESY spectra. After revisiting the assignments of TLM, we performed a standard two-dimensional NOE experiment similar to that performed in other ILOE NMR experiments (15Becattini B. Pellecchia M. SAR by ILOEs. An NMR-based approach to reverse chemical genetics.Chemistry. 2006; 12: 2658-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the two-dimensional NOE spectra in Fig. 3 shows apparent negative ILOE cross-peaks between the C6, C12, and C7 TLM methyl resonances at 1.41, 1.44, and 1.50 ppm, respectively, and the PK940 methyl cluster peaks spanning 0.71–0.75 ppm. The cross-peaks have chemical shifts equal to the other C2′ and C3′ NOE signals observed from the K940 methylene groups at 1.15 and 1.32 ppm, respectively. Given the close proximity of the geminal C9′ and C10′ methyls, we expect that they should have similar NOEs to any point on TLM. The presence of only one associated ILOE eliminates the geminal methyls as the interacting partners with TLM. In our experiments, we were able to observe ILOEs between TLM and the pantetheine analog (PK940) only at mixing times longer than 500 ms and were unable to detect ILOE signals at the shorter mixing times required for distance assessment. The lack of sensitivity and the inability to detect and differentiate signal in the presence of overlapping chemical shifts and high background noise have previously been reported to hinder ILOE detection involving small molecules (16Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. One-dimensional NOE experiments using pulsed field gradients.J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Consequently, we acquired one-dimensional NOE data using the DPFGSE method, inverting the PK940 methyl cluster signal at ∼0.75 ppm. Because of enhanced sensitivity, the one-dimensional experiment (16Stott K. Keeler J. Van Q.N. Shaka A.J. One-dimensional NOE experiments using pulsed field gradients.J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 302-324Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Stott K. Stonehouse J. Keeler J. Hwang T.-L. Shaka A.J. Excitation sculpting in high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Application to selective NOE experiments.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 4199-4200Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar) allowed detection of the ILOE signal even at very low mixing times (∼100 ms), giving us very clean and easily interpretable spectra. Moreover, the acquisition times were greatly reduced for the one-dimensional experiment, which also improved the quality of the data given that the enzyme was not very stable for long periods of time under the experimental conditions employed. The one-dimensional NOE experiment also indicated the presence of transient interligand NOEs between the three TLM methyls and the PK940 methyl cluster in the presence of the enzyme (Fig. 4). The simultaneous selective inversion of the three TLM methyl groups allowed us to specifically assign these ILOEs to interactions between the three TLM methyl groups and the terminal C1′ methyl of PK940. NOE buildup curves were obtained for the three TLM methyls over a range of mixing times (Fig. 5A). The NOE intensities, normalized with respect to the inverted peak intensity, were plotted against the mixing time to obtain buildups that, to a large extent, canceled the effect of external relaxation at moderate mixing times (18Hu H. Krishnamurthy K. Revisiting the initial rate approximation in kinetic NOE measurements.J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 182: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Using the distance between the TLM vinyl protons on C11 (1.85 Å) as a reference, the distances between the C1′ PK940 methyl and TLM C12, C6, and C7 methyls were calculated to be 3.0, 3.4, and 3.4 Å, respectively. To refine the relative positions of the two ligands, we attempted to invert the three TLM methyls individually to observe the ILOE with the terminal methyl of PK940. This turned out to be a challenging task for a number of reasons. Initially, the chemical shifts of the three TLM methyls are very close, making individual inversion problematic. Use of a higher magnetic field (900 MHz) increased the separation of the three peaks sufficiently to provide selectivity in the absence of the enzyme. However, upon addition of enzyme, we observed a loss of selectivity, wherein inversion of all three methyls was observed upon inversion of any one methyl, especially at higher mixing times. This observation can be explained by proposing that the dipolar coupling between KasA and TLM provides a route for cross-relaxation between the KasA methyls/methylenes and TLM methyls by spin diffusion (28Edzes H.T. Samulski E.T. Cross relaxation and spin diffusion in the proton NMR or hydrated collagen.Nature. 1977; 265: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Attempts to target the PK940 methyl cluster at ∼0.71 ppm and the singlet at 0.75 ppm exclusively on a 900-MHz field also resulted in a loss of selectivity that worsened at higher mixing times. Additionally, the expected line broadening caused by modulation in the transverse relaxation time (T2) in the bound and the unbound state of the ligands could contribute to the observed loss of selectivity. Despite these issues, we were able to selectively invert the downfield TLM methyl (C7) using a 180-ms Gaussian pulse at 900 MHz. Moreover, we observed similar rates of ILOE buildup (supplemental Fig. S3) compared with inversion of the PK940 methyl cluster. Several control experiments were performed to confirm that the observed signal was an ILOE and not a transferred NOE with the protein. First, the experiments were repeated in the absence of the enzymes as a control. No ILOE was observed between the two ligands. Second, no signal was observed at ∼1.45 ppm when the bandwidth at ∼0.75 ppm was irradiated in the presence of only TLM and enzyme, whereas negative ILOEs were observed when PK940 was also present. Similarly, no signal was observed at ∼0.75 ppm when the methyl bandwidth at ∼1.45 ppm was irradiated in the presence of only PK940 and enzyme. These controls confirmed the presence of ILOEs between TLM and PK940 with the terminal methyl of PK940 oriented toward the TLM methyl groups. Using this information, we modeled PK940 into the active site of KasA using the x-ray structure of the TLM-C171Q KasA complex (19Luckner S.R. Machutta C.A. Tonge P.J. Kisker C.

To satisfy the constraints imposed by the NMR data, PK940 must occupy the putative KasA pantetheine-binding pocket (Fig. 6A). This structural analysis suggested that elaboration of the TLM thiolactone ring at either the 3 or the 4"

Regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is critical for myriad functions within the cell, and imbalance of pHi can have severe consequences for cell survival. The electrogenic Na+/HCO3− co-transporter (NBCe1) 2 is widely distributed and is essential for pHi regulation (1Park K. Hurley P.T. Roussa E. Cooper G.J. Smith C.P. Thévenod F. Steward M.C. Case R.M.

The inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-binding protein, IRBIT, is the most well known mechanism of NBCe1-B regulation (9Shirakabe K. Priori G. Yamada H. Ando H. Horita S. Fujita T. Fujimoto I.

IRBIT enhances the activity of NBCe1-B via two distinct mechanisms; that is, directly by increasing the per-molecule activity of NBCe1-B (9Shirakabe K. Priori G. Yamada H. Ando H. Horita S. Fujita T. Fujimoto I. Mizutani A. Seki G. Mikoshiba K. IRBIT, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-binding protein, specifically binds to and activates pancreas-type Na+/HCO3− cotransporter 1 (pNBC1).Proc.

Role of IRBIT vs. amino-terminal truncation.Am. J. Physiol.

Li Q. So I. Huang C.L. Ando H. Mizutani A. Seki G. Mikoshiba K. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. IRBIT governs epithelial secretion in mice by antagonizing the WNK/SPAK kinase pathway.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). IRBIT is also known to bind NHE3 and increase its activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner (12He P. Zhang H. Yun C.C. IRBIT, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor-binding protein released with IP3, binds Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, and activates NHE3 activity in response to calcium.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33544-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the other hand a plethora of interacting partners have been reported for the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 that act to either directly regulate exchanger activity or as a scaffold for downstream signaling events (13Boedtkjer E. Bunch L. Pedersen S.F. Physiology, pharmacology, and pathophysiology of the pH regulatory transport proteins NHE1 and NBCn1. Similarities, differences, and implications for cancer therapy.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2012; 18: 1345-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, calcineurin homologous protein 1 (CHP1) has recently been proposed to bind to NHE1 and enhance surface expression by stabilization at the plasma membrane (14Matsushita M. Tanaka H. Mitsui K. Kanazawa H. Dual functional significance of calcineurin homologous protein 1 binding to Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 301: C280-C288Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, data on NBCe1-B and NHE1 expression-modifying binding partners, especially in endogenous expression systems, remains scarce. Using yeast two hybrid screening we identified an interaction between NBCe1-B and the stress 70 protein chaperone STCH, a microsome-associated member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family that also encodes a core ATPase. Synonyms for STCH include “microsomal stress 70 protein ATPase core” and “heat shock 70-kDa protein member 13” (HSPA13). In humans STCH is constitutively expressed in all cell types and is induced by increases in cytoplasmic calcium but not by heat shock (15Otterson G.A. Flynn G.C. Kratzke R.A. Coxon A. Johnston P.G. Kaye F.J. Stch encodes the ATPase core of a microsomal stress 70 protein.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recent genomic studies have linked the Stch gene to several brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, and autism (16Han P. Wang X.F. Wang L.

Stch has also been suggested as a candidate plasticity gene (19Heimel J.A. Hermans J.M. Sommeijer J.P. Neuro-Bsik Mouse Phenomics consortium Levelt C.N. Genetic control of experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex.Genes Brain Behav. 2008; 7: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and genetic mutations of Stch are thought to be associated with cancer occurring through tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis pathway (20Yamagata N. Furuno K. Sonoda M. Sugimura H. Yamamoto K. Stomach cancer-derived del223V-226L mutation of the STCH gene causes loss of sensitization to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 376: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At the molecular level it is reported that STCH interacts with the ubiquitin-like proteins Chap1 and Chap2 (cyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptide 1 and 2), which are known to modulate transit through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (21Kaye F.J. Modi S. Ivanovska I. Koonin E.V. Thress K. Kubo A. Kornbluth S. Rose M.D. A family of ubiquitin-like proteins binds the ATPase domain of Hsp70-like Stch.FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the major cellular role of STCH has until now remained poorly understood. In our study STCH increased the surface expression of NBCe1-B in transiently transfected Xenopus oocytes, and functional analysis showed that endogenous STCH was required for full recovery of NBCe1-B and NHE1 from acidic pHi in human submandibular gland (HSG) ductal cells. Thus we demonstrate for the first time a role for STCH in pHi regulation though the enhancement of NBCe1-B and NHE1 activity. Bait fragments (aa 96–440 of NBCe1-B) were cloned into the yeast binding domain vector pGBKT7 that carries the trp1 gene (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For preparing prey construct, a library of human submandibular gland (hSMG) PCR products was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA according to manufacturer's protocols (Clontech). The hSMG PCR products linearized activation domain vector pGADT7-Rec (carrying the leu2 gene). The bait construct and prey library were cotransformed into competent yeast cells (strain AH109) containing the MEL1 expression system that encodes α-galactosidase. Interaction of GAL4 (binding domain) and GAL4 (activation domain) fusion proteins enables the cells to grow on selection medium (−Ade/−Trp/−Leu/−His). Cotransformed yeast was cultured on a selection plate containing X-α-gal. Candidates were selected based on visualization of the blue α-galactosidase product. Putative positive interactions between bait and prey proteins were analyzed using an α-galactosidase assay, which measures the quantity of enzyme secreted into the culture medium. Quadruple dropout liquid medium (lacking X-α-gal) was inoculated with positive colonies and incubated at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5–1.0 (16∼18 h). Yeast cultures (1 ml) were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, and 8 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 24 μl of assay buffer. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 960 μl of 0.1 m Na2CO3. The absorbance at 410 nm was measured, and α-galactosidase units were determined and compared with positive and negative controls. NBCe1-B wild type and N-terminal deletion mutants, aa 1–95 (Δ95aa) and 1–345 (Δ345aa), were cloned in pFLAG CMV2 vector and pBluescript II SK(+) vector to generate pFLAG CMV2-NBCe1-B, Δ95aa, and Δ345aa for expressing in HSG cells and pBluescript II SK(+)-NBCe1-B, Δ95aa, and Δ345aa for expressing in Xenopus oocytes, respectively. Also, STCH wild type and N-terminal deletion mutants aa 1–314 (Δ314aa) and 1–359 (Δ359aa) were cloned in pEGFP C1 vector and pBluescript II SK(+) vector to generate GFP-STCH, Δ314aa and Δ359aa for expressing in HSG cells and pBluescript II SK(+)-STCH, and Δ314aa and Δ359aa for expressing in Xenopus oocytes. NHE1 were cloned in pcDNA3.1(+) vector to generate pcDNA3.1(+)-NHE1 for expressing in HSG cells. All constructs were prepared from PCR product of HSG cells. The IRBIT construct was a gift from Katsuhiko Mikoshiba. All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. hSMG tissue was acquired from patients who had submandibular glands resected as a treatment for a range of oral tumors. The group contained both men and women with ages ranging between 55 and 61 years. All patients gave informed consent for participation in this research. After surgical excision, the glands were instantly placed in cold (4 °C) physiological saline and transported to the laboratory for the experiments. The present study was allowed by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Dental Hospital (CRI06002). Total RNA was extracted from hSMG tissues and HSG cell lines using a TRI REAGENT (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained RNAs were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using oligo(dT) reverse transcriptase primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The human GAPDH was amplified to assess the cDNA yield. Cycling parameters were as follows: 38 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Transfection of HSG cells was performed by using GenefectineTM Reagent (Gentrone Biotech). HSG cells transfected constructs and hSMG tissues were lysed by lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, Xpert protease inhibitor mixture solution (GenDEPOT, Barker, TX), 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF for 15 min on ice and ultrasonicated 5 times for 10 s each. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants were precleaned by incubation with Protein A/G plus-agarose bead (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and incubated with antibody coupled to beads overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with same lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Where necessary, background contamination of heavy chain IgG in immunoprecipitation blots was removed with ReliaBLOT reagent (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after Western blotting transfer, nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in 20 ml of ReliaBLOT block solution followed by incubated with primary antibody diluted in 15 ml ReliaBLOT block solution overnight. Membranes were then washed three times in TBS-Tween buffer. ReliaBLOT HRP conjugate (anti-rabbit secondary antibody) was diluted in ReliaBLOT block solution at 1:5000 ratio. Membranes were again washed three times in TBS-Tween buffer, and the blot was developed as usual. Confluent HSG cells grown on coverglass bottom dishes were fixed with methanol for 5 min at −4 °C, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Then they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution, normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Rabbit anti-STCH polyclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) was used to visualize endogenous STCH in HSG cells. A mouse monoclonal antibody against PDI (Abcam, Cambridge, CB4 0FL, UK) followed by Alexa Fluor® 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) was used for the detection of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence images were acquired at ×100 magnification with a 1.40 N.A oil immersion lenses (Plan-Apochromat, DIC M27) using a confocal microscope (LSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Japan). All images were acquired with the same settings (ZEN2010 software, Zeiss). Fluorescence probes were excited and imaged sequentially, and colocalization was confirmed overlaying of the images. Images are representative of four independent experiments. Capped RNAs were generated using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE® kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasmids containing NBCe1-B or STCH clones/pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and IRBIT clones/PHM6 vector were linearized by a restriction enzyme digest, and cRNAs were obtained via an in vitro transcription reaction of the digestion products. For the reaction, 1 μg of purified linear template was mixed with transcription buffer, NTP/CAP, and T7 polymerase and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The template was removed by adding TURBO DNase to the reaction, and cRNAs were subsequently purified with a phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The size, quantity, and quality of the in vitro transcription products were evaluated with denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis; cRNAs were stored in RNase-free water at −80 °C. Oocyte were injected with NBCe1-B cRNA (5 ng) or coinjected with STCH cRNA (1 ng) with WPI Nanofilter 2000 via a sterile glass pipette and incubated at 18 °C for 2 days. NBCe1-B-mediated currents were measured in a HCO3−-buffered solution containing 33 mm NaHCO3, 66 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 when bubbled with 5% CO2. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship was determined by applying step voltage pulses from −160 to +60 mV from a holding potential of −25 mV. NBCe1 currents recorded in oocytes co-expressed with STCH and/or IRBIT were evoked by a single depolarizing step pulse from −120 to +20 mV. For membrane potential recordings, oocytes were first perfused with a HEPES-buffered solution 96 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 vCaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Transporter activity was induced by changing to the HCO3−-buffered solution. For Na+-free solution, NaCl and NaHCO3 were replaced by equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine·Cl and choline-HCO3−, respectively. Oocytes were injected with cRNA for NBCe1-B (5 ng) and STCH (1 ng). 48 h after injection, oocytes (30 per group) were homogenized in equal volume of buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, Xpert protease inhibitor mixture solution (100×)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 48,000 × g at 4 °C. Both the pellets (membrane fractions) were subjected to SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting. For visualizing NBCe1-B, oocytes were fixed overnight at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS (3 × 5 min), oocytes were embedded in low melting point 3% agarose in PBS, and 20 μm sections were cut using a Cryocut Microtome (CM3050S, Leica). Sections were placed onto slides, blocked by incubation with normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with rabbit anti-NBCe1 polyclonal antibody (Millipore) overnight at 4 °C. After washing again with PBS (3 × 5 min), oocytes were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium. Immunofluorescence images were acquired at ×10 magnification with a 0.3 N.A. lenses (Plan-Neofluar, Zeiss) using a confocal microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss, Japan). All images were acquired with the same settings. Membrane fluorescence intensity was analyzed in scaled image images (1 pixel = 2.5 μm) using the Plot Profile function within ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). After starvation for 3 h, HSG cells were transfected with 50 pmol of siRNA diluted in 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 10 μl of Genefectine was diluted in 250 μl of the same medium. The diluted siRNA and Genefectine were mixed and after 15 min were added to the dish. The final siRNA concentration was 10 nm. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMED with serum. HSG cells were loaded with 2 μm BCECF-AM for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS buffer. pHi recordings of HSG cells were obtained by measuring the fluorescence ratio using the MetaFluor® imaging system with fluorescence ratio imaging software (Version 7.6.5.0). BCECF-AM fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 440 and 495 nm with an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Cells were perfused with either HCO3−-buffered solution in 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.5, or HEPES-buffered solution 10 mm d-Glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Intracellular acidification was induced by exposure to 20 mm NH4Cl for 1 min in Na+-free bath solution. For Na+ free solutions, NaCl and/or NaHCO3 were replaced by equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine·Cl and choline-HCO3−, respectively. S-(N-Ethyl-n-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA; 25 μm) and 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS; 500 μm) were applied by adding to the bath solution at the final concentration. Bath solution was perfused at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The resting pHi of cells was calibrated using the high potassium nigericin procedure. Cells were perfused with five individual calibration solutions 10 mm NaCl, 130 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.005 mm nigericin, pH 6.2, 6.6, 7.0, 7.4, 7.8. 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxylmethyl ester (BCECF/AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and DIDS and EIPA were obtained from Sigma. HSG cells were rinsed twice in PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS. Cells were scraped, lysed, and sonicated 5 times for 1 s. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min for 5 s. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined, and 1 mg of lysate was then incubated with NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. The agarose beads were washed in 3 times in wash buffer (Pierce). Biotinylated surface proteins were eluted by heating the beads at 80 °C for 10 min and then analyzed by Western blot. Bands were quantified by densitometry using the ImageJ program (National Institutes of Health). Densitometry values for surface protein expression were normalized to 100% of control biotinylated NHE1, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), and NBCe1-B. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.; n is number of experimental repeats unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significances were assessed by analysis of variance; p < 0.05 was considered significant. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a hSMG prey cDNA library using a bait sequence encoding the intracellular N-terminal domain of NBCe1-B comprising 345 residues (aa 96–440) (Fig. 1A). Using a highly selective medium, 30 positive colonies were identified and isolated (Table 1). Plasmid DNA was selected from blue colonies exhibiting α-galactosidase activity and sequenced. Seven of 30 sequences contained open reading frame proteins found in the GenBankTM database. Of those seven sequences, STCH was identified in five colonies (Table 2). The strength of the NBCe1-B (bait) and STCH (target) interaction relative to controls was confirmed using an α-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1B). NBCe1-B and STCH mRNA transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in hSMG duct tissues, but not acinar tissues, isolated directly from human patients (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the interaction between endogenous STCH and NBCe1-B by performing a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in hSMG tissues (Fig. 1D).TABLE 1Growth of colonies on selective medium after cotranformation of bait (aa 96–440) and a human submandibular gland librarySelective mediumNumber of colonies−Trp>1.0 × 106− Leu>1.5 × 106−Trp/−Leu>49,000−Trp/−Leu/−His441−Ade/−Trp/−Leu/−His30 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Proteins interacting with bait (aa 96–440)ProteinNumber of coloniesGenBankTM no.Immunoglobulin κ constant1BC070334Prokineticin 11AL358215STCH5NM_006948.4 Open table in a new tab Next, we examined the effect of STCH on the activity of NBCe1-B by performing two electrode voltage-clamp recordings in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with NBCe1-B cRNA alone or co-injected with STCH cRNA. Oocytes were perfused with a HCO3−-buffered solution bubbled with 5% CO2, and the current generated from NBCe1-B was recorded as negative charge influx during step voltage pulses. Transporter conductance was determined from the current-voltage (I-V) relationship. Co-expression with STCH produced an ∼2-fold increase in conductance (2.4 ± 0.1 μS) compared with NBCe1-B alone (1.1 ± 0.1 μS) (Fig. 1E). STCH is known to be a microsome-associated chaperone (15Otterson G.A. Flynn G.C. Kratzke R.A. Coxon A. Johnston P.G. Kaye F.J. Stch encodes the ATPase core of a microsomal stress 70 protein.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore. we checked for labeling of endogenous STCH in the ER of an HSG cell. Consistent with previous studies, confocal immunofluorescence shows that STCH (green) was co-localized with the ER marker, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI); red) (Fig. 1F). Having confirmed the interaction between endogenous NBCe1-B and STCH, we next sought to determine the essential binding domains. Two NBCe1-B mutants were constructed in which a portion of the N-terminal domain had been deleted (Δ95aa and Δ345aa) (Fig. 2A) and were characterized electrophysiologically using a Xenopus oocyte expression system. Oocytes were injected with wild type or mutant NBCe1-B cRNA, and the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of the resultant NBCe1-B transporter activity was determined by applying step voltage pulses. The Δ95aa mutant showed ∼6-fold increase (6.0 ± 0.2 μS) in conductance compared with wild type of NBCe1-B (1.1 ± 0.1 μS), whereas the Δ345aa mutant showed no detectable transporter activity (Fig. 2B). The enhanced activity of the Δ95aa mutant alone compared with wild type suggests that the"

Compounds 2 and 3 specifically bound to HEWL, acting as competitive inhibitors with Ki values of 2.01 × 10(-5) and 1.84 × 10(-6) m, respectively. From ITC analysis, the binding of 3 was found to be driven by favorable enthalpy change (ΔHr°), which is similar to those obtained for 2 and (GlcNAc)4. However, the entropy loss (-TΔSr°) for the binding of 3 was smaller than those of 2 and (GlcNAc)4. Thus the binding of 3 was found to be more favorable than those of the others. Judging from the Kd value of 3 (760 nm), the compound appears to have the highest affinity among the lysozyme inhibitors identified to date. X-ray crystal structure of HEWL in a complex with 3 showed that compound 3 binds to subsites -4 to -1 and the moranoline moiety adopts an undistorted (4)C1 chair conformation almost overlapping with the -1 sugar covalently bound to Asp-52 of HEWL (Vocadlo, Davies, G. J., Laine, R., and Withers, S. G. (2001) Nature 412, 835-838). From these results, we concluded that compound 3 serves as a transition-state analogue for lysozyme providing additional evidence supporting the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate in the catalytic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2037237554,"Based on previous comparative genomic analyses, a set of nearly 600 polypeptides was identified that is present in green algae and flowering and nonflowering plants but is not present (or is highly diverged) in nonphotosynthetic organisms. The gene encoding one of these “GreenCut” proteins, CPLD38, is in the same operon as ndhL in most cyanobacteria; the NdhL protein is part of a complex essential for cyanobacterial respiration. A cpld38 mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii does not grow on minimal medium, is high light-sensitive under photoheterotrophic conditions, has lower accumulation of photosynthetic complexes, reduced photosynthetic electron flow to P700+, and reduced photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (ΦPSII); these phenotypes are rescued by a wild-type copy of CPLD38. Single turnover flash experiments and biochemical analyses demonstrated that cytochrome b6f function was severely compromised, and the levels of transcripts and polypeptide subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex were also significantly lower in the cpld38 mutant. Furthermore, subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex in mutant cells turned over much more rapidly than in wild-type cells. Interestingly, PTOX2 and NDA2, two major proteins involved in chlororespiration, were more than 5-fold higher in mutants relative to wild-type cells, suggesting a shift in the cpld38 mutant from photosynthesis toward chlororespiratory metabolism, which is supported by experiments that quantify the reduction state of the plastoquinone pool.

Mammalian INSIGs exert control by directly interacting with proteins containing sterol-sensing domains (SSDs) when sterol levels are elevated. Mammalian 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGR) undergoes sterol-dependent, endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) that is mediated by INSIG interaction with the HMGR SSD. The yeast HMGR isozyme Hmg2 also undergoes feedback-regulated ERAD in response to the early pathway-derived isoprene gernanylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Hmg2 has an SSD, and its degradation is controlled by the INSIG homologue Nsg1. However, yeast Nsg1 promotes Hmg2 stabilization by inhibiting GGPP-stimulated ERAD. We have proposed that the seemingly disparate INSIG functions can be unified by viewing INSIGs as sterol-dependent chaperones of SSD clients. Accordingly, we tested the role of sterols in the Nsg1 regulation of Hmg2. We found that both Nsg1-mediated stabilization of Hmg2 and the Nsg1-Hmg2 interaction required the early sterol lanosterol. Lowering lanosterol in the cell allowed GGPP-stimulated Hmg2 ERAD. Thus, Hmg2-regulated degradation is controlled by a two-signal logic; GGPP promotes degradation, and lanosterol inhibits degradation. These data reveal that the sterol dependence of INSIG-client interaction has been preserved for over 1 billion years. We propose that the INSIGs are a class of sterol-dependent chaperones that bind to SSD clients, thus harnessing ER quality control in the homeostasis of sterols.

Regulation of the sterol pathway is critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis and the function of cellular membranes. Lessons learned from the natural mechanisms of sterol regulation are directly applicable to clinical management of cholesterol. A rate-limiting step in the highly conserved cholesterol synthesis pathway is catalyzed by HMGR 2The abbreviations used are: HMGRHMG-CoA reductaseSSDsterol-sensing domainERendoplasmic reticulumERADendoplasmic reticulum-associated degradationSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinSCAPSREBP cleavage-activating proteinINSIGinsulin-induced gene proteinHRDHMG-CoA reductase degradationFPPfarnesyl pyrophosphateGGPPgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphateCHXcycloheximideRo48Ro48-8071TbterbinafinePIprotease inhibitors. that produces mevalonate from HMG-CoA (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4544) Google Scholar). As such, HMGR is subject to multiple forms of feedback control by the sterol pathway; high flux through the pathway results in lower levels of HMGR, whereas lower flux results in higher HMGR (2Brown M.S.

Understanding feedback regulation of HMGR has implications for the clinic because HMGR is the target of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and sterol pathway feedback impacts the efficacy of these drugs.

The most selective mechanism controlling HMGR is the feedback regulation of its stability. Lipid signals generated by the sterol pathway feed back to regulate HMGR degradation (3Jo Y.

When the synthesis of sterol pathway products is high, degradation is fast and HMGR protein levels fall. When synthesis is low, degradation is slow and HMGR protein levels rise (2Brown M.S.

Regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, in yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). HMGR resides in the ER and is thus subject to ER-associated degradation (ERAD). HMGR consists of an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain and a C-terminal cytosolic catalytic domain; the N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient for HMGR-regulated degradation (3Jo Y. Debose-Boyd R.A. Control of cholesterol synthesis through regulated ER-associated degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). HMGR-regulated degradation is conserved between mammals and yeast; accordingly, we have exploited Saccharomyces cerevisiae to discover the mechanisms of degradation and its control by the sterol pathway (4Hampton R.Y. Garza R.M. Protein quality control as a strategy for cellular regulation. Lessons from ubiquitin-mediated regulation of the sterol pathway.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are two HMGR isozymes in yeast, Hmg1 and Hmg2. Hmg1 is a stable isoform, whereas Hmg2 undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the ER-localized HRD pathway (4Hampton R.Y. Garza R.M. Protein quality control as a strategy for cellular regulation. Lessons from ubiquitin-mediated regulation of the sterol pathway.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In response to high signal, Hmg2 undergoes HRD-dependent ubiquitination, extraction from the ER membrane, and degradation by the 26 S proteasomes (6Garza R.M. Sato B.K. Hampton R.Y. In vitro analysis of Hrd1p-mediated retrotranslocation of its multispanning membrane substrate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase.J. Biol.

Lessons from ubiquitin-mediated regulation of the sterol pathway.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The HRD pathway primarily functions in protein quality control to target misfolded or damaged proteins in the ER lumen or membrane for ERAD. When sterol pathway activity is high, Hmg2 appears to adopt a structure recognized by the HRD quality control pathway, allowing feedback-regulated destruction of Hmg2 (7Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Lipid-mediated, reversible misfolding of a sterol-sensing domain protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Garza R.M. Tran P.N. Hampton R.Y.

Chem. 2009; 284: 35368-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hmg2 entry into the HRD pathway is controlled by a signal derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a 15-carbon early pathway isoprene. High FPP results in more degradation and lower HMGR levels, and low FPP results in less degradation and higher HMGR protein levels (9Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. A highly conserved signal controls degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in eukaryotes.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In more recent work, we identified the 20-carbon FPP derivative gernaylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) as the likely endogenous FPP-derived signal (8Garza R.M. Tran P.N. Hampton R.Y. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is a potent regulator of HRD-dependent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase degradation in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35368-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, an oxysterol signal augments the isoprene signal to promote Hmg2-regulated degradation by the HRD pathway (10Gardner R.G. Shan H. Matsuda S.P. Hampton R.Y. An oxysterol-derived positive signal for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase degradation in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8681-8694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Response to either of these signals depends on the highly conserved sterol-sensing domain (SSD) in the Hmg2 transmembrane domain, such that the SSD is required for the degradation-enhancing effects of each class of signal (11Theesfeld C.L. Pourmand D. Davis T. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y. The sterol-sensing domain (SSD) directly mediates signal-regulated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase isozyme Hmg2.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Regulated degradation of mammalian HMGR also occurs by ERAD, and a homologue of the Hrd1 E3 ligase called gp78 is responsible for ubiquitination (12Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Gp78, a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase, associates with Insig-1 and couples sterol-regulated ubiquitination to degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the presence of pathway signals, HMGR degradation is accelerated. The primary signal for mammalian HMGR degradation is a methylated derivative of lanosterol, called 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (13Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Insig-mediated degradation of HMG CoA reductase stimulated by lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Nguyen A.D.

Hypoxia stimulates degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase through accumulation of lanosterol and hypoxia-inducible factor-mediated induction of insigs.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27436-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The use of a lanosterol derivative ensures that the regulation of the primary enzyme of sterol synthesis is keyed to the synthesis of this class of molecules (13Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Insig-mediated degradation of HMG CoA reductase stimulated by lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, degradation of mammalian HMGR by gp78 is also increased by a 20-carbon isoprene, but the nature and action of this second signal is not clear (15Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Insig-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of mammalian 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase stimulated by sterols and geranylgeraniol.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Sterol-regulated degradation of mammalian HMGR requires the highly conserved ER membrane-resident INSIG proteins (12Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Gp78, a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase, associates with Insig-1 and couples sterol-regulated ubiquitination to degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). INSIG promotes HMGR degradation when sterol signal is high by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78 to HMGR. gp78, a HRD1-related ligase, promotes ubiquitination of both HMGR and INSIG that ultimately leads to their destruction by cytosolic 26 S proteasomes (3Jo Y. Debose-Boyd R.A. Control of cholesterol synthesis through regulated ER-associated degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This mechanism, a sterol-dependent association between HMGR and INSIG followed by HRD pathway destruction, functions to lower HMGR activity when sterol intermediates are high. Similarly, INSIG binds to the regulatory protein SCAP, to allow sterol-dependent control of the SREBP transcription factor's activation by cleavage. In the case of SCAP, cholesterol promotes the interaction, rather than lanosterol. Cholesterol induces INSIG binding to SCAP and traps it in the ER, blocking transfer of SCAP-bound SREBP to its site of activation in the Golgi. Both mammalian targets of INSIG, HMGR and SCAP, have SSDs, and these are required for the sterol-dependent interaction of each with INSIG. In fact, it has been suggested that the primary function of the SSD is interaction with INSIG (16Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Identification of luminal Loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18002-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although our data and other recent data clearly show that the SSD has INSIG-independent functions as well (11Theesfeld C.L. Pourmand D. Davis T. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y. The sterol-sensing domain (SSD) directly mediates signal-regulated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase isozyme Hmg2.J. Biol.

Identification of twenty-three mutations in fission yeast Scap that constitutively activate SREBP.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2001-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two conserved INSIGs are expressed in yeast (18Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. INSIG. A broadly conserved transmembrane chaperone for sterol-sensing domain proteins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), called Nsg1 and Nsg2, and they function to control regulation of Hmg2. However, rather than promote HMGR degradation, Nsgs stabilize Hmg2, and Nsg1 functions at its natural levels to block the regulated degradation of Hmg2 by GGPP (18Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. INSIG. A broadly conserved transmembrane chaperone for sterol-sensing domain proteins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As expected from INSIG action in mammals, Nsg1 stabilizes Hmg2 by binding to its SSD-containing transmembrane domain. Thus, considering all the examples, INSIGs appear to have unrelated functions: retaining SCAP in the ER, recruiting an E3 for degradation of HMGR, or causing stabilization of Hmg2. However, these apparently distinct functions represent documented activities of chaperones, and we have proposed the idea that INSIGs are chaperones dedicated to SSD-containing proteins (18Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. INSIG. A broadly conserved transmembrane chaperone for sterol-sensing domain proteins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Do these different INSIG functions toward SSD-containing proteins use the same mechanism? In mammals, INSIG function requires sterol-induced binding to the membrane anchors of HMGR and SCAP. If yeast INSIG, Nsg1, functions in a similar manner, we would expect the association between Hmg2 and Nsg1 to require a sterol molecule. Thus, we tested this idea. In this work, we demonstrate that the action of INSIGs toward HMGR is mechanistically conserved across a billion years of evolution between yeast and mammals. Nsg1 binding and stabilization of Hmg2 required lanosterol. INSIGs in yeast thus prohibit Hmg2 entry into the HRD ERAD when sterol synthesis is active. In the absence of sterols, when Hmg2 is freed from Nsg1, high GGPP caused Hmg2 to be degraded by the HRD pathway. We propose that this regulatory logic for Hmg2-regulated degradation (“GGPP yes, sterols no”) may be appropriate when the role of anaerobiosis is considered in the natural biology of yeast. When Hmg2 and Nsg1 were disengaged, Nsg1 was also subject to ER-associated degradation. Surprisingly, Nsg1 degradation appeared to use a novel ERAD pathway. The remarkable consistency between mammalian and yeast INSIG function and mechanism will be a valuable asset in understanding this key lipid regulatory axis and the interplay between sterol biology and ER protein quality control. All strains (Table 1) and plasmids (Table 2) were constructed with standard molecular biology techniques. To construct pRH2566 (pMET3-ERG11::URA3), 850 nucleotides of the 5′ portion of the ERG11 ORF were amplified from a tiling array plasmid (19Jones G.M. Stalker J. Humphray S. West A. Cox T. Rogers J.

Cycloheximide (CHX; 1001B3, ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) stock was 50 mg/ml in DMSO. Lovastatin (a gift from Merck) stock was 25 mg/ml in methanol ammonia at 4 °C. Ro48-8071 (Ro48; a gift from Johannes Aebi at Hoffmann-La Roche) stock was 40 mg/ml in DMSO. Terbinafine was prepared as an ethanolic solution (10 mg/ml). Ketoconazole (K1003, Sigma) was 10 mg/ml in DMSO. Fenpropimorph (36772, Sigma) was 100 mg/ml in 95% ethanol. MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-aldehyde; C2211, Sigma) was 25 mg/ml in DMSO. GGPP (G6025, Sigma) was 200 μg/vial in methanol/ammonia (7:3). Digitonin (5628, Sigma) was recrystallized three times in ethanol and dried in aliquots using a SpeedVac. The following immunological reagents were used: anti-HA monoclonal antibody ascites (1:2500; Covance); anti-Myc 9E10.2 monoclonal antibody from hybridoma supernatants prepared in the laboratory; anti-HA affinity matrix (AFC-101P, Covance); goat anti-mouse-HRP (1:10,000; Jackson Immunochemicals); anti-Pgk1 (1:2500; A6457, Molecular Probes); and anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (gift from Richard Gardner, University of Washington). S. cerevisiae strains (Table 1) were derived from S288C background and are isogenic. Yeasts were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium with 2% glucose. Experiments were performed on cultures in log phase between 0.2 and 0.6 OD/ml (A600 nm). Standard yeast techniques were used to introduce plasmids and prepare gene deletions. The hrd1Δ, nsg1Δ, nsg2Δ, and hmg2Δ null strains were made by PCR-mediated homologous recombination of the KanMX4 or nourseothricin gene (NatMX4) cassettes flanked by 50 base pairs of homology to the coding regions (Table 3, Oligonucleotide). Nulls were confirmed by PCR and associated deletion phenotypes. To make 1mycHmg2-GFP expressed from the HMG2 promoter, a PCR fragment was generated using pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-HIS3MX6 as a template. The primers contained 50 base pairs of homology to the HMG2 gene, such that GFP is inserted after amino acid 668, the same pos"

https://openalex.org/W2036021956,"Four of the genes that encode gel-forming mucins, which are major components of the mucus layer protecting many epithelial surfaces, are clustered at chromosome 11p15.5 and show both cell- and tissue-specific expression patterns. We aimed to determine whether the individual genes were coordinately regulated by mechanisms involving higher order chromatin structure. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites were predicted in silico and CTCF occupancy then evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. CTCF was found at many sites across the gene cluster, and its binding was correlated with mucin gene expression. Next, siRNA-mediated depletion of CTCF was shown to increase MUC2 expression in A549 lung carcinoma cells and both MUC6 and MUC5AC expression in LS180 colon carcinoma cells. These changes correlated with loss of CTCF binding at multiple sites, although others retained occupancy. In cells actively expressing the mucins, the gene cluster was shown by chromosome conformation capture to form looped three-dimensional structures with direct interactions between the MUC2 promoter region, regions 30 kb 5' to it, close to the MUC6 promoter and others near the 3' end of MUC5AC, >170 kb away. Finally, to demonstrate the importance of CTCF binding to mucin gene expression, Calu-3 lung carcinoma cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS increased the expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC and reduced MUC5B. CTCF occupancy was concurrently depleted at specific binding sites close to these genes. These data suggest that CTCF binding and cell type-specific long-range interactions across the 11p15.5 gene cluster are critical mechanisms for coordinating gel-forming mucin gene expression."
