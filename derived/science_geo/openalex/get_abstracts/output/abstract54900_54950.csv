https://openalex.org/W1518913349,"Abstract Sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays have been developed for cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP), cyclic inosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cIMP), and cyclic uridine 3',5'-monophosphate (cUMP). These assays are based upon competition of the cyclic nucleotide with isotopically labeled cyclic nucleotide derivatives for binding sites on specific antibody. Antibodies to the cyclic nucleotides were obtained by immunizing rabbits with an antigen prepared by conjugating the 2'-O-succinyl derivative of the cyclic nucleotide with protein (human serum albumin or keyhole limpet hemocyanin). High specific activity derivatives of the cyclic nucleotides (g150 Ci per mmole) were prepared by iodinating (125I) the tyrosine methyl ester derivative of the succinylated cyclic nucleotide. Free and bound 125I-labeled cyclic nucleotides were separated by either the second antibody precipitation technique or (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Binding equilibrium was reached in 24 hours, but sensitive and reproducible assays were obtained after 4 to 6 hours of incubation. The sensitivity and assay range for the various radioimmunoassays are (picomoles per tube): cAMP, 0.01 to 2; cGMP, 0.01 to 1.0; cIMP, 0.12 to 10.0; and cUMP, 0.1 to 10.0. Structurally related purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and nucleosides exhibited ≤0.005% competitive binding in all immunoassays except cIMP which showed 0.35% competitive binding in the cGMP assay, cGMP 1% in the cIMP assay, and cIMP 1% in the cUMP assay."
https://openalex.org/W1481052392,"Abstract The Escherichia coli and T4 DNA polymerases do not extend chains in which the 3'-terminal nucleotide (primer terminus) is not paired with the template. By using synthetic double-stranded polynucleotides, the 3' → 5' exonuclease function of these polymerases was shown to be directed specifically against a mispaired or unpaired primer terminus. Chain extension of such termini begins only after all mispaired nucleotides have been removed and a basepaired terminus is reached. The latter is completely conserved while polymerization is maintained. These results suggest that the function of the 3' → 5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases is to remove mispaired nucleotides which have been incorrectly incorporated, thereby increasing the fidelity of template copying. The function of other E. coli exonucleases suggested by their specificities on polynucleotide substrates are trimming loose ends of DNA for exonuclease I and enlarging nicks and gaps within helical regions for exonuclease III."
https://openalex.org/W1539796768,"Abstract An assay method has been developed for the measurement of tissue levels of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) based upon the ability of the cyclic nucleotide to activate cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase prepared from either lobster tail muscle or silkmoth pupal fat body. The method has been used to measure cyclic GMP levels in various biological tissues and human urine, and in slices of heart and brain incubated under various conditions. The results obtained with this new method agree well with published values of tissue levels of cyclic GMP. The limit of the sensitivity of the assay method is about 0.5 pmole of cyclic GMP in an incubation volume of 0.2 ml (2.5 x 10-9m). Acetylcholine caused a rapid (within 0.5 min) increase of 5- to 10-fold in the cyclic GMP level in rat ventricular slices. The cyclic GMP level returned to the basal value within 5 min. Acetylcholine also effectively lowered the increase in myocardial adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) caused by isoproterenol or glucagon. Isoproterenol or glucagon, in reverse fashion, effectively lowered the increase in myocardial cyclic GMP level caused by acetylcholine. The basal level of myocardial cyclic AMP was not significantly influenced by acetylcholine, nor the basal cyclic GMP level by isoproterenol or glucagon alone. Acetylcholine increased cyclic GMP levels and decreased cyclic AMP levels in rabbit cerebellar slices. In cerebral cortex slices, acetylcholine increased cyclic GMP levels without affecting cyclic AMP levels. Norepinephrine, on the other hand, lowered the cyclic GMP levels while greatly increasing the cyclic AMP levels of cerebellum. Histamine was without effect on cyclic GMP levels in cerebellum but increased cyclic AMP levels. In cerebral cortex, histamine caused a slight increase in cyclic GMP levels accompanied by a great elevation in cyclic AMP levels. These data support the concept that the levels of cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP are under separate regulatory control."
https://openalex.org/W1658269687,"Abstract A cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase has been purified from bovine heart muscle. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 280,000 by gel filtration chromatography, and it was composed of cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase and cyclic AMP-binding subunits with molecular weights of 42,000 and 55,000, respectively. When the purified protein kinase was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, or storage there appeared smaller forms of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase with molecular weights of approximately 140,000 and 90,000. A close structural relationship between all of these forms of protein kinase was suggested by the observation that each was composed of the same two kinds of subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1559996241,"Abstract Vesicles formed from cytochrome oxidase and phospholipids catalyzed the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c in a manner similar to that of intact mitochondria. A respiration-dependent release of protons and uptake of potassium ions were observed in the presence of valinomycin with reduced 1,4-naphthoquinone-2-sulfonate as reductant for cytochrome c. With ascorbate as reductant 3- to 5-fold stimulation of respiration was observed on addition of uncouplers or ionophorous agents."

https://openalex.org/W1670369342,"Abstract Physiological concentrations of estradiol added in vitro to immature rat uteri in Eagle's HeLa medium induced the near maximal (compared to in vivo) synthesis of a specific uterine protein (induced protein (IP)). The magnitude of IP induction closely corresponded to the amount of nuclear bound [3H]estradiol at different estradiol concentrations. Maximal IP induction and maximal binding of [3H]estradiol to nuclear receptor were obtained with 2 to 3 x 10-8 m estradiol; 2 to 3 x 10-9 m estradiol gave a 50% response with both; and at 10-10 m, induction and binding were minimal. The greatest in vitro response at 2 x 10-8 m estradiol was about 85% of that obtained in vivo. The coincidence of the induced proteins synthesized after either in vivo or in vitro hormone administration was shown by coelectrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Likewise, the over-all pattern of newly synthesized soluble proteins was the same in uteri stimulated with estrogen either in vitro or in vivo. The time course of the rate of IP synthesis (a measure of amount of IP-synthesizing capacity) in vitro (detectable by 15 min; 50% by 20 to 30 min) was similar to that obtained in vivo. In both situations, the increase in IP-synthesizing capacity is actinomycin D sensitive. Also, the rate of accumulation of IP-synthesizing capacity is highest initially and falls off rapidly with time (by 30 min) whether accumulation occurs in vitro or in vivo; at this time, however, the amount of estradiol is continuing to increase or remains at a high level in the nucleus. Induction of IP synthesis shows a strict hormonal specificity. Only estrogenic compounds induced, whereas progesterone, testosterone, and insulin did not. The efficacy of induction was 17 β-estradiol g diethylstilbestrol g estriol g 17 α-estradiol. Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, at 10-3 or 10-5 m, did not induce IP and neither enhanced nor diminished the induction of IP due to estradiol. These findings clearly indicate that estrogen can directly stimulate the uterus without the requirements of intact vascular or nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W1589027452,"Abstract Horse liver aldehyde: NAD oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.1.3) has been purified to homogeneity by a procedure consisting of salt fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. The purified material has a turnover number of 1.85 µmoles of NADH per min per mg of protein when assayed at pH 9.0 with propionaldehyde as substrate. Values obtained for the molecular weight of the native enzyme by sucrose density centrifugation, sedimentation equilibrium, and multiple porosity disc gel electrophoresis were 220,000, 260,000, and 252,000, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a subunit molecular weight of 57,000, suggesting a tetrameric structure for the native enzyme. Specificity studies indicated that both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were oxidized. For most aldehydes tested, the Michaelis constants were between 0.1 to 1 µm when corrected for equilibrium concentrations of inactive hydrated aldehyde. Chloral, which is completely hydrated, was an inhibitor of the dehydrogenase reaction. Despite the broad aldehyde specificity, substrate analogues in which the aldehydic hydrogen of RCHO was replaced by NH2, CH3, or even OH were not found to be inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2156895606,"Abstract Aldehyde:NAD oxidoreductase (EC 1.2.1.3), purified to homogeneity from horse liver, possesses, in addition to its dehydrogenase activity, the ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl esters at a rate equal to approximately one-third that of the oxidation-reduction reaction. That this esterase activity is most probably an active site phenomenon is suggested by the competitive inhibition of nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by high concentrations of propionaldehyde, a substrate for the dehydrogenase reaction. The coenzyme for the dehydrogenase reaction, NAD, also exerts a modifying influence on the esterase activity, producing a 2-fold enhancement of rate of nitrophenyl ester hydrolysis. NADH exerts the same 2-fold stimulation of the esterase reaction. By comparing the concentrations of substrate and coenzyme needed to affect the esterase reaction with the calculated dissociation constants determined from initial velocity studies, it has been possible to suggest an ordered binding of substrates in the dehydrogenase reaction. The mechanism postulates that NAD binds preferentially to free enzyme to form an enzyme-NAD binary complex, followed by the binding of aldehyde to give a ternary complex. Binding of aldehyde to free enzyme occurs only at extremely high concentrations of aldehyde, and, thus, is not significant under normal assay conditions nor at physiological aldehyde concentrations. In view of the preferred order of the dehydrogenase reaction, the dependence of the Vmax of the reaction upon the choice of aldehyde substrate suggested that either the formation, interconversion, or breakdown of the ternary complex (or complexes) is most probably rate limiting. The kinetic importance of the interconversion of ternary complexes was eliminated by determining that no deuterium isotope was obtained when 1-deutero-propionaldehyde was used as a substrate. A Taft plot of the Vmax and substrate for the dehydrogenase reaction gave a positive p* value, indicating that the ratelimiting step is favored by enhancement of the partially positive nature of the carbonyl carbon. In accordance with the data and by analogy with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, it is suggested that either the formation or the breakdown of a covalent intermediate through nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate is most probably the rate-limiting step in the dehydrogenase reaction scheme."
https://openalex.org/W1529306244,"The sluggish respiratory response to ADP in liver mitochondria of alloxan diabetic rats and hibernating ground squirrels was overcome by addition of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that poor penetration of ADP prevented maximum oxygen consumption. The in vivo depression of adenine nucleotide translocation through the inner mitochondrial membrane was confirmed directly by measurements of [14C]ADP translocase and 32Pi-ATP exchange reactions. The inhibition of adenine nucleotide penetration was considered to be a consequence of increased hepatic lipid content, particularly long chain acyl-CoA esters, which occur in diabetes and hibernation. Demonstrated changes in the pattern of mitochondrial long chain fatty acids may be responsible for the altered spectral characteristics of the cytochromes observed in these animals. The inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocation could be reproduced in vitro with normal rat liver mitochondria by production of, or upon addition of certain esters of long chain fatty acids. Simultaneous addition of pyruvate or α-ketoglutarate with the free fatty acid prevented formation of the acyl-CoA ester and inhibition of translocation. Selective reversal of the inhibition by carnitine provided strong evidence implicating the acyl-CoA ester rather than the free fatty acid as the inhibitory agent. From these results, it is postulated that certain long chain acyl-CoA esters, acting as natural effectors of adenine nucleotide translocation, can perform a physiological role in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1487220128,"Abstract The levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) were measured in eight regions of mouse central nervous system (CNS), utilizing a recently developed radioimmunological assay. The effect of postnatal development and of ischemia on regional CNS cAMP and cGMP levels were studied also. Levels of cAMP were found to vary from 0.6 µmole per kg, wet weight, in spinal cord to 2.3 µmoles per kg, wet weight, in striatum. cGMP levels in most of the CNS were much lower, 33 to 69 nmoles per kg, wet weight, except in cerebellum, where the concentration of cGMP was 630 nmoles per kg, wet weight, 10 to 20 times that in any other region. Ischemia produced a 4-fold increase in cerebral cortical and cerebellar cAMP levels within 60 s, but with continued ischemia cAMP levels subsequently decreased. Levels of cGMP did not change during the initial 60 s of ischemia, and then decreased 60% in cerebral cortex and 80% in cerebellum. During the 1st week after birth, no changes in the levels of the two cyclic nucleotides in either forebrain or hindbrain were observed. Between 7 days and 21 days after birth, cAMP levels in forebrain, brain stem, and cerebellum increased 2-fold. The changes in cGMP levels between 7 days and adulthood were quite unlike those of cAMP. There was no change in forebrain cGMP, brain stem cGMP increased 2-fold, and in cerebellum cGMP rose dramatically, to a level 13 times that at 7 days."
https://openalex.org/W1487826997,"Abstract Human PP-ribose-P synthetase, partially purified from erythrocytes, was found to have Michaelis constants for ribose-5-P, MgATP, and magnesium of 33 µm, 14 µm, and 0.2 mm, respectively. Based on studies of initial velocity and product inhibition, the kinetic mechanism is postulated to be an ordered Bi Bi reaction with ribose-5-P binding first and PP-ribose-P being released last. Magnesium binds sequentially with the substrates, but its exact role is unclear. A large number of compounds including ADP, GMP, GDP, GTP, IDP, ITP, 2,3-DPG, XDP, CDP, CTP, TDP, TTP, NADH, NADPH, and FAD are inhibitors of the enzyme. Inhibition by ADP, which is competitive with respect to ATP, may reflect regulation of the enzyme by cellular energy levels as previously suggested by Atkinson and Fall ((1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 3241). Inhibition by 2,3-DPG and PP-ribose-P, which is competitive with respect to ribose-5-P, may provide a link between oxygenation of hemoglobin and regulation of PP-ribose-P synthesis in the erythrocyte. The other inhibitors studied had a high Ki for the enzyme and inhibition appeared to be noncompetitive which is consistent with the hypothesis that PP-ribose-P synthetase activity is also regulated by a mechanism of heterogeneous metabolic pool inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1514001920,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase in purified platelet membrane was activated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) when 2 mm ATP was used as substrate. When the substrate concentration was lowered to 0.1 mm (using an analogue of ATP, 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) which has been shown to be a substrate for adenylate cyclase but is not degraded by ATPase), the PGE1 activation of adenylate cyclase was markedly reduced or abolished, without affecting the fluoride stimulation. The PGE1 activation of the enzyme was restored by the addition of GTP to the incubation medium. The effect was evident even at 1 µm GTP, and the optimal effect was obtained at 0.1 mm GTP. The GTP effect was seen at all concentrations of PGE1 used in these experiments. Moreover, GTP effect also was evident at lower substrate concentrations. GTP did not appear to change the apparent affinity of the substrate to the enzyme, but markedly increased the PGE1-stimulated enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1488225405,"Abstract The resolution of fully functional xanthine oxidase from nonfunctional enzyme by the technique of affinity chromatography is described. Both forms of the enzyme possess the full complement of the oxidation-reduction components molybdenum, FAD, iron, and acid-labile sulfur. Nonfunctional xanthine oxidase does not possess the cyanolyzable persulfide group and can be partially activated by incubation with sodium sulfide. The presence of the active center persulfide is essential for catalytic activity with xanthine as substrate but is not required for DPNH-ferricyanide reductase activity. It is also required for the following properties of xanthine oxidase: (a) bleaching of the oxidation-reduction chromophores of the enzyme by xanthine or by sodium borohydride, (b) development of the rapid molybdenum electron paramagnetic resonance signals by xanthine or NaBH4, (c) development of the electron paramagnetic resonance signals of the reduced iron sulfur chromophores by xanthine or NaBH4, (d) interaction with the inhibitors arsenite and cyanide, (e) development of the molybdenum electron paramagnetic resonance signals associated with inactivation of the enzyme by formaldehyde. A reaction mechanism for xanthine oxidase involving the persulfide linkage is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1565859051,"Abstract Glucagon-sensitive, insulin-secreting tumors of the Syrian (golden) hamster were homogenized in 1 mm NaHCO3 and subjected to differential centrifugation. The 10,000 x g particles were used for both binding of 125I-glucagon and activation of adenylate cyclase. Glucagon was the only hormone that activated adenylate cyclase. 125I-Glucagon bound to receptors rapidly and was competitively displaced by 1 µg per ml or less of unlabeled hormone; other polypeptide hormone were without effect. The glucagon concentration that produced half-maximal activation of adenylate cyclase was 10 ng per ml and half-maximal displacement of 125I-glucagon was 5 ng per ml; 2–29 glucagon, missing only the NH2-terminal histidine, bound to receptors but did not activate adenylate cyclase. When 2–29 glucagon was added to native glucagon, it blocked activation of adenylate cyclase. Extracts of porcine that contained glucagon immunoreactivity also activated adenylate cyclase but were only one-tenth as potent as pancreatic glucagon; 2–29 glucagon inhibited the effect of gut glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1603178174,"Abstract The binding of azide, thiocyanate, cyanate, and cyanide to bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase has been studied by means of optical spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD). The results show that there are at least four anion binding sites on the protein, and these are divided equally into two classes. One of these classes of binding sites strongly binds 2 moles of azide producing an altered EPR spectrum, no change in the NMRD, and only a minor change in the visible optical spectrum. These two binding sites are considered to be the Zn2+ ions of the protein. The other class of binding sites binds 2 moles of cyanide, lowering the NMRD to the diamagnetic level, and producing substantial changes in the optical and EPR spectra. These two binding sites are considered to be the 2 Cu2+ ions of the protein. Thiocyanate and cyanate appear to bind only to the Zn2+, having no effect on the NMRD and minor effects on the optical spectrum, although each ion produces a characteristic EPR spectrum. Addition of excess azide to the protein results in the appearance of an intense charge transfer band near 373 nm, produces minor changes in the 2-azide complex EPR spectrum and lowers the NMRD to the diamagnetic level. The presence of excess cyanide produces an absorption band at 530 nm and a unique EPR spectrum (Rotilio, G., Finazzi Agro, A., Calabrese, L., Bossa, F., Guerrieri, P., and Mandovi, B. (1971) Biochemistry, 10, 611). The data have been rationalized in terms of a model in which zinc and copper are relatively close to each other in the protein, perhaps existing in a ligand-bridged bimetal complex."
https://openalex.org/W1597698279,"An exonuclease activity was detectable in crude extracts from Escherichia coli 1200 cells (Endo I-, su-) infected with T7 phage bearing amber mutations in gene 3 (T7 endonuclease I) and gene 5 (T7 DNA polymerase). The activity was not detectable if the infecting phage also contained an amber mutation in gene 6. That gene 6 is the structural gene for this enzyme was shown by the fact that phage bearing a temperature-sensitive mutation in gene 6 induced an exonuclease activity which was more heat labile than the wild type enzyme. The enzyme has been purified 500-fold, and the purified preparations are essentially free of ribonuclease, endonuclease, DNA polymerase, and exonuclease I activity although they do contain measurable 3′-phosphatase activity, likely the reflection of residual E. coli exonuclease III. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for divalent cations and a sulfhydryl reagent and is stimulated greatly by potassium ions. The enzyme shows a marked preference for duplex DNA and liberates 5′-mononucleotides as the sole acid-soluble product. The gene 6 exonuclease is involved in the degradation of cellular DNA to acid-soluble products after T7 phage infection."
https://openalex.org/W1596195372,"Abstract Chick embryo fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (chicken embryo fibroblasts (RSV-Ta)) have normal morphology at 40.5° but after a transfer to 36° show the morphological characteristics of transformed cells. This transformation is prevented by N6,2'-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate plus theophylline. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (RSV-Ta) have the same high endogenous levels of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) at 40.5° as uninfected fibroblasts; however, when shifted to 36° the cyclic AMP levels fall to a value similar to that of the fibroblasts infected with wild type RSV. This suggests that an early event in transformation leads to a decreased level of cyclic AMP, and the decreased level of cyclic AMP results in some of the unique properties of transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533307374,"Abstract Seven glycopeptide fractions, representing five different glycopeptides, were isolated from a γM-immunoglobulin obtained from a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Two of the glycopeptides contained only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues in the molar ratio of 7:2, while the other three glycopeptides contained sialic acid, galactose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and fucose in the molar ratio of 1:2:3 to 4:4 to 4.5:0.5. The structure of the oligosaccharide portion of four of the glycopeptides was investigated as follows. Sequential enzymatic degradation of the oligosaccharide chains with purified glycosidases helped to determine the sequences of the sugars. The linkages between the sugars were established by serial periodate oxidation and by methylation of the glycopeptides, followed by identification of the alditol acetate derivatives of the methylated sugars by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The methylation data demonstrated the existence of microheterogeneity in one of the oligosaccharide units which contains only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues. Microheterogeneity was also shown to occur in the outer branches of the more complex oligosaccharide units which lacked a full complement of fucose and sialic acid residue. Partial structures are proposed for four of the glycopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2046346047,"Transovarial transmission of vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana serotype) by experimentally infected Lutzomyia trapidoi and Lutzomyia ylephiletrix to their progeny was demonstrated. Virus was recovered from all developmental stages; mean virus titers from egg to first generation adult showed a four-log increase, indicating that virus multiplication occurred during development of the sandflies. Virus titers in first generation adult females were comparable to those found in their parents. These infected female sandflies transmitted vesicular stomatitus virus Indiana by bite to susceptible animals and transmitted the virus transovarially to their offspring (second generation). Results demonstrate a possible mechanism for transmission and maintenance of this virus in nature without a vertebrate (heat) host reservoir."

Previously, only RNA and herpes DNA viruses have been recognized as capable of inducing leukemia and lymphoma in mammals. The significance of these findings is emphasized in relation to the nature of viral agents that may be involved in analogous diseases of man."
https://openalex.org/W1576284636,"Abstract An investigation of the structure and peptide attachment of the mannose-N-acetylglucosamine unit (unit A) from human and calf thyroglobulin has been carried out on glycopeptides containing large (8 to 10 mannose plus 2 glucosamine residues) and small (5 to 6 mannose plus 2 glucosamine residues) variants of this unit, as well as on an oligosaccharide fraction (8 mannose plus 2 glucosamine residues). All of the mannose residues could be released by α-mannosidase, after which 1 N-acetylglucosamine could be removed by β-N-acetyglucosaminidase. This permitted the isolation from the glycopeptides of 2-acetamido-4-O-(2acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-1-N-β-l-aspartyl-2deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosylamine and 2-acetamido-1-N-β-laspartyl-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosylamine, which could be split to aspartic acid plus di-N-acetylchitobiose or N-acetylglucosamine, respectively, by the action of glycosyl asparaginase. Incubation of the unit A oligosaccharide with α-mannosidase resulted in the production of a di-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharide in high yield which was shown to be identical with di-N-acetylchitobiose. Serial periodate oxidation of the glycopeptides caused destruction of all but approximately 2 of the mannose residues, but spared both N-acetylglucosamine residues in the first Smith degradation. These 2 surviving mannose residues were destroyed in the second degradation. One glucosamine was oxidized in the third treatment, while the other glucosamine still remained intact. Glycerol was the only alcohol released during the three Smith degradations. Periodate oxidation and sodium borohydride reduction of the reduced unit A oligosaccharide, in which the terminal glucosamine had been converted to glucosaminitol, yielded 1 residue of xylosaminitol. Methylation of the glycopeptides by the method of Hakamori yielded tetra- and di-O-methyl mannose ethers from glycopeptides with small carbohydrate units, while tetra-, tri-, and di-O-methyl ethers were obtained from the glycopeptides with large carbohydrate units. All glycopeptides yielded only 1 O-methyl ether of N-methylglucosamine, which was identified by ion exchange chromatography to be 3,6-di-O-methyl-N-methylglucosamine. The results of these studies suggest the following structure for carbohydrate unit A. [see PDF for sequence] The smallest unit found was a tightly branched structure containing 5 mannose residues, and the larger units are believed to contain additional mannose residues, designated as (Man)x linked to the terminal residues of the three chains by α1-2 bonds. No significant species variations were observed between the calf and human proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1966340517,"The binding constants and the number of binding sites for insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and calcium ions for the plasma membrane of rat liver were determined by Scatchard plots. The plots are biphasic or multiphasic, an indication of at least two types of binding sites for each ligand. At least three types of binding sites were found for insulin. In the concentration range of 10(-6) to 10(-8) molar, glucagon, epinephrine, and hydro-cortisone increased calcium ion binding to the plasma membrane, whereas insulin decreased this binding. At hormone concentrations of 10(-6) to 10(-7) molar, glucagon was the most effective in increasing calcium binding, but at a hormone concentration of 10(-8) molar, hydrocortisone was the most effective in stimulating calcium binding. Adenosine triphosphate reversed the effect of insulin and inhibited the effect of the other hormones. These studies suggest a relation between hormones and calcium with respect to membrane structure and function."

Approximately 20 percent of the radioactivity emerges as angiotensin 11, the remainder as lower homologs. Radioactivity is not retained by the lungs but has the same volume of distribution and mean transit time as blue dextran, a compound unlikely to leave the intravascular space. Plasma membrane fractions of lung are capable of converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

https://openalex.org/W1562709317,"Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase detritiates phosphoenolpyruvate 3-tritium under conditions of the net forward reaction prior to the release of pyruvate. This exchange requires that release of pyruvate is not rapid with respect to reversal of the proton transfer steps involved in the catalysis of its enolization. This conclusion is consistent with the low tritium isotope effect that is observed for the hydrogen exchange on pyruvate that is activated by ATP. An intrinsic isotope effect for the proton abstraction step as high as 26 can be expected since such high values were observed in the enzymatic enolization of pyruvate activated by other phosphate compounds. Considerable exchange of tritium from tritiated water into remaining phosphoenolpyruvate during the course of the forward pyruvate kinase reaction is observed, indicating that the enzyme-bound pyruvate-ATP complex that is generated in the forward reaction can return to substrate form at a significant rate relative to product release. A kinetic analysis indicates that the release of phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP may be a rate-determining factor in this exchange rate. Thus, the conclusions of earlier workers that muscle pyruvate kinase follows rapid equilibrium kinetics require re-examination. The effects of varying pH, mono- and divalent cations, temperature, and alternative activators on the rates of proton exchange are reported."
https://openalex.org/W1551230608,"Abstract A method is described for the isolation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit liver. The enzyme has been crystallized as the NAD complex and its chemical and physical properties have been compared with those of the muscle enzyme. The kinetics of the reversible reaction catalyzed by the dehydrogenases is sensitive to temperature and ionic strength and has been examined at 37°, pH 7.4, in a solvent of ionic strength 0.1. Under these conditions the outstanding new feature of the reverse reaction, the reductive dephosphorylation of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate, is the positive cooperativity of the response of both enzymes to concentration increments of the acyl phosphate and the increase in this cooperativity as a function of concentration of the cosubstrate, NADH. At low concentrations of the acyl phosphate, the reduced coenzyme exerts an inhibitory function which is abolished by high concentrations of acyl phosphate or by low concentrations of NAD acting as a heterotropic effector. The same concentrations of NAD which activate at low acyl phosphate concentration inhibit at high concentrations of the 3-carbon substrate by competing with NADH. Activation of the reaction by NAD involves a transition of the acyl phosphate saturation function from a sigmoidal to the hyperbolic form and hence sensitizes the enzyme to lower concentrations of acyl phosphate. The substrate inhibition by NADH and the activation by NAD may be accounted for by the binding of the nucleotides to catalytic sites of the tetrameric protein that are not occupied by the acyl enzyme intermediate. Although the competitive advantage in binding to the apoprotein strongly favors NAD over NADH, the competition under reaction conditions tends to be equalized at nonacylated sites of the acylated protein and is drastically reversed at the acylated sites. Thus at kinetic saturation levels of the acyl phosphate Knadh remains in the 10-µm range, but half-maximal inhibition by NAD occurs at concentrations of the latter that are in excess of 1000 µm. These properties involve both ligandinduced conformational transitions of the protein and a local steric effect of the acyl group that interferes with the binding of the oxidized but not the reduced form of the pyridine nucleotide. In the forward or oxidative phosphorylation reaction the reciprocal kinetic plots are entirely linear except under conditions of product inhibition by NADH. The preferential binding of NADH at an acylated site is not strongly expressed in the inhibition by added NADH because such sites are already occupied by product NADH that is released subsequent to the rate-limiting acyl group transfer from enzyme to orthophosphate ion. The acyl phosphate is a strong inhibitor of the forward reaction, noncompetitive with NAD and strictly competitive with aldehyde. Intracellularly, the enzyme always operates in the presence of high concentrations of NAD which are required to provide the driving force for the energy-conserving reaction. Functional reversibility, under the adverse substrate concentration distributions in the aerobic hepatocyte, is maintained by regulatory effects of NAD binding which promote the reaction of extremely low concentrations of acyl phosphate, and by the differential effects of acylation of the protein which allow access of substrate NADH and at the same time eliminate a prohibitive inhibition by the high concentrations of NAD. The catalytic properties of the liver and muscle enzyme are qualitatively similar but exhibit some quantitative differences that would favor the more diversified metabolic requirements of liver. However, no definitive structural differences have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W1671589314,"Abstract A galactosyltransferase that transferred galactose from UDP-galactose to O-β-(N-acetyl)-glucosaminosyl (1 → 3)-O-β-galactosyl (1 → 4) glucosyl (1 → 1) ceramide to give galactosyl-O-β-(N-acetyl)glucosaminosyl (1 → 3)-O-β-galactosyl (1 → 4)-glucosyl (1 → 1) ceramide was detected in homogenates of rabbit bone marrow. The enzyme was present in the supernatant solution obtained after homogenization of rabbit bone marrow in the presence of Triton X-100 and centrifugation at 100,000 x g. The product of the reaction was isolated, purified, and analyzed for its constituents. It formed a precipitin line with anti-type XIV pneumococcal polysaccharide horse serum, and the line fused with that of tetraglycosylceramide derived from rabbit erythrocyte B active pentaglycosylceramide. UDP-galactose could not be replaced by galactose or galactose-1-P; the Km values were 5.0 x 10-4 m and 1.2 x 10-4 m for the triglycosylceramide and UDP-galactose, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1601510129,"Abstract Cleavage of the 2',3'-carbon-carbon bond of the 3'-terminal adenosine residue of yeast tRNAphe and Escherichia coli tRNAtyr was effected by oxidation with sodium periodate at pH 6 followed by reduction of the dialdehyde to the diol by sodium borohydride at pH 8. Both of these tRNA species could still be acylated by their respective amino acids and cognate synthetases. tRNAphe retained 82% of its acceptance capacity and tRNA tyr retained 50% activity. On the other hand, oxidized-reduced Phe-tRNA could no longer form a ternary complex with E. coli Tu factor and GTP, demonstrating that intactness of this end of the tRNA molecule is important in this recognition reaction. This modification also blocked T-factor-dependent Phe-tRNA binding to the A site on the ribosome, and severely inhibited nonenzymatic binding at the P site at 4 to 6 mm Mg++ relative to control Phe-tRNA's although most of the inhibitory effect at this site could be abolished by raising the Mg++ concentration to 15 to 20 mm."
https://openalex.org/W1586848695,"Abstract An enzyme discovered in the cell membrane fraction of Escherichia coli catalyzes the following reaction: CDP-diglyceride + H2O → CMP + phosphatidic acid The enzyme has been extracted from the membrane fraction with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and has been purified 115-fold. This novel hydrolase appears to have a high specificity, since it does not attack at a significant rate DPN, ATP, or CDP-choline, substrates that are rapidly split by nucleotide pyrophosphatase(s) of broad specificity previously described in plant and animal tissues. It also appears to be distinct from the periplasmic bacterial hydrolases specific for nucleoside diphosphate sugars. The CDP-diglyceride hydrolase is devoid of phospholipase D activity and is also unusual in that it is strongly inhibited by AMP."

https://openalex.org/W1577769874,"The kinetic properties of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase have been examined as a function of pyridoxal phosphate modification, this reagent having been previously shown to react specifically with lysine-97 of the tentative sequence proposed by Smith et al. ((1970) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 67, 724). It is found that partial modification (two to three groups per six chains in the active enzyme) leads to almost complete loss of excess NADH inhibition. Modification also leads to an increase in the inhibition constant for GTP as well as a progressive loss of activity. The nature of these changes suggest strong subunit-subunit interaction with respect to some of the regulatory properties of the enzyme. The altered inhibition constant for GTP is apparently a consequence of a change in the rate of a coenzyme-GTP-induced conformational change. Loss of activity after pyridoxal phosphate modification may not be complete since some residual activity always remains. Furthermore, modification has a slight activating effect on activity when the enzyme is assayed in the presence of excess GTP. It is concluded that, although lysine-97 is an important residue in the catalytic reaction, it may not be essential for activity. Prior modification of lysine-428 with trinitrobenzenesulfonate, which also results in loss of excess NADH inhibition, does not affect the rate or extent of pyridoxal phosphate modification."

https://openalex.org/W1552486600,"Abstract It is shown that an enzyme from Colias butterflies, oxidizing the yellow pteridine xanthopterin to the colorless pteridine leucopterin, is in fact xanthine dehydrogenase. Methods for the partial purification of the enzyme are given. The enzyme oxidizes a number of purines and pteridines effectively, with NAD+ as cosubstrate. It is inhibited competitively by its products of reaction, leucopterin and uric acid, and by the precursor of xanthopterin, 7,8-dihydroxanthopterin. A model is constructed for the regulation of portions of the Colias pteridine pathway during ontogeny, incorporating both product and feed forward inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase as shown here."
https://openalex.org/W1578649761,Abstract The interaction of Mn2+ with d-xylose isomerase from two species of bacteria has been studied by electron paramagnetic resonance and by the longitudinal proton relaxation rate of water solutions of the enzyme. Binary enzyme-Mn2+ complexes are detected with dissociation constants in order of magnitude agreement with kinetically determined activator constants. A 4-fold enhancement of the effect of d-xylose isomerase-Mn2+ on the proton relaxation rate of water was observed. This is decreased by substrates and inhibitors consistent with the replacement of water ligands of the enzyme-bound manganese by substrate oxygen functions. The dissociation constants of the ternary complexes of substrates and inhibitors are in agreement with their respective Km or Ki values. Differences in the enhancements of the ternary complexes of substrates and inhibitors indicate that α-anomeric forms have a greater effect than corresponding β-anomeric forms.
https://openalex.org/W1536491514,"Abstract Prior reduction of chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase with xanthine or NADH leads to accelerated loss of enzymic FAD on exposure to 3 m KI. Reduction with NADH leads to the dissociation of all of the FAD, whereas reduction with xanthine results in the rapid dissociation of only 50% of the FAD. In both cases the xanthine → NAD activity is completely abolished. Oxidation of xanthine in the presence of artificial electron acceptors is effected at comparable rates by the two apoproteins. Oxidation of NADH by the partially deflavinated enzyme is generally commensurate with its flavin content, whereas the fully deflavinated enzyme is incapable of oxidizing NADH. Spectrophotometric and electron paramagnetic resonance studies on the apoproteins have shown that the partially deflavinated enzyme is reducible by both xanthine and NADH, whereas the fully deflavinated enzyme is reducible only by xanthine. The results are discussed in the context of the arrangement of the electron carrier components in the active center of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1515941039,"Abstract The effects of various proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and Pronase) on the enzymatic activity of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase are remarkably similar for the enzyme from rabbit muscle and yeast. In both instances mild proteolytic digestion results in substantial inactivation in the absence of NAD+ and in essentially no inactivation in the presence of NAD+ at concentrations greater than 10 Km. Correlation of the extent of enzymatic inactivation with the amount of bound coenzyme reveals that full protection of activity is attained for both mammalian and yeast dehydrogenases when 50 to 60% of the NAD+-binding sites are saturated. These results clearly indicate that the proteases are sensing change at the tertiary and quaternary structural level and suggest that only one molecular theory for explaining allosteric regulation is needed to rationalize the NAD+ homotropic effects observed for the two dehydrogenases. A model is proposed in which ligand binding to one of two paired subunits initiates highly coupled, quaternary interactions with the other subunit. Additional, secondary interactions are assumed to occur between the two dimers in the tetrameric protein."
https://openalex.org/W1577097122,"Abstract A method for measuring the stereospecific uptake of d-glucose by isolated human erythrocyte membranes has recently been developed in our laboratory (Kahlenberg, A., Urman, B., and Dolansky, D. (1971) Biochemistry, 10,3154). Data obtained with this method were interpreted to suggest that the uptake activity measured represented the binding of d-glucose to a specific site on the erythrocyte membrane. To investigate the possible role of phospholipids in this d-glucose uptake activity, the phospholipid structure of erythrocyte membranes was modified by treatment with phospholipase A2, C, or D, and the effect of each modification on their d-glucose uptake activity and phospholipid composition was determined. Phospholipase A2 treatment produced a maximum decrease in uptake activity of 75% in association with the hydrolysis of approximately 74% of the total available β-fatty acid ester linkages of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine; the maximum hydrolysis of these phospholipids obtainable was 91%. In contrast, hydrolysis of approximately 64% and 46% of the membrane phospholipid phosphodiester linkages by phospholipase C and D, respectively, resulted in only a 25% decrease in d-glucose uptake activity. Likewise a greater decrease in the activity of the erythrocyte membrane (sodium plus potassium)-activated adenosine triphosphatase was observed after phospholipase A2 than after phospholipase C or D treatment. Acetylcholinesterase activity of the membrane was not affected by any of these phospholipolytic enzymes. The above results suggest that perturbation of phospholipid hydrophobic groups in the interior of the membrane, proximal or hydrophobically bound to membrane proteins, causes a decrease in the d-glucose uptake activity of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1493701512,"Abstract A soluble, NAD-dependent dehydrogenase which is specific for d-aldohexoses, including d-fucose, d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-altrose, d-allose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and 2-deoxy-d-galactose, has been purified 335-fold from a pseudomonad capable of using d-fucose as a sole carbon source. Forty-five other sugars and related compounds tested did not serve as substrates and did not affect the rate of d-glucose oxidation. The pH optimum was 8 to 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer and 9 to 10 in glycine-NaOH buffer. The enzyme was insensitive to thiols and thiol group reagents and was not activated by divalent metal ions. Representative apparent Km values were 5.8 mm for d-fucose, 0.86 mm for d-glucose and 0.08 mm for NAD+. The β anomer of d-glucose was preferred over the α anomer. d-Fuconate was isolated as the apparent product of d-fucose oxidation, indicating that the unstable d-fucono-δ-lactone rather than d-fucono-γ-lactone was the immediate product. This was confirmed by the demonstration that d-glucono-δ-lactone, but not d-fucono-γ-lactone or d-galactono-γ-lactone, could serve as a substrate in the reverse reaction. Thus, it is concluded that β-d-glucopyranose and β-d-fucopyranose are the actual substrates for the enzyme."

The Km values for d-fuconate and l-arabonate were 4.0 mm and 4.3 mm, respectively. The product of d-fuconate dehydration was identified as 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-fuconate. A d-fuconate dehydrataseless mutant was isolated and shown to grow normally on d-glucose and d-galactose, but not to grow on d-fucose or l-arabinose."
https://openalex.org/W1482491913,"Abstract Lipoprotein lipase can hydrolyze triglyceride emulsions formed by incubation of triolein coated on solid supports in the presence of serum albumin, but only after substrate activation by a serum cofactor. The effect of Ca2+ on the rate of fatty acid release in this system has been studied. Experiments in which the rate of triglyceride hydrolysis by post-heparin plasma or partially purified lipase preparations was determined in the presence of varying concentrations of Ca2+ have shown that the Km value for the metal is 0.02 to 0.06 mm and that as little as 0.20 mm is required for attaining maximal reaction rates. During the incubation of post-heparin plasma in the absence of serum, the addition of Ca2+ is sufficient for maximal activation of the substrate by the plasma cofactor. Preactivation of the substrate by the cofactor is not necessary, since activation occurs rapidly. The rate of release of fatty acids by the enzyme in partially purified preparations, heart homogenates, or extracts of acetone powder of adipose tissue can be increased by increasing serum concentrations in the incubation medium. However, higher Vmax values and lower Km values for serum are observed in the presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+. A protein cofactor, partially purified from rat serum by a lipid adsorption technique, has been found to activate the substrate, but only in the presence of Ca2+. Examining the rate of hydrolysis of varying substrate concentrations under different experimental conditions has shown that Ca2+ itself has no effect on enzyme activity; fatty acid release being observed only in the presence of both the protein and metal cofactors. Binding studies with 45Ca2+ lead to the conclusion that the cofactor role of Ca2+ is that of enzyme activator. From 8 to 25% of the metal in the incubation system can be bound by the enzyme-substrate complex, whereas only a fraction is bound by the substrate alone. The complex-bound calcium can be sequestered by EDTA, suggesting that metal binding by the enzyme-substrate complex is reversible. Thus, for maximal enzymatic activity the system requires substrate activation by the protein cofactor and enzyme activation by Ca2+. The hydrolysis of serum chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins by the enzyme can be enhanced by serum, but much faster reaction rates are observed in the presence of Ca2+. Because of this fact and in view of the low range of Ca2+ concentrations required for enzyme activation, a physiological role for the metal in the in vivo hydrolysis of these natural substrates of the enzyme outside the fat cells of adipose tissue is proposed. Experimental results further show that EDTA can inhibit the activity of the lipase and that this inhibition can be reversed by excess Ca2+. The inhibition by 1 m NaCl, heparin, and protamine sulfate cannot be prevented by Ca2+. Citrate and pyrophosphate are not found to be inhibitory in the present system."

The inhibition was specific for tRNAtyr; it was competitive with tyrosine and noncompetitive with ATP. tRNA modified by periodate oxidation or by limited digestion with phosphodiesterase proved to be a stronger inhibitor of the enzyme than native tRNA; the inhibition by these tRNA's, however, was no longer purely competitive with tyrosine. Measurements of the binding of tRNAtyr to the enzyme by means of nitrocellulose filters revealed 1 mole of tRNAtyr bound per mole of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1551328272,"Abstract An enzyme that phosphorylates DPNH to form TPNH has been isolated from aerobic yeast mitochondria and purified 127-fold. This enzyme differs from other reported DPN kinases in that it is specific for DPNH as a substrate and requires high concentrations of a carboxylic acid such as acetate for maximal activity. In the presence of 0.2 m sodium acetate, the apparent Km values for DPNH, ATP, and Mg++ are 42 µm, 1.0 mm, and 1.0 mm, respectively. Purified DPNH kinase is highly unstable; however, it can be protected from denaturation by 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate itself does not activate the enzyme. Mitochondrial DPNH kinase represents about 5% of the total DPN and DPNH kinase activities of the yeast cell and appears to be involved in maintaining the level of triphosphopyridine nucleotide in the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1550435008,"Abstract Synthetically and chemically modified forms of staphylococcal nuclease-T', the noncovalent complex of the polypeptide fragments nuclease-T-(6–48) (containing residues 6 through 48 of staphylococcal nuclease) and nuclease-T-(49–149) (containing residues 49 through 149 of nuclease), were prepared and characterized. Analogue forms of synthetic-(6–47) (the synthetic fragment corresponding to nuclease residues 6 through 47) were prepared by the solid phase method with variations from the normal sequence at residues lysine 9, glutamic acid 10, proline 11, alanine 12, threonine 13, leucine 14, isoleucine 15, isoleucine 18, and tyrosine 27. In addition, [3-nitro-l-tyrosyl 27]-nuclease-T-(6–48) and [3-amino-l-tyrosyl 27]-nuclease-T-(6–48) were obtained, respectively, by tetranitromethane treatment of nuclease-T-(6–48) and by subsequent reduction of the nitrated product. All of the above fragment derivatives were studied for the ability to associate with nuclease-T-(49–149) to generate enzymic activity. The results have allowed a description of the functions of the residues studied in nuclease-T'. This information has been interpreted further based on the present knowledge of the staphylococcal nuclease crystal structure (Arnone, A., Bier, C. J., Cotton, F. A., Hazen, E. E., Jr., Richardson, D. C., Richardson, J. S., AND Yonath, A. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 2302) and therein extended to predictions for intact nuclease as well. The studies reported indicate that the NH2-terminal residues 9 through 13 participate in several critical main chain and side chain hydrogen bonds, with loss of residues 6 through 13 causing complete destabilization of the nuclease-T' complex. Tyrosine 27 helps to stabilize nuclease-T' structure, probably by hydrophobic interactions as well as by side chain hydrogen bonding, whereas the nonpolar side chains of isoleucine 15 and isoleucine 18 are important for nuclease-T' fragment association and stabilization of the active site region of the complex, respectively. The results are consistent with the view that nuclease and nuclease-T' have similar detailed structural features in the regions studied."
https://openalex.org/W1521390995,"Abstract An incompletely branched, low molecular weight form of glycogen has been isolated from liver tissue of a patient with glycogen storage disease. Digestion with pullulanase and β-amylase, oxidation by periodate, Smith degradation, spectral studies of the iodine complexes, osmotic pressure measurements, and end group analysis gave results which indicate a molecular weight range of 8,000 to 15,000 with an average chain length of 17 to 18 glucose units per branch point. The substance was found in heart and kidney tissues in addition to liver. In an attempt to evaluate the role of branching enzyme in the disease, it was found that the branching enzyme was not stable in normal frozen liver and disappeared with a half-life of about 5 weeks. Clinical, chemical, and pathological factors in this case were similar to those previously reported in the case of glycogen storage disease type IV."
https://openalex.org/W1988589460,"We have developed an optical scanning instrument which may become a valuable aid in a variety of cell studies. Cell multiplication can be readily monitored with the instrument. By varying the chemical environment in which the cells are tested, questions of research and clinical interest may be quickly and conveniently answered. It appears possible to investigate the chemotherapeutic value of experimental agents, and to scan the sensitivity of a given population of neoplastic cells to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents at several concentrations. The optical scanning system may also be used to investigate certain metabolic pathways of cells in tissue culture, to determine drug resistance, and to assess the effects of medium composition on cell growth. Our studies of BrdU resistance in mouse lymphoma cells were done primarily to demonstrate the potential of this optical scanning method, and we do not intend to continue the cytokinetic studies at present. We trust that others will be stimulated to investigate further applications of this instrumental approach to problems in cell biology."

https://openalex.org/W1570299605,"Abstract The only major deoxyribonuclease forming acid-soluble fragments from radioactively labeled DNA was isolated from cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The enzyme was purified 325-fold, yielding two bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the lesser of which was a distinct ribonuclease activity. Extensive modification of the deoxyribonuclease during purification to produce multiple species could be avoided by the use of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the destruction of endogenous nucleic acids. Marked instability of the enzyme at all stages of purification was overcome by the use of 30% glycerol and 2-mercaptoethanol; the purified preparation had a pH optimum of 7.8. The enzyme closely resembled exonuclease III of Escherichia coli in several respects; the products were 5'-mononucleotides and inorganic phosphate; phosphate release was dependent on the presence of 3'-phosphoryl end groups in DNA; hydrolysis was initiated at the 3'-terminus; native DNA was degraded three to four times faster than heat-denatured DNA. Unlike exonuclease III the entire substrate could be hydrolyzed providing there were several readditions of enzyme during the incubation. It was optimally stimulated by 2.5 mm magnesium and to a lesser extent by manganese. The P. aeruginosa exonuclease was inhibited by ionic strength above 0.05 m Tris because of a reduced binding affinity for the DNA substrate; both the exonuclease and phosphatase functions demonstrated almost identical inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoate and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The molecular weight was estimated to be 42,500 by gel filtration."
