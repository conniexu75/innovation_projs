https://openalex.org/W1482688465,"I have proposed that orthodox electrocardiography be implemented, both for research and medical purposes, by the use of long-period, continuous recording of heart potentials with a portable, self-contained instrument-the electrocardiocorder together with semiautomatic methods for the rapid analysis of the resulting voluminous data. An electronic system to make this concept practical has been developed in our laboratory and typical results are described in this article."

https://openalex.org/W1980872889,"Hypothalamic sites which control feeding exert a corresponding control over lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation. This was demonstrated in rats bearing four, intrahypothalamic electrode-cannulas for electrical stimulation or chemical injection. Self-stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus was inhibited by ventromedial excitation or by excessive feeding. Both self-stimulation and feeding were accelerated (disinhibited) by ventromedial ablation or anesthetization. Thus food acts via the ventromedial hypothalamus to inhibit not only feeding, but also lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation."

Human volunteers can be experimentally infected by dropping infected fluids into the nasopharynx2, by inhalation of finely atomized liquid suspension3, or by inhalation of room air into which virus has been introduced by aerosol spray4. However, there is no direct evidence to prove whether epidemic or pandemic influenza is spread by direct contact by large droplets, or by finely dispersed airborne droplet nuclei."

Radioautographic evidence is presented of incorporation of label from radioactive macromolecular RNA presented to normal and neoplastic mouse cells. Although most of the label appeared in cellular RNA, deoxyribonucleic acid also was occasionally labeled. This suggested that at least partial degradation of the RNA occurred prior to or after incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W124813944,Strontium-90 concentrations have been determined in a variety of foods used by the native population. Caribou from the tundra carry 10 to 20 times the level of domestic cattle. Eskimos for whom caribou is a staple in the diet are found to have four times the strontium-90 content of the average for the world population of the North Temperate Zone.

https://openalex.org/W2087087406,"ANTHROPOMETRIC measurements have been made on 32 pairs of brothers. All subjects are adult men. The average age of the younger brothers is 32.3 yr., that of older brothers, 39.4. Age differences between members of the same pair vary from 1 to 20 years. The brother–brother correlations are shown in Table 1. Some coefficients are low but, unless below 0.35, they are significant at the 5–1 per cent level. Low coefficients are to be expected because in a panmictic population a brother–brother correlation should not significantly exceed 0.50 (or 0.42 for autosomal dominant characters). Other coefficients are higher but, as for low significant correlations, with two exceptions there is no significant departure from 0.50. For head breadth and cephalic index, correlations are surprisingly high and significantly above 0.50. Such values can be expected if, instead of random mating, there is a fairly high degree of homogamy. In man, assortative mating exists primarily for body-height, secondarily for some characters correlated with stature. In our sample, fraternal correlation for body-height is low and does not differ significantly from 0.50, the limiting value compatible with panmixia. One can guess that assortative mating is directly related to some other anatomical traits, but it is hard to believe that cephalic index, which gives the strongest correlation, can be sexually attractive. A quite different explanation seems to be more credible."
