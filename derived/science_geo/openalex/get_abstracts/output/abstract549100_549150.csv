https://openalex.org/W2219205942,"The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, leucine and isoleucine have been implicated in a number of diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. Adipose tissue plays an important role in BCAA homeostasis by actively metabolizing circulating BCAA. In this work, we have investigated the link between BCAA catabolism and fatty acid synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using parallel 13C-labeling experiments, mass spectrometry and model-based isotopomer data analysis. Specifically, we performed parallel labeling experiments with four fully 13C-labeled tracers, [U-13C]valine, [U-13C]leucine, [U-13C]isoleucine and [U-13C]glutamine. We measured mass isotopomer distributions of fatty acids and intracellular metabolites by GC-MS and analyzed the data using the isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) framework. We demonstrate that 3T3-L1 adipocytes accumulate significant amounts of even chain length (C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0) and odd chain length (C15:0 and C17:0) fatty acids under standard cell culture conditions. Using a novel GC-MS method, we demonstrate that propionyl-CoA acts as the primer on fatty acid synthase for the production of odd chain fatty acids. BCAA contributed significantly to the production of all fatty acids. Leucine and isoleucine contributed at least 25% to lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool, and valine and isoleucine contributed 100% to lipogenic propionyl-CoA pool. Our results further suggest that low activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and mass action kinetics of propionyl-CoA on fatty acid synthase result in high rates of odd chain fatty acid synthesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Overall, this work provides important new insights into the connection between BCAA catabolism and fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes and underscores the high capacity of adipocytes for metabolizing BCAA."

The firing pattern of grid cells might be explained by attractor dynamics in a network, which requires either direct excitatory connectivity between phase-specific grid cells or indirect coupling via interneurons. However, knowledge regarding local networks that support in vivo activity is incomplete. Here we identified essential components of LII networks in the MEC. We distinguished four types of excitatory neurons that exhibit cell-type-specific local excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. Furthermore, we found that LII neurons contribute to the excitation of contralateral neurons in the corresponding layer. Finally, we demonstrated that the medial septum controls excitation in the MEC via two subpopulations of long-range GABAergic neurons that target distinct interneurons in LII, thereby disinhibiting local circuits. We thus identified local connections that could support attractor dynamics and external inputs that likely govern excitation in LII."

While macrophage activity plays a critical role in driving disease pathology, there are limited data available on the effects of tissue stiffness on macrophage activity. In this study, the effects of substrate stiffness on inflammatory mediator production by macrophages were investigated. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were grown on polyacrylamide gels that mimicked the stiffness of a variety of soft biological tissues. Overall, macrophages grown on soft substrates produced less proinflammatory mediators than macrophages grown on stiff substrates when the endotoxin LPS was added to media. In addition, the pathways involved in stiffness-regulated proinflammation were investigated. The TLR4 signaling pathway was examined by evaluating TLR4, p-NF-κB p65, MyD88, and p-IκBα expression as well as p-NF-κB p65 translocation. Expression and translocation of the various signaling molecules were higher in macrophages grown on stiff substrates than on soft substrates. Furthermore, TLR4 knockout experiments showed that TLR4 activity enhanced proinflammation on stiff substrates. In conclusion, these results suggest that proinflammatory mediator production initiated by TLR4 is mechanically regulated in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2217674194,"The adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are a large yet poorly understood family of seven-transmembrane proteins. A defining characteristic of the aGPCR family is the conserved GAIN domain, which has autoproteolytic activity and can cleave the receptors near the first transmembrane domain. Several aGPCRs, including ADGRB1 (BAI1 or B1) and ADGRG1 (GPR56 or G1), have been found to exhibit significantly increased constitutive activity when truncated to mimic GAIN domain cleavage (ΔNT). Recent reports have suggested that the new N-terminal stalk, which is revealed by GAIN domain cleavage, can directly activate aGPCRs as a tethered agonist. We tested this hypothesis in studies on two distinct aGPCRs, B1 and G1, by engineering mutant receptors lacking the entire NT including the stalk (B1- and G1-SL, with indicating stalkless). These receptors were evaluated in a battery of signaling assays and compared with full-length wild-type and cleavage-mimicking (ΔNT) forms of the two receptors. We found that B1-SL, in multiple assays, exhibited robust signaling activity, suggesting that the membrane-proximal stalk region is not necessary for its activation. For G1, however, the results were mixed, with the SL mutant exhibiting robust activity in several signaling assays (including TGFα shedding, activation of NFAT luciferase, and β-arrestin recruitment) but reduced activity relative to ΔNT in a distinct assay (activation of SRF luciferase). These data support a model in which the activation of certain pathways downstream of aGPCRs is stalk-dependent, whereas signaling to other pathways is stalk-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2220360740,"Probiotics are a promising alternative to improve food animal productivity and health. However, scientific evidence that specific microbes can be used to benefit animal health and performance is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of administering a live culture of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii to newborn dairy calves on subsequent growth, health, and fecal microbiome. Initially, a safety trial was conducted using 30 newborn bull calves to assess potential adverse effects of the oral and rectal administration of F. prausnitzii to neonatal calves. No adverse reactions, such as increased body temperature or heart and respiratory rates, were observed after the administration of the treatments. All calves survived the experimental period, and there was no difference in fecal consistency score, attitude, appetite or dehydration between the treatment groups. The rectal route was not an efficient practice while the oral route ensures that the full dose is administered to the treated calves. Subsequently, a randomized field trial was completed in a commercial farm with preweaned calves. A total of 554 Holstein heifers were assigned to one of two treatment groups: treated calves (FPTRT) and non-treated calves (control). Treated calves received two oral doses of F. prausnitzii, one at treatment assignment (1st week) and another one week later. The FPTRT group presented significantly lower incidence of severe diarrhea (3.1%) compared with the control group (6.8%). Treated calves also had lower mortality rate associated with severe diarrhea (1.5%) compared to control calves (4.4%). Furthermore, FPTRT calves gained significantly more weight, 4.4 kg over the preweaning period, than controls calves. The relative abundance of F. prausnitzii in the fecal microbiota was significantly higher in the 3rd and 5th weeks of life of FPTRT calves than of the control calves, as revealed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our findings showed that oral administration of F. prausnitzii improves gastrointestinal health and growth of preweaned calves, supporting its use as a potential probiotic."

In addition to revealing genome-wide features of the transcriptome of identified CNS cell types, this approach has also offered insight into epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. The critical importance of epigenetic chromatin remodeling through processes that include histone modifications and DNA methylation and demethylation is underscored by recent studies showing a linkage between disruption of these processes and human disease, including cancers of the CNS (Robertson, 2005Robertson K.D. DNA methylation and human disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2007aWang G.G. Allis C.D. Chi P. Chromatin remodeling and cancer, Part I: Covalent histone modifications.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 363-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Epigenetic modifications to DNA, especially 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by DNA methyltransferases has been studied extensively (Smith and Meissner, 2013Smith Z.D. Meissner A. DNA methylation: roles in mammalian development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that 5mC can be converted to 5hmC by the ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of dioxygenases (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D’Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y.

Ayata P. Dewell S. Kriaucionis S. Heintz N. MeCP2 binds to 5hmC enriched within active genes and accessible chromatin in the nervous system.Cell. 2012; 151: 1417-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), suggest that the Tet-mediated generation of 5hmC has an important role in the epigenetic control of CNS neuronal differentiation. In the present study, we used TRAP methodology to analyze global gene expression patterns, including the expression of genes involved in epigenetic regulatory pathways of developing cerebellar GCs. To assess the similarities and differences between global transcription profiles over a series of developmental stages and to compare them with differentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we used a metagene projection methodology (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet J.P. Tamayo P. Golub T.R. Mesirov J.P. Metagenes and molecular pattern discovery using matrix factorization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, Tamayo et al., 2007Tamayo P. Scanfeld D. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Roberts C.W. Mesirov J.P. Metagene projection for cross-platform, cross-species characterization of global transcriptional states.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5959-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This approach allows us to find the most salient patterns of gene expression over time and identify the corresponding key biological features in an unbiased manner. Using this methodology, we show that there are pivotal changes in a broad range of chromatin remodeling genes during the developmental stage when the cerebellar circuitry forms. To analyze DNA cytosine modification in developing GCs, we quantitated genome-wide 5hmC distribution. To test the function of Tet genes in cerebellar GC development, we then used an ESC model and functional assays in developing cerebellar cortex. Activation of Tet enzymes in GCs treated with vitamin C resulted in elevated 5hmC levels at exon start sites of upregulated genes, notably axon guidance genes and ion channel genes; knockdown of Tet1 and Tet3 resulted in a failure of granule cell dendritic arborization, which is a critical step in circuit formation. These studies suggest a role for Tet genes and chromatin remodeling genes during the formation of CNS synaptic circuitry. To provide a comparative analysis of genome-wide gene expression at key developmental stages, we used TRAP methodology (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D. Heiman M. Schmidt E.F. Stevens T.R. Ma G. Bupp S. Shrestha P. Shah R.D. Doughty M.L. et al.Application of a translational profiling approach for the comparative analysis of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 749-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M.

As NeuroD1 is a specific marker for postmitotic GCs, we purified mRNA from postmitotic GCs from Tg(NeuroD1-Egfp-L10a) mouse cerebellar tissue at P0, when NeuroD1+ GCs begin to exit the cell cycle; at P7, the peak of GC glial-guided migration from the external granule cell layer (EGL) to the internal granule cell layer (IGL); at P12–P21, the period when the cerebellar circuitry forms (Hansel et al., 2001Hansel C.

Neural design of the cerebellar motor control system.Brain Res. 1972; 40: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar); and at P56, when the cerebellum is mature in the adult mouse (Figures 1A and 1B ). To generate a time series model of gene expression for developing cerebellar GCs, we used metagene projection to identify the most salient features of transcriptional behavior of cerebellar GCs at key developmental stages. This was done by factoring the matrix of Affymetrix microarray profiles of GC samples (genes by time points) (Figures S1B–S1D) into the product of two matrices: (genes by metagenes) × (metagenes by time points), which approximates the input data array (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet J.P.

Biological annotations for each metagene were derived by first projecting the original expression dataset into a space of pathways and biological processes from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A.

Moody S.E. Dunn I.F. Schinzel A.C. Sandy P. Meylan E. Scholl C. et al.Systematic RNA interference reveals that oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers require TBK1.Nature. 2009; 462: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar) and finding those that are most similar to the metagene’s profile (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). For additional annotation, we formed a set of the genes that most highly contribute to each metagene (i.e., with highest values in the corresponding column of the first matrix) and computed the significance of their overlap with gene sets in curated databases such as MSigDB and DAVID (Huang et al., 2009Huang W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25477) Google Scholar). Seven metagenes (C1_7–C7_7, Figure 1C) were identified. Metagene 7 was of special interest because it revealed genes that were upregulated during the time when the cerebellar circuitry forms (P12–P21). Pivotal changes occurred in reactomes for the major classes of epigenetic pathway genes, represented in multiple metagenes, during the period of circuit formation (Figure 1D). These reactomes included genes that encode proteins that regulate chromatin remodeling (Figures 2A and S2A), histone modification (Figures 2B–2D and S2B), and DNA methylation and demethylation (Figures 1D and S2C) (Robertson, 2005Robertson K.D. DNA methylation and human disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2007aWang G.G. Allis C.D. Chi P.

Especially dramatic was the discovery of serial changes in groups representing ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling genes, histone methylation and acetylation genes, and DNA methylation and demethylation genes, including the Tet genes, which generate 5hmC epigenetic marks (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D’Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y.

The expression of genes related to DNA methylation (DNA methyltransferases) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) peaked first, preceding that of Tet enzymes and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Figures 1D, 2A–2D, and S2D). We examined these in more detail (see below). During the same time window, axon guidance genes and ion channel genes, as well as genes that are required for axon and dendrite outgrowth and synapse formation, were also upregulated (Figures 1E and S3). Among chromatin remodeling reactomes, pivotal changes occurred in the expression levels of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, genes that function in the balance between proliferation and differentiation (de la Serna et al., 2006de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Imbalzano A.N. Chromatin remodelling in mammalian differentiation: lessons from ATP-dependent remodellers.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) when GCs undergo terminal differentiation, and centromere proteins (Figure 2A). Among these were Smarc genes, which belong to the SWI/SNF and ISWI family (Wang et al., 2007bWang G.G. Allis C.D. Chi P. Chromatin remodeling and cancer, Part II: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and Cenp genes, which assemble on centromeric DNA to epigenetically control chromosome segregation during mitosis (Westhorpe and Straight, 2013Westhorpe F.G. Straight A.F. Functions of the centromere and kinetochore in chromosome segregation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2013; 25: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of these genes were downregulated after P12, when post-migratory GCs form connections with ingrowing afferent axons. These findings are consistent with recent studies showing an important role for Smarca5 (Snf2h) in the early development of the cerebellum (Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2014Alvarez-Saavedra M. De Repentigny Y. Lagali P.S. Raghu Ram E.V. Yan K. Hashem E. Ivanochko D. Huh M.S. Yang D. Mears A.J. et al.Snf2h-mediated chromatin organization and histone H1 dynamics govern cerebellar morphogenesis and neural maturation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), where a conditional ablation of Smarca5 affected PC dendritic arborization during cerebellar development, and with the finding that a conditional loss of Smarca4 or Smarcb1 in GCs impairs neurogenesis and cerebellar development, resulting in mice with severe ataxia (Moreno et al., 2014Moreno N. Schmidt C. Ahlfeld J. Pöschl J. Dittmar S. Pfister S.M. Kool M. Kerl K. Schüller U. Loss of Smarc proteins impairs cerebellar development.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 13486-13491Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among histone methyltransferases (HMTs), the levels of a number of genes increased after neurogenesis, while others decreased in postmitotic cells (Figure 2D). Importantly, HMTs that increased when the circuitry forms (P12 onward) mediate the formation of epigenetic marks that activate gene expression. Among these were HMTs that generate H3K4me1, H3K4me2, or H3K4me3, including Setd1a, Setd7, Smyd3, Mll1, Mll2, Mll3, and Mll5. At this developmental stage, the level of most of the genes that mediate formation of repressive epigenetic marks went down. These included Ezh2, the HMT responsible for the formation of H3K27me3, as well as Setdb1, Setdb2, Suv39h1, and Suv39h2, which generate H3K9me3, and Suv420h1 and Suv420h2, which generate H4K20me3. The changes in gene levels were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Figures 2E–2H and S2E and Table S2), and the histone modifications in developing cerebella were examined by immunohistochemistry (Figure S4A and Table S1). We focused on the Tet genes because of studies showing levels of 5hmC in brain 10-fold higher than that of those in other tissues (Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009Kriaucionis S. Heintz N.

Ayata P. Dewell S. Kriaucionis S. Heintz N. MeCP2 binds to 5hmC enriched within active genes and accessible chromatin in the nervous system.Cell. 2012; 151: 1417-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and that these differences suggest a possible role in neuronal differentiation and/or synaptic function. Our gene expression assays, as well as qRT-PCR measurements, on cerebellar GCs revealed upregulation of all three Tet genes in GCs between P12 and P21 (Figure 3A), with higher levels of Tet1 and Tet3 and lower levels of Tet2 (Figures 3B and 3C). As recent studies demonstrate that vitamin C activates Tet enzymes and induces Tet-dependent DNA demethylation (Blaschke et al., 2013Blaschke K. Ebata K.T. Karimi M.M. Zepeda-Martínez J.A. Goyal P. Mahapatra S. Tam A. Laird D.J. Hirst M.

Soc. 2013; 135: 10396-10403Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), we also analyzed the expression of vitamin C transporters in developing GCs. The levels of vitamin C transporters Slc2a1, Slc2a3, Slc23a1, and Slc23a2 in developing GCs peaked at P18 (Figure 3A), after which levels remained fairly constant. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR measurements (Figure 3D). Thus, the levels of both Tet genes and vitamin C transporter genes increase in post-migratory GCs. We then examined the localization of 5hmC during cerebellar development. By liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Figure 3E), 5hmC levels were lowest at P0 and P7, the peak of GC neurogenesis, increasing dramatically between P12 and P18, when the cerebellar circuitry forms. 5hmC levels rose further at P56, when the circuitry is mature. A small increase in 5mC levels occurred over these stages of cerebellar development, with higher levels seen at P56. Similar results were seen with dot blot analysis, which revealed a 3-fold increase in cerebellar 5hmC levels over development (Figures S4B and S4C). By immunocytochemistry, highly proliferating GC progenitors (GCPs) in the EGL of P0–P7 mouse cerebellar cortex had undetectable levels of 5hmC, with much higher levels in NeuroD1-EGFP-positive, post-migratory, differentiated GCs in the IGL where there was broad double labeling with antibodies against 5hmC and GFP (Figure S4D). In contrast, staining for 5mC was high in proliferating GCPs in the EGL (prior to NeuroD1 expression), postmitotic NeuroD1-EGFP-positive GCs migrating across the molecular layer (ML), and differentiated GCs in the IGL (Figure S4E). These findings extend previous studies on 5hmC during cortical development (Lister et al., 2013Lister R. Mukamel E.A. Nery J.R. Urich M. Puddifoot C.A. Johnson N.D. Lucero J. Huang Y. Dwork A.J. Schultz M.D. et al.Global epigenomic reconfiguration during mammalian brain development.Science. 2013; 341: 1237905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) by demonstrating a dramatic increase in 5hmC levels during the stage when the circuitry forms in the developing cerebellar cortex. To analyze the function of Tet genes and changes in 5hmC marks in GC development, we used two approaches. First, we used a stem cell model of GCs, inducing GC differentiation by treating ESCs generated from Tg(NeuroD1-Egfp-L10a) transgenic mice with factors that induce GC differentiation in vivo (Salero and Hatten, 2007Salero E. Hatten M.E. Differentiation of ES cells into cerebellar neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to assay changes in gene expression after Tet enzyme activation. Prior experiments on ESCs lacking Tet1 and Tet2 demonstrated that vitamin C treatment selectively activates Tet enzymes (Blaschke et al., 2013Blaschke K. Ebata K.T. Karimi M.M. Zepeda-Martínez J.A. Goyal P. Mahapatra S. Tam A. Laird D.J. Hirst M.

Soc. 2013; 135: 10396-10403Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). After vitamin C treatment, the percentage of NeuroD1-EGFP+ ESC-derived GCs in the culture increased 2-fold, suggesting that vitamin C promoted the differentiation of ESCs into GCs (Figures S5A and S5B). Gene expression assays using TRAP methodology showed dramatic increases in the expression of axon guidance genes (Figure 4A). This was the case for most of the genes in the axon guidance reactome, including axon guidance ligands and receptors, much like the concurrent upregulation of the Tet gene cluster and the axon guidance gene cluster between P12 and P21 in endogenous GCs (Figures 4B, 4C, 1D, 1E, and S3). In addition, the level of expression of all of the 19 genes encoding ion channels and synaptic proteins that we assayed by qRT-PCR increased after vitamin C treatment (Figures 4D and S5C–S5E). Similar results were obtained for native P7 GCs treated with vitamin C (data not shown). The relative level of 5hmC increased approximately 5-fold in vitamin C-treated ESC-derived GCs compared with control, untreated cells (Figures 4E and 4F). No significant change in the relative level of 5mC occurred after vitamin C treatment. These findings demonstrate that vitamin C activation of Tet enzymes, which increased levels of 5hmC, result in upregulation of genes involved in axon guidance, as well as ion channel genes involved in neuronal conductance and activity. Importantly a large number of studies demonstrate that axon guidance genes, including many of those found in our analyses, also function in dendrite outgrowth (Clifford et al., 2014Clifford M.A. Athar W.

https://openalex.org/W2275614981,"DNA replication in almost all organisms depends on the activity of DNA primase, a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that synthesizes short RNA primers of defined size for DNA polymerases. Eukaryotic and archaeal primases are heterodimers consisting of small catalytic and large accessory subunits, both of which are necessary for the activity. The mode of interaction of primase subunits with substrates during the various steps of primer synthesis that results in the counting of primer length is not clear. Here we show that the C-terminal domain of the large subunit (p58C) plays a major role in template-primer binding and also defines the elements of the DNA template and the RNA primer that interact with p58C. The specific mode of interaction with a template-primer involving the terminal 5′-triphosphate of RNA and the 3′-overhang of DNA results in a stable complex between p58C and the DNA/RNA duplex. Our results explain how p58C participates in RNA synthesis and primer length counting and also indicate that the binding site for initiating NTP is located on p58C.

https://openalex.org/W2201949845,"Advanced predictive analytical techniques are being increasingly applied to clinical risk assessment. This study compared a neural network model to several other models in predicting the length of stay (LOS) in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (ICU) based on pre-incision patient characteristics.Thirty six variables collected from 185 cardiac surgical patients were analyzed for contribution to ICU LOS. The Automatic Linear Modeling (ALM) module of IBM-SPSS software identified 8 factors with statistically significant associations with ICU LOS; these factors were also analyzed with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) module of the same software. The weighted contributions of each factor (""trained"" data) were then applied to data for a ""new"" patient to predict ICU LOS for that individual.Factors identified in the ALM model were: use of an intra-aortic balloon pump; O2 delivery index; age; use of positive cardiac inotropic agents; hematocrit; serum creatinine ≥ 1.3 mg/deciliter; gender; arterial pCO2. The r2 value for ALM prediction of ICU LOS in the initial (training) model was 0.356, p <0.0001. Cross validation in prediction of a ""new"" patient yielded r2 = 0.200, p <0.0001. The same 8 factors analyzed with ANN yielded a training prediction r2 of 0.535 (p <0.0001) and a cross validation prediction r2 of 0.410, p <0.0001. Two additional predictive algorithms were studied, but they had lower prediction accuracies. Our validated neural network model identified the upper quartile of ICU LOS with an odds ratio of 9.8(p <0.0001).ANN demonstrated a 2-fold greater accuracy than ALM in prediction of observed ICU LOS. This greater accuracy would be presumed to result from the capacity of ANN to capture nonlinear effects and higher order interactions. Predictive modeling may be of value in early anticipation of risks of post-operative morbidity and utilization of ICU facilities."
https://openalex.org/W1741736375,"Ontology Matching aims at identifying a set of semantic correspondences, called an alignment, between related ontologies. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in efficient and effective matching methods for large ontologies. However, alignments produced for large ontologies are often logically incoherent. It was only recently that the use of repair techniques to improve the coherence of ontology alignments began to be explored. This paper presents a novel modularization technique for ontology alignment repair which extracts fragments of the input ontologies that only contain the necessary classes and relations to resolve all detectable incoherences. The paper presents also an alignment repair algorithm that uses a global repair strategy to minimize both the degree of incoherence and the number of mappings removed from the alignment, while overcoming the scalability problem by employing the proposed modularization technique. Our evaluation shows that our modularization technique produces significantly small fragments of the ontologies and that our repair algorithm produces more complete alignments than other current alignment repair systems, while obtaining an equivalent degree of incoherence. Additionally, we also present a variant of our repair algorithm that makes use of the confidence values of the mappings to improve alignment repair. Our repair algorithm was implemented as part of AgreementMakerLight, a free and open-source ontology matching system."

Humans acquire this organism from a wide range of food and water sources as well as during aquatic recreational activities. In the present study, the diversity and distribution of Aeromonas species from freshwater lakes in Malaysia was investigated using glycerophospholipid-cholesterol acyltransferase (GCAT) and RNA polymerase sigma-factor (rpoD) genes for speciation. A total of 122 possible Aeromonas strains were isolated and confirmed to genus level using the API20E system. The clonality of the isolates was investigated using ERIC-PCR and 20 duplicate isolates were excluded from the study. The specific GCAT-PCR identified all isolates as belonging to the genus Aeromonas, in agreement with the biochemical identification. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the rpoD gene sequence and all 102 isolates were identified as: A. veronii 43%, A. jandaei 37%, A. hydrophila 6%, A. caviae 4%, A. salmonicida 2%, A. media 2%, A. allosaccharophila 1%, A. dhakensis 1% and Aeromonas spp. 4%. Twelve virulence genes were present in the following proportions--exu 96%, ser 93%, aer 87%, fla 83%, enolase 70%, ela 62%, act 54%, aexT 33%, lip 16%, dam 16%, alt 8% and ast 4%, and at least 2 of these genes were present in all 102 strains. The ascV, aexU and hlyA genes were not detected among the isolates. A. hydrophila was the main species containing virulence genes alt and ast either present alone or in combination. It is possible that different mechanisms may be used by each genospecies to demonstrate virulence. In summary, with the use of GCAT and rpoD genes, unambiguous identification of Aeromonas species is possible and provides valuable data on the phylogenetic diversity of the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2286553382,"Coral reefs are now subject to global threats and influences from numerous anthropogenic sources. Foraminifera, a group of unicellular shelled organisms, are excellent indicators of water quality and reef health. Thus we studied a set of samples taken in 1992 to provide a foraminiferal baseline for future studies of environmental change. Our study provides the first island-wide analysis of shallow benthic foraminifera from around Moorea (Society Archipelago). We analyzed the composition, species richness, patterns of distribution and abundance of unstained foraminiferal assemblages from bays, fringing reefs, nearshore and back- and fore-reef environments. A total of 380 taxa of foraminifera were recorded, a number that almost doubles previous species counts. Spatial patterns of foraminiferal assemblages are characterized by numerical abundances of individual taxa, cluster groups and gradients of species richness, as documented by cluster, Fisher α, ternary plot and Principal Component Analyses (PCA). The inner bay inlets are dominated by stress-tolerant, mostly thin-shelled taxa of Bolivina, Bolivinella, Nonionoides, Elongobula, and Ammonia preferring low-oxygen and/or nutrient-rich habitats influenced by coastal factors such as fresh-water runoff and overhanging mangroves. The larger symbiont-bearing foraminifera (Borelis, Amphistegina, Heterostegina, Peneroplis) generally live in the oligotrophic, well-lit back- and fore-reef environments. Amphisteginids and peneroplids were among the few taxa found in the bay environments, probably due to their preferences for phytal substrates and tolerance to moderate levels of eutrophication. The fringing reef environments along the outer bay are characterized by Borelis schlumbergeri, Heterostegina depressa, Textularia spp. and various miliolids which represent a hotspot of diversity within the complex reef-lagoon system of Moorea. The high foraminiferal Fisher α and species richness diversity in outer bay fringing reefs is consistent with the disturbance-mosaic (microhabitat heterogeneity) hypothesis. Calculations of the FORAM Index (FI), a single metric index to assess reef vitality, indicate that all fore- and most back-reef environments support active carbonate accretion and provide habitat suitability for carbonate producers dependent on algal symbiosis. Lowest suitability values were recorded within the innermost bays, an area where natural and increasing anthropogenic influences continue to impact the reefs. The presence of habitat specific assemblages and numerical abundance values of individual taxa show that benthic foraminifera are excellent recorders of environmental perturbations and good indicators useful in modern and ancient ecological and environmental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2202657320,"Thyroid hormones (THs) play important roles in development, metamorphosis, and metabolism in vertebrates. During the past century, TH functions were regarded as a synapomorphy of vertebrates. More recently, accumulating evidence has gradually convinced us that TH functions also occur in invertebrate chordates. To date, however, TH-related studies in non-chordate invertebrates have been limited. In this study, THs were qualitatively detected by two reliable methods (HPLC and LC/MS) in a well-studied molluscan species, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Quantitative measurement of THs during the development of C. gigas showed high TH contents during embryogenesis and that oyster embryos may synthesize THs endogenously. As a first step in elucidating the TH signaling cascade, an ortholog of vertebrate TH receptor (TR), the most critical gene mediating TH effects, was cloned in C. gigas. The sequence of CgTR has conserved DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains that normally characterize these receptors. Experimental results demonstrated that CgTR can repress gene expression through binding to promoters of target genes and can interact with oyster retinoid X receptor. Moreover, CgTR mRNA expression was activated by T4 and the transcriptional activity of CgTR promoter was repressed by unliganded CgTR protein. An atypical thyroid hormone response element (CgDR5) was found in the promoter of CgTR, which was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). These results indicated that some of the CgTR function is conserved. However, the EMSA assay showed that DNA binding specificity of CgTR was different from that of the vertebrate TR and experiments with two dual-luciferase reporter systems indicated that l-thyroxine, 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine, and triiodothyroacetic acid failed to activate the transcriptional activity of CgTR. This is the first study to functionally characterize TR in mollusks. The presence of THs and the functions of CgTR in mollusks contribute to better understanding of the evolution of the TH system."

https://openalex.org/W2218885001,"Lung endothelial cell apoptosis and injury occurs throughout all stages of acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and impacts disease progression. Lung endothelial injury has traditionally been focused on the role of neutrophil trafficking to lung vascular integrin receptors induced by proinflammatory cytokine expression. Although much is known about the pathogenesis of cell injury and death in ALI/ARDS, gaps remain in our knowledge; as a result of which there is currently no effective pharmacologic therapy. Enzymes known as caspases are essential for completion of the apoptotic program and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that caspase-1 may serve as a key regulator of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMVEC) apoptosis in ALI/ARDS. Our recent experiments confirm that microparticles released from stimulated monocytic cells (THP1) induce lung endothelial cell apoptosis. Microparticles pretreated with the caspase-1 inhibitor, YVAD, or pan-caspase inhibitor, ZVAD, were unable to induce cell death of HPMVEC, suggesting the role of caspase-1 or its substrate in the induction of HPMVEC cell death. Neither un-induced microparticles (control) nor direct treatment with LPS induced apoptosis of HPMVEC. Further experiments showed that caspase-1 uptake into HPMVEC and the induction of HPMVEC apoptosis was facilitated by caspase-1 interactions with microparticulate vesicles. Altering vesicle integrity completely abrogated apoptosis of HPMVEC suggesting an encapsulation requirement for target cell uptake of active caspase-1. Taken together, we confirm that microparticle centered caspase-1 can play a regulator role in endothelial cell injury."

https://openalex.org/W2218939365,"Major advances in early detection and therapy have significantly increased the survival of breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, most cancer therapies are known to carry a substantial risk of adverse long-term treatment-related effects. Little is known about patient susceptibility to severe side effects after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of taxanes. Recent advances in genome-wide genotyping and sequencing technologies have supported the discoveries of a number of pharmacogenetic markers that predict response to chemotherapy. However, effectively implementing these pharmacogenetic markers in the clinic remains a major challenge. On the other hand, recent advances in proteomic technologies incorporating mass spectrometry (MS) for biomarker discovery show great promise to provide clinically relevant protein biomarkers. In this study, we evaluated the association between protein content in serum exosomes and severity of CIPN. Women with early stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant taxane chemotherapy were assessed with the FACT-Ntx score and serum was collected before and after the taxane treatment. Based on the change in FACT-Ntx score from baseline to 12 month follow-up, we separated patients into two groups: those who had no change (Group 1, N = 9) and those who had a ≥20% worsening (Group 1, N = 8). MS-based proteomics technology was used to identify proteins present in serum exosomes to determine potential biomarkers. Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon analysis was applied and maximum FDR was controlled at 20%. From the serum exosomes derived from this cohort, we identified over 700 proteins known to be in different subcellular locations and have different functions. Statistical analysis revealed a 12-protein signature that resulted in a distinct separation between baseline serum samples of both groups (q<0.2) suggesting that the baseline samples can predict subsequent neurotoxicity. These toxicity-associated biomarkers can be further validated in larger retrospective cohorts for their utility in identifying patients at high risk for CIPN."
https://openalex.org/W2278498475,"Ginsenoside compound K (C-K) is attracting a lot of interest because of its biological and pharmaceutical activities, including hepatoprotective, antitumor, anti-wrinkling, and anti-skin aging activities. C-K has been used as the principal ingredient in skin care products. For the effective application of ginseng extracts to the manufacture of cosmetics, the PPD-type ginsenosides in ginseng extracts should be converted to C-K by enzymatic conversion. For increased yield of C-K from the protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides in red-ginseng extract (RGE), the α-L-arabinofuranoside-hydrolyzing α-L-arabinofuranosidase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (CS-abf) was used along with the β-D-glucopyranoside/α-L-arabinopyranoside-hydrolyzing β-glycosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SS-bgly) because SS-bgly showed very low hydrolytic activity on the α-L-arabinofuranoside linkage in ginsenosides. The optimal reaction conditions for C-K production were as follows: pH 6.0, 80°C, 2 U/mL SS-bgly, 3 U/mL CS-abf, and 7.5 g/L PPD-type ginsenosides in RGE. Under these optimized conditions, SS-bgly supplemented with CS-abf produced 4.2 g/L C-K from 7.5 g/L PPD-type ginsenosides in 12 h without other ginsenosides, with a molar yield of 100% and a productivity of 348 mg/L/h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest concentration and productivity of C-K from ginseng extract ever published in literature."
https://openalex.org/W2207891120,"Immune responses are critically regulated by the functions of CD4 helper T cells. Based on their secreted cytokines, helper T cells are further categorized into different subsets like Treg or Th17 cells, which suppress or promote inflammatory responses, respectively. Signals from IL-2 activate the transcription factor STAT5 to promote Treg but suppress Th17 cell differentiation. Our previous results found that the deficiency of a dual-specificity phosphatase, DUSP4, induced STAT5 hyper-activation, enhanced IL-2 signaling, and increased T cell proliferation. In this report, we examined the effects of DUSP4 deficiency on helper T cell differentiation and STAT5 regulation. Our in vivo data showed that DUSP4 mice were more resistant to the induction of autoimmune encephalitis, while in vitro differentiations revealed enhanced iTreg and reduced Th17 polarization in DUSP4-deficient T cells. To study the cause of this altered helper T cell polarization, we performed luciferase reporter assays and confirmed that, as predicted by our previous report, DUSP4 over-expression suppressed the transcription factor activity of STAT5. Surprisingly, we also found that DUSP4-deficient T but not B cells exhibited elevated STAT5 protein levels, and over-expressed DUSP4 destabilized STAT5 in vitro; moreover, this destabilization required the phosphatase activity of DUSP4, and was insensitive to MG132 treatment. Finally, domain-mapping results showed that both the substrate-interacting and the phosphatase domains of DUSP4 were required for its optimal interaction with STAT5, while the coiled-coil domain of STAT5 appeared to hinder this interaction. Our data thus provide the first genetic evidence that DUSP4 is important for helper T cell development. In addition, they also help uncover the novel, DUSP4-mediated regulation of STAT5 protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W2215970716,"Objective Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have altered circadian rhythm of circulating serum cortisol, melatonin and IL-6, as well as disturbance in the expression of clock genes ARNTL2 and NPAS2. In humans, TNFα increases the expression ARNTL2 and NPAS2 but paradoxically suppresses clock output genes DPB and PER3. Our objective was to investigate the expression of direct clock suppressors DEC1 and DEC2 (BHLHE 40 and 41 proteins) in response to TNFα and investigate their role during inflammation. Methods Cultured primary fibroblasts were stimulated with TNFα. Effects on DEC2 were studied using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. The role of NF-κB in DEC2 increase was analyzed using IKK-2 specific inhibitor IMD-0354. Cloned DEC2 was transfected into HEK293 cells to study its effects on gene expression. Transfections into primary human fibroblasts were used to confirm the results. The presence of DEC2 was analyzed in (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) synovial membranes by immunohistochemistry. Results TNFα increased DEC2 mRNA and DEC2 was mainly detected at nuclei after the stimulus. The effects of TNFα on DEC2 expression were mediated via NF-κB. Overexpression, siRNA and promoter activity studies disclosed that DEC2 directly regulates IL-1β, in both HEK293 cells and primary human fibroblasts. DEC2 was increased in synovial membrane in RA compared to OA. Conclusion Not only ARNTL2 and NPAS2 but also DEC2 is regulated by TNFα in human fibroblasts. NF-κB mediates the effect on DEC2, which upregulates IL-1β. Circadian clock has a direct effect on inflammation in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2183342362,"Urban-scale traffic monitoring plays a vital role in reducing traffic congestion. Owing to its low cost and wide coverage, floating car data (FCD) serves as a novel approach to collecting traffic data. However, sparse probe data represents the vast majority of the data available on arterial roads in most urban environments. In order to overcome the problem of data sparseness, this paper proposes a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based traffic estimation model, in which the traffic condition on a road segment is considered as a hidden state that can be estimated according to the conditions of road segments having similar traffic characteristics. An algorithm based on clustering and pattern mining rather than on adjacency relationships is proposed to find clusters with road segments having similar traffic characteristics. A multi-clustering strategy is adopted to achieve a trade-off between clustering accuracy and coverage. Finally, the proposed model is designed and implemented on the basis of a real-time algorithm. Results of experiments based on real FCD confirm the applicability, accuracy, and efficiency of the model. In addition, the results indicate that the model is practicable for traffic estimation on urban arterials and works well even when more than 70% of the probe data are missing."
https://openalex.org/W2198357860,"Alvinocaridid shrimps are endemic species inhabiting hydrothermal vents and/or cold seeps. Although indirect evidences (genetic and lipid markers) suggest that their larval stages disperse widely and support large scale connectivity, larval life and mechanisms underlying dispersal are unknown in alvinocaridids. Here we provide for the first time detailed descriptions of the first larval stage (zoea I) of four alvinocaridid species: Rimicaris exoculata and Mirocaris fortunata from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Alvinocaris muricola from the Congo Basin and Nautilocaris saintlaurentae from the Western Pacific. The larvae were obtained from onboard hatching of brooding females (either at atmospheric pressure or at habitat pressure in hyperbaric chambers) and from the water column near adult habitats, sampled with plankton pumps or sediment traps. Major characteristics of the alvinocaridid larvae include undeveloped mandible and almost complete absence of setation in the inner margin of the mouth parts and maxillipeds. Although the larvae are very similar between the four species studied, some morphological features could be used for species identification. In addition, undeveloped mouthparts and the large amount of lipid reserves strongly support the occurrence of primary lecithotrophy in the early stage of alvinocaridids. Although lecithotrophy in decapod crustaceans is usually associated with abbreviated larval development, as a mechanism of larval retention, morphological and physiological evidences suggest the occurrence of an extended and lecithotrophic larval stage in the Alvinocarididae. These traits permit the colonization of widely dispersed and fragmented environments of hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Distribution of larval traits along the phylogenetic reconstruction of the Alvinocarididae and related families suggest that lecithotrophy/planktotrophy and extended/abbreviated development have evolved independently along related families in all potential combinations. However, the Alvinocarididae is the only taxa with a combination of lecithotrophy and extended larval development."
https://openalex.org/W2218336555,"CD40, CX3CL1 and TNF-α promote atheroma and neointima formation. CD40 and TNF-α are also central to the development of diabetic retinopathy while CX3CL1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of this retinopathy. The purpose of this study was to examine whether CD40 ligation increases CX3CL1 and TNF-α protein expression in human endothelial cells from the aorta and retina. CD154 (CD40 ligand) upregulated membrane-bound and soluble CX3CL1 in human aortic endothelial cells. CD154 triggered TNF-α production by human aortic endothelial cells. TNF Receptor Associated Factors (TRAF) are key mediators of CD40 signaling. Compared to human aortic endothelial cells that express wt CD40, cells that express CD40 with a mutation that prevents TRAF2,3 recruitment, or CD40 with a mutation that prevents TRAF6 recruitment exhibited a profound inhibition of CD154-driven upregulation of membrane bound and soluble CX3CL1 as well as of TNF-α secretion. While both CD154 and TNF-α upregulated CX3CL1 in human aortic endothelial cells, these stimuli could act independently of each other. In contrast to human aortic endothelial cells, human retinal endothelial cells did not increase membrane bound or soluble CX3CL1 expression or secrete TNF-α in response to CD154 even though CD40 ligation upregulated ICAM-1 and CCL2 in these cells. Moreover, TNF-α did not upregulate CX3CL1 in retinal endothelial cells. In conclusion, CD40 ligation increases CX3CL1 protein levels and induces TNF-α production in endothelial cells. However, endothelial cells are heterogeneous in regards to these responses. Human aortic but not retinal endothelial cells upregulated CX3CL1 and TNF-α in response to CD40 ligation, as well as upregulated CX3CL1 in response to TNF-α. These dissimilarities may contribute to differences in regulation of inflammation in large vessels versus the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2221558969,"Breeding programs for increasing spikelet number in rice have resulted in compactness of the panicle, accompanied by poor grain filling in inferior spikelets. Although the inefficient utilization of assimilate has been indicated as responsible for this poor grain filling, the underlying cause remains elusive. The current study utilized the suppression subtractive hybridization technique to identify 57 and 79 genes that overexpressed in the superior and inferior spikelets (with respect to each other), respectively, of the compact-panicle rice cultivar Mahalaxmi. Functional categorization of these differentially expressed genes revealed a marked metabolic difference between the spikelets according to their spatial location on the panicle. The expression of genes encoding seed storage proteins was dominant in inferior spikelets, whereas genes encoding regulatory proteins, such as serine-threonine kinase, zinc finger protein and E3 ligase, were highly expressed in superior spikelets. The expression patterns of these genes in the inferior and superior spikelets of Mahalaxmi were similar to those observed in another compact-panicle cultivar, OR-1918, but differed from those obtained in two lax-panicle cultivars, Upahar and Lalat. The results first suggest that the regulatory proteins abundantly expressed in the superior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars and in both the superior and inferior spikelets of lax-panicle cultivars but poorly expressed in the inferior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars promote grain filling. Second, the high expression of seed-storage proteins observed in the inferior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars appears to inhibit the grain filling process. Third, the low expression of enzymes of the Krebs cycle in inferior spikelets compared with superior spikelets of compact-panicle cultivars is bound to lead to poor ATP generation in the former and consequently limit starch biosynthesis, an ATP-consuming process, resulting in poor grain filling."
https://openalex.org/W2283404274,"Precise mitotic spindle assembly is a guarantee of proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Chromosome instability caused by disturbed mitosis is one of the major features of various types of cancer. JMJD5 has been reported to be involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the nucleus, but little is known about its function in mitotic process. Here we report the unexpected localization and function of JMJD5 in mitotic progression. JMJD5 partially accumulates on mitotic spindles during mitosis, and depletion of JMJD5 results in significant mitotic arrest, spindle assembly defects, and sustained activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Inactivating SAC can efficiently reverse the mitotic arrest caused by JMJD5 depletion. Moreover, JMJD5 is found to interact with tubulin proteins and associate with microtubules during mitosis. JMJD5-depleted cells show a significant reduction of α-tubulin acetylation level on mitotic spindles and fail to generate enough interkinetochore tension to satisfy the SAC. Further, JMJD5 depletion also increases the susceptibility of HeLa cells to the antimicrotubule agent. Taken together, these results suggest that JMJD5 plays an important role in regulating mitotic progression, probably by modulating the stability of spindle microtubules.

Taken together, these results suggest that JMJD5 plays an important role in regulating mitotic progression, probably by modulating the stability of spindle microtubules. In eukaryotic cells, accurate chromosome segregation during cell division relies on the proper assembly of a bipolar spindle during mitosis. Disturbed mitosis may result in genome instability and is one of the major features of many types of cancer (1Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W.

Although previous studies have shown a transcriptional regulation role of JMJD5 in cell cycle progression, the precise function of JMJD5 in mitosis is still unclear. In this study, we found that during mitosis, JMJD5 diffused into cytoplasm and partially accumulated on spindles. Further, we showed that JMJD5 was associated with microtubules and regulated the stability of spindle microtubules. Depletion of JMJD5 led to abnormal spindle assembly and resulted in significant accumulation of mitotic cells by activating SAC. Also we found that JMJD5 depletion enhanced the cytotoxic responses of HeLa cells to nocodazole, an antimicrotubule agent. These data revealed a novel role of JMJD5 in regulating microtubule stability and mitotic progression. Thymidine, nocodazole, taxol, and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

HeLa cells were purchased from National Platform of Experimental Cell Resources for Sci-Tech (China). The cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% streptomycin/penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. siRNA was transfected using RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions in medium without antibiotics. The plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). The cells were synchronized by double thymidine block (DTB) and release or by nocodazole treatment. For DTB and release, the cells were treated with 4 mm thymidine for 17 h, released in fresh medium for 8 h, and then treated with 4 mm thymidine again for 15 h. Cells in different phases were harvested sequentially at the indicated time points after being released from DTB. To get more M phase cells, the cells were synchronized by nocodazole treatment. Briefly, the cells were treated with 4 mm thymidine for 17 h, released in fresh medium for 4 h, and then treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 17 h. The cells were shaken off and extracted directly for immunoprecipitation or released back in fresh medium and harvested sequentially at the indicated time points to analyze mitotic exiting. HeLa cells grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips were fixed with methanol at −20 °C or 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Then the cells were permeabilized and blocked in PBS-BT buffer (1× PBS, 3% (m/V) BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at room temperature. The cells were incubated with diluted primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and then with diluted (1:200) FITC- or CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature in dark for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (VECTOR laboratory). The images were acquired using an A1R MP multiphoton confocal microscope (Nikon) under 100× oil objective and analyzed with NIS-Elements software (Nikon). Cell mitotic index was evaluated as described previously with some modifications (22Juan G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Detection of mitotic cells. John Wiley & Sons, 2004Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde followed by ice-cold 80% ethanol. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 and incubated with diluted Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate anti-phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) antibody in dark. The cells were washed once and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide and RNase A (Takara) on ice for 30 min. Mitotic index was determined using BD FACSCalibur, and the data were analyzed by CellQuestTM Pro software (BD Biosciences). HeLa cells were transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 JMJD5 KO Plasmids with Lipofectamine 3000, and GFP-positive cells were selected by FACS after 24 h. Single cell colonies were selected and tested by Western blot. HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-GFP were transfected with siRNAs or siRNAs together with pcDNA3.1-mcherry, mJMJD5-WT-mcherry, and mJMJD5-mut-mcherry plasmids and then synchronized by DTB and released for 6 h. Then living cell microscopy was performed on an OLYMPUS IX81-ZDC microscope with 10× objective (to get more cells for calculation). Images were taken approximately every 3 min and were analyzed with CellSens Dimension software (Olympus). The duration of mitosis was calculated according to the time lapse images from the sign of chromosome condensation at prophase to chromosome decondensation at telophase.

The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer before incubation with whole cell lysate (cells after nocodazole synchronization and released for 30 min) at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the beads were washed three times, and the associated proteins were eluted by GSH. The samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Microtubule co-sedimentation assay with cell lysate was performed as described previously with some modifications (26Antrobus R. Wakefield J.G. Isolation, Identification, and Validation of Microtubule-Associated Proteins from Drosophila Embryos.Microtube Dynamics: Methods and Protocols. 2011; (Humana Press Inc, 999 Riverview Dr, Ste 208, Totowa, Nj 07512–1165 U.S.A): 273-291Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were synchronized with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 17 h and lysed in C buffer with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) on ice for 30 min. Then the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and ultracentrifugation (Beckman Optima MAX-XP), and DTT and GTP (Thermo) were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The mixture was incubated in water bath at 30 °C for 5 min and divided into two equal with volumes: one was placed on ice in the absence of taxol, and the other was placed in 37 °C water bath with taxol at a final concentration of 20 μm for 15 min. The samples were layered on top of cushion buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 25 °C. The supernatant fractions and pellets were collected individually, and the distribution of proteins in each fraction was examined by immunoblotting. Microtubule co-sedimentation assay with purified JMJD5 protein was performed using the kit from Cytoskeleton, Inc., according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, JMJD5-GST protein was dialyzed in general buffer prior to the assay. Purified tubulin proteins were incubated in general buffer with GTP at 35 °C for 20 min, and taxol was then added to stabilize the microtubules. Then the dialyzed JMJD5-GST was incubated alone or with different concentrations of microtubules (1–20 μm) in general buffer at 25 °C for 30 min. Samples were placed onto a 100-μl cushion buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a TLA100 rotor for 40 min at 25 °C. The pellets and supernatants were collected, suspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. HeLa cells transfected with siRNAs were seeded on polylysine-coated glass coverslips and then synchronized by DTB. 9 h after the second thymidine release, these cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 2 h. Then cells were fixed, and immunofluorescence assay was performed. Deconvolution images were collected and analyzed with Delta Vision Elite System (GE Healthcare) under 100× oil objective, and optical sections were taken at intervals of 0.2 μm. Distances were measured between sister kinetochores that were in the same confocal plane. To elucidate the role of JMJD5 in the cell cycle, we first investigated the expression changes of JMJD5 across the cell cycle. HeLa cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary by DTB were released back into cell cycle. The expression level of JMJD5 slightly increased in the G2-M phase (data no shown). Further, we investigated the localization of JMJD5 during cell cycle progression. We performed the immunofluorescent (IF) staining experiments in HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA or siJMJD5. As shown in Fig. 1A, we observed that JMJD5 localized mainly in the nucleus during interphase and early prophase. Surprisingly, after the nuclear envelope breaking down, JMJD5 diffused into the cytoplasm, and some localized onto mitotic spindles, whereas little signals could be detected on chromosomes. Meanwhile, little signals could be observed in JMJD5-depleted metaphase cells (Fig. 1A) and cells in other mitotic stages (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the antibody and the localization of JMJD5. To verify this localization, human JMJD5-HA fusion protein was overexpressed in HeLa cells, and its localization was detected using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the phenomenon detected with the endogenous antibody, JMJD5-HA signals also concentrated on mitotic spindles during mitosis. Once the nuclear envelope reformed, JMJD5 was found to relocalize in the nucleus (Fig. 1, A and B). The localization of JMJD5 on mitotic spindles implies that JMJD5 may play a distinct role in cell mitotic progression. The spindle apparatus ensures appropriate separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during mitosis. To investigate the function of JMJD5 in mitotic progression, we next examined the effects of JMJD5 depletion on mitosis using two distinct siRNAs against JMJD5. FACS analysis was performed to detect the mitotic index and DNA content at the same time. As shown in Fig. 2A, a G2/M arrest in JMJD5-depleted cells was observed, consistent with previous report (13Hsia D.A. Tepper C.G. Pochampalli M.R. Hsia E.Y.C. Izumiya C. Huerta S.B. Wright M.E. Chen H.W. Kung H.J. Izumiya Y. KDM8, a H3K36me2 histone demethylase that acts in the cyclin A1 coding region to regulate cancer cell proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Notably, a significant increase in the mitotic index was observed in JMJD5 knockdown cells as well (Fig. 2A). To verify this mitotic index increase, we performed Western bolt of mitotic markers and cell counts after IF staining assays. Consistently, JMJD5 depletion up-regulated the level of histone H3Ser10 phosphorylation and cyclin B1, two mitotic markers (Fig. 2B), and increased the number of phosho-H3Ser10 positive cells in IF assay (Fig. 2C). JMJD5 is highly conserved in evolution. Orthologs of JMJD5 in human (hJMJD5) and mouse (mJMJD5) share 77% amino acid identity. In particular, the identity of the JmjC domain is as high as 90%. Further, Flag-tagged mJMJD5 showed same localization pattern in HeLa cells as hJMJD5 did (data not shown). To further validate the result that JMJD5 depletion was responsible for the elevation of the mitotic index, mJMJD5 was reintroduced into JMJD5-depleted HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2 (D and E), the increase of mitotic markers and the mitotic index caused by JMJD5 depletion were partially reversed in cells overexpressing mJMJD5. JMJD5 was reported to be histone H3K36me2 demethylase and non-histone protein hydroxylase (13Hsia D.A. Tepper C.G. Pochampalli M.R. Hsia E.Y.C. Izumiya C. Huerta S.B. Wright M.E. Chen H.W. Kung H.J.

The crystal structure of JMJD5 showed that, in the catalytic site, Fe2+ could be chelated by residues His321, Asp323, and His400 (27Del Rizzo P.A. Krishnan S. Trievel R.C.

This HX(D/E)XnH motif is highly conserved in JmjC domain-containing proteins and is important for their catalytic activity (29Klose R.J. Kallin E.M. Zhang Y.

To further investigate whether the enzymatic activity of JMJD5 is responsible for its function during mitosis, we designed the catalytically inactive mutant of mJMJD5 (H319A/D321A), which is related to H321A/D323A of hJMJD5. To our surprise, the mJMJD5 H319A/D321A mutant was also able to partially reverse the elevation of mitotic index caused by JMJD5 depletion similar to wild-type mJMJD5 (Fig. 2, D and E). Because CRISPR/Cas9 mediate gene knock-out has now been widely used in gene functional test (30Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S.L. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X.B. Jiang W.Y. Marraffini L.A.

Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-Guided Human Genome Engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6420) Google Scholar), we also generated the CRISPR/Cas9 JMJD5 knock-out cell lines to examine the function of JMJD5 on mitosis. As shown in Fig. 2 (F and G), JMJD5 knock-out cell lines also showed higher levels of mitotic markers (Fig. 2F) and mitotic index (Fig. 2G) compared with control cell lines. Also, both wild-type and mutant mJMJD5 were able to partially rescue the mitotic arrest caused by JMJD5 knock-out (Fig. 2H). The results confirm that JMJD5 is required for proper mitosis, and this function may not dependent on the catalytic activity of JMJD5. Meanwhile, IF staining of α-tubulin and ACA was performed, and cells in different mitotic stages were counted according to chromatin morphology. As shown in Fig. 3A, knockdown of JMJD5 caused a significantly increased percentage in metaphase cells and a decreased percentage in anaphase cells among mitotic cells. Moreover, various patterns of abnormal mitotic spindles were observed in both JMJD5 knockdown cells (Fig. 3B) and JMJD5 knock-out cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that JMJD5 plays an important role in regulating mitotic process and spindle assembly. There are two possible causes for accumulation of mitotic cells. One is the shortening of premitotic processes (G1 phase, S phase, or G2 phase), and the other is the prolongation of mitosis. To precisely elucidate the phenomenon caused by JMJD5 depletion, we synchronized siRNA-transfected HeLa cells by DTB, and released these cells for different durations to analyze the mitotic index over time. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mitotic index curve of JMJD5-depleted cells showed no significant difference compared with the curve of control cells at mitotic entry (8 h after release), but it was higher at all times after that. Moreover, the height of the mitotic index curve of JMJD5-depleted cells was twice as high as that of control cells, and the former curve failed to decline to the basal level (level before mitotic entry) as observed for control cells. Consistent with the changes in the mitotic index, a marked increase and a delayed decline of the mitotic markers were also detected in JMJD5-depleted cells (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that JMJD5-depleted cells may obtain a prolonged mitotic phase. To further validate this possibility, we synchronized the siRNA-transfected HeLa cells to the mitotic phase by “cell shake-off” after thymidine/nocodazole treatment and released them back into the cell cycle. As expected, JMJD5 knockdown cells showed a delayed decline of mitotic markers compared with control cells during mitotic progression (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that JMJD5 plays an important role in regulating mitotic exit. To elucidate the mechanisms of mitotic delay induced by JMJD5 depletion, we next conducted time lapse microscopy of HeLa cells stably expressing histone H2B-GFP, with or without JMJD5 depletion. In control cells, most cells divided within 1 h with properly aligned chromosomes (Fig. 4,"

Based on physiological, biochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis it was identified as Cupriavidus sp. CY-1. Further 2,4-D degradation experiments at different concentrations (200 to 800 mg l(-1)) were carried out using CY-1. Effect of NaCl and KNO3 on 2,4-D degradation was also evaluated. Degradation of 2,4-D and the metabolites produced during degradation process were analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and GC-MS respectively. The amount of chloride ions produced during the 2,4-D degradation were analyzed by Ion chromatography (IC) and it is stoichiometric with 2,4-D dechlorination. Furthermore two different types of soils collected from two different sources were used for 2,4-D degradation studies. The isolated strain CY-1 was bio-augmented into 2,4-D contaminated soils to analyze its degradation ability. Culture independent methods like denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and culture dependent methods like colony forming units (CFU) and most probable number (MPN) were used to analyze the survivability of strain CY-1 in contaminated soil. Results of T-RFLP were coincident with the DGGE analysis. From the DGGE, T-RFLP, MPN and HPLC results it was concluded that strain CY-1 effectively degraded 2,4-D without disturbing the ecosystem of soil indigenous microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2276872640,"Bacterial deterioration of sugarcane during harvesting and processing is correlated with significant loss of sucrose yield and the accumulation of bacterial polysaccharides. Dextran, a homoglucan produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides, has been cited as the primary polysaccharide associated with sugarcane deterioration. A culture-based approach was used to isolate extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) producing bacterial strains from milled sugarcane stalks. Ribosomal RNA sequencing analysis grouped 25 isolates into 4 genera. This study identified 2 bacterial genera not previously associated with EPS production or sucrose degradation. All isolates produced polysaccharide when grown in the presence of sucrose. Monosaccharide analysis of purified polymers by Gas Chromatography revealed 17 EPSs consisting solely of glucose (homoglucans), while the remainder contained traces of mannose or fructose. Dextranase treatment of polysaccharides yielded full digestion profiles for only 11 extracts. Incomplete hydrolysis profiles of the remaining polysaccharides suggest the release of longer oligosaccharides which may interfere with sucrose crystal formation."
https://openalex.org/W2276362072,"Background Calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS), which is used in the evaluation of osteoporosis, is believed to be intimately associated with the characteristics of the proximal femur. However, the specific associations of calcaneal QUS with characteristics of the hip sub-regions remain unclear. Design A cross-sectional assessment of 53 osteoporotic patients was performed for the skeletal status of the heel and hip. Methods We prospectively enrolled 53 female osteoporotic patients with femoral fractures. Calcaneal QUS, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and hip structural analysis (HSA) were performed for each patient. Femoral heads were obtained during the surgery, and principal compressive trabeculae (PCT) were extracted by a three-dimensional printing technique-assisted method. Pearson’s correlation between QUS measurement with DXA, HSA-derived parameters and Young’s modulus were calculated in order to evaluate the specific association of QUS with the parameters for the hip sub-regions, including the femoral neck, trochanteric and Ward’s areas, and the femoral shaft, respectively. Results Significant correlations were found between estimated BMD (Est.BMD) and BMD of different sub-regions of proximal femur. However, the correlation coefficient of trochanteric area (r = 0.356, p = 0.009) was higher than that of the neck area (r = 0.297, p = 0.031) and total proximal femur (r = 0.291, p = 0.034). Furthermore, the quantitative ultrasound index (QUI) was significantly correlated with the HSA-derived parameters of the trochanteric area (r value: 0.315–0.356, all p<0.05) as well as with the Young’s modulus of PCT from the femoral head (r = 0.589, p<0.001). Conclusion The calcaneal bone had an intimate association with the trochanteric cancellous bone. To a certain extent, the parameters of the calcaneal QUS can reflect the characteristics of the trochanteric area of the proximal hip, although not specifically reflective of those of the femoral neck or shaft."

However, the requirement of high-input RNA and time-consuming nature of the current methods limited the studies of APA for the samples difficult to obtain. Here, we describe a new method based on our SAPAS in combining in vitro transcription (IVT) and magnetic beads purification.

https://openalex.org/W2220293083,"Many socio-economically important pathogens persist and grow in the outside host environment and opportunistically invade host individuals. The environmental growth and opportunistic nature of these pathogens has received only little attention in epidemiology. Environmental reservoirs are, however, an important source of novel diseases. Thus, attempts to control these diseases require different approaches than in traditional epidemiology focusing on obligatory parasites. Conditions in the outside-host environment are prone to fluctuate over time. This variation is a potentially important driver of epidemiological dynamics and affect the evolution of novel diseases. Using a modelling approach combining the traditional SIRS models to environmental opportunist pathogens and environmental variability, we show that epidemiological dynamics of opportunist diseases are profoundly driven by the quality of environmental variability, such as the long-term predictability and magnitude of fluctuations. When comparing periodic and stochastic environmental factors, for a given variance, stochastic variation is more likely to cause outbreaks than periodic variation. This is due to the extreme values being further away from the mean. Moreover, the effects of variability depend on the underlying biology of the epidemiological system, and which part of the system is being affected. Variation in host susceptibility leads to more severe pathogen outbreaks than variation in pathogen growth rate in the environment. Positive correlation in variation on both targets can cancel the effect of variation altogether. Moreover, the severity of outbreaks is significantly reduced by increase in the duration of immunity. Uncovering these issues helps in understanding and controlling diseases caused by environmental pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1565146740,"We present a message-passing algorithm to solve a series of edge-disjoint path problems on graphs based on the zero-temperature cavity equations. Edge-disjoint paths problems are important in the general context of routing, that can be defined by incorporating under a unique framework both traffic optimization and total path length minimization. The computation of the cavity equations can be performed efficiently by exploiting a mapping of a generalized edge-disjoint path problem on a star graph onto a weighted maximum matching problem. We perform extensive numerical simulations on random graphs of various types to test the performance both in terms of path length minimization and maximization of the number of accommodated paths. In addition, we test the performance on benchmark instances on various graphs by comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms and results found in the literature. Our message-passing algorithm always outperforms the others in terms of the number of accommodated paths when considering non trivial instances (otherwise it gives the same trivial results). Remarkably, the largest improvement in performance with respect to the other methods employed is found in the case of benchmarks with meshes, where the validity hypothesis behind message-passing is expected to worsen. In these cases, even though the exact message-passing equations do not converge, by introducing a reinforcement parameter to force convergence towards a sub optimal solution, we were able to always outperform the other algorithms with a peak of 27% performance improvement in terms of accommodated paths. On random graphs, we numerically observe two separated regimes: one in which all paths can be accommodated and one in which this is not possible. We also investigate the behavior of both the number of paths to be accommodated and their minimum total length."
https://openalex.org/W2201396334,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is a crucial component in the regulation of gene expression in various cellular processes in animal and plant cells. HDAC has been reported to play a role in embryogenesis. However, the effect of HDAC on androgamete development remains unclear, especially in gymnosperms. In this study, we used the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB) to examine the role of HDAC in Picea wilsonii pollen germination and pollen tube elongation. Measurements of the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient revealed that TSA and NaB influenced this gradient. Immunofluorescence showed that actin filaments were disrupted into disorganized fragments. As a result, the vesicle trafficking was disturbed, as determined by FM4-64 labeling. Moreover, the distribution of pectins and callose in cell walls was significantly altered in response to TSA and NaB. Our results suggest that HDAC affects pollen germination and polarized pollen tube growth in Picea wilsonii by affecting the intracellular Ca2+ concentration gradient, actin organization patterns, vesicle trafficking, as well as the deposition and configuration of cell wall components."

We analyzed the differential gene expression of cardiac ion channels, and we found a total of 34 altered genes. We found that the calcium channel CACNG8 mRNA and protein levels were down-regulated and highly and inversely related with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = -0.78, P<0.01). Furthermore, the potassium channels KCNN3 and KCNJ2 mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated and showed also a significant and inverse correlation with LVEF (r = -0.61, P<0.05; r = -0.60, P<0.05) in patients with SMVT.A broad set of deregulated genes have been identified by RNA-sequencing technique. The relationship of CACNG8, KCNN3 and KCNJ2 with LVEF, and the up-regulation of KCNN3 and KCNJ2 in all patients with SMVT, irrespective of CACNG8 expression, suggest a significant role for these three ion flux related genes in the LV dysfunction present in this cardiomyopathy and an important relationship between KCNN3 and KCNJ2 up-regulation and the presence of SMVT."
https://openalex.org/W2215945119,"Lipid A is the active center of lipopolysaccharide which also known as endotoxin. Monophosphoryl-lipid A (MPLA) has less toxicity but retains potent immunoadjuvant activity; therefore, it can be developed as adjuvant for improving the strength and duration of the immune response to antigens. However, MPLA cannot be chemically synthesized and can only be obtained by hydrolyzing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) purified from Gram-negative bacteria. Purifying LPS is difficult and time-consuming and can damage the structure of MPLA. In this study, Escherichia coli mutant strains HWB01 and HWB02 were constructed by deleting several genes and integrating Francisella novicida gene lpxE into the chromosome of E. coli wild type strain W3110. Compared with W3110, HWB01 and HWB02 synthesized very short LPS, Kdo2-monophosphoryl-lipid A (Kdo2-MPLA) and Kdo2-pentaacyl-monophosphoryl-lipid A (Kdo2-pentaacyl-MPLA), respectively. Structural changes of LPS in the outer membranes of HWB01 and HWB02 increased their membrane permeability, surface hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation ability and sensitivity to some antibiotics, but the abilities of these strains to activate the TLR4/MD-2 receptor of HKE-Blue hTLR4 cells were deceased. Importantly, purified Kdo2-MPLA and Kdo2-pentaacyl-MPLA differed from wild type LPS in their ability to stimulate the mammalian cell lines THP-1 and RAW264.7. The purification of Kdo2-MPLA and Kdo2-pentaacyl-MPLA from HWB01 and HWB02, respectively, is much easier than the purification of LPS from W3110, and these lipid A derivatives could be important tools for developing future vaccine adjuvants."
https://openalex.org/W2208870467,"β-diketonates are customary bidentate ligands in highly luminescent ternary europium complexes, such as Eu(β-diketonate)3(L)2, where L stands for a nonionic ligand. Usually, the syntheses of these complexes start by adding, to an europium salt such as EuCl3(H2O)6, three equivalents of β-diketonate ligands to form the complexes Eu(β-diketonate)3(H2O)2. The nonionic ligands are subsequently added to form the target complexes Eu(β-diketonate)3(L)2. However, the Eu(β-diketonate)3(H2O)2 intermediates are frequently both difficult and slow to purify by recrystallization, a step which usually takes a long time, varying from days to several weeks, depending on the chosen β-diketonate. In this article, we advance a novel synthetic technique which does not use Eu(β-diketonate)3(H2O)2 as an intermediate. Instead, we start by adding 4 equivalents of a monodentate nonionic ligand L straight to EuCl3(H2O)6 to form a new intermediate: EuCl3(L)4(H2O)n, with n being either 3 or 4. The advantage is that these intermediates can now be easily, quickly, and efficiently purified. The β-diketonates are then carefully added to this intermediate to form the target complexes Eu(β-diketonate)3(L)2. For the cases studied, the 20-day average elapsed time reduced to 10 days for the faster synthesis, together with an improvement in the overall yield from 42% to 69%."
https://openalex.org/W2215397035,"The Mediterranean Sea and adjoining East Atlantic Ocean host a diverse array of small-sized mussels that predominantly live on sunken, decomposing organic remains. At least two of these, Idas modiolaeformis and Idas simpsoni, are known to engage in gill-associated symbioses; however, the composition, diversity and variability of these symbioses with changing habitat and location is poorly defined. The current study presents bacterial symbiont assemblage data, derived from 454 pyrosequencing carried out on replicate specimens of these two host species, collected across seven sample sites found in three oceanographic regions in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic. The presence of several bacterial OTUs in both the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic suggests that similar symbiont candidates occur on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. The results reveal markedly different symbiotic modes in the two species. Idas modiolaeformis displays high symbiont diversity and flexibility, with strong variation in symbiont composition from the East Mediterranean to the East Atlantic. Idas simpsoni displays low symbiont diversity but high symbiont fidelity, with a single dominant OTU occurring in all specimens analysed. These differences are argued to be a function of the host species, where subtle differences in host evolution, life-history and behaviour could partially explain the observed patterns. The variability in symbiont compositions, particularly in Idas modiolaeformis, is thought to be a function of the nature, context and location of the habitat from which symbiont candidates are sourced."

https://openalex.org/W2200487348,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway directs a multitude of cellular responses during embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. Stimulation of the pathway results in activation of Hh target genes by the transcription factor Ci/Gli, which binds to specific motifs in genomic enhancers. In Drosophila, only a few enhancers (patched, decapentaplegic, wingless, stripe, knot, hairy, orthodenticle) have been shown by in vivo functional assays to depend on direct Ci/Gli regulation. All but one (orthodenticle) contain more than one Ci/Gli site, prompting us to directly test whether homotypic clustering of Ci/Gli binding sites is sufficient to define a Hh-regulated enhancer. We therefore developed a computational algorithm to identify Ci/Gli clusters that are enriched over random expectation, within a given region of the genome. Candidate genomic regions containing Ci/Gli clusters were functionally tested in chicken neural tube electroporation assays and in transgenic flies. Of the 22 Ci/Gli clusters tested, seven novel enhancers (and the previously known patched enhancer) were identified as Hh-responsive and Ci/Gli-dependent in one or both of these assays, including: Cuticular protein 100A (Cpr100A); invected (inv), which encodes an engrailed-related transcription factor expressed at the anterior/posterior wing disc boundary; roadkill (rdx), the fly homolog of vertebrate Spop; the segment polarity gene gooseberry (gsb); and two previously untested regions of the Hh receptor-encoding patched (ptc) gene. We conclude that homotypic Ci/Gli clustering is not sufficient information to ensure Hh-responsiveness; however, it can provide a clue for enhancer recognition within putative Hedgehog target gene loci."
https://openalex.org/W2211009139,"Type VII collagen, as a major component of anchoring fibrils found at basement membrane zones, is crucial in anchoring epithelial tissue layers to their underlying stroma. Recently, type VII collagen was discovered in the inner human retina by means of immunohistochemistry, while proteomic investigations demonstrated type VII collagen at the vitreoretinal interface of chicken. Because of its potential anchoring function at the vitreoretinal interface, we further assessed the presence of type VII collagen at this site. We evaluated the vitreoretinal interface of human donor eyes by means of immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and Western blotting. Firstly, type VII collagen was detected alongside vitreous fibers6 at the vitreoretinal interface. Because of its known anchoring function, it is likely that type VII collagen is involved in vitreoretinal attachment. Secondly, type VII collagen was found within cytoplasmic vesicles of inner retinal cells. These cells resided most frequently in the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer. Thirdly, type VII collagen was found in astrocytic cytoplasmic inclusions, known as corpora amylacea. The intraretinal presence of type VII collagen was confirmed by Western blotting of homogenized retinal preparations. These data add to the understanding of vitreoretinal attachment, which is important for a better comprehension of common vitreoretinal attachment pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2206747014,"Genetic factors determining exercise capacity and the magnitude of the response to exercise training are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with exercise training in mice. Based on marked differences in training responses in inbred NZW (-0.65 ± 1.73 min) and 129S1 (6.18 ± 3.81 min) mice, a reciprocal intercross breeding scheme was used to generate 285 F2 mice. All F2 mice completed an exercise performance test before and after a 4-week treadmill running program, resulting in an increase in exercise capacity of 1.54 ± 3.69 min (range = -10 to +12 min). Genome-wide linkage scans were performed for pre-training, post-training, and change in run time. For pre-training exercise time, suggestive QTL were identified on Chromosomes 5 (57.4 cM, 2.5 LOD) and 6 (47.8 cM, 2.9 LOD). A significant QTL for post-training exercise capacity was identified on Chromosome 5 (43.4 cM, 4.1 LOD) and a suggestive QTL on Chromosomes 1 (55.7 cM, 2.3 LOD) and 8 (66.1 cM, 2.2 LOD). A suggestive QTL for the change in run time was identified on Chromosome 6 (37.8 cM, 2.7 LOD). To identify shared QTL, this data set was combined with data from a previous F2 cross between B6 and FVB strains. In the combined cross analysis, significant novel QTL for pre-training exercise time and change in exercise time were identified on Chromosome 12 (54.0 cM, 3.6 LOD) and Chromosome 6 (28.0 cM, 3.7 LOD), respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that combined cross analysis can be used to identify novel QTL and narrow the confidence interval of QTL for exercise capacity and responses to training. Furthermore, these data support the use of larger and more diverse mapping populations to identify the genetic basis for exercise capacity and responses to training."
https://openalex.org/W2221917984,"The use of digital information in geological fields is becoming very important. Thus, informatization in geological surveys should not stagnate as a result of the level of data accumulation. The integration and sharing of distributed, multi-source, heterogeneous geological information is an open problem in geological domains. Applications and services use geological spatial data with many features, including being cross-region and cross-domain and requiring real-time updating. As a result of these features, desktop and web-based geographic information systems (GISs) experience difficulties in meeting the demand for geological spatial information. To facilitate the real-time sharing of data and services in distributed environments, a GIS platform that is open, integrative, reconfigurable, reusable and elastic would represent an indispensable tool. The purpose of this paper is to develop a geological cloud-computing platform for integrating and sharing geological information based on a cloud architecture. Thus, the geological cloud-computing platform defines geological ontology semantics; designs a standard geological information framework and a standard resource integration model; builds a peer-to-peer node management mechanism; achieves the description, organization, discovery, computing and integration of the distributed resources; and provides the distributed spatial meta service, the spatial information catalog service, the multi-mode geological data service and the spatial data interoperation service. The geological survey information cloud-computing platform has been implemented, and based on the platform, some geological data services and geological processing services were developed. Furthermore, an iron mine resource forecast and an evaluation service is introduced in this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2180098427,"We consider a multi-species community modelled as a complex network of populations, where the links are given by a random asymmetric matrix J, with fraction 1-C of zero entries, where C reflects the over-all connectivity of the system. The non-zero elements of J are drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean 'mu' and standard deviation . The signs of the elements J reflect the nature of density-dependent interactions, such as predatory-prey, mutualism or competition, and their magnitudes reflect the strength of the interaction. In this study we try to uncover the broad features of the interspecies interactions that determine the global robustness of this network, as indicated by the average number of active nodes (i.e. non-extinct species) in the network, and the total population, reflecting the biomass yield. We find that the network transitions from a completely extinct system to one where all nodes are active, as the mean interaction strength goes from negative to positive. We also find that the total population, displays distinct non-monotonic scaling behaviour with respect to the product 'mu'C, implying that survival is dependent not merely on the number of links, but rather on the combination of the sparseness of the connectivity matrix and the net interaction strength. Moreover, the total population levels are optimal when the network has intermediate net positive connection strengths. At the local level we observe marked qualitative changes in dynamical patterns, ranging from anti-phase clusters of period 2 cycles and chaotic bands, to fixed points, under the variation of mean 'mu' of the interaction strengths. Lastly, we propose an effective low dimensional map to capture the behavior of the entire network, and this provides a broad understanding of the interplay of the local dynamical patterns and the global robustness trends in the network."

(Sutherlandia) is a South African botanical that is traditionally used to treat a variety of health conditions, infections and diseases, including cancer. We hypothesized Sutherlandia might act through Gli/ Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling in prostate cancer cells and used RNA-Seq transcription profiling to profile gene expression in TRAMPC2 murine prostate cancer cells with or without Sutherlandia extracts. We found 50% of Hh-responsive genes can be repressed by Sutherlandia ethanol extract, including the canonical Hh-responsive genes Gli1 and Ptch1 as well as newly distinguished Hh-responsive genes Hsd11b1 and Penk."
https://openalex.org/W2202456040,"The trafficking of T-lymphocytes to peripheral draining lymph nodes is crucial for mounting an adaptive immune response. The role of chemokines in the activation of integrins via Ras-related small GTPases has been well established. R-Ras is a member of the Ras-subfamily of small guanosine-5'-triphosphate-binding proteins and its role in T cell trafficking has been investigated in R-Ras null mice (Rras-/-). An examination of the lymphoid organs of Rras-/- mice revealed a 40% reduction in the cellularity of the peripheral lymph nodes. Morphologically, the high endothelial venules of Rras-/- mice were more disorganized and less mature than those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from Rras-/- mice had approximately 42% lower surface expression of L-selectin/CD62L. These aberrant peripheral lymph node phenotypes were associated with proliferative and trafficking defects in Rras-/- T cells. Furthermore, R-Ras could be activated by the chemokine, CCL21. Indeed, Rras-/- T cells had approximately 14.5% attenuation in binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 upon CCL21 stimulation. Finally, in a graft-versus host disease model, recipient mice that were transfused with Rras-/- T cells showed a significant reduction in disease severity when compared with mice transplanted with wild-type T cells. These findings implicate a role for R-Ras in T cell trafficking in the high endothelial venules during an effective immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2198896089,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are the bacterial adaptive immune system against foreign nucleic acids. Given the variable nature of CRISPR, it could be a good marker for molecular epidemiology. Group A streptococcus is one of the major human pathogens. It has two CRISPR loci, including CRISPR01 and CRISPR02. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of CRISPR-associated gene cassettes (cas) and CRISPR arrays in highly prevalent emm types. The cas cassette and CRISPR array in two CRISPR loci were analyzed in a total of 332 strains, including emm1, emm3, emm4, emm12, and emm28 strains. The CRISPR type was defined by the spacer content of each CRISPR array. All strains had at least one cas cassette or CRISPR array. More than 90% of the spacers were found in one emm type, specifically. Comparing the consistency between emm and CRISPR types by Simpson's index of diversity and the adjusted Wallace coefficient, CRISPR01 type was concordant to emm type, and CRISPR02 showed unidirectional congruence to emm type, suggesting that at least for the majority of isolates causing infection in high income countries, the emm type can be inferred from CRISPR analysis, which can further discriminate isolates sharing the same emm type."
https://openalex.org/W2204071669,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multifactorial disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. The combined effects of multiple susceptibility genes might result in a higher risk for IS than a single gene. Therefore, we investigated whether interactions among multiple susceptibility genes were associated with an increased risk of IS by evaluating gene polymorphisms identified in previous meta-analyses, including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, beta fibrinogen (FGB, β-FG) A455G and T148C, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2–4, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) G894T. In order to examine these interactions, 712 patients with IS and 774 controls in a Chinese Han population were genotyped using the SNaPshot method, and multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis was used to detect potential interactions among the candidate genes. The results of this study found that ACE I/D and β-FG T148C were significant synergistic contributors to IS. In particular, the ACE DD + β-FG 148CC, ACE DD + β-FG 148CT, and ACE ID + β-FG 148CC genotype combinations resulted in higher risk of IS. After adjusting for potential confounding IS risk factors (age, gender, family history of IS, hypertension history and history of diabetes mellitus) using a logistic analysis, a significant correlation between the genotype combinations and IS patients persisted (overall stroke: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–2.02, P < 0.001, large artery atherosclerosis subtype: adjusted OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.08–2.07, P = 0.016, small-artery occlusion subtype: adjusted OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.43–2.91, P < 0.001). The results of this study indicate that the ACE I/D and β-FG T148C combination may result in significantly higher risk of IS in this Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2208984186,"This report describes BioDry (patent pending), a method for reliably preserving the biomolecules associated with aquatic microbial biomass samples, without the need of hazardous materials (e.g. liquid nitrogen, preservatives, etc.), freezing, or bulky storage/sampling equipment. Gel electrophoresis analysis of nucleic acid extracts from samples treated in the lab with the BioDry method indicated that molecular integrity was protected in samples stored at room temperature for up to 30 days. Analysis of 16S/18S rRNA genes for presence/absence and relative abundance of microorganisms using both 454-pyrosequencing and TRFLP profiling revealed statistically indistinguishable communities from control samples that were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection. Seawater and river water biomass samples collected with a portable BioDry ""field unit"", constructed from off-the-shelf materials and a battery-operated pumping system, also displayed high levels of community rRNA preservation, despite a slight decrease in nucleic acid recovery over the course of storage for 30 days. Functional mRNA and protein pools from the field samples were also effectively conserved with BioDry, as assessed by respective RT-PCR amplification and western blot of ribulose-1-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BioDry can adequately preserve a suite of biomolecules from aquatic biomass at ambient temperatures for up to a month, giving it great potential for high resolution sampling in remote locations or on autonomous platforms where space and power are limited."
https://openalex.org/W2204718162,"For most olfactometers described in the literature, adjusting olfactory stimulation intensity involves modifying the dilution of the odorant in a neutral solution (water, mineral, oil, etc.), the dilution of the odorant air in neutral airflow, or the surface of the odorant in contact with airflow. But, for most of these above-mentioned devices, manual intervention is necessary for adjusting concentration. We present in this article a method of controlling odorant concentration via a computer which can be implemented on even the most dynamic olfactometers. We used Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), a technique commonly used in electronic or electrical engineering, and we have applied it to odor delivery. PWM, when applied to odor delivery, comprises an alternative presentation of odorant air and clean air at a high frequency. The cycle period (odor presentation and rest) is 200 ms. In order to modify odorant concentration, the ratio between the odorant period and clean air presentation during a cycle is modified. This ratio is named duty cycle. Gas chromatography measurements show that this method offers a range of mixing factors from 33% to 100% (continuous presentation of odor). Proof of principle is provided via a psychophysical experiment. Three odors (isoamyl acetate, butanol and pyridine) were presented to twenty subjects. Each odor was delivered three times with five values of duty cycles. After each stimulation, the subjects were asked to estimate the intensity of the stimulus on a 10 point scale, ranging from 0 (undetectable) to 9 (very strong). Results show a main effect of the duty cycles on the intensity ratings for all tested odors."
