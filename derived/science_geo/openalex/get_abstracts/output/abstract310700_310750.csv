https://openalex.org/W2168619221,"Stable isotope ratios of oxygen ((18)O/(16)O) and hydrogen (D/H) in water have long been considered powerful indicators of paleoclimate. However, quantitative interpretation of isotope variations in terms of climate changes is hampered by a limited understanding of physical processes controlling the global isotope behavior. Analysis was conducted of time series of (18)O content (delta (18)O) of monthly precipitation and surface air temperature available through the International Atomic Energy Agency-World Meteorological Organization global network, ""Isotopes in Precipitation."" This study indicates that long-term changes of isotopic composition of precipitation over mid-and high-latitude regions during the past three decades closely followed long-term changes of surface air temperature with the average 8180-temperature coefficient around 0.6 per mil per degree Celsius."
https://openalex.org/W2048722474,"The Paraná-Etendeka flood volcanic event produced approximately 1.5 x 10(6) cubic kilometers of volcanic rocks, ranging from basalts to rhyolites, before the separation of South America and Africa during the Cretaceous period. New (40)Ar/(39)Ar data combined with earlier paleomagnetic results indicate that Paraná flood volcanism in southern Brazil began at 133 +/- 1 million years ago and lasted less than 1 million years. The implied mean eruption rate on the order of 1.5 cubic kilometers per year is consistent with a mantle plume origin for the event and is comparable to eruption rates determined for other well-documented continental flood volcanic events. Paraná flood volcanism occurred before the initiation of sea floor spreading in the South Atlantic and was probably precipitated by uplift and weakening of the lithosphere by the Tristan da Cunha plume. The Parana event postdates most current estimates for the age of the faunal mass extinction associated with the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary."

Seismicity was calibrated with estimates based on surface structures on the moon and measured lunar seismicity that includes the entire seismogenic lithosphere. Results indicate that Mars is seismically active today, with a sufficient number of detectable marsquakes to allow seismic investigations of its interior."

https://openalex.org/W2044852727,"Large silicon carbide (SiC) particles extracted from acid-insoluble residues of carbonaceous chondrites are isotopically anomalous in both silicon and carbon and contain isotopically extreme noble gases. These particles are thought to have originated in mass outflows from red giant stars and to have existed in the interstellar medium at the time the solar system formed from an interstellar cloud. Calculations show that the silicon isotope correlations in those large SiC particles can be generated only in the most massive carbon stars. Consequently, the almost pure neon-22 (22Ne) in those particles must be interpreted as the condensation of radioactive sodium-22 (22Na) in the particles as they flowed away from the stars. The 22Na is produced through proton capture by 21Ne at the base of the surface convection zone. Neon-22 does not exist abundantly in helium shells hot enough to burn magnesium, which is necessary to establish the measured silicon isotopic composition."

https://openalex.org/W2042969352,"FROM the beginning of man's thoughtful consideration of natural processes, the phenomenon of sexual reproduction, with the associated phenomena of heredity, have persistently engaged his keenest interest. The primary fact of the necessary concurrence of two individuals in the production of offspring was, in the case of animals, recognized from the beginning. The equivalent phenomenon was not established for plants until the end of the seventeenth century. At this time, however, little more was known of the essential features of the sexual process in animals than had beenfamiliar to Assyrians, Egyptians and Greeks twenty centuries before. Of the additions made since 1700 to our knowledge of sexual reproduction, of its varied types and of the associated phenomena, no mean share has been contributed by botanical investigators. Noteworthy among such contributions are the work of Koelreuter and Mendel in the production and systematic study of plant hybrids, and the early work of Pfeffer on the chemotactic response of spermatozoids. Of more recent work we may cite that of the plant cytologists on apogamy and apospory, on multi-nucleate sexual eells or gametes, and on the long-delayed nuclear fusion in the sexual reproduction"
