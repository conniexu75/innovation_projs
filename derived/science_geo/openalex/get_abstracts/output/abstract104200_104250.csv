As recent evidence suggests that caveolae may participate in G protein-coupled signaling events, we have investigated the potential interaction of caveolin with heterotrimeric G proteins. Using cell fractionation techniques, we found that mutational or pharmacologic activation of Gsα prevents its cofractionation with caveolin. In a second independent approach, we directly examined the interaction of G proteins with caveolin. For this purpose, we recombinantly expressed caveolin as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Using an in vitro binding assay, we found that caveolin interacts with G protein α subunits (Gs, Go, and Gi). Mutational or pharmacologic activation (with guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)) of Gα subunits prevents this interaction, indicating that the inactive GDP-bound form of Gα subunits preferentially interacts with caveolin. This G protein binding activity is located within a 41-amino acid region of caveolin's cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (residues 61-101). Further functional analysis shows that a polypeptide derived from this region of caveolin (residues 82-101) effectively suppresses the basal activity of purified G proteins, apparently by inhibiting GDP/GTP exchange. This caveolin sequence is homologous to a region of the Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, a known inhibitor of GDP/GTP exchange for Rab proteins. These data suggest that caveolin could function to negatively regulate the activation state of heterotrimeric G proteins. Caveolae are flask-shaped plasma membrane specializations.

The PTH2 receptor is much more selective in ligand recognition and appears to have a more specific tissue distribution. It is activated by PTH and not by PTHrP and is particularly abundant in the brain and pancreas.

PTHrP was identified as an activity released from tumors that cause elevated serum calcium and was originally referred to as hypercalcemia of malignancy factor (for review, see Refs. 1Martin T.J.

PTHrP and PTH are products of distinct genes but have in common 8 out of their first 13 amino acids, and both activate a cloned PTH/PTHrP receptor(3Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.-B. Freeman M. Kong X.F.

PTH has effects in a number of tissues in addition to bone and kidney, including the heart, brain, liver, testis, pancreas, uterus, placenta, and blood cells (for references, see Ref. 5Tian J. Smogorzewski M. Kedes L. Massry S.G. Am. J. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). While mRNA encoding the PTH/PTHrP receptor is particularly abundant in kidney and bone, the receptor has a very widespread distribution (5Tian J. Smogorzewski M. Kedes L. Massry S.G. Am. J.

Fischer J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The effects of exogenous PTH and PTHrP are indistinguishable in most tissues (8Blind E. Knappe V. Schroth J. Ziegler R. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 101: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and on the cloned PTH/PTHrP receptor expressed in tissue culture cells(9Bringhurst F.R.

Circulating PTHrP is undetectable in the adult except for malignancies and lactating mothers(11Law F. Ferrari S. Rizzoli R. Bonjour J.-P. Adv. Nephrol. 1994; 23: 281-294PubMed Google Scholar); however, PTHrP mRNA or immunoreactivity has been demonstrated in many of the tissues that respond to exogenous PTH(12Lee K. Deeds J.D. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 453-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is currently thought that local PTHrP normally acts on the PTH/PTHrP receptors in most tissues(14Martin T.J. J. Intern. Med. 1993; 233: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The PTH/PTHrP receptor is a member of a recently recognized subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that includes the receptors for the glucagon-GHRH-VIP family of peptides (glucagon, GLP-I, GIP, GHRH, VIP, secretin, PACAP) and for calcitonin and CRF (see Ref. 15Usdin T.B. Bonner T.I. Mezey E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2662-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar for references). These receptors have no obvious sequence homology with the remaining majority of G-protein-coupled receptors but share 30-60% amino acid identity with each other. We have now identified a new PTH-recognizing receptor, which we refer to as the PTH2 receptor. Unlike the PTH/PTHrP receptor the PTH2 receptor recognizes PTH and not PTHrP, and it has a more circumscribed distribution than the PTH/PTHrP receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPCR using degenerate primers (3S1 and 7S3) was performed using a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library as the template. Material between 400 and 600 base pairs was excised from a 2% NuSieve-agarose gel, amplified again using the same primers, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, for which restriction sites were present in the PCR primers, and ligated into pUC18 vector. cDNA inserts in individual bacterial colonies were sequenced, as described previously(16Usdin T.B. Mezey E. Button D.C. Brownstein M.J. Bonner T.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2861-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). One of these sequences, encoding a potentially unique receptor, is referred to as CXS1.A human genomic clone containing the last 5 exons (to be described separately) was obtained from a cosmid library (Stratagene) using CXS1 as a probe. PCR using primers based on sequences within predicted exons in this clone (hCXS1f and hCXS1g) was used to identify a clone in a human cerebral cortex cDNA library. This clone did not contain the receptor's full coding sequence. cDNA was synthesized from human hippocampal RNA using random hexamer primers. Single-sided anchored PCR (anchored rapid amplification of cDNA ends(17Troutt A.B. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Pulendran B. Nossal G.J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9823-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) performed using nested antisense primers (hCXS1i and hCXS1k) derived from the partial cDNA clone yielded an additional sequence that included the apparent translation initiation site. PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with specific primers (hCXS1l and hCXS1k) generated a fragment overlapping the first partial clone. The two fragments were ligated at a ScaI site in the region of overlap and subcloned into the expression vector CMVires (16Usdin T.B. Mezey E. Button D.C. Brownstein M.J. Bonner T.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2861-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) to generate hPTH2.ires. All sequences were obtained as described previously(16Usdin T.B. Mezey E. Button D.C. Brownstein M.J. Bonner T.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2861-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The final sequence was obtained from both strands of overlapping restriction fragments from either the cDNA or genomic clones. Human PTH/PTHrP receptor cDNA was obtained by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) from human liver RNA using primers (PTHRup and PTHRdn) based on the known receptor sequence (GenBank U17418) and ligated into the vector CMVires. The human PTH/PTHrP receptor clone obtained lacks the exon containing the putative signal peptide (bases 172-294 in GenBank U17418) but otherwise contains the published coding sequence.

Neurosci. 1991; 2: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (19Marck C. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1995: 16.13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar) and transferred to 24 or 48 well plates the following day. Cells transiently expressing the receptors were assayed for ligand-stimulated β-galactosidase activity (LVIP cells) or cAMP (COS-7 cells) 72 or 96 h following transfection, as described previously (15Usdin T.B. Bonner T.I. Mezey E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2662-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) except that isobutylmethylxanthine was omitted from the LVIP incubation. LVIP reporter cells stably expressing the PTH2 receptor were generated following growth in G418 and selection of individual colonies.Northern blots of human RNA (Clontech) were hybridized to random hexamer-primed 32P-labeled probes corresponding to nucleotides 113-653 of the hPTH2 receptor, nucleotides 536-934 of the PTH/PTHrP receptor (GenBank U17418), or nucleotides 296-693 of mouse neuron-specific enolase (GenBank X52380; 91% identity with the human sequence). Hybridization was performed in 5 X SSPE, 10 X Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 2% SDS containing 100 μg/ml salmon DNA at 42°C overnight, and blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.2 X SSPE at 60°C and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate (Fuji Biomedical BAS2000).Nucleic acid sequence analysis was performed using the University of Wisconsin GCG package(20Marck C. Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package Genetics Computer Group. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar), DNA Strider(21Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), and Seqman (DNASTAR, Madison WI). Peptides were obtained from Bachem California. Human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos2 (HTB-85) and G-292 (CRL1423) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).RESULTSWe identified the PTH2 receptor based on its homology to related receptors. Starting with a PCR product obtained using degenerate primers derived from common amino acid sequences in the third and seventh transmembrane domains of the secretin, calcitonin, and PTH/PTHrP receptors and using a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library as the template, we obtained human cDNAs (see “Experimental Procedures”) encoding a composite 2.64-kb cDNA (GenBank U25128). It contains 143 bases of 5′-untranslated sequence, 1.65 kb of coding sequence, and 850 bases of 3′-untranslated sequence ending in an authentic poly(A) sequence (based on comparison with the gene sequence). The deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1. The sequence is a member of the subfamily that includes the receptors for secretin, VIP, GLP-I, PACAP, glucagon, GIP, GHRH, PTH, calcitonin, and CRF. The similarity of the deduced amino acid sequences of these receptors ranges from 32% (CRF receptor) to 70% (PTH/PTHrP receptor) identity. The PTH2 receptor has a number of features that are characteristic of this receptor subfamily, including a potential signal sequence (absent in most other G-protein-coupled receptors), a hydrophilic, predicted extracellular amino terminus of 138 residues that contains 6 conserved cysteine residues, and several highly conserved stretches of amino acids within the putative transmembrane domains. Several recent studies suggest that the amino-terminal domain contributes significantly to ligand binding specificity(22Juppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts J.T.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of the PTH/PTHrP receptor contains a 45-amino acid domain encoded by a distinct exon (exon E2) that can be deleted without apparent effect on function of the receptor(27Lee C.W. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Juppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There is no homologous sequence in the PTH2 receptor and no indication in our PCR reactions of a larger species, which might contain an additional exon. Thirty-three of 67 residues in the amino-terminal domains are identical between the PTH2 receptor and the PTH/PTHrP receptor when the potential signal sequences and the PTH/PTHrP receptor exon E2 are not considered.The ligand(s) activating the newly cloned PTH2 receptor was initially identified by screening LVIP reporter cells transiently expressing the receptor (LVIP cells are mouse L cells stably expressing a cAMP-responsive element fused to the bacterial lacZ gene so that activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to β-galactosidase accumulation(18Konig M. Mahan L.C. Marsh J.W. Fink S.J. Brownstein M.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1991; 2: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Of the ligands for the known members of the receptor subfamily and related peptides screened at 1 μM concentration, only PTH activated the receptor (data not shown). The response in LVIP cells transiently expressing the receptor is relatively small. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, experiments were performed by transient expression in COS-7 cells with radioimmunoassay of cAMP, and LVIP cells stably expressing the PTH2 receptor were selected.hPTH-(1-34) potently activates the PTH2 receptor expressed in COS-7 cells (EC50 0.86 ± 0.031 nM, data from three independent transfections of COS-7 cells, mean ± S.E.) while PTHrP-(1-36) had little or no effect (Fig. 2). In transfected COS-7 cells, in which hPTH-(1-34) produces a 5-25-fold increase in cAMP over the basal level no effect of 1 μM PTHrP-(1-36) was detected. The PTH/PTHrP receptor does not discriminate between PTH and PTHrP(3Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.-B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski L.F. Hock J. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 4Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Cell Biol. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Google Scholar). To verify that the lack of effect of PTHrP at the PTH2 receptor was a property of the receptor, and not our experimental conditions, we obtained a human PTH/PTHrP receptor clone by PCR. The clone that we obtained lacks the signal peptide encoding exon present in the previously described sequences and probably uses a different initiating methionine. However, the predicted amino acid sequence lacks only the first two residues past the predicted signal peptide of the previously characterized receptor. When expressed in COS-7 cells this PTH/PTHrP receptor responds to both hPTH-(1-34) and PTHrP-(1-36) as expected (Fig. 2) confirming that the lack of effect of PTHrP on the PTH2 receptor is a property of that protein. Maximal activation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor consistently led to less accumulation of cAMP than activation of the PTH2 receptor, which may be due to less efficient expression of the PTH/PTHrP receptor clone lacking its signal peptide. LVIP cells provide a less direct but more sensitive assay of receptor activation. PTHrP-(1-36) produces a small signal at 1 μM in LVIP cells stably expressing the PTH2 receptor, equivalent to ~50,000-fold less hPTH-(1-34) (Fig. 3). [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34)amide is slightly less potent than hPTH-(1-34). No increase in cAMP over basal levels was produced by any of these peptides in COS-7 or LVIP cells that were not transfected with one of the receptors.Figure 2:Stimulation of cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the PTH2 (◊ and ♦) or PTH/PTHrP (○ and ●) receptor. Seventy-two hours following transfection cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of hPTH-(1-34) (● and ♦) or PTHrP-(1-36) (○ and ◊) for 10 min at room temperature, and cAMP in aliquots of cell lysate was determined as described previously (15Usdin T.B.

The strongest signal is a single 3.5-kb band in brain RNA followed by 3.2- and 1.5-kb bands in the pancreas. We do not know whether the 1.5-kb band represents a distinct gene product. Because the blot was washed at high stringency it seems more likely that it represents an alternatively spliced mRNA. We do not know whether it codes for a functional protein since it is shorter than the coding sequence of the cDNA that we obtained. The testis and placenta samples contain less intense bands of 3.0-3.5 kb (while the lane containing the placenta sample is adjacent to the brain sample, hybridization with neuron-specific enolase suggests that the signal is not due to spillover). The cDNA sequences we obtained account for 2.64 kb. Since the cDNA contains a nonstandard polyadenylation signal (AATTAAA instead of AATAAA) an alternative polyadenylation site might account for some of the difference. Hybridization of a PTH/PTHrP receptor probe to the same Northern blot (Fig. 4, c and d) confirmed that distinct species are detected and emphasized that the distribution of the PTH/PTHrP receptor is much more widespread than that of the PTH2 receptor. The PTH/PTHrP receptor is particularly abundant in kidney, as previously reported(4Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V.

Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), while PTH2 receptor mRNA is not detected in the kidney by this procedure. Using reverse transcription PCR we failed to detect mRNA for the PTH2 receptor in RNA prepared from human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos2 and G-292; data not shown).Figure 4:Northern blots of human mRNA hybridized to probes recognizing the PTH2 receptor (upper panels) or the PTH/PTHrP receptor (lower panels). Blots were hybridized to random hexamer-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes and exposed for 72 h (PTH2) or 8 h (PTH/PTHrP) to a PhosphorImager plate (Fuji Biomedical BAS2000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have identified a novel PTH receptor, which we call the PTH2 receptor. The most notable difference from the PTH/PTHrP receptor is that it is recognized by PTH and not by PTHrP. An attractive possibility would be for the PTH2 receptor to mediate the effects of circulating PTH, thus providing selectivity. However, our preliminary investigation suggests that the PTH2 receptor is likely not to mediate the major effects of PTH on calcium and phosphate metabolism. Messenger RNA encoding the PTH2 receptor is not abundant in kidney or in the two bone-derived cell lines that we examined, all of which contain PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA. The PTH2 receptor is most likely to function in the brain and pancreas where its mRNA is particularly abundant, and possibly in the testis and placenta.The broad distribution of PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor in the brain has lead to the proposal that PTHrP is a neurotransmitter(29Weaver D.R. Deeds J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 28: 296-310Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). While attention is generally focused on PTH synthesized in the parathyroid gland there is also evidence for authentic PTH in the brain, particularly in several hypothalamic nuclei(30Pang P.K.T. Kaneko T. Harvey S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: R643-R647PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fraser R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Pang P.K.T. Harvey S. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2517-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intracerebral administration of PTH affects dopamine metabolism (32Harvey S. Hayer S. Sloley B.D. Peptides. 1993; 14: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and prolactin release (33Harvey S. Fraser R.A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and has effects on memory, nociperception, and serum Ca2+(33Harvey S. Fraser R.A. J.

It is not clear whether PTH or PTHrP normally has these effects or whether there is a distinction between the actions of endogenous PTH and PTHrP in the brain. In the areas of the rat brain where PTH mRNA has been demonstrated most clearly, the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus(31Fraser R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Pang P.K.T. Harvey S. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2517-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), PTH/PTHrP receptor mRNA levels are relatively low(29Weaver D.R. Deeds J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Mol.

Considerable insight into the receptor residues involved in ligand recognition has been gained by studying chimeras between species homologs of the PTH/PTHrP receptor (22Juppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T. Potts J.T.J. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.-B. Segre G.V. Gardella T.J.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ability of the PTH2 receptor to discriminate between PTH and PTHrP peptides and the high degree of similarity between the PTH2 and PTH/PTHrP receptors should prove useful in further characterizing the residues within both receptors that are responsible for ligand specificity.The potential role of the PTH2 receptor in disease and its usefulness in drug design are also areas for future exploration. While the PTH2 receptor does not appear abundant in kidney or bone where PTH is thought to exert most of its effects on mineral balance, recent data suggest that PTH also affects serum calcium through an action in the brain(34Matsui H. Aou S. Ma J. Hori T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: R21-R27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the PTH2 receptor is quite abundant. Thus the PTH2 receptor may play a role in mineral balance as well as other central nervous system and pancreatic functions. While the possibility of another endogenous ligand cannot be excluded, the high affinity and selectivity of the PTH2 receptor for PTH suggests that PTH is the native ligand.

PTHrP was identified as an activity released from tumors that cause elevated serum calcium and was originally referred to as hypercalcemia of malignancy factor (for review, see Refs. 1Martin T.J.

PTHrP and PTH are products of distinct genes but have in common 8 out of their first 13 amino acids, and both activate a cloned PTH/PTHrP receptor(3Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.-B. Freeman M. Kong X.F.

PTH has effects in a number of tissues in addition to bone and kidney, including the heart, brain, liver, testis, pancreas, uterus, placenta, and blood cells (for references, see Ref. 5Tian J. Smogorzewski M. Kedes L. Massry S.G. Am. J. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). While mRNA encoding the PTH/PTHrP receptor is particularly abundant in kidney and bone, the receptor has a very widespread distribution (5Tian J. Smogorzewski M. Kedes L. Massry S.G. Am. J.

Fischer J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The effects of exogenous PTH and PTHrP are indistinguishable in most tissues (8Blind E. Knappe V. Schroth J. Ziegler R. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1993; 101: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and on the cloned PTH/PTHrP receptor expressed in tissue culture cells(9Bringhurst F.R.

Circulating PTHrP is undetectable in the adult except for malignancies and lactating mothers(11Law F. Ferrari S. Rizzoli R. Bonjour J.-P. Adv. Nephrol. 1994; 23: 281-294PubMed Google Scholar); however, PTHrP mRNA or immunoreactivity has been demonstrated in many of the tissues that respond to exogenous PTH(12Lee K. Deeds J.D. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 453-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is currently thought that local PTHrP normally acts on the PTH/PTHrP receptors in most tissues(14Martin T.J. J. Intern. Med. 1993; 233: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The PTH/PTHrP receptor is a member of a recently recognized subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that includes the receptors for the glucagon-GHRH-VIP family of peptides (glucagon, GLP-I, GIP, GHRH, VIP, secretin, PACAP) and for calcitonin and CRF (see Ref. 15Usdin T.B. Bonner T.I. Mezey E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2662-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar for references). These receptors have no obvious sequence homology with the remaining majority of G-protein-coupled receptors but share 30-60% amino acid identity with each other. We have now identified a new PTH-recognizing receptor, which we refer to as the PTH2 receptor. Unlike the PTH/PTHrP receptor the PTH2 receptor recognizes PTH and not PTHrP, and it has a more circumscribed distribution than the PTH/PTHrP receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2087965877,"The Bacillus subtilis dlt operon (D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid) is responsible for D-alanine esterification of both lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid (WTA). The dlt operon contains five genes, dltA-dltE. Insertional inactivation of dltA-dltD results in complete absence of D-alanine from both LTA and WTA. Based on protein sequence similarity with the Lactobacillus casei dlt gene products (Heaton, M. P., and Neuhaus, F. C.(1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 4707-4717), we propose that [Abstract] dltA encodes the D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase (Dcl) and dltC the D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp). We further hypothesize that the products of dltB and dltD are concerned with the transport of activated D-alanine through the membrane and the final incorporation of D-alanine into LTA. The hydropathy profiles of the dltB and dltD gene products suggest a transmembrane location for the former and an amino-terminal signal peptide for the latter. The incorporation of D-alanine into LTA and WTA did not separate in any of the mutants studied which indicates that either one and the same enzyme is responsible for D-alanine incorporation into both polymers or a separate enzyme, encoded outside the dlt operon, transfers the D-alanyl residues from LTA to WTA (Haas, R., Koch, H.-U., and Fischer, W.(1984) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 21, 27-31). Inactivation of dltE has no effect on D-alanine ester content of both LTA and WTA, and at present we cannot propose any function for its gene product. Transcription analysis shows that the dlt operon is transcribed from a σD-dependent promoter and follows the pattern of transcription of genes belonging to the σD regulon. However, the turn off of transcription observed before sporulation starts seems to be dependent on the Spo0A and AbrB sporulation proteins and results in a D-alanine-free purely anionic LTA in the spore membrane.

They are named after the phosphate groups they contain in diester bonds and are classified in two groups: wall teichoic acids (WTA), which are phosphodiester-linked via a linkage unit to muramic acid residues of peptidoglycan(3Ward J.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 211-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hancock I.C. Baddiley J. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes.

V., Amsterdam1994: 199-215Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis 168, from which the strains studied here are derived, LTA and WTA possess a poly(glycerophosphate) chain that is substituted with D-alanine ester(7Glaser L. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3187-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Shimada A. Ito E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 508-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The poly(glycerophosphate) chains of LTA and WTA are generally synthesized by separate enzyme systems and contain enantiomeric glycerophosphate residues. For the biosynthesis of the glycosylated WTA-linkage unit complex, CDP-glycerol and nucleotide-activated sugars are used(3Ward J.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 211-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hancock I.C. Baddiley J. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1985: 279-307Crossref Google Scholar), which suggests that it occurs on the cytosolic site of the membrane, where the respective enzymes have access to their water-soluble substrates. In contrast, the biosynthesis of LTA uses lipid substrates and is thought to be located on the outer layer of the cytoplasmic membrane(5Fischer W. Handb. Lipid Res. 1990; 6: 123-234Google Scholar, 6Fischer W. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall, New Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1994: 199-215Google Scholar). The incorporation of D-alanine into LTA has been studied intensively in Lactobacillus casei and suggested to involve two enzymes and a D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp)(1Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D-Alanine, activated via D-alanyl AMP, is linked to Dcp and is used, possibly via a putative undecaprenol phosphate derivative, for the alanylation of membrane-associated LTA. Earlier experiments with Staphylococcus aureus revealed that the D-alanine ester of LTA is subject to a rapid turnover: part is lost by spontaneous hydrolysis, another part serves as donor for the D-alanylation of WTA(2Haas R. Koch H.U. Fischer W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 21: 27-31Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The loss of D-alanine ester from LTA is continuously compensated for by re-alanylation(10Koch H.U. Döker R. Fischer W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which requires activated D-alanine on the outer membrane layer and may therefore be accomplished by the same enzyme as the de novo incorporation into the growing chain. Essential roles for teichoic acids in bacterial physiology have repeatedly been suggested but it was only recently that insertional mutations documented that WTA is indeed required for growth of Bacillus subtilis(11Maul C. Young M. Margot P. Karamata D. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to B. subtilis, L. casei is devoid of WTA and contains only LTA(12Kelemen M.V. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In L. casei, mutants that loose the ability to synthesize LTA have not been observed and are apparently lethal. Mutants defective in D-alanylation of LTA displayed defective cell separation and aberrant morphology but definite proof that both phenotypes are caused by the same mutation is still lacking(13Ntamere A.S. Taron D.J. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1702-1711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of an operon responsible for the D-alanylation of both LTA and WTA in B. subtilis. This operon was identified in the framework of the European sequencing project of the B. subtilis chromosome(14Glaser P. Kunst F. Arnaud M. Coudart M.-P. Gonzales W. Hullo M.-F. Ionescu M.

Searches using the BLAST program were performed in the nonredundant protein library at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Sequences were compared using the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package, version 6.0 (University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI). Isogenic B. subtilis strains derivative of JH642 (trpC2, phe-1) used in this study were: JH646 (spo0A12), JH703abr4 (spo0A677, abrB4), JH642::pLM5 (sigD::pLM5cat)(18Helmann J.D. Marquez L.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). B. subtilis strains were grown in Schaeffer's sporulation medium (19Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) or in PY broth (Difco antibiotic medium 3). For biochemical analysis, bacteria were grown in two different media (A and B) that contained (per liter) the following: medium A: casein hydrolysate, 10 g; yeast extract, 0.5 g; glucose, 5 g (sterilized separately); NH4Cl, 2 g; K2HPO4, 18.5 g; KH2PO4, 2.5 g; trisodium citrate, 1 g; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.4 g; FeSO4.H2O, 0.01 g; MnSO4.H2O, 0.015 g; the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH and medium B: casein hydrolysate, 5 g; meat extract, 1.5 g; yeast extract, 1.5 g; glucose, 2 g (sterilized separately); K2HPO4, 3.68 g; KH2PO4, 1.32 g; the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. For batch growth, overnight cultures were diluted 40-fold and grown with vigorous aeration on a rotary shaker at 32°C to an A578 of approximately 4 and 2 in medium A and B, respectively. Cultures were rapidly cooled to 0°C, harvested by centrifugation (3600 rpm, 20 min) at 4°C and washed with cold 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.7 (buffer A), containing 9 g of NaCl/liter. Sporulation assays were carried out with cells grown for 24 h in Schaeffer's broth. Serial dilutions were then plated on Schaeffer's agar plates before and after treatment with CHCl3. Motility was assessed on semisolid agar plates(20Albertini A.M. Caramori T. Crabb W.D. Scoffone F. Galizzi A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3573-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation of B. subtilis strains by plasmid or chromosomal DNA was performed by standard procedures(21Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selections for antibiotic resistance were done at the following concentrations: chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml; kanamycin, 2 μg/ml; erythromycin and lincomycin (MLSR (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance)) 1 and 25 μg/ml, respectively. The lacZ fusion plasmid pDLT68 was used in the circular form to transform strain JH642 (selecting for KmR) to obtain strain JH642::pDLT68. The correct integration into the dlt locus was checked by PBS1 transduction and the Km resistance was found to be linked to the sacA marker at 335° on the chromosomal map. The fusion was transferred to different mutant strains using 0.1 μg of chromosomal DNA extracted from JH642::pDLT68 and selecting for KmR. Escherichia coli DH5α used for plasmid construction and propagation was grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. Chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis was prepared by the method of Marmur (22Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (8945) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Plasmid DNA from E. coli was purified by the boiling method of Holmes and Quigley(23Holmes D.S. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). The plasmids described in this study were constructed in the integrative vector pJM103 that carries a chloramphenicol resistance marker selectable in B. subtilis(24Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar). The lacZ fusion plasmid pDLT68 was constructed in pJM115 that derives from pDH32 by replacement of the chloramphenicol resistance gene with a Km resistance gene. Plasmid pDLT71 was constructed in the chloramphenicol cassette vector pJM105A (24Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar) in two steps. First, the 400-base pair BamHI-BglII fragment from pDLT52 was placed downstream of the cat gene. Then, the 1150-base pair fragment PvuI-BamHI from pDLT55 was placed upstream of the cat gene. In order to construct plasmid pDLT72, pDLT55 was digested with BclI, and the ends were blunted with Klenow polymerase. The 750-base pair central fragment was discarded, whereas the 5-kb portion carrying the vector was purified and ligated with a fragment containing the ermG gene obtained from the erythromycin cassette vector pJM109B (24Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar) after digestion with BamHI and SalI. All the ends were first made blunt using Klenow polymerase. Plasmid pDLT74A was obtained by first cloning the SphI-SalI fragment (Fig. 1) in pJM103 and then inserting the fragment with the km gene from the Km cassette vector pJM114 (24Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar) in the EcoRV site. Bacteria (5 g, wet mass) were suspended in buffer A (12.5 ml) and disrupted in a Braun disintegrator with glass beads under cooling with CO2(25Fischer W. Koch H.U. Haas R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Glass beads were removed by filtration in a sintered glass funnel. Samples of the homogenate were taken in triplicate for the determination of dry mass (1 ml), phosphorus (0.025 ml), isolation of LTA (2 ml), preparation of cell walls (0.25 ml), and lipid extraction (2 ml). Operational steps were performed at pH 4.7 and, as possible, at 2-4°C. LTA was extracted from the homogenate by hot phenol/water and isolated from the aqueous layer by hydrophobic chromatography on octyl-Sepharose using a downscaled centrifugation procedure(26Koch H.U. Haas R. Fischer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For cell wall preparation, the homogenate was diluted fourfold with SDS in buffer A to a final concentration of 2% (mass/volume). The mixture was sonicated for 15 min, then vigorously shaken at 65°C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation and washing of the pellet five times with buffer A (1 ml each). Lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh Dyer procedure (27Kates M. Techniques in Lipidology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) using buffer A instead of water. WTA constituents were released from purified walls by hydrolysis with 48% (by mass) HF, 2°C, 36 h. After drying in vacuum at 2°C, the hydrolysate was suspended in 0.01 M lithium acetate, pH 4.7, and WTA constituents were separated from dephosphorylated walls by centrifugation (12,000 x g). The supernatant was subjected to hydrolysis with 2 M HCl, 100°C, 2.5 h and then analyzed for phosphorus(28Schnitger H. Papenberg K. Ganse E. Czok R. Bücher T. Adam H. Biochem. J. 1959; 332: 167-185Google Scholar), D-glucose(29Kunst A. Draeger B. Ziegenhorn J. Bermeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 163-172Google Scholar), D-alanine (30Grassl M. Supp M. Bermeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis.

Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1985: 2-12Google Scholar). Glc(α1-2)Gro was identified in HF hydrolysates as trifluoroacetate by gas liquid chromatography(34Leopold K. Fischer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Galactosamine, a constituent of the minor WTA species(37Strauch M.A. Spiegelman G.B. Perego M. Johnson W.C. Burbulys D. Hoch J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), was measured after hydrolysis with 4 M HCl (100°C, 18 h). LTA was hydrolyzed in 2 M HCl at 100°C for 2.5 h and analyzed for phosphorus, D-alanine, glucose, and glycerol, the latter being measured after further treatment with phosphomonoesterase. Glucosamine was quantified after hydrolysis of LTA in 4 M HCl, 100°C, 18 h (33Fischer W. Behr T. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Glc(α1-2)Gro, GlcNAc(α1-2)Gro, and Glc(β1-6)Glc(β1-3)Gro were identified in the HF hydrolysate of deacylated LTA as trifluoroacetates by gas liquid chromatography(34Leopold K. Fischer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The chain length of LTA was calculated from molar amounts of phosphorus and glucose by the formula: phosphorus/0.5 glucose multiplied by 1.1 for correction of chain Glc(α1-2)Gro. The total alanine of LTA and WTA was ester-linked, as shown by release through mild alkaline treatment (0.1 M NaOH, 37°C, 1 h). Cultures for β-galactosidase assays were grown in Schaeffer's sporulation medium. The assay was carried out as described previously(35Ferrari E. Henner D.J. Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the units were calculated according to Miller(36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting experiments were performed using plasmid pDLT62. The fragment carrying the dlt promoter was digested with HindIII (which is in the multiple cloning site adjacent to the PvuII) site, end-labeled using Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Corp.), and excised with BamHI digestion. DNase I protection experiments with Spo0A and AbrB were performed as described previously(37Strauch M.A. Spiegelman G.B. Perego M. Johnson W.C. Burbulys D. Hoch J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The labeled fragment was also subjected to Maxam and Gilbert A + G and C + T sequencing reactions (38Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar) to generate a reference ladder. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five genes from the dlt operon were analyzed using the programs described under “Material and Methods.” The dltA gene product is highly similar to L. casei Dcl, the dltA gene product, and also, to a lower extent, to peptidyl antibiotic synthetase domains. The alignment of the B. subtilis DltA protein sequence with its counterpart from L. casei and the synthetase domain from Bacillus brevis gramicidin synthase (GrsB) (39Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) is presented in Fig. 2A. The region surrounding the putative phosphate binding loop GXXGXPKG as well as the two other regions proposed by Heaton and Neuhaus (1Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as essential for the formation of the acyl adenylate are particularly well conserved in these three proteins. Analysis of the hydropathy profile of DltA (data not shown) suggests a cytoplasmic localization. Protein sequence comparison of the B. subtilis DltB protein with the first 188 codons of L. casei dltB gene product (1Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown) reveals an high percentage of identical residues (50%). The hydropathy profile of DltB from B. subtilis shows the presence of hydrophobic domains which suggest a transmembrane localization (Fig. 3). The amino acid composition of this protein also shows a strong predominance of positively charged versus negatively charged residues (24 lysine, 12 arginine, and 17 histidine residues versus 8 aspartic acid and 7 glutamic acid residues). The dltC gene product is a putative D-alanine carrier protein (Dcp) based on similarity to acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid biosynthesis. Amino acid sequence alignments of the B. subtilis DltC with ACPs from different origins and the amino-terminal sequence of L. casei Dcp (9Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 2B. The sequence surrounding the serine residue to which the 4′-phosphopanthoteine prosthetic group is linked is an highly conserved region. Like the other ACPs, the B. subtilis Dcp is a negatively charged protein (8 aspartic and 10 glutamic acid residues for a 78-amino acid-long protein). The product of the fourth gene, dltD, does not have any significant similarity to known proteins. Amino acid composition and hydropathy profile (Fig. 3) suggest the presence of an amino-terminal signal peptide: 3 positively charged residues followed by a core of hydrophobic residues (MKKRFFGPIILAFILFAGAIA). Therefore DltD could be a secreted protein, and the amino-terminal sequence could anchor the protein to the outer face of the cell membrane. The rest of the protein is hydrophilic and highly positively charged (45 lysine, 10 arginine, and 8 histidine residues versus 15 aspartic acid and 25 glutamic acid residues). The positively charged residues are mostly clustered in three regions at position 164 (KKKMMKRMLRFK), at position 268 (KKLKPKVPKLKGKNKGR) and at position 328 (KKGRTDYYKVNKQUIRAK). The product of the last gene of the operon is homologous to a large family of oxidoreductases, including the E. coli 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (40Rawlings M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5751-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The deduced protein sequence of DltE suggests a cytoplasmic localization. In order to define the physiological role for each of the five genes in the B. subtilis dlt operon, we constructed a series of mutant strains using the insertional mutagenesis technique with integrational vectors(24Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar). Two strategies were followed. 1) B. subtilis competent cells were transformed with an integrative vector containing a DNA fragment internal to the dlt operon. Chromosomal integration of such a plasmid by a Campbell-type single crossover event results in the disruption of the dlt transcriptional unit. In this way, we obtained: (i) integration of plasmid pDLT65A that resulted in interruption of transcription at the BamHI site internal to dltA; (ii) integration of pDLT77 that stopped transcription at the DraI site in dltC but allowed the synthesis of complete dltA and dltB gene products; iii) integration of pDLT76 that gave rise to a mutant that was missing only the dltE gene product (Fig. 1). 2) Two plasmids were constructed, pDLT71 and pDLT72 (Fig. 1) which, upon linearization and integration in the B. subtilis chromosome by double crossover gave rise to a deletion-gene replacement event. Integration of pDLT71 resulted in the deletion of the promoter region, dltA and part of dltB (replaced by the chloramphenicol resistance gene). The resulting strain was defective for all the functions coded by the dlt operon. Integration of pDLT72, on the other hand, deleted a portion of dltB (replaced by the erythromycin resistance determinant), but left the dltA gene intact. A third plasmid, pDLT74A (Fig. 1), after integration by double crossover resulted in interruption of the transcriptional unit at the EcoRV site in dltD due to the presence of the km gene. Since transcription from the km promoter occurs opposite to the transcription of dlt, no transcription of dltE could occur. This resulted in a mutant strain synthesizing a truncated dltD gene product and completely defective for dltE but unaffected for the transcription of dltA, dltB, and dltC. None of the constructed mutants showed a defective phenotype for cell division or morphology as observed by phase-contrast microscopy with cultures grown on agar plates or in liquid media. Unaltered cell morphology and septation were confirmed by electron microscopy.2( 2J. Wecke, M. Perego, and W. Fischer, unpublished data. )However, dlt mutants were not motile compared with the wild type strain, as assessed on semisolid agar plates, although they were equally motile when cells were grown in liquid medium and observed by phase-contrast microscopy. LTA was extracted, and cell walls were prepared from mechanically disintegrated bacteria under conditions that preserve the native substitution of LTA and WTA with D-alanine ester(25Fischer W. Koch H.U. Haas R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 41Fischer W. Koch H.U. Rösel P. Fiedler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4557-4562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In B. subtilis JH642, LTA and WTA are composed of poly(glycerophosphate) chains, as indicated by an equimolar ratio in both polymers of glycerol and phosphorus (data not shown). A minor WTA species composed of Glc(β1-3)GalNAc-1-P repeats (32Shibaev V.N. Duckworth M. Archibald A.R. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) did not contribute more than 9 ± 2% to total WTA phosphorus, as was estimated by galactosamine measurement in WTA hydrolysates. In a first series of experiments, bacteria were grown in medium A. As shown in Table I, the LTA of the wild type strain JH642 contained on average 29 glycerophosphate residues/chain. Forty-four percent of the glycerophosphate residues were substituted with D-alanine ester, 10% with N-acetyl-α-D-glucosaminyl, and less than 1% with α-D-glucopyranosyl residues. In WTA 9% of the glycerophosphate moieties were substituted with D-alanine ester and 64% with α-D-glucopyranosyl residues.Table I:LTA and WTA of B. subtilis wild type and dlt mutant strains during vegetative growth Open table in a new tab Insertional inactivation of dltA (pDLT65A), dltB (pDLT72), dltC (pDLT77) and dltD (pDLT74A) each caused complete absence of D-alanine ester from both LTA and WTA (Table I). However D-alanine incorporation into LTA and WTA, to an extent comparable with that of the wild type strain, was seen when dltE was inactivated (pDLT76). It should be noted that, compared with the parent strain, the content of WTA and LTA was unchanged in all mutant strains: per gram of bacterial dry mass it amounted to 354 ± 24 μmol and 63 ± 3 μmol phosphorus, respectively, and contributed 32.1 ± 1.5% and 5.7 ± 0.3% to the total cellular phosphorus (data not shown). Also, in the mutant strains there was no systematic change either in the chain length of LTA or in the extent of glucosylation of WTA (Table I). It was only the substitution of LTA-glycerol with N-acetylglucosaminyl residues that increased from 10 to 19% when D-alanine ester was not incorporated. In order to verify that dltE is actually not involved in D-alanine incorporation into WTA, bacteria were grown in the low salt medium B. Under these conditions, the alanine substitution of WTA-glycerol increased from 10 to 25% in the wild type strain, and this increase was paralleled by the alanine content of WTA in the mutant strain pDLT76 in which dltE is inactive.

Experimental flies containing single extra doses of Drosophila Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase genes were compared with appropriate controls at different ages. Overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase caused a retardation in the accumulation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine during aging and in response to the exposure of live flies to x-rays. The age-related loss of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (Glu-6-P dehydrogenase) and the increase in the rate of mitochondrial H2O2 generation were less steep in the experimental than control flies. The rate of in vivo oxygen consumption in the latter two-thirds of life span was higher in the experimental than in the control flies. Furthermore, the metabolic potential, or the total amount of oxygen consumed during an average life span, was about 30% greater in the experimental than the control flies. Altogether, results of this study indicate that overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase ameliorates the age-related accumulation of molecular oxidative damage and susceptibility to such damage in response to acute oxidative stress while prolonging the metabolic life of flies. The concept that oxidative stress is a causal factor in the aging process is supported.

A related protein, designated the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, that specifically binds apolipoprotein (apo) E has recently been characterized and shown to be expressed in heart, muscle and adipose tissue and the human monocyte-macrophage cell line THP-1. The VLDL receptor binds and internalizes VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein from Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits as well as β-migrating VLDL from cholesterol-fed rabbits but not LDL from WHHL rabbits. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the rabbit VLDL receptor cDNA have now been shown to bind or internalize VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) isolated from fasted normolipidemic human subjects with lower affinity than WHHL-VLDL or rabbit β-VLDL. However, binding and internalization were markedly enhanced when fasted human VLDL was preincubated with either recombinant human apoE (3/3) or lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in CHO cells overexpressing the rabbit or human VLDL receptor. CHO cells transfected with both the rabbit VLDL receptor cDNA and the human LPL cDNA effectively bound, internalized, and degraded fasted human VLDL without pretreatment. Treatment of heparinase reduced the effect of LPL-mediated binding at 4°C, but the inhibitory effect was lower at 37°C. Pseudomonas LPL also enhanced the binding of human fasted VLDL to the VLDL receptor at 37°C in CHO cells overexpressing the human VLDL receptor. Taken together, LPL causes the enhancement of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins binding to the VLDL receptor via both the formation of bridge between lipoproteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans and its lipolytic effect. Ligand blot analysis showed that the apparent molecular mass of the VLDL receptor is 118 kDa, which is smaller than that of the LDL receptor. These results indicate that the VLDL receptor recognizes both triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are also relatively rich in apoE, as well as the remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins after catabolism and the interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans by LPL. The VLDL recep-tor may thus function as a receptor for remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in extrahepatic tissues.

Lipid-laden cells, or foam cells, are a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions. These cells originate from both smooth muscle cells and macrophages, with experimental evidence supporting a major role for macrophages in foam cell formation(8Ross R.

Cholesterol-rich β-VLDL, which is present in the plasma of cholesterol-fed animals, is thought to induce the atherosclerosis observed in these animal models (10). β-VLDL obtained from cholesterol-fed animals of several species promoted cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages; VLDL from normal animals did not stimulate cholesteryl ester synthesis(11Goldstein J.L.

Cholesterol-rich VLDL from WHHL rabbits also induced marked cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages(13Kita T. Yokode M. Watanabe Y. Narumiya S. Kawai C. J. Clin.

Most of the free cholesterol is then re-esterified in the cytoplasm, where it accumulates as lipid droplets. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of VLDL receptor mRNA in rabbit resident alveolar macrophages, and the mRNA was not down-regulated by β-VLDL (17Suzuki J. Takahashi S. Oida K. Shimada A. Kohno M. Tamai T. Miyabo S. Yamamoto T. Nakai T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that macrophages take up triglyceride-rich lipoproteins via the VLDL receptor and are then transformed into foam cells. However, little is known of the mechanism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins uptake via the VLDL receptor. Macrophages secrete proteins, such as apoE and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), that alter the binding affinity of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins for lipoprotein receptors. Crespo et al.(18Crespo P. Ros M.A. Ordovás J.M. Rodriguez J.C. Ortiz J.M. León J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) showed that apoE mRNA is present in foam cells forming an atherosclerotic plaque but not in smooth muscle cells from the vessel media. Rosenfeld et al.(19Rosenfeld M.E. Bulter S. Ord V.A. Lipton B.A. Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also demonstrated macrophage-specific apoE expression in rabbit and human atherosclerotic lesions. Lindqvist et al.(20Lindqvist P. Ostlund-Lindqvist A.-M. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Little J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by LPL is essential for the uptake of the lipoproteins by macrophages. Ylä-Herttuala et al. (21) showed by in situ hybridization and immunochemistry that a subfraction of lesion macrophages and smooth muscle cells in human and rabbit atherosclerotic aorta contained LPL mRNA. O'Brien et al.(22O'Brien K.D. Gordon D. Deeb S. Ferguson M. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) also demonstrated by in situ hybridization that macrophage-derived foam cells are the primary source of LPL in human coronary plaques. Thus, it is important to elucidate the separate effects of apoE and LPL on the role of the VLDL receptor in foam cell formation. We have now examined the effects of apoE and LPL on the uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins via the VLDL receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells and clarified the apparent molecular mass of the VLDL receptor by ligand blotting. All restriction enzymes and other nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzou (Otsu, Japan) and Life Technologies, Inc.

Plasmid pCMV-LPL, in which human LPL cDNA was fused to the cytomegalovirus Rc/CMV vector (Invitrogen), was a gift of Drs. Takanari Gotoda and Nobuhiro Yamada (Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo)(24Gotoda T. Senda M. Gamou T. Furuichi Y. Oka K.

All other chemicals were of reagent grade or the best commercially available. Human VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was isolated from the plasma of fasted normolipidemic subjects by ultracentrifugation with a Hitachi RP-70Ti rotor(27Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Rabbit β-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was isolated from the plasma of Japanese white rabbits fed a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol for 4 weeks. Lipoproteins were subjected to a second ultracentrifugation, isolated at the same density, and exhaustively dialyzed against 150 mM NaCl and 0.24 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Bovine lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (d > 1.215 g/ml) was isolated from fetal bovine serum. Lipoproteins were labeled with 125I by the method of Bolton and Hunter(28Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The final specific activity was 200-750 cpm/ng protein, and more than 96% of the 125I radioactivity was precipitable by incubation with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Fluorescently labeled lipoproteins were prepared by incorporation of DiI as described(29Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al.(30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids (5.4 μg) encoding the rabbit VLDL receptor (pVLDLR-1), the human VLDL receptor (ph-VLR2), or the human LDL receptor (pLDLR-2) and pSV2-neo, which contains the neomycin resistant gene(31Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected to ldlA-7 cells using Lipofectin (32Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4370) Google Scholar) as described previously (2-4, 17). The clones were screened with the use of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(33Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13494) Google Scholar), Northern blot analysis, and ligand blot assay (mentioned below). Positive cell clones for the rabbit VLDL receptor, the human VLDL receptor, and the human LDL receptor were designated V-1, V-2, and L-2 cells, respectively. A transfectant with only pSV2-neo was used for control cells (N-1 cells). We also established a cell line, designated V+LPL, which was cotransfected with the rabbit VLDL receptor cDNA (pVLDLR-1) and the human LPL cDNA (pCMV-LPL). To confirm the expression of the human LPL cDNA in the selected clone, we measured LPL activity and LPL protein in the culture medium and performed Northern blot analysis with a human LPL cDNA probe. Transfected cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). For experiments designed to assay the ligand binding activity of the transfectants, cells were seeded at a density of 1 = 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes. After 2 days, the medium was removed and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 125I-Labeled lipoproteins were added to the cells in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% LPDS. After 4 h at 37°C or 4°C, the cell association (binding and internalization) of 125I-lipoproteins was measured by assaying the amount of radioactivity associated with the cells that was dissolved by 1 N NaOH. The proteolytic degradation of 125I-lipoproteins was measured by assaying the amount of radioactivity of 125I-labeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble (non-iodide) material formed by the cells and released into the culture medium, as described by Goldstein and Brown(34Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular protein was measured according to the method of Lowry et al.(30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and varied by less than 10% within each assay. To confirm the contribution of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, heparinase (2.4 units/ml) was preincubated for 2 h at 37°C before the binding assays. The amount of specific activity was determined by subtracting the radioactivity associated with N-1 cells from that associated with V-1, V-2, and V+LPL cells to exclude the effect of LRP (LDL receptor-related protein). All binding assays were performed in triplicate. For binding studies with fluorescently labeled lipoproteins, transfected cells were seeded at 5 = 105 cells/35-mm dish. After 2 days, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 4 h at 37°C with DiI-labeled lipoproteins in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% LPDS. N-1 cells were used as a control to check the effect of LRP. Membrane fractions of transfected cells were prepared by the method of Hofmann et al.(35Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Lee E. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8260-8270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 7.5% slab gels containing 0.1% SDS. The samples were not exposed to a reducing agent and were not heated. Proteins were transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose paper with the use of a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Ligand blotting was performed with 125I-labeled β-VLDL from the plasma of cholesterol-fed rabbits with or without LPL (35). Rainbow protein markers were used to calibrate molecular mass. Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells by the acid/guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) and fractionated on a 3% agarose gel (10 μg/lane). After transfer to a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe; Bio-Rad), RNA was cross-linked by exposure to 120 mJ of ultraviolet radiation. Transcripts encoding human LPL were detected by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe prepared from human LPL cDNA. The membrane was finally washed, air-dried, and subjected to autoradiography for 4 days. LPL activity and LPL protein were assayed by the modified method of Nozaki et al.(37Nozaki S. Kubo M. Matsuzawa Y. Tarui S. Clin. Chem. 1984; 30: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the method of Ikeda et al.(38Ikeda Y. Takagi A. Ohkaru Y. Nogi K. Iwanaga T. Kurooka S. Yamamoto A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1911-1924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with Markit-F LPL (Dainippon, Osaka, Japan). Briefly, the cells were seeded at 2 = 105 cells/35-mm dishes. After 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% LPDS and heparin (0.5 units/ml) for 20 min at 37°C. The culture medium was then collected and stored at −80°C until the assay. We have previously shown that the rabbit VLDL receptor binds and internalizes VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) and IDL (1.006 g/ml < d < 1.019 g/ml) from WHHL rabbits as well as β-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) from cholesterol-fed rabbits with high affinity but not LDL (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml) from WHHL rabbits(2Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 3Yamamoto T. Takahashi S. Sakai J. Kawarabayasi Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Human fasted 125I-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) from normolipidemic subjects was recognized by the VLDL receptor with lower affinity compared with β-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) from cholesterol-fed rabbits and VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) from WHHL rabbits (Fig. 1). But ligand blot assay, which has higher sensitivity than cell culture binding assay, showed a clear band corresponding to the VLDL receptor when fasted human VLDL was used as a ligand (data not shown). Those data were consistent with the results of Battey et al.(39Battey F.D. Gafves M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who used the solid-phase binding assay. The binding and internalization of 125I-labeled VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) from fasted humans in the rabbit or human VLDL receptor-overexpressing cells were dependent on preincubation of the VLDL with apoE (Fig. 2). These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles enriched in apoE are more effectively recognized by the VLDL receptor.Figure 2:Effect of recombinant apoE on the binding and internalization of fasted human 125I-VLDL in V-1 (○) and V-2 cells (Δ). V-1 and V-2 cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% LPDS and containing 125I-VLDL (208 or 394 cpm/ng of protein) from fasted humans that had been preincubated at a concentration of 3.6 μg of protein/ml in V-1 cells and 2.5 μg/ml in V-2 cells with the indicated concentration of recombinant apoE (3/3) for 1 h at 37°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 shows the effect of bovine LPL on rabbit β-VLDL binding to the human VLDL receptor using ligand blot assay. Several bands more than the VLDL receptor appeared when bovine LPL was incubated with 125I-β-VLDL; especially the band corresponding to LRP was detected. To exclude the effect of LRP on the binding of fasted human VLDL, the data were calculated by subtracting the value of N-1 cells from that of V-1 or V-2 cells in the radiolabeled lipoprotein assay. In the case of fluorescently labeled lipoprotein binding assay, we compared V-1 and V-2 cells with N-1 cells. Bacterial LPL was dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM deoxycholate and 0.1 mM SDS. This lipase has lipolytic activity similar to that of LPL, but it is a structurally different protein(40Kokusho Y. Machida H. Iwasaki S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1982; 46: 1743-1750Google Scholar). The binding and internalization of fasted human 125I-VLDL or 125I-β-VLDL from cholesterol-fed rabbits (d < 1.006 g/ml) in V-1 cells were increased after preincubation of lipoprotein with bacterial LPL (Fig. 4A). In V-2 cells overexpressing the human VLDL receptor, bovine LPL also enhanced the binding of fasted human 125I-VLDL to the human VLDL receptor (Fig. 4B). Pseudomonas LPL, which have no effect on LRP(41Beisiegel U. Weber W. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8342-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), enhanced the binding of fasted human fluorescently labeled VLDL to the human VLDL receptor (data not shown). To investigate whether this effect of bacterial LPL was observed with human LPL, we cotransfected ldlA-7 cells with the rabbit VLDL receptor cDNA and the human LPL cDNA (V+LPL cells). LPL activity and LPL protein released into the medium by V+LPL cells were 106.0 ± 11.0 nmol of free fatty acid/ml/min and 313.4 ± 33.0 ng/mg of cell protein (means ± S.E.; n = 3), respectively. The corresponding values for V-1 cells were 2.0 ± 1.0 nmol ml-1 min-1 and 91.7 ± 10.2 ng/mg of cell protein, respectively. Northern blot analysis of V-1 cells revealed only a 4.0-kilobase Chinese hamster LPL mRNA, whereas V+LPL cells also contained an abundant 2.3-kilobase human LPL mRNA (Fig. 5A). Expression of the rabbit VLDL receptor in V-1 cells and V+LPL cells was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5B). V-1 cells and V+LPL cells revealed an abundant 3.6-kilobase rabbit VLDL receptor mRNA, whereas N-1 cells had very low levels of VLDL receptor mRNA. The association of fasted human VLDL or β-VLDL with V+LPL cells was compared with that with V-1 cells. Whereas V-1 cells took up fluorescently labeled fasted human VLDL slightly, they did take up DiI-labeled rabbit β-VLDL clearly (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, both fluorescently labeled fasted human VLDL and rabbit β-VLDL were taken up by V+LPL cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Control cells (N-1 cells) transfected with pSV2-neo alone did not take up fluorescently labeled fasted human VLDL or rabbit β-VLDL (data not shown). In V+LPL cells, the degradation of 125I-labeled fasted human VLDL increased in a dose-dependent manner and was not saturable (Fig. 7). These data indicated that both bacterial LPL and human LPL enhanced the receptor-mediated endocytosis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins via the VLDL receptor. To confirm that the effect of LPL on the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to the VLDL receptor is its lipolytic effect or the formation of bridge between lipoproteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, we examined the binding assay for 3 h at 4 or 37°C after preincubation of heparinase (2.4 units/ml) for 2 h at 37°C. Even at 4°C, V+LPL cells showed that LPL also enhanced the binding of fasted human VLDL to the VLDL receptor. Treatment of heparinase induced the inhibitory effect of LPL-mediated fasted human VLDL binding to the VLDL receptor at 4 and 37°C by 75.5 and 15.4%, respectively (Fig. 8). We suggest that there are two mechanisms of LPL-mediated binding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to the VLDL receptor. One is the bridge between lipoproteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and other is its lipolytic activity.Figure 4:Effect of bacterial LPL or bovine LPL on the binding and internalization of fasted human 125I-VLDL and rabbit 125I-β-VLDL in V-1 cells and V-2 cells.

In the presence of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase, in vitro phosphorylation of the minor autophosphorylation sites was increased, and four additional residues were phosphorylated. Following EGF stimulation, two (Tyr-891 and Tyr-920) were found to be phosphorylated in a colorectal cell line (DLD-1) and in a breast tumor cell line (MCF7). The remaining in vitro sites were not found to be highly phosphorylated in vivo. The sequences surrounding Tyr-891 and Tyr-920 match the reported consensus binding sequences for the SH2 domains of Src and the regulatory domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85α), respectively. In vitro, both of these proteins were found to bind to Src-phosphorylated EGF-R with ∼100-fold greater affinity than to autophosphorylated EGF-R, demonstrating that Src creates new sites for SH2 binding. Furthermore, Csk-inactivated Src was activated by interaction with Src-phosphorylated EGF-R but not by autophosphorylated EGF-R. Upon EGF treatment of MCF7 or three colorectal carcinoma cell lines (WiDr, DLD-1, and LS174T), the EGF-R coimmunoprecipitated with both p85α and Src. Evidence is also presented that suggests that an EGF-R-related protein, ErbB2, may be involved in similar Src-mediated interactions. These data demonstrate that EGF-R is phosphorylated in vivo at non-autophosphorylation sites and that these novel sites can act as docking sites for Src, P85α, and potentially other SH2-containing proteins. In addition, the data suggest a tyrosine phosphatase-independent mechanism for the elevation of Src activity in cells exposed to growth factors. Overexpression of Src, EGF-R, and/or ErbB2 in breast and colorectal tumor cells suggests the potential that such interactions may contribute to the transformed phenotype of these carcinomas.

INTRODUCTIONThe cellular events that result from extracellular signaling by growth factors are initiated primarily by members of the transmembrane protein-tyrosine kinase family (for review, see Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). Typically, these receptor kinases dimerize upon binding ligand, which results in enzyme activation and the subsequent inter- and/or intra-molecular autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. These receptor autophosphorylation sites act as docking sites for a wide range of regulatory molecules, each of which contain at least one Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that mediates interaction with the receptor (for reviews, see Koch et al., 1991Koch A.A.

They have found that the SH2 domains can generally be placed into families of related binding specificities, with the three residues on the carboxy side of the phosphotyrosine having the greatest influence on affinity. However, binding of SH2-containing proteins to whole proteins appears to be less predictable than the interactions between isolated SH2 domains and simple peptides (Soler et al., 1994Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Other proteins have been reported to bind to the EGF-R, but the site or sites of binding have not been identified. Recently, the prototype SH2-containing protein, pp60c-src (Src) was reported to associate with the EGF-R (also known as ErbB1) and a related protein, ErbB2, in a breast tumor cell line (Luttrell et al., 1994Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M. Rodriguez M. Berman J. Gilmer T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This correlates with evidence that overexpression of Src enhances the mitogenic response of cells to EGF (Chang et al., 1993Chang J.H. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Zhang K. Parson S.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 959-967PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the autophosphorylation sites in the EGF-R are similar to the reported consensus binding sequence for Src-SH2 (pTyr-acidic-acidic-hydrophobic) (Songyang et al., 1993Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

There would seem to be three possible explanations for these findings: 1) these observed bindings are artifacts and are not physiologically important, 2) consensus sequences based on peptides are not reliable predictors of protein binding or, 3) there may be other tyrosine residues within the EGF-R that are phosphorylated and can bind SH2-containing proteins.While we do not discount the possibility that the first two explanations may be valid for some of the confusion in the literature, in this report we show evidence that Src can phosphorylate the EGF-R on novel sites in vitro, that Src and P85α preferentially associate with the EGF-R after it has been phosphorylated by Src, that these Src-phosphorylated sites (including consensus binding sites for Src and P85α) are phosphorylated in cells in response to EGF, that P85α and Src bind to the EGF-R in these cells in an EGF-dependent manner, and that Csk-inactivated Src is reactivated upon binding to the Src phosphorylated EGF-R. In addition, ErbB2, a closely related receptor kinase, is also phosphorylated by Src in vitro. The P85α and Src consensus binding sites found in the EGF-R are highly conserved in ErbB2, suggesting similar SH2 interactions may exist with the EGF-R growth factor receptor family. This evidence suggests the possible involvement of these interactions in breast and colorectal carcinomas.DISCUSSIONThe EGF receptor and ErbB2 have each been demonstrated to autophosphorylate multiple sites in vitro (Fig. 8). Kinase inactive mutants fail to phosphorylate these sites in response to ligand stimulation, suggesting that autophosphorylation also takes place in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, is capable of phosphorylating each of these receptors to a high level. In vitro, Src phosphorylates all of the EGF-R autophosphorylation sites plus an additional five tyrosine residues. Two of these additional sites (Tyr-891 and Tyr-920) were observed to be phosphorylated in a colorectal carcinoma cell line (DLD-1) and in a breast tumor cell line (MCF-7). In cells that overexpress EGF-R (i.e. A431) autophosphorylation may predominate, thus explaining why these additional sites have been missed in the few previous studies that have mapped in vivo phosphotyrosine sites. Although EGF-R is overexpressed in several of the carcinoma cell lines used in this study, Src is also highly expressed (Masanori et al., 1990Masanori I. Yoshida K. Kyo E. Ayhan A. Nakayama H. Yasui W. Ito H. Tahara E. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1990; 59: 173-178Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The correlation of the overexpression of Src with phosphorylation of these non-autophosphorylated sites indicates that Src may be the endogenous kinase responsible for this phosphorylation. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that phosphorylation of these new sites is only observed under conditions where Src is found to associate with the EGF-R.Wasilenko et al., 1991Wasilenko W.J. Payne D.M. Fitzgerald D.L. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar have demonstrated that in cells transformed by pp60v-src, the EGF-R is constitutively phosphorylated at nonautophosphorylation sites. Furthermore, phospholipase C-γ is also constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in these cells. Because phospholipase C-γ is an in vivo substrate of the EGF-R kinase, the authors concluded that the basal activity of EGF-R had been activated by pp60v-src phosphorylation. However, in our hands, phosphorylation of EGF-R by Src has no effect on EGF-R activity in vitro (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that the constitutive phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ in Src-transformed cells may be due to phosphorylation by Src itself, or phospholipase C-γ may be capable of binding to one of the sites of phosphorylation by Src; thus, it becomes a substrate for EGF-R in the absence of dimerization and autophosphorylation. Phospholipase C-γ has been shown to specifically bind to pTyr-992, a minor autophosphorylated site. In our hands, this site was a very minor site, barely visible above background on an overexposed film (not shown). However, after Src phosphorylation, this site was as highly phosphorylated as the major sites of autophosphorylation, correlating with our observations of EGF-R phosphorylation in vivo following EGF stimulation. These data suggest that phospholipase C-γ may actually bing to a predominantly non-autophosphorylated site. Whether this site is actually phosphorylated by Src or another kinase in vivo is still not certain.Both Src and P85α have been found to bind to the EGF-R in previous reports, and our results add further evidence that this is indeed the case in the cell types examined in this study. However, none of the autophosphorylation sites of EGF-R fit the consensus binding sites for either Src or the P85α SH2 domains, and we observe only weak binding of these proteins to the autophosphorylated EGF-R. It would appear likely that it is more than an artifactual coincidence that, of the three non-autophosphorylated sites observed to be phosphorylated in cells, one is a text book example of a P85α binding site while another matches the binding requirements of Src-SH2 quite well. Furthermore, the sequences surrounding these two sites are far more conserved between EGF-R and ErbB2 than are any of the major autophosphorylation sites. Taken together, these observations make a strong argument for a physiological role for Src phosphorylation of these tyrosine residues.It has recently been reported that the a carboxyl-terminal truncated EGF-R (that has its carboxyl-terminal tail including all known autophosphorylation sites removed) can still mediate EGF-induced proliferation and growth. However, when each of the individual autophosphorylation sites are mutated to phenylalanine, the EGF-R is unable to transduce a proliferative signal. Since truncation is a drastic alteration, it was surprising that it could retain more of its functionality. Our studies may suggest an explanation for this observation. Perhaps the three tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Src in the carboxyl terminus of the kinase domain are sufficient to mediate these effects of EGF. However, Src may not be able to phosphorylate these sites before the EGF-R tail has been autophosphorylated (i.e. the tail may fold over and block these sites, a suggestion for which there is some evidence (Gill et al., 1988Gill G.N. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Glenney J.R. Wiley H.S. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Therefore, if the autophosphorylation sites are mutated, the tail cannot be phosphorylated; so, the remaining sites are blocked from being phosphorylated. On the other hand, truncation would completely remove the tail, leaving these sites open for phosphorylation by Src, and signaling from SH2 proteins that interact with these sites could still occur.Coker et al., 1994Coker K.J. Staros J.V. Guyer C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6967-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar have recently reported that a kinase negative mutant of EGF-R retained the capacity to stimulate DNA synthesis upon EGF stimulation. This inactive kinase was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to EGF by what the authors described as an associated tyrosine kinase. Thus, there is ample evidence that additional tyrosine kinases assist in mediating the response to growth factors such as EGF.EGF signaling has been demonstrated to be enhanced by overexpression of Src and may cause the activation of Src (Luttrell et al., 1988Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our findings that Src creates additional SH2 docking sites on EGF-R and that one or more of these is a docking site for Src suggests an explanation of how these effects may occur. Activation of Src has been measured directly in EGF-stimulated cells, but it has also been observed that certain physiological Src substrates become phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation. The role of Src in EGF signaling is probably not limited to the creation of additional SH2 docking sites on the receptor and is probably involved in the phosphorylation of downstream regulatory molecules. It is also possible that some of the proteins that have been thought to be substrates of EGF-R may actually be phosphorylated by Src bound to the EGF-R. Src has been demonstrated to associate with EGF-R, ErbB2, PDGF-R, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, c-Kit, and the fibroblast growth factor receptor (Mohammadi et al., 1991Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol.

Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions support the hypothesis that Src is directly involved with many growth factor signaling pathways. Furthermore, mice with homozygous deletions of the src gene die within the first few weeks after birth (Soriano et al., 1991Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, they do not have detectable abnormalities in the brain or platelets (tissues rich in Src). However, they are deficient in bone remodeling. Although Src is necessary for survival after the first few weeks of life, it is not essential for cell viability, suggesting that its function is nonessential or that redundant pathways exist that would ensure cell viability even in the absence of Src.As just implied, EGF is not the only growth factor that seems to involve Src in its signaling. PDGF stimulation of cells results in activation and phosphorylation of Src, and the PDGF-R directly associates with Src via a PDGF-R autophosphorylated site. ErbB2 has been reported to associate with Src in mammary tumor cells (Luttrell et al., 1994Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M. Rodriguez M. Berman J. Gilmer T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We now report that the EGF-R and ErbB2 are also phosphorylated by Src on non-autophosphorylation sites, and it is these additional sites that are required for Src binding. Therefore, Src may be an intrinsic part of many growth factor signaling pathways. This view is consistent with the ubiquitous expression of Src in all cell types.While we present strong evidence that these mechanisms occur in at least some tumor cell lines, it is unclear whether they contribute in any way to tumorigenesis or if they are involved in EGF signal transduction in non-transformed cells. Future studies, with EGF-R mutants lacking the sites phosphorylated by Src, should help to elucidate the role of these sites in EGF signaling. INTRODUCTIONThe cellular events that result from extracellular signaling by growth factors are initiated primarily by members of the transmembrane protein-tyrosine kinase family (for review, see Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). Typically, these receptor kinases dimerize upon binding ligand, which results in enzyme activation and the subsequent inter- and/or intra-molecular autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. These receptor autophosphorylation sites act as docking sites for a wide range of regulatory molecules, each of which contain at least one Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that mediates interaction with the receptor (for reviews, see Koch et al., 1991Koch A.A.

In this study, squelching experiments revealed that both TADs of p65, as well as the related subunit c-Rel, compete for the same cofactor(s) mediating transactivation. Both TADs of p65 share a common sequence motif, which is evolutionarily conserved and displays a remarkable degree of spatial organization when aligned on an α-helical surface. The functional importance of the common sequence motif was confirmed by deletion analysis of TA2. Within the conserved sequence motif, a 7-amino-acid repeat was noted. Idealized heptad repeats fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 were transcriptionally active, but only as multimers. Phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of a defined region within the TA2 domain was found to be stimulated by phorbol ester treatment of cells. In contrast, TA1 was constitutively phosphorylated, and its activity did not significantly respond to phorbol ester stimulation. The stimulatory effect of phorbol ester on transcription of the TA2 domain was completely blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor. These data suggest that protein kinase C has a dual effect on NF-κB activity.

A variety of human cell lines express both the α and β isoforms which have molecular masses of 170 and 180 kDa, respectively(17Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2901-2908PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-species Southern blot analysis suggests that neither yeast nor Drosophila possess a β type topoisomerase but that topoisomerase IIβ is found in avian and mammalian species(16Tan K.B. Dorman T.E. Falls K.M. Chung T.D. Mirabelli C.K. Crooke S.T. Mao J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar). The two isoforms are differentially expressed during the cell cycle. Topoisomerase IIα levels rise in late S, peak in G2M, and decrease as cells complete mitosis, while β is present at a relatively constant level throughout the cell cycle(17Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar). They have different tissue distributions shown by studies of expression of murine topoisomerase II. Whereas α is associated with tissues containing proliferating cells, β is found in a wider range of tissue types (19Capranico G. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Fisher M.L. Zunino F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, topoisomerase IIα and β appear to be differentially localized in the nucleus, with topoisomerase IIβ reported to be nucleolar(20Zini N. Martelli A.M. Sabatelli P. Santi S. Negri C.

Why higher eukaryotes possess two distinct isoforms of the type II enzyme while other organisms survive with one is not clear, and isoform-specific catalytic activities and cellular functions remain to be clarified, particularly for the more recently isolated topoisomerase IIβ. Progress in this area has been hindered by the small amounts of homogeneous type II enzyme that can be purified from human cells(22Liu L.F. Miller K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3487-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), particularly for the recently characterized β isoform(10Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). One approach in circumventing this problem is to overexpress the enzymes in yeast using the available α and β cDNA clones. Overexpression of human topoisomerase IIα has been reported by us previously(23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe for the first time a system for the overexpression of human topoisomerase IIβ. We have characterized the structure and activity of this isoenzyme in vitro and compared its structural and enzymatic properties to those of human topoisomerase IIα. Amsacrine (m-AMSA) and its ortho analogue (o-AMSA) were obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute. Teniposide and etoposide were kindly provided by Bristol-Myers Co. Sources of quercetin, quercetagetin, and myricetin have been described previously(24Austin C.A. Patel S. Ono K. Nakane H.

Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or ethanol at 1 mg/ml, stored at −20°C, and diluted in Me2SO or ethanol immediately before use. All other reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers. Plasmids pBS-CAA5-19 and SP11 containing partial cDNAs for human topoisomerase IIβ have been reported previously(12Chung T.D.Y. Drake F.H.

YEpWob6 is a yeast Escherichia coli shuttle vector containing the human TOP2α cDNA under the control of the yeast GAL1 promoter(23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). YEpTOP2-PGAL1, a YEp24 derivative for the expression of the yeast TOP2 gene, has been described previously(25Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). YEphTOP2β was constructed using the above plasmids. The 0.9-kb SalI to AgeI fragment containing the first five codons of the yeast TOP2 gene downstream of the GALI promoter was isolated from YEpTOP2 and fused to the 46th codon of human TOP2β at the AgeI site through the use of a polymerase chain reaction generated fragment of human TOP2β. This was spliced to the remaining 4.6 kb of TOP2β cDNA assembled from several partial cDNA clones(13Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The resulting GALI promoter-TOP2β cDNA fragment was then inserted into a 6.8-kb XhoI to SalI segment derived from YEpWOB6, which contains the URA3 marker gene, the yeast 2-μm plasmid replication origin, and the β-lactamase gene and replication origin of E. coli pBR322. Six liters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JEL1 (α leu 2 trp1 ura3-52 prb1-1122 pep4-3 Δhis3::PGAL 10 - GAL4) containing plasmid YEphTOP2β were grown in glucose-free medium to an optical density of 0.4-1.0 at 600 nm, measured in a Cecil CE595 spectrophotometer. Expression of recombinant human topoisomerase IIβ protein was induced from the plasmid-borne hTOP2β gene by addition of galactose to the growth medium (2% final concentration). Induction times of 3-16 h were used. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and each gram of cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer I (containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.7, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The cell suspension was either flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −70°C, or cells were lysed immediately for enzyme purification. Topoisomerase IIβ was purified by the method of Worland and Wang (25Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described previously for human DNA topoisomerase IIα(23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae DNA topoisomerase II was isolated by the method of Worland and Wang(25Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by the ATP-dependent relaxation of supercoiled plasmid pBR322. Standard relaxation buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 300 μg/ml of BSA and 0.4 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA. One unit is the amount of enzyme required to relax 50% of the DNA in 30 min at 37°C in standard relaxation buffer. Alternatively, topoisomerase II activity was assessed by decatenation of kinetoplast DNA as described previously (24). One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that decatenates 0.5 μg of kDNA under standard conditions. Relaxation or decatenation reactions were stopped by addition of a gel electrophoresis loading buffer containing 25% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 0.25 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels in TBE buffer containing (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, and 2.5 mM EDTA). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV transillumination using Polaroid type 665 film. Enzyme activities were estimated by inspection of band intensities on the photographic negatives. Proteins were electrophoretically separated on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were visualized with Coomassie Blue or detected immunologically. For immunological detection, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes either using a Bio-Rad wet blotter or an Atto semi-dry blotter, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Antibody probing of membrane blots was carried out as follows. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) for 30 min, then incubated for 2 h at 37°C with a topoisomerase IIβ-specific antiserum, in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS) plus 0.1% SDS. The membrane was washed twice in TTBS and once in TBS, then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat (anti-rabbit) antisera in TBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed as above prior to color generation, and then incubated in AP buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) containing 330 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 160 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Color development was stopped by addition of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mM EDTA. Blots were also probed with antisera raised against the C-terminal quarter of topoisomerase IIβ. Incubations were carried out in 3% BSA at 30°C for 2 h, and the blot was then washed and developed as described above. Human topoisomerase IIβ was dialyzed into 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20% glycerol in the presence of 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors benzamidine (1 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml). Dialysis was carried out at 4°C for 1 h, and final protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford(26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase was then digested with 20% (w/w) or 5% (w/w) Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or bovine pancreatic trypsin at 30°C for various lengths of time. SV8 digestion was also carried out in acetate buffer containing 50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.35, 165 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. Reactions were quenched by addition of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and boiling for 2 min. Aliquots were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Trypsin and SV8 digestions were also carried out in the presence of 1 mM ATP, 1 mM AMP-PNP, or 67 μg/ml pUC19 DNA. Proteins were digested and run on polyacrylamide gels as described above prior to electroblotting on to Pall, Problott, or Hyperbond membrane according to the manufacturers' instructions. Membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the desired bands were excised. N-terminal sequencing of the protein fragments was carried out on a Beckmann peptide sequencer, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cleavage reaction mixtures contained 0.4 μg of supercoiled pBR322 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 30 μg/ml BSA, and 1 unit of human topoisomerase IIα or IIβ in the presence or absence of m-AMSA, o-AMSA, teniposi de, or etoposide. Reactions were carried out in the absence of ATP for 30 min at 37°C, stopped with 1% SDS followed by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose in TBE buffer. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV transillumination. Supercoiled plasmid pBR322 DNA was prepared, linearized, and end-labeled as described previously(24Austin C.A. Patel S. Ono K. Nakane H. Fisher L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, pBR322 was cut with EcoRI, incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and radiolabeled at its 5′ ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. After HindIII digestion, the 4333-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment was separated and purified by electrophoresis in a 1% low melting agarose gel. Cleavage reaction mixtures contained 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) Me2SO, 30 μg/ml BSA, 10 units of human topoisomerase IIα or β, a 4333-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pBR322 DNA end-labeled at the EcoRI end, and m-AMSA, ellipticine, teniposide, etoposide, or flavonoid compound at 0.25-1.5 μg/ml (total volume 20 μl). Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then treated with 1 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS and 1 μl of 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 50°C for 30 min. DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose in TBE buffer. Gels were blotted overnight on to DE81 paper before autoradiography. End-labeled pBR322 was prepared by cutting with HindIII, labeling with [α32P]dCTP an d Klenow polymerase, and then cutting with EcoRI before gel purification of the 4333-bp fragment. Cleavage was carried out by incubating 4 pmol of topoisomerase II with 5500 counts/min of labeled DNA (as measured by Cherenkov counting) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 30 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mM ATP (final volume 20 μl). Where present, Me2SO was at 2.5%, and m-AMSA or o-AMSA at 5 or 50 μg/ml. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, then SDS and proteinase K were added to 1% (w/v) and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. After incubation for a further 60 min, DNA was precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen. After centrifugation the pellet was washed in 90% ethanol and then resuspended in 4 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated to 80°C before being loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel which was then run at 1100 V. We have for the first time successfully overexpressed human topoisomerase IIβ in milligram quantities in a yeast expression system. We designed a construct, YEphTOP2β (Fig. 1), to express human topoisomerase IIβ in S. cerevisiae, encoding residues 46-1621 fused to sequence encoding the first 5 amino acid residues of yeast topoisomerase II. Sequence alignments of human topoisomerase IIβ protein sequence with those of other eukaryotic type II enzymes indicated that the N-terminal 41 residues are poorly conserved and thus unlikely to be essential for catalysis(14Austin C.A. Sng J.H. Patel S. Fisher L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In YEphTOP2β the coding region is under the control of the galactose-inducible yeast GAL1 gene promoter, similar to YEpWOB6 which was used in the overexpression of human DNA topoisomerase IIα(23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). YEphTOP2β was transformed into a protease-deficient and ura3 yeast strain JEL1 and grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing 3% (v/v) glycerol and 2% (w/v) lactic acid. Induction of the human enzyme was achieved by the addition of galactose to the growth medium, to a final concentration of 2% and growth was continued for 3-16 h. Purification of the recombinant human topoisomerase IIβ was carried out as described previously for human topoisomerase IIα(23Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the procedure involved cell lysis, polymin P, and ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by phosphocellulose column chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis identified a Coomassie-stained band of approximately 175 kDa in extracts of galactose-induced JEL1 containing YEphTOP2β (Fig. 2A, lane c) which was absent from extracts of uninduced cells (lane b). This size is consistent for a 1621 amino acid protein missing the first 45 amino acids. Topoisomerase IIβ purified to the phosphocellulose stage was >90% homogeneous and migrated with a lower mobility than recombinant topoisomerase IIα (Fig. 2A, lanes d and e), as expected from their predicted molecular masses. Immunoblot analysis with a topoisomerase IIβ-specific antisera positively identified the topoisomerase IIβ as a 175 kDa band in both the crude lysate and the phosphocellulose fraction (Fig. 2B, lanes c and d). Yields of between 300 and 700 μg/liter were obtained following purification, allowing production of milligram quantities of recombinant human topoisomerase IIβ. Recombinant topoisomerase IIβ was enzymatically active as assayed by its relaxation of supercoiled pBR322 in the presence of ATP. The specific activity of the purified β protein ranged between 3 × 104 and 1 × 105 units/mg, similar to that reported for the native human topoisomerase IIα and Drosophila topoisomerase II(22Liu L.F. Miller K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3487-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 28Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relaxation of supercoiled pBR322 was dependent on Mg(II) and ATP. Concentrations of 6-30 mM MgCl2 and 10-190 mM KCl were shown to support relaxation. These cation ranges are in agreement with those reported for human topoisomerase IIβ purified from cell lines(10Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Earlier enzymatic studies suggested that topoisomerase IIβ was unstable and became fragmented if boiled prior to SDS-PAGE analysis (18). Stability of purified recombinant human DNA topoisomerase IIβ was assessed by incubation for 2 min at 50, 68, 80, and 100°C in SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to gel electrophoresis. No differences were seen between α and β treated in this way, and neither exhibited substantial protein degradation (data not shown). Topoisomerase II α and β activities as measured by the DNA relaxation assay were stable for at least 24 h at 4 and 25°C. At 37°C, activity began to decrease after an 8-h incubation. Topoisomerase IIβ is thus not as unstable as reported for the native enzyme from human cells(10Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 18Woessner R.D. Chung T.D. Hofmann G.A. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Drake F.H. Johnson R.K. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2901-2908PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the instability problem in the earlier work may have been due to the presence of a contaminating protease. However, we cannot formally eliminate the possibility that our recombinant protein is more stable due to the presence of the first five amino acids from yeast topoisomerase II or due to the lack of the first 45 amino acids of the human topoisomerase IIβ. Previous proteolysis studies on E. coli DNA gyrase and yeast topoisomerase II have suggested that type II topoisomerases are folded into discrete domains(29Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6093-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The hinge regions between these domains are more accessible and therefore less resistant to proteolytic cleavage. S. cerevisiae topoisomerase II is preferentially cleaved in three discrete protease sensitive regions, A-C. Sites A and B for S. aureus V8 protease have been mapped to the C-terminal side of residues 411 and 680, respectively, while site C is around amino acid 1200. The precise cleavage site depends on the specificity of the protease. To characterize the domain structure of topoisomerase IIβ, we carried out proteolytic digests with trypsin and S. aureus V8 protease. To identify the resulting fragments, immunoblots were probed with two antisera: one specific for a 13-residue peptide, amino acid residues 928-940 in topoisomerase IIβ (10) (Fig. 4), and an antibody raised against the C-terminal quarter of topoisomerase IIβ. The exact sites of proteolytic cleavage were determined by N-terminal sequence analysis of the most prominent digestion products, (Table I).Table I:N-terminal sequence analysis of domain boundaries Open table in a new tab A time course for digestion of human topoisomerase IIβ by trypsin is shown in Fig. 3. The C-terminal tail of topoisomerase IIβ was most sensitive to digestion: it was cleaved at several sites to give the major digestion product of approximately 130 kDa (Fig. 3). This fragment was stable to further digestion for up to 24 h. Fragments of approximately 90 and 50 kDa became visible as the period of digestion was increased. The 90 kDa band was visualized by Western blotting and probing with the anti-peptide antibody, which indicated that it spans the centre of the protein (Fig. 4). N-terminal sequencing showed that the 50-kDa fragment starts at Val49, which is 8 amino acid residues from the N terminus of the recombinant protein; this fragment therefore corresponds to the ATPase domain identified in E. coli DNA gyrase. The anti-peptide antibody also detected an approximately 62-kDa digestion product which was formed later than the other fragments and was stained less intensely by Coomassie Blue, consistent with this fragment being less abundant. N-terminal sequencing of this fragment showed that cleavage had occurred C-terminal to Phe722. Fragments of a similar size to those produced with trypsin were observed with SV8 protease and their N-terminal sequences determined and listed in Table I. From the order of appearance and the intensities of the various products, it was deduced that the preferred order of cleavage in human type II topoisomerase IIβ is region C, then region A, and lastly region B (Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Table I). To investigate the degree of similarity in the domain structure of human topoisomerase IIα and β, digests with SV8 protease and trypsin were carried out on the α isoform in the same manner as described above (Fig. 5). The patterns of fragments produced were very similar for both isoforms. Moreover, N-terminal sequencing confirmed that cleavage occurs at very similar sites in the two proteins (Table I). From the SV8 digests of the α isoform, it was also possible to identify two small fragments of 23 and 17 kDa: these start at Lys1264 and Ile1405, respectively, and are derived from the C-terminal segment"

Recombination frequency synergistically increased by the combination of overexpression of RAD52 and ionizing radiation. These observations suggest that homologous recombination mediated by RAD52 is involved in double-stranded break repair in mammalian cells. Repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs)1( 1The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble strand breakPCRpolymerase chain reaction. ) is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity and cell survival. DSBs in intracellular DNA are generated by various chemical and physical agents, including ionizing radiation. Resnick (1Resnick M.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1975; 59: 97-106Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar) proposed that DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination with an intact homolog. In his model, free DNA ends locate an intact homologous sequence and use it as template for the repair of the strand break through DNA repair synthesis and ligation. This was further amplified to a model for recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(2Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). More recent observations obtained with yeast and Escherichia coli strongly emphasize a major role of homologous recombination in DSB repair(3Krasin F. Hutchinson F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 5Wu T.-C.

Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). It has frequently been argued that the primary biological role of recombination is the repair of DNA damage rather than the formation of recombinant genotypes through the exchange of genetic markers(8Kobayashi I. Adv. Biophys. 1992; 28: 81-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Bernstein H. Byerly H.C. Hopf F.A. Michod R.E. Science. 1985; 229: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is supported by the demonstration that ionizing radiation increases the number of unrepaired DNA DSBs in radiation-sensitive mutants that are also deficient in recombination functions(10Resnick M.A. Martin P. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1976; 143: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 11Budd M. Mortimer R.K. Mutat. Res. 1982; 103: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). double strand break polymerase chain reaction. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, a group of DSB repair genes has been identified as members of the RAD52 epistasis group(12Friedberg E.C. Siede W. Cooper A.J. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1991: 147-192Google Scholar, 13Game J. Spencer J.F.T. Spencer D. Smith A.R.W. Yeast Genetics: Fundamental and Applied Aspects. Springer-Verlag, New York1983: 105-137Google Scholar). These genes (including RAD50-57, MRE11, and XRS2) have been identified based upon their sensitivity to ionizing radiation or deficiencies in recombination(14Ajimura M. Leem S.H. Ogawa H. Genetics. 1992; 133: 51-66Crossref Google Scholar, 15Ivanov E.L. Korolev V.G. Fabre F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 651-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1991: 407-521Google Scholar). Although these mutants exhibit similarity in general phenotypes, they display differences in their response to ionizing radiation and show deficiency in different steps in recombination. Among these mutants, RAD51, RAD52, and RAD54 have the most severe and pleiotropic defects and suggest that the genes responsible for these mutant phenotypes play fundamental roles in recombination and DSB repair(13Game J. Spencer J.F.T. Spencer D. Smith A.R.W. Yeast Genetics: Fundamental and Applied Aspects. Springer-Verlag, New York1983: 105-137Google Scholar). Most of the information regarding the functions of the RAD52 protein has come from studies in yeast. These studies suggested that the RAD52 protein is not required for the initiation of recombination, but is essential for an intermediate stage following the formation of DSBs but before the appearance of stable recombinants(17Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). More recent evidence demonstrating physical interactions between RAD52 and RAD51 suggests that one of the functions of RAD52 is to modulate recombination and/or DSB repair by interacting directly with other factors(17Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 18Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, yeast RAD51 was shown to catalyze homologous pairing and strand exchange in an ATP and Mg2+-dependent manner(19Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This data suggests that the mammalian counterparts of RAD51 are likely to catalyze ATP-dependent pairing and strand exchange and have an essential role in genetic recombination. It is also possible that mammalian RAD52 may function to modulate the catalytic activity of RAD51. The present study reports the cloning and characterization of a human RAD52 cDNA. By using a lacZ reporter system for intrachromosomal homologous recombination(20Ludwig D.L. Stringer J.R. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it is further demonstrated that overexpression of RAD52 in cultured monkey cells induces homologous recombination and increased resistance to γ-rays. These results indicate that RAD52 is important for DSB repair in mammalian cells through homologous recombination. The monkey cell line FSH2 was kindly provided by Dr. Dale Ludwig (Los Alamos National Laboratory)(20Ludwig D.L. Stringer J.R. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). The hybridoma line (CRL 1729) producing the anti-myc monoclonal antibody (I-9E10.2) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies were purified from culture medium by conventional methods. To clone human RAD52, two pairs of degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based upon consensus amino acid sequences of S. cerevisiae(21Adzuma K. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Schizosaccharomyces pombe(22Ostermann K. Lorentz A. Schmidt H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5940-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and chicken(23Bezzubova O.Y. Schmidt H. Osterman K. Heyer W.-D. Buerstedde J-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5945-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The first round of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed by using total phage lysate of a human spleen cDNA library (Stratagene) as a template with primers F1 (5′ AA(AG)(TC)TIGGICCIGA(AG)TA(TC) 3′) and R1 (5′ ICC(AG)TAICCIAT(AT)TC(TC)TC 3′). One μl of the first round PCR product was used for a second round PCR amplification with primers F2 (5′ GA(AG)GA(TC)ATIGGITA(TC)GG 3′) and R2 (5′ IC(GT)(TC)TTIA(AG)IGC(AG)TCIGT 3′). For amplification of RAD52, 1 μl of phage library lysate (plaque forming unit = 6 X 109/ml) or the first round PCR product was mixed with 50 pmol of each primer pair in a total reaction volume of 100 μl containing 60 mM KCl, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 at 25°C, 2.75 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dNTPs, and 2 units of Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PCR products were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequence was determined to confirm the homology with RAD52 counterparts of other species. Once the presence of RAD52 homology was confirmed, riboprobes were prepared using T3 RNA polymerase to screen the cDNA library. The cDNA was sequenced by the combination of a nested deletion and a primer walking strategy using the modified T7 polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence analysis was performed with various programs in DNASTAR (Madison, WI). A pBKCMV-hRAD52 construct encoding RAD52 protein was made by restriction digestion with BstXI and religation of the original cDNA clone. For immunological detection of RAD52 protein in monkey cells, pBKCMV-hRAD52 was further modified by introducing a synthetic linker containing an initiation codon in-frame with the c-myc epitope to the N terminus of the RAD52 protein (c-myc top strand: 5′ GCTAGCATGTGTGAACAAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTGGGTATGAC 3′, c-myc bottom strand: 5′ ACTACATACCCAAGTCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGCTTTTGTTCACACATGC 3′)(24Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FSH2 cells were seeded at a density of 106 cells/100-mm dish and grown for 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of pBKCMV-hRAD52 by using the calcium phosphate method(25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). After 2 weeks in selection medium containing G418 (600 μg/ml), individual colonies were picked and expanded for future use. Expanded individual clones were subjected to PCR to test the integrity of RAD52 construct. Those PCR-positive clones were further analyzed with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm the expression of RAD52 protein.2( 2M. S. Park, manuscript in preparation. ) Basically identical procedures described as by Ludwig and Stringer (20Ludwig D.L. Stringer J.R. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were used to determine the recombination frequency in FSH2 cells expressing RAD52. Cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes at 5 X 105 cell/dish and incubated for several days. When cultures were 90% confluent, plates were fixed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside. Areas containing cells positive for β-galactosidase were counted. The frequency of recombination was determined as the total β-galatosidase-positive area containing equal or less than four cells divided by the total number of viable cells. FSH2 cells and five independent transformants overexpressing the RAD52 protein were subjected to colony formation assay after irradiation with various doses of γ-rays. For each colony formation assay, 500 cells were plated in 60-mm dish and irradiated with a Mark I model 68A high-dose rate 137Cs source chamber irradiator at a dose rate of 6.55 gray/min. The dose of γ-rays was in the range of 0-5 gray. Two weeks after irradiation, the number of individual colonies was scored. To assess the effect of ionizing radiation on recombination events in FSH2 cells overexpressing RAD52, cell monolayers were seeded 2 h prior to irradiation at a density of 105 cells in 100-mm dishes. Monolayers were irradiated with various doses of γ-rays and incubated for 5 days. For each experiment, at least three dishes were treated with ionizing radiation, or mock-treated, for each dose. The frequencies of recombination were determined as described above. A RAD52 cDNA was isolated from a human spleen library using a PCR product amplified with degenerate primers specific to evolutionarily conserved domains in RAD52 protein. The cDNA encoded a protein of 418 amino acids (predicted Mr 46,172) (Fig. 1). The cDNA sequence is identical with the previously published human RAD52 sequences(27Muris D.F.R. Bezzubova O.

Human and chicken RAD52 are 58% identical at the amino acids level. Homology between the human and chicken RAD52 proteins increased to 72% when conserved amino acid substitutions were considered. Homology between human and both bakers' and fission yeast RAD52 was approximately 30% identity and 50% similarity in overall sequence. When the predicted amino acid sequences of mouse (29Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Bauchwitz R. Rothstein R. Genomics. 1994; 23: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and human RAD52 protein were compared, they were 72% identical and 81% similar. Amino acid sequence comparison of the human RAD52 with the mouse, chicken, and two yeasts indicated that the homology was restricted to a region of about 200 amino acids located within the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Conservation of deduced amino acid sequences of RAD52 homologs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the hypothesis that RAD52 protein provides resistance to ionizing radiation through DSB repair, five independent transformants overexpressing RAD52 were assessed for ionizing radiation sensitivity. These transformants showed the presence of both intact RAD52 inserts and the c-myc-RAD52 protein in the nucleus (data not shown). Transformants overexpressing human RAD52 exhibited enhanced resistance to ionizing radiation (Fig. 3). The resistance was ~20% higher in the dose range of 1-2 grays. The transformants were about twice as resistant to ionizing radiation 5-gray exposure compared with control groups. Following the observation that overexpressed RAD52 conferred increased ionizing radiation resistance in FSH2 cells, I tested the hypothesis that this enhanced radiation resistance reflected elevated levels of homologous recombination. FSH2 cells contain an integrated lacZ recombination substrate targeted to a specific chromosome locus(20Ludwig D.L. Stringer J.R. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this cell line (FSH), homologous recombination between lacZ gene segments allows the production of β-galactosidase, which can be detected histochemically in situ. The frequency of spontaneous homologous recombination increased a minimum of 3-fold in FSH2 cells that were transfected with pBKCMV-hRAD52 (Fig. 4). The recombination frequency of the mock-transfected FSH2 cells with PBKCMV vector alone was not significantly different from that of FSH2 cells. Interestingly, ionizing radiation alone also increased recombination frequencies in FSH2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). I then determined if the overexpression of human RAD52 could affect and increase in homologous recombination following DNA damage from ionizing radiation. When Rad52.2 cells were irradiated with γ-rays, the recombination frequency increased synergistically (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Synergistic induction of intrachromosomal homologous recombination by a combination of ionizing radiation and overexpression of human RAD52 in monkey cells.

This suggested that the N terminus of the RAD52 protein has functional significance such as mediating self-association as was previously demonstrated(18Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This notion was further supported by the phenotypes of various yeast mutants which carry mutations in N terminus of the protein. The rad52-1 or rad52-2 mutation, containing missense point mutations in codons 90 or 64, respectively(21Adzuma K. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Boundy-Mills K.L. Livingston D.M. Genetics. 1993; 133: 39-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exhibit a phenotype indistinguishable from null mutant phenotypes. To the contrary, the C terminus of RAD52 may have some other unknown functional significance specific to each species(31Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There has been no previous report describing the involvement of mammalian RAD52 in DSB repair through homologous recombination pathways. Studies with lower eukaryotic organisms have demonstrated that DNA-damaging agents, such as UV (254 nm) and ionizing radiation, as well as alkylating agents, could induce mitotic and meiotic allelic recombination. The frequency of recombination is depend on the DNA repair capacity of the cells(32Kunz B.A. Haynes R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1981; 15: 57-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Less is known, however, about the ability of such agents to induce homologous recombination in mammalian cells. Despite the expectation that ionizing radiation influences homologous recombination, because it induces mitotic recombination in yeasts (32Kunz B.A. Haynes R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1981; 15: 57-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and causes sister chromatid exchanges in mammalian cells (33Latt S.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1981; 15: 11-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), there have been no previous reports demonstrating the induction of homologous recombination by ionizing radiation in mammalian cells. In this report I observed a significant increase in induced recombination frequencies in FSH2 cells following exposure to ionizing radiation. In an earlier study utilizing mouse L cells, Wang et al.(34Wang Y. Maher V.M. Liskay R.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) observed no effect of γ-rays on intrachromosomal recombination between TK alleles. The induction in homologous recombination I observed in monkey cells may reflect differences in the cell system utilized. One of the possible explanations for the discrepancies can be differences in species, in this case between mouse and monkey cells. Furthermore, CV-1 cells represent immortalized but not transformed cell types, unlikely the fully transformed state of mouse L-cells(26Hay R. Caputo J. Chen T.R. Macy M. McClintock P. Reid Y. American Type Culture Collection Catalog of Cell Lines and Hybridomas. 1992; Vol. 7: 1 40-2 41Google Scholar). Additionally, the stability of the genomes in these two cell lines is different. CV-1 cells exhibit a relatively stable karyotype, whereas chromosomes in L cells are relatively unstable(26Hay R. Caputo J. Chen T.R. Macy M. McClintock P. Reid Y. American Type Culture Collection Catalog of Cell Lines and Hybridomas. 1992; Vol. 7: 1 40-2 41Google Scholar). These differences in genomic stability may reflect inherent differences in DNA repair. Last, the mode of analysis of intrachromosomal recombination is considerably different between the two systems. In the lacZ system, the assay is performed soon after transfection and does not require cloning of productive recombinants. The human RAD52-mediated radiation resistance in monkey cells indicates a potential role of mammalian RAD52 in DSB repair. The induced recombination frequency by RAD52 suggests the functional significance of mammalian RAD52 for intrachromosomal recombination. Homologous recombination might have been induced through dominant positive effects on catalytic components of recombination, including RAD51. The physical interactions between human RAD52 and RAD51 has been observed both in vivo and in vitro.2 It is interesting to note the synergistic effects on the induction of homologous recombination by ionizing radiation and overexpression of RAD52. These observations strongly argue for the functional importance of RAD52 in homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair in mammalian cells. Direct evidence for this can be only ascertained by addressing the same questions in a RAD52 null background. I thank Dr. D. Ludwig for providing the FSH2 cells, helpful discussions, and the critical reading of the manuscript. I also thank Dr. Richard Okinaka for irradiation of cells. I appreciate Dr. Rick Reynolds for attempting to establish a Chinese hamster ovary cell line overexpressing human RAD52."

Malonyl-CoA did not accumulate when phospholipid and fatty acid synthesis was blocked. However, the inactivation of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II with the antibiotic cerulenin triggered a large increase in the accumulation of malonyl-CoA following the cessation of phospholipid synthesis, illustrating that the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases were responsible for the degradation of malonyl-CoA in the presence of long chain acyl-ACP. The acyl-ACP requirement for malonyl-CoA degradation activity was confirmed by shifting enoyl-ACP reductase mutants (fabI(Ts)) to the non-permissive temperature, leading to the abrupt cessation of fatty acid synthesis and the accumulation of malonyl-CoA in the absence of cerulenin. Analysis of the ACP pool composition before and after the temperature shift showed that the fabI block did not result in the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP. These data indicate a feedback regulatory loop that functions to recycle malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA following the down-regulation of fatty acid and phospholipid formation and provides a physiological rationale for the acyl-ACP-dependent, malonyl-ACP decarboxylase reaction catalyzed by β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II.

Fatty acid biosynthesis in dissociated (type II) fatty acid synthase systems typified by Escherichia coli is carried out by the shuttling of intermediates attached to ACP1( 1The abbreviations used are: ACPacyl carrier proteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. )between a collection of enzymes that each catalyze a single step in the pathway (for review, see Ref. 1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions involved in the cycles of chain elongation and the first steps in phospholipid synthesis are outlined in Fig. 1. The cofactors and substrates are known, the proteins have been purified, and their respective genes have been identified, cloned, and sequenced (Fig. 1). However, much less is understood about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of the pathway and coordinate the rate of fatty acid bioysnthesis with phospholipid production, macromolecular synthesis, and cell growth. acyl carrier protein high pressure liquid chromatography isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases are recognized as key regulators of several aspects of fatty acid biosynthesis (for review, see Ref. 1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the condensation of malonyl-ACP with acyl-ACP to form the corresponding β-ketoacyl-ACPs. Synthase III is encoded by the fabH gene and catalyzes the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis from malonyl-ACP and acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-ACP (2Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The FabH enzyme is distinct in that it specifically utilizes acetyl-CoA rather than ACP thioesters. Mutants (fabH) have been isolated that have minimal FabH specific activity in vitro, but the mutant strains retain significant FabH activity in vivo(3Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FabH overexpression leads to a decrease in the average chain length of membrane fatty acids consistent with its role in initiation(4Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether FabH is essential for initiation of fatty acid synthesis. Synthase II (encoded by the fabF gene) is required for the elongation of palmitoleoyl-ACP to cis-vaccenoyl-ACP and is responsible for the temperature regulation of membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition(5Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3263-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Mutants (fabF) lacking synthase II activity do not have a growth phenotype, illustrating that FabF function is not essential(9de Mendoza D. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 49-52Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Gelman E.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 381-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthase I is encoded by the fabB gene and catalyzes an essential step in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis(11D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5289-5294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, mutants (fabB) devoid of FabB activity require supplementation with exogenous unsaturated fatty acids for growth(12Rosenfeld I.S. D'Agnolo G. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2452-2460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these data provide compelling evidence that the condensing enzymes play an important role in specifying the composition of the products of fatty acid biosynthesis, it is not known whether they also have a role in regulating the total rate of fatty acid formation. All three condensing enzymes have been purified and their biochemical properties extensively characterized. In addition to their condensing enzyme activity, the synthases catalyze several additional reactions diagramed in Fig. 2. The physiological significance of these alternative reaction pathways is unknown, but understanding the condensing mechanism is important since the results in this paper point to a role for these reactions in regulating malonyl-CoA levels. All three condensing enzymes catalyze acyl-CoA:ACP transacylation. FabB and FabF catalyze the transacylation of all acyl-CoA thioesters with ACP, with the notable exception of acetyl-CoA(13Alberts A.W. Bell R.M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3190-3198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, FabH exhibits acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activity(4Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transacylation is the first step in the condensation reaction and results in the formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate bound to the active site cysteine, which exchanges with either ACP or CoA (Fig. 2, Ref. 14D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5283-5288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of acyl-enzyme formation from acyl-CoA is at least 10,000 times slower than the rate of β-ketoacyl-ACP formation from acyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP(14D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5283-5288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This large rate discrepancy is consistent with the inability of acyl-CoA derivatives to function in fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo and suggests that the transacylase activities of FabB and FabF are not physiologically significant. Although the acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activity of FabH is slower than condensation, it remains possible that this transacylation reaction may have a physiological function(4Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second reaction is malonyl-ACP decarboxylation that is measured either as the release of 14C-labeled CO2 from [1-14C]malonyl-ACP or by the incorporation of [14C]CO2 into malonyl-CoA(13Alberts A.W. Bell R.M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3190-3198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter reaction is termed the malonyl-CoA:CO2 exchange reaction and was used to detect condensing enzyme activity and to quantitate ACP (15Vagelos P.R. Alberts A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2786-2791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Majerus P.W. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 43-50Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These two reactions are explained by the formation of an enzyme-associated carbanion from malonyl-ACP, which 1) condenses with the acyl-enzyme intermediate, 2) picks up a proton to form acetyl-ACP, or 3) reacts with CO2 to reform malonyl-ACP (Fig. 2). Cerulenin is a potent antibiotic that blocks fatty acid synthesis by the irreversible inactivation of FabB and FabF (17Vance D. Goldberg I. Mitsuhashi I. Bloch K. Omura S. Nomura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18Kauppinen S. Siggard-Andersen M. von Wettstein-Knowles P. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) but not FabH (2Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7624-7629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cerulenin covalently modifies the active site of FabB and FabF (8Ulrich A.K. de Mendoza D. Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Awaya J. Omura S. Vagelos P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and, therefore, effectively blocks all of the reactions depicted in Fig. 2. Recent experiments provide compelling support for a role for long chain acyl-ACP in the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. The inhibition of phospholipid biosynthesis at the glycerol-P acyltransferase step (PlsB, Fig. 1) by the removal of glycerol-P from either plsB or gpsA mutants, or the inhibition of the acyltransferase by the accumulation of ppGpp results in the concomitant cessation of fatty acid biosynthesis and the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP intermediates(20Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positive correlation between the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and the accumulation of acyl-ACP suggested that long chain acyl-ACPs are feedback regulators of the pathway. This idea was tested in vivo by the overexpression of either of the two E. coli thioesterases (TesA or TesB) (21Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or the California bay tree thioesterase (Bte)(24Voelker T.A. Davies H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7320-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These thioesterases degrade acyl-ACP, and, therefore, these end products do not accumulate following the inhibition of acyltransferase activity, and fatty acid biosynthesis continues unabated(21Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression of either Bte (24Voelker T.A. Davies H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7320-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the truncation of TesA, resulting in the cytoplasmic localization of this periplasmic protein(23Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), causes the cells to produce and secrete copious amounts of fatty acids during normal growth and in stationary phase. The uncoupling of fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis following overexpression of these acyl-ACP thioesterases provides compelling support for a feedback regulatory loop, whereby the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACPs inhibit an early enzyme in the pathway(21Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Our goal is to identify components involved in the acyl-ACP-dependent feedback inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis by measuring the changes in levels of pathway intermediates in vivo following the accumulation of acyl-ACP and the down-regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. β-[3-3H]Alanine (specific activity, 56.5 Ci/mmol), [2-3H]acetic acid (specific activity, 4.13 Ci/mmol), [2-14C]malonyl coenzyme A (specific activity, 47.8 mCi/mmol), and En3Hance were purchased from DuPont NEN. ScintA-XF scintillation fluid was from Packard. Coenzyme A thioesters for HPLC standards were from Sigma. Acyl-ACPs were synthesized as described by Rock and Garwin (25Rock C.O. Garwin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7123-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that cells overexpressing acyl-ACP synthetase (26Jackowski S. Jackson P.D. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as the enzyme source. Acetyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP standards were prepared as described(20Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains used for these experiments are listed in Table I. Transductions were performed with phage P1virusing standard techniques(27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Cultures were routinely grown in M9 minimal medium (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose. Glycerol-P (0.04%) was added for growth of plsB strains. The β-alanine concentration was 1.5 μM for routine growth, and 0.5 μM β-[3H]alanine (specific activity, 56.5 Ci/mmol) was used in the metabolic labeling experiments(28Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were inoculated to a density of 4 x 107 cells/ml from an overnight culture in the same medium and grown to a density of 5 x 108 cells/ml in the presence of 0.5 μM β-[3H]alanine. Cell number was monitored on a Klett-Summerson colorimeter calibrated by determining the number of colony-forming units per milliliter as a function of the turbidity readings.Table I:Bacterial strains Open table in a new tab Cultures were grown to mid logarithmic phase (density of 5 x 108 cells/ml) and treated as follows. Glycerol-P was removed from plsB cultures by vacuum filtration, and the cells were washed in prewarmed M9 minimal medium and resuspended in M9 medium containing all required supplements except glycerol-P. Controls cells were resuspended in medium containing glycerol-P. Temperature-sensitive strains were grown at 30°C, and an aliquot was removed and placed in a flask warmed to 42°C when the cell density reached 5 x 108 cells/ml. Fatty acid synthesis was measured by addition of [3H]acetate (0.1 mCi/ml) to experimental and control cultures. Samples (1 ml) were then removed at intervals, and the incorporation of label was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 20% (w/v) sodium acetate. Total lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer(32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar), and the amount of [3H]acetate incorporated was quantitated by scintillation counting. Samples (0.5 ml) were removed from the cultures of panD strains that were metabolically labeled with β-[3H]alanine to uniformly label the 4′-phosphopantetheine moieties of CoA and ACP, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min at 4°C, 15,000 rpm, and frozen on dry ice. Samples for analysis of CoA pools were lysed with 1 N formic acid, and reverse phase HPLC was performed on a Vydac C18 RP column as previously described(33Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Peaks were assigned by comparing elution times with CoA, acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA standards. The identity of the malonyl-CoA peak was verified by spiking the sample with [14C]malonyl-CoA and double-label scintillation counting of the column effluent. Samples for conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis were lysed by a procedure using successive treatments with sucrose, lysozyme, EDTA, and Triton X-100(33Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J.

Aliquots were electrophoresed in 13% acrylamide gels containing the indicated concentrations of urea depending on the range of acyl-ACP chain lengths to be examined(2Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Fixed gels were soaked in En3Hance, and bands were visualized by fluorography at −80°C. Previous work reported that the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis at the PlsB step led to the accumulation of acyl-ACP and the inhibition of fatty acid production(21Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined both of these parameters in strain SJ22 (panD plsB) to determine the time course for acyl-ACP accumulation and to verify that a correlation exists between these two events in our system. The panD mutation results in the inactivation of aspartate 1-decarboxylase rendering the cells auxotrophic for β-alanine. Thus, the 4′-phosphopantetheine moieties of CoA and ACP can be specifically and uniformly labeled with β-[3H]alanine at a known specific activity in these mutants(28Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, strain SJ22 was labeled with β-[3H]alanine, the glycerol-P was removed to block phospholipid synthesis at the acyltransferase step, and the time course for the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP was determined by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). The steady-state levels of long chain acyl-ACP were low during logarithmic growth but rose rapidly following glycerol-P starvation. Acyl-ACP accumulated rapidly during the first 10 min after glycerol-P removal and increased at a slower rate up to 80 min (Fig. 3B). Since ACP was not limiting, these data point to a mechanism that attenuates fatty acid synthesis (acyl-ACP accumulation) after the cessation of phospholipid synthesis. The rate of fatty acid synthesis was measured by determining the incorporation of exogenous [14C]acetate into total lipids. Acetate incorporation into total lipids of strain SJ22 essentially ceased 10 min after removal of glycerol-P (Fig. 4A). This result may have been due to the degradation of synthesized fatty acids by the β-oxidation system, and therefore we also examined the effect of glycerol-P starvation in fadD (acyl-CoA synthetase) and fadE (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) derivatives of strain SJ22 (Fig. 4, B and C), where β-oxidation was blocked. The results were the same in both cases: acetate incorporation into total lipids essentially ceased after 10 min of glycerol-P starvation. Our experiments analyzed lipids in the medium plus the cells; therefore, synthesis and secretion of fatty acids was not an explanation for the decreased radiolabel in fatty acids. Since the fadD mutants cannot form acyl-CoA derivatives, the finding that fatty acid synthesis was inhibited in strain SJ55 (plsB fadD) (Fig. 4B) provided a strong argument against acyl-CoA thioesters as participants in the down-regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. These data confirmed that fatty acid production was inhibited following the cessation of phospholipid synthesis and verified the correlation between this inhibition and acyl-ACP accumulation. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was a likely candidate for down-regulation following the cessation of phospholipid synthesis since this enzyme system generates the malonyl-CoA intermediate required for each elongation step. We assayed the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in vivo by uniformly labeling the CoA pool with β-[3H]alanine and determining the formation of malonyl-CoA by reverse phase HPLC. The CoA pool composition of the control cells grown in the presence of glycerol-P was typical of normal E. coli strains in that acetyl-CoA was the dominant CoA species present (>90% of the total), whereas malonyl-CoA comprised less than 0.5% of the total CoA thioesters (Ref. 36Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Fig. 5A). The addition of cerulenin to inhibit the activity of the FabB and FabF condensing enzymes resulted in a sharp increase in the malonyl-CoA pool to 33% of the total with a concomitant decrease in the size of the acetyl-CoA pool (Fig. 5B). These data showed that acetyl-CoA carboxylase continued to generate malonyl-CoA when fatty acid synthesis was blocked at the condensing enzyme step. The cerulenin concentration used in these experiments (1 mg/ml) was arrived at by incubating cells with different concentrations of cerulenin for 2.5 min and measuring the increase in the malonyl-CoA pool. The effect of cerulenin on the malonyl-CoA pool was dose dependent at the lower concentrations (<0.5 mg/ml), and 1 mg/ml cerulenin was selected for the experiments because this concentration consistently gave the maximum response within 2.5 min. The removal of glycerol-P from strain SJ22 had a less noticeable effect on the CoA pool composition (Fig. 5C). Acetyl-CoA remained as the predominant thioester, although there was an increase in non-esterified CoA and an unidentified minor component that eluted in fraction 15 between CoA and malonyl-CoA in all samples. Malonyl-CoA accumulation was not detected in glycerol-P-starved cells, although phospholipid and fatty acid syntheses were blocked. However, when the cells were starved for glycerol-P for 15 min, then exposed to cerulenin for 2.5 min, the accumulation of malonyl-CoA was detected to 26% of the total pool (Fig. 5D). High levels of acyl-ACP persisted in the glycerol-P-starved cultures that were treated with cerulenin (not shown). These data showed that malonyl-CoA production continued in the absence of phospholipid synthesis but that malonyl-CoA did not accumulate unless cerulenin was added to inhibit the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II. The inhibition of phospholipid synthesis at the PlsB step by (p)ppGpp leads to the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP and the inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis(22Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if malonyl-CoA production was affected by the induction of (p)ppGpp accumulation, the CoA pool composition was measured (Fig. 6). In control cells, acetyl-CoA was the predominant species (Fig. 6A), and the induction of (p)ppGpp accumulation did not alter the distribution of label among the CoA thioesters (Fig. 6B). However, the addition of cerulenin resulted in an increase in malonyl-CoA to 40% of the total pool (Fig. 6C). These data show that malonyl-CoA production continued when phospholipid and fatty acid biosynthesis were down-regulated by the induction of (p)ppGpp but did not accumulate unless cerulenin was added to inhibit FabB and FabF. The data in Figure 5:, Figure 6: led to the working hypothesis that the condensing enzymes were responsible for the degradation of malonyl-CoA following the cessation of phospholipid synthesis. The possible role of acyl-ACP as a cofactor in this scheme was investigated by blocking fatty acid synthesis at a step prior to the formation of acyl-ACP and determining whether malonyl-CoA would accumulate in cells that contained active condensing enzymes. The fabI gene encodes an enoyl-ACP reductase activity that is essential for fatty acid synthesis(37Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Hogenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site blocked in fabI(Ts) mutants was identified in vivo by the analysis of the ACP pool composition using conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis before and after shifting the cells to the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 7). Strain SJ16 was used as a control. Growth of strain RJH13 (panD fabI(Ts)) ceased 20 min after the shift from 30 to 42°C, and the incorporation of [3H]acetate into fatty acids and phospholipids was decreased by 93% (data not shown). These data were consistent with the reported inability of fabI(Ts) mutants to synthesize fatty acids at the non-permissive temperature(37Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Hogenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ACP pool composition of strain RJH13 at 30°C was the same as the control strain SJ16 (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 5). Acetyl-ACP was a major component, with malonyl-ACP and medium chain acyl-ACPs also present. The shift of strain RJH13 from 30 to 42°C was not accompanied by the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP (Fig. 7A, lane 3); however, there was a pronounced change in the composition of the short chain ACP thioesters. At 42°C, acetyl-ACP was not detected, and malonyl-ACP and ACP were the prominent species (Fig. 7B, lane 3). The addition of cerulenin caused the accumulation of 4:0 ACP and other medium chain acyl-ACPs in the control strain SJ16 (Fig. 7, lane 6) and in strain RJH13 at 30°C (Fig. 7, lane 2). However, cerulenin addition to strain RJH13 after shifting the cells to 42°C did not alter the ACP pool composition as dramatically as was found in the other strains. In contrast to the wild-type pattern, only small amounts of 4:0 ACP accumulated, and significant quantities of malonyl-ACP and ACP remained (Fig. 7B, lane 4). The production of 4:0-8:0 ACP in cerulenin-treated cells was attributed to the activity of FabH, the cerulenin-resistant condensing enzyme(2Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that these intermediates did not accumulate when strain RJH13 (panD fabI(Ts)) was treated with cerulenin at the non-permissive temperature indicated that FabI catalyzed the early reduction steps in fatty acid biosynthesis. The accumulation of malonyl-CoA in the presence and absence of cerulenin was measured in strain RJH13 at the permissive and non-permissive temperatures (Fig. 8). Malonyl-CoA levels were low in cells grown at 30°C, and malonyl-CoA accumulation was triggered by the addition of cerulenin. In contrast, shifting strain RJH13 to 42°C caused an immediate, cerulenin-independent accumulation of malonyl-CoA. Therefore, malonyl-CoA accumulated in the fabI(Ts) mutants in the absence of acyl-ACP and in the presence of active condensing enzymes, suggesting that both long chain acyl-ACP plus active FabB and FabF condensing enzymes were required to degrade malonyl-CoA. In principle, inactivation of the condensing enzymes using mutant strains should yield the same results as the addition of cerulenin. Neither strain RJH2 (fabF) nor strain RJH16 (fabB(Ts)) accumulated malonyl-CoA at 30°C or after shifting the cultures to either 42 or 44°C (not shown). This result was anticipated since in both cases the cells still possessed an alternative active condensing enzyme. Therefore, we constructed strain RJH18 (panD fabB(Ts) fabF) harboring both defective genes and examined the levels of malonyl-CoA at both the permissive (30°C) and non-permissive (44°C) temperatures. We did not detect malonyl-CoA levels that exceeded 1% of the total pool in cells growing at 30°C. The addition of cerulenin to the cultures at 30°C yielded a large accumulation of malonyl-CoA to 40% of the total pool; however, malonyl-CoA reached only 6-7% to the total CoA pool in cells cultured at 44°C. Next, the rate of acetate incorporation at 44°C in strain RJH18 was examined in the presence and absence of cerulenin. The temperature shift decreased the rate of acetate incorporation to 30% of the control level at 20 min and to 8% of the control level at 80 min (data not shown). In contrast, incorporation of acetate into fatty acids at 20 min after the addition of cerulenin was <2% of the control. These data showed that shifting the condensing enzyme mutants to the non-permissive temperature did not abruptly halt fatty acid synthesis and accounted for the inability to observe the large increase in malonyl-CoA levels found in cerulenin-treated cells in these double mutants. However, malonyl-CoA increased approximately 10-fold following the shift to 44°C, consistent with a role for these two condensing enzymes in regulating the malonyl-CoA content. Our analysis leads to a model describing a connection between fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis in E. coli outlined in Fig. 9. Fatty acid biosynthesis is initiated by the condensation of malonyl-ACP and acetyl-CoA, and subsequent rounds of elongation yield the long chain acyl-ACP substrates for enzyme PlsB. Physiological inhibition of PlsB activity, for example by (p)ppGpp (22Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the mutational inactivation of the acyltransferase (Fig. 3, Ref. 20Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leads to the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACP that, in concert with β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and/or II (FabB and FabF), stimulate the degradation of malonyl-ACP to acetyl-ACP. The acetate group is returned to the central metabolic pool by the conversion of acetyl-ACP to acetyl-CoA via the transacylase activity of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH). Acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccABCD), which is transacylated to malonyl-ACP by malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD). This model is consistent with the physiological experiments that demonstrate a dual requirement for acyl-ACP and active condensing enzymes to initiate the degradation of malonyl-ACP. The massive accumulation of malonyl-CoA in cells treated with cerulenin clearly points to a requirement for active FabB and/or FabF for the degradation of malonyl-CoA that continues to be generated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase following the inhibition of phospholipid synthesis (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). The requirement for acyl-ACP is confirmed by the analysis of fabI(Ts) mutants, which do not accumulate long chain acyl-ACPs at the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 7). These fabI(Ts) mutants possess active FabB and FabF and also accumulate malonyl-CoA (Fig. 8). An acyl-ACP requirement for the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in vivo is clear from the work of Jiang and Cronan (21Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who show that prevention of acyl-ACP accumulation in cells that are blocked at the glycerol-P acyltransferase step by the overexpression of either thioesterase I or II permits continued high rates of fatty acid synthesis in the absence of phospholipid formation. Elimination of the leader sequence of TesA, the thioesterase normally present in the periplasmic compartment, leads to the accumulation of this enzyme in the cytosol and the overproduction of fatty acids at all phases of growth(23Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4216-4219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Also, Voelker and Davies (24Voelker T.A. Davies H.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7320-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the expression of a plant medium chain acyl-ACP thioesterase in E. coli uncouples fatty acid biosynthesis from phospholipid formation, providing additional support for the idea that acyl-ACPs are feedback regulators of fatty acid biosynthesis. Fatty acid synthesis is the only cellular process that utilizes malonyl-CoA, whereas acetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of a myriad of cellular components and is a key regulator of intermediary metabolism. Therefore, one of the physiologically important consequences of the proposed futile cycle in Fig. 9 is to prevent the accumulation of CoA into a metabolically inactive thioester pool during periods of metabolic readjustment. It is also possible that the rate of fatty acid synthesis is controlled by the feedback activation of the “futile cycle” by acyl-ACP. This hypothesis suggests that the degradation of malonyl-ACP initiated by acyl-ACP reduces the supply of malonyl-ACP, leading to the cessation of fatty acid synthesis. Although this is an attractive hypothesis, our experiments do not rule out that the regulation of malonyl-CoA metabolism arises as a consequence of the acyl-ACP inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis at another site. This model proposed in Fig. 9 ascribes a physiological function to the enigmatic reactions catalyzed by the condensing enzymes that are not related to chain elongation. As outlined in the Introduction and Fig. 2, the ability of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases I and II (FabB and FabF) to carry out malonyl-ACP decarboxylation is an established biochemical property of these enzymes(13Alberts A.W. Bell R.M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3190-3198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of malonyl-CoA:CO2 exchange is greatly accelerated by acyl-ACP (15Vagelos P.R. Alberts A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2786-2791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Majerus P.W. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 43-50Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate stimulates the degradation of malonyl-ACP. The acyl-ACPs that are substrates for the glycerol-P acyltransferase are poor substrates for the condensation reaction catalyzed by FabB and FabF(6Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the model proposes that the decarboxylation reaction (reaction 3 in Fig. 2) is accelerated by the accumulation of these long chain acyl-ACPs. β-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) is an active acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase(4Tsay J.-T. Oh W. Larson T.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this reaction is proposed to account for the transfer of acetyl moieties back to the CoA pool. During conditions of logarithmic growth, this transfer may be limited due to the high concentration of acetyl-CoA and the low levels of free CoA acceptor(36Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model places acetyl-ACP as a byproduct of fatty acid biosynthesis rather than an active participant in chain initiation. Historically, acetyl-ACP was thought to be a key intermediate in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis (for review, see Ref. 1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the discovery of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) and the finding that FabH catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis using acetyl-CoA as the primer but not acetyl-ACP (2Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jackowski S. Murphy C.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6807-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that acetyl-ACP is not an essential intermediate in initiation. Post-Bettenmeiller et al.(35Post-Bettenmeiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlregge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) conclude that acetyl-ACP is not an intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis and in fact accumulates to high levels during the down-regulation of the pathway based on a detailed kinetic analysis of acetyl-ACP turnover in plant chloroplasts. Thus, acetyl-ACP is proposed as a product of the futile cycle (Fig. 9) rather than an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis. The analysis of the ACP pool composition in fabI(Ts) mutants supports this idea. The inhibition of fatty acid synthesis prior to the formation of acyl-ACP in fabI(Ts) mutants would prevent the operation of the futile cycle leading to the disappearance of acetyl-ACP (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, acetyl-ACP is a predominant component of the ACP pool in logarithmically growing cells (Fig. 7, lane 5), indicating that the futile cycle contributes to the regulation of malonyl-CoA utilization during normal growth of E. coli.

Peripheral blood MO provide the common source of MAC. Arbitrarily, or in response to so far unknown signals, they infiltrate tissues and body cavities. There, probably depending on the microenvironment and tissue-specific factors, they develop into different types of MAC with functional heterogeneity(4Rutherford M.S. Witsell A. Schook L.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 602-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Gordon S. Fraser I. Nath D. Hughes D. Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Under in vitro conditions a similar process of maturation from human blood MO to MAC, accompanied by specific changes of morphological, cytochemical, phenotypic, and functional properties can be observed(6Musson R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 111: 331-340Google Scholar, 7Andreesen R. Picht J. Löhr G.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 56: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several cell surface antigens are commonly used as phenotypic markers; for example, the low affinity Fc receptor (CD16), the α-chain of the vitronectin receptor (CD51), the transferrin receptor (CD71), and endoglin (CD105) are preferentially detectable on mature MAC, whereas the B148.4 antigen is mainly expressed on peripheral blood MO(8Andreesen R. Kreutz M. Fusenig E. Graf H. Ernst Schering Research Foundation Workshop 11: Cell Culture in Pharmaceutical Research. Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg1994: 9-27Google Scholar). The two monoclonal antibodies MAX.1 and MAX.11 have originally been developed to detect lineage-restricted antigens specific for late differentiation stages of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage(9Andreesen R. Bross K.J. Osterholz J. Emmerich F. Blood. 1986; 67: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During in vitro differentiation of human blood MO, surface expression of MAX.1 and MAX.11 antigen is increasing from low or undetectable levels on MO to a high expression level on MAC (after cultivation for 7 days in the presence of serum)(9Andreesen R. Bross K.J. Osterholz J. Emmerich F. Blood. 1986; 67: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, MAC in serous cavities (e.g. pleural and peritoneal cavity and alveolar space) express MAX.1 and MAX.11 antigen in a heterogeneous pattern, whereas tissue MAC from various organs express them at a low level(10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We purified MAX.1 and MAX.11 antigen by immunoaffinity chromatography from the supernatants of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)-treated, in vitro differentiated MAC. After NH2-terminal sequencing we identified carboxypeptidase M (CPM) as the antigen detected by both antibodies MAX.1 and MAX.11. CPM cleaves COOH-terminal arginine or lysine from peptides and proteins (11), and it is known to be anchored to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage(12Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A.

Because of its presence on plasma membranes and an optimal activity at neutral pH, CPM may participate in modulation of peptide hormone activity (e.g. kinins and enkephalin hexapeptides), or inactivation of peptides (e.g. kinins and anaphylatoxins) at local tissue sites(11Skidgel R.A.

Furthermore, human myeloid leukemia cell lines appear to correspond with different immature stages of myeloid differentiation. The human myeloid leukemia cell lines THP-1, U937, and HL-60 differentiate into MO/MAC-like cells when they are treated with (1,25(OH)2D3) (14Tanaka H. Abe E. Miyaura C. Kuribayashi T. Konno K.

Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We investigated expression of CPM on these myeloid cell lines, and since the induction of MAX.1/11 antigen CPM during monocytic differentiation with 1,25(OH)2D3 has been reported previously(18Kreutz M. Andreesen R. Blood. 1990; 76: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we further studied the regulation of the expression of CPM during the process of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of THP-1, U937, and HL-60 cell lines. The mAbs MAX.1 and MAX.11 were purified from hybridoma supernatants by ammonium sulfate precipitation (55%) followed by protein G-Sepharose chromatography. The purity and immunologic reactivity of both antibodies was documented by SDS-PAGE and immunoperoxidase staining, respectively. Two CD14 mAbs (RMO 52, Dianova-immunotech, Hamburg, Germany, and My4, Coulter Electronics, Krefeld, Germany) and a CD11c mAb (anti-Leu-M5, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) were used as control antibodies for immunoprecipitations and FACS analysis. All chemical reagents used were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by leukapheresis of healthy donors, followed by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll/Hypaque. MO were isolated from mononuclear cells by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation in a J6M-E centrifuge (Beckman, München, Germany) as described previously (19). MO were >90% pure as determined by morphology and expression of CD14 antigen. Isolated MO were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with vitamins, antibiotics, pyruvate, nonessential amino acids (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 × 10-8M β-mercaptoethanol, and with 2% human pooled AB-group serum on Teflon foils for a period of up to 8 days(19Andreesen R. Brugger W. Scheibenbogen C. Kreutz M. Leser H.G. Rehm A. Löhr G.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The human monocytic cell lines THP-1, U937, and HL-60 were grown in culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) until used for experiments. 1,25(OH)2D3 was provided by Hoffman-La Roche. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 was performed at a concentration of 1 × 10-7M for 72 h. Cells were surface-labeled using biotin as described(20Cole S.R. Ashman L.K. Ey P.L. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Meier T. Arni S. Malarkannan S. Poincelet M. Hoessli D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-5 × 107 cells were labeled in 1 ml of PBS containing 100 μg/ml 6-(+)-biotinylamidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester sodium salt (NHSS-LC-biotin, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature. Labeling was stopped by the addition of NH4Cl to a final concentration of 10 mM, and cells were washed twice with PBS. 1 × 108 cells/ml were suspended in PBS containing 0.2 units/ml PI-PLC (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C on a rotating mixer. The resulting supernatant was collected by centrifugation and kept at 4°C until used. Biotin-labeled cells were resuspended in 500 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim) and solubilized by the addition of 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Boehringer Mannheim) and 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Lysis was performed for 45 min on ice, and then nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 4°C, 30 min). Supernatants from cell lysis or PI-PLC treatment were precleared with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) overnight at 4°C on a rotating mixer. Immunoprecipitation was done by incubating the precleared supernatant with monoclonal antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4°C and precipitation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 45 min on a rotating mixer. Sepharose pellets were washed five times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, suspended in SDS sample buffer(22Shapiro A.L. Vinuela E. Maizel J.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 126: 155-164Google Scholar, 23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), processed for deglycosylation as described below, or stored at −20°C. A 2-ml immunoaffinity column (3 mg/ml mAb linked to 6-(+)-aminohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-Sepharose) was equilibrated with binding buffer (1:1 mixture of PBS and TSS buffer (0.01 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate)). Supernatant from PI-PLC-treated MAC diluted 1:2 with TSS buffer, was applied to the column. After sample loading the column was washed with 5 column volumes of each of the following buffers: TSS buffer, Tris buffer, pH 8.0 (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl), and Tris buffer, pH 9.0 (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 0.5 M NaCl). Material bound to the column was eluted with 50 mM triethanolamin/NaOH, pH 11.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mM NaCl, in 1.5-ml fractions, immediately neutralized with 0.2 volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mM NaCl. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to identify fractions containing purified antigen. Deglycosylation of immunoprecipitated proteins still coupled to the protein G-Sepharose involved washing beads with NGF-wash buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) and elution of proteins from the protein G beads by boiling in 50 μl of NGF buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, pH 7.0). SDS was neutralized by the addition of 25 μl of 20% n-dodecyl maltoside, and supernatant was incubated at 37°C with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) overnight. Alternatively, eluted protein from immunoaffinity purification was dialyzed against NGF-wash buffer, SDS and β-mercaptoethanol were added to a final concentration of 1% each, and the solution was boiled. SDS was neutralized by addition of 50 μl of 20% n-dodecyl maltoside (Boehringer Mannheim)/100 μl solution and incubated at 37°C with N-glycosidase F (10 units/ml) overnight. Deglycosylated proteins were precipitated with methanol/chloroform as described(24Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). Samples from immunoprecipitation were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (22Shapiro A.L. Vinuela E. Maizel J.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 126: 155-164Google Scholar, 23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) along with biotinylated molecular weight marker proteins (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for 1 h at 0.8 mA/cm2(25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C in blocking solution (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After washing with 0.1% Tween-20 in blocking solution the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham UK; diluted 1:2,500 in blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin). After extensive washing, biotinylated proteins on the nitrocellulose membrane were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) of Amersham. Unbiotinylated MAX.11 immunoaffinity-purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gels, reducing conditions) after deglycosylation and methanol/chloroform precipitation and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). After staining with Coomassie Blue, a specific band was cut and subjected to an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (model 477A) with an online PTH-analyzer (model 120A). For determination of enzymatic activity membranes of washed cells or placental microvilli were prepared by Dounce homogenization in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (1,500 × g, 4°C, 15 min), and crude membrane preparations were either processed immediately or stored at −20°C. After centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to remove debris, membrane fragments were further separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 2 M NaCl followed by recentrifugation. The washed pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 4°C, 15 min). CPM activity was measured with dansyl-Ala-Arg (BioTeZ, Berlin, Germany) as a substrate in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 340 nm excitation and 495 nm emission as described(26Skidgel R.A. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 6: 373-385Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In control reactions CPM activity was inhibited by 10 M 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (Calbiochem). The protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid according to the described procedure (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar) with albumin as the standard. Freshly isolated MO or cultured cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing 0.06% immunoglobulin (Sandoz Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), and 5 × 105 cells were incubated with saturating amounts of specific mAbs or IgG isotype control (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at 4°C. After two further washes, cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min at 4°C. After two more washes, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldhyde in PBS. Analysis was performed using a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). Cell populations were gated according to their forward and side scattering. Synthetic oligonucleotides designed according to the CPM nucleotide sequence (13Tan F. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Schilling J.W. Skidgel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used for PCR amplification of cDNA prepared from mRNA of in vitro differentiated MAC. The sense primer 5′-TTTCAACTACCACCGCCAGGAAGG-3′ corresponded to nucleotides 45-68, and the antisense primer 5′-ATGTGCAAAAGACTCACTAAAAATAA-3′ corresponded to nucleotides 1282-1307. Conditions for PCR amplification were 95°C for 1 min, 64°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1.5 min repeated for 35 cycles. The amplified PCR product was inserted into a plasmid vector (Ta Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Partial DNA sequencing was done by dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer′s instructions, and sequences were analyzed on the Applied Biosystems DNA sequencing system (model 373A). Total RNA was isolated from different cell types by the guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol method(28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The RNA (10 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels (29Krause S.W. Kreutz M. Zenke G. Andreesen R. Ann. Hematol. 1992; 64: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and transferred to nylon membranes (Magna NT, MSI, Westbrough, MA). Hybridization (adapted from Refs. 29Krause S.W. Kreutz M. Zenke G. Andreesen R. Ann. Hematol. 1992; 64: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and 30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar) was performed using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe of the EcoRI restriction fragments of the cloned CPM PCR fragment (random primed DNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). To provide an internal control, membranes were reprobed with an oligonucleotide against 18 S rRNA labeled by T4 kinase (5′ end-labeling kit, Amersham). Autoradiography was performed at −70°C, and bands were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer. For a biochemical characterization of antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies MAX.1 and MAX.11, we surface-labeled in vitro differentiated MAC with NHSS-LC-biotin and immunoprecipitated antigens from the cell lysates. Both mAbs precipitated a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 58-64 kDa (Fig. 1A) Subsequent digestion of the immunoprecipitated material with N-glycosidase F resulted in a shift of apparent size to 46 kDa (Fig. 1B), indicating a carbohydrate content of about 28% by weight. Since it was already shown that the antigen detected by MAX.1 can be cleaved from the cell membrane by PI-specific phospholipase C(31Van der Schoot C.E. Huizinga T.W.J. Gadd S. Majdic O. Wijmans R. Knapp W. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Knapp W. Dörken B. Gilks W.R. Rieber E.P. Schmidt R.E. Stein H. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Leukocyte Typing IV. Oxford Press, Oxford1989: 887-891Google Scholar), immunoprecipitations were performed using supernatants of surface-labeled MAC after treatment with PI-PLC. The diffuse bands of the antigens precipitated by mAb MAX.1 and MAX.11 after PI-PLC treatment were identical to the bands obtained from cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Since the characteristics of antigens detected by mAb MAX.1 and MAX.11 were very similar during the experiments described above, we investigated the possibility that both antibodies detect the same antigen. Cell lysates from surface-labeled in vitro differentiated MAC were subjected to chromatography over small immunoaffinity columns (0.5 ml) of MAX.1 or MAX.11 covalently linked to Sepharose. After extensive washing to remove unspecifically bound material, eluates from both columns were reprecipitated with each of the two mAbs and an isotype control antibody. After enzymatical deglycosylation of the precipitated material the characteristic band of 46 kDa was detectable after precipitation with MAX.1 and MAX.11 but not with the isotype control antibody (Fig. 2), confirming that the antigens detected by MAX.1 and MAX.11 are identical. In vitro differentiated MAC (8 × 108 cells) were exposed to PI-PLC to cause the release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins into the supernatant. A smaller portion of cells (1 × 108 cells) was surface-labeled with biotin before PI-PLC treatment. Supernatants of labeled and unlabeled cells were combined and subjected to immunoaffinity column chromatography over MAX.11 covalently linked to Sepharose. After washing, the material bound to the column was eluted in small fractions, and a small part of each fraction was analyzed on SDS-PAGE with subsequent immunoblotting and visualization of biotinylated protein by ECL. The fraction containing the immunopurified antigen was used for NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the following sequence was obtained: Leu-Asp-Phe-Asn-Tyr-X-X-Gln-Glu-Gly-Met-Glu-Ala. A search of the EMBL nucleic acid data bases revealed identity with the NH2-terminal sequenced amino acids of CPM(13Tan F. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Schilling J.W. Skidgel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that CPM is identical with MAX.1/11 antigen, we measured CPM activity with dansyl-Ala-Arg as substrate in membrane preparations from in vitro differentiated MAC after immunoprecipitation with mAb MAX.1 or MAX.11 or an isotype control antibody. As a positive control with well known CPM activity we used membrane preparations of placental microvilli in a similar experiment. As shown in Table I, in comparison to the isotype control antibody (100%) the majority of enzymatic activity was precipitated by antibodies MAX.1 and MAX.11.Table I:Immunoprecipitation of carboxypeptidase activity from membrane fractions of in vitro differentiated macrophages (MAK) or placental microvilli (PM) Open table in a new tab After it was proven that mAbs MAX.1 and MAX.11 detect CPM, we investigated the correlation of CPM surface expression with membrane-bound enzymatic activity and mRNA-expression during serum-induced in vitro differentiation of MO. Cultured MO were harvested at the indicated time points, and preparations of cells for flow cytometry, RNA extraction, and enzyme assay were done in parallel. As shown in Fig. 3, FACS analysis confirmed that the surface expression of CPM markedly increases during monocytic in vitro differentiation. A slightly different staining pattern of mAbs MAX.1 and MAX.11 was reproducible in all experiments. For both antibodies, the mean fluorescence, a parameter corresponding to the number of molecules/cell, strongly increased during 7 days of culture in the presence of serum. In parallel, carboxypeptidase activity of cell membrane preparations was measured with dansyl-Ala-Arg as substrate at the same time points, using a placental membrane preparation as a positive control. The mean specific activity (nmol/h/mg) of CPM increased 30-40-fold during monocytic differentiation (Fig. 4), showing a similar behavior as the surface expression determined by FACS analysis. To study the regulation of CPM expression at the RNA level, total cellular RNA was prepared at the same time points and hybridized with a CPM-probe. Total RNA prepared from placenta was used as a positive control, and lymphocyte RNA and fibroblast RNA were used as negative controls. As shown in Fig. 5, a strong induction of CPM mRNA expression was detectable during 7 days of culture in the presence of serum. In addition we studied expression of CPM on myeloid cell lines HL-60, U937, and THP-1, which appear to represent different immature stages of myeloid differentiation. In promyeloid cell line HL-60 CPM surface expression was almost undetectable. Upon treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 a weak induction of CPM expression could be demonstrated in FACS analysis (Table II). The histiocytic cell line U937 showed a weak surface expression of CPM that could be slightly enhanced by treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. In comparison with the other two cell lines the monoblastic cell line THP-1 showed a high surface expression of CPM that markedly increased during the 3 days of 1,25(OH)2D3-treatment.Table II:Carboxypeptidase M surface expression on myeloid cell lines Open table in a new tab The expression and tissue distribution of the glycoproteins detected by mAbs MAX.1 and MAX.11 suggested that they might be of interest for the investigation of MAC differentiation and site-specific activation(9Andreesen R. Bross K.J. Osterholz J. Emmerich F. Blood. 1986; 67: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and identification of the antigen detected by both mAbs. We used PI-PLC cleavage from the plasma membrane to purify the MAX.11 antigen by immunoaffinity chromatography. The quantity and purity of the eluted protein were sufficient for determination of NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. A comparison of the determined amino acid sequence with the published amino acid sequence of CPM (13Tan F. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Schilling J.W. Skidgel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) disclosed that the two molecules are identical. Results from biochemical characterization (58-64-kDa glycoprotein, anchoring to the plasma membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage) matched the published data(11Skidgel R.A. Davis R.M. Tan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2236-2241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A. Kriho V.B. Li X.-Y. Becker R.P. Erdös E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both antibodies were able to almost completely precipitate enzymatic activity from membrane preparations of in vitro differentiated MAC and placental microvilli as a control, too. Reactivity of MAX.1 and MAX.11 slightly differs in immunoperoxidase stainings of MAC from different body fluids(9Andreesen R. Bross K.J. Osterholz J. Emmerich F. Blood. 1986; 67: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and immunofluorescent flow cytometry during MO to MAC differentiation. Staining of CPM by mAb MAX.1 seems to be delayed in comparison with mAb MAX.11, suggesting that both antibodies might recognize differentially expressed epitopes on the CPM-molecule. Digestion of precipitated CPM with neuraminidase and β-galactosidase both lead to a marked shift of apparent size to 60 and 56 kDa, respectively (data not shown), indicating that the glycans linked to CPM are, at least in part, of the complex type. It is known that the expression of some glycosyltransferases responsible for glycan structure and composition can be regulated in a maturation-associated manner (32Mizoguchi A. Takasaki S. Maeda S. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 259: 11949-11957Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).2( 2M. Rehli, S. W. Krause, M. Kreutz, and R. Andreesen, unpublished observations. )Therefore, a different glycosylation of CPM during the process of MO to MAC differentiation might be an explanation for the slightly different binding of MAX.1 and MAX.11. Further evidence for the identity of CPM and MAX.1/11 antigen comes from the described similar tissue distributions of enzymatic activity and antigen expression. In addition to expression on MAC, MAX.1 and MAX.11 antigen could be detected in human kidney (glomerular mesangial cells), in human placenta (cytotrophoblastic and syncytial cells), in the upper gastrointestinal tract (subepithelial structures), and weakly in lymphoid organs (dendritic reticulum cells)(10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This staining pattern correlates with the published distribution of enzymatic activity of CPM. Membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity is measurable in membrane fractions of various human tissues (placental microvilli, kidney, lung, and brain) (11Skidgel R.A. Davis R.M. Tan F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 9: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Basic carboxypeptidases catalyze the removal of COOH-terminal basic amino acids arginine or lysine from peptides or proteins. The natural substrates appear to be peptide hormones like kinins, enkephalin hexapeptides, and anaphylatoxins or proteins like creatine kinase(36Skidgel R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The removal of COOH-terminal arginine or lysine results in modulation or inactivation of peptide hormone activity and can also change the physical properties of proteins(36Skidgel R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). CPM is a membrane-bound ectopeptidase, present in many organs and tissues. It can participate in control of peptide hormone activity at the cell surface, degradation of extracellular proteins and peptides, and prohormone processing(36Skidgel R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), but its regulation and actual functional role in different tissues are still unclear. The release of L-arginine from peptides or proteins by CPM may increase local concentrations of this amino acid at the MAC cell surface. At sites of a high density of substrates, e.g. at inflammatory sites, CPM activity might influence L-arginine metabolism. In the lung, CPM is present on alveolar type I pneumocytes (33Skidgel R.A.

Biol. 1993; 9: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that CPM is involved in bradykinin metabolism. It may protect the alveolar surface from bradykinin-induced deletious vascular responses(37Chodimella V. Skidgel R.A. Krowiak E.J. Murlas C.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Desmanez N. Lockhart A. Lacroix H. Dusser D.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

In patients with extrinsic allergic bronchiolitis and active pulmonary sarcoidosis, CPM expression on alveolar MAC as detected by mAb MAX.1 is increased in comparison with healthy persons(10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Elevated serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme, a predominantly membrane-bound peptidyl dipeptidase that cleaves similar substrates as CPM, is used to diagnose and to assess response to treatment of sarcoidosis(40Lieberman J. Clin. Lab. Med. 1989; 9: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CPM expression on alveolar MAC or its activity in the bronchoalveolar fluid could serve as additional markers for this disease. Further investigations should clarify the value of this parameter in diagnosing and monitoring active pulmonary sarcoidosis and other inflammatory lung diseases. MAC from granulomas of patients with sarcoidosis synthesize the biological active hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3(41Adams J.S. Singer F.R. Gacad M.A. Sharma O.P. Hayes M.J. Vouros P. Holick M.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1985; 60: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 may be involved in the stimulation of alveolar MAC to produce CPM. The possibility for a role of vitamin D3 in regulation of CPM expression is supported by several additional observations; it is shown that, in the absence of serum proteins, MAX.1/CPM is expressed in a maturation-associated manner during 1,25(OH)2D3-induced in vitro maturation of MO to MAC(18Kreutz M. Andreesen R. Blood. 1990; 76: 2457-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated in this study, 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of human promonocytic leukemia cell lines THP-1 and U937 is accompanied by an increased expression of CPM. Also in HL-60 cells, which are thought to represent the earliest differentiation stage of the three cell lines tested, CPM expression slightly increased during 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. In renal allograft rejections T-cell activation is required to cause CPM expression in local MAC, since the CPM expression is undetectable in patients treated with Cyclosporin A(10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results indicate that T-lymphokines may have a possible regulatory role in the expression induction of CPM. Recent observations of our group suggest that tumor cells modulate MAC differentiation and are capable of suppressing CPM expression on MAC associated with solid tumors.3( 3A. Konur, M. Kreutz, R. Knüchel, and R. Andreesen, submitted for publication. ) To clarify whether T-cell-derived or tumor-derived factors play an active role in modulation of CPM expression further studies on gene regulation are required. The functional role of CPM in MAC will depend on its tis-sue localization and the occurrence of its natural substrates. The present available data on possible substrates are still incomplete. Peptide hormone processing includes complex regulatory mechanisms. Its course and its role in tissue injury and inflammation as well as the effects of peptide hormones and metabolites on cells of the immune system have not yet been characterized. As described previously(9Andreesen R. Bross K.J. Osterholz J. Emmerich F. Blood. 1986; 67: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Andreesen R. Gadd S. Costabel U. Leser H.G. Speth V. Cesnik B. Atkins R.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), CPM expression, detected by mAbs MAX.1 and MAX.11, is restricted to the MO/MAC lineage within hematopoietic cells. Besides other peptidases (neutral endopeptidase (CD10), aminopeptidase N (CD13), and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26)) carboxypeptidase M should be assigned to a cluster differentiation (CD) group. We thank Dr. Frank Emmerich for providing sufficient amounts of MAX.1 and MAX.11 hybridoma supernatants, Dr. Rainer Deutzman for performing the NH2-terminal sequencing, Anne Pietryga-Krieger for cDNA sequencing, and Dr. Werner Falk for help-ful advice and discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2016319958,"Factor VIIa, in the presence of Ca2+ and tissue factor (TF), initiates the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. The light chain (amino acids 1-152) of factor VIIa consists of an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain followed by two epidermal growth factor-like domains, whereas the heavy chain (amino acids 153-406) contains the serine protease domain. In this study, both recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa) and factor VIIa lacking the Gla domain were found to contain two high-affinity (Kd∼150 μM) Ca2+ binding sites. The rVIIa also contained ∼6-7 low-affinity (Kd∼1 mM) Ca2+-binding sites. By analogy to other serine proteases, one of the two high affinity Ca2+-binding sites in factor VIIa may be formed involving Glu-210 and Glu-220 of the protease domain. In support of this, a synthetic peptide composed of residues 206-242 of factor VIIa bound one Ca2+ with Kd∼230 μM; however, Ca2+ binding was observed only in Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 M NaCl and not in buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl. In both low or high salt ±Ca2+, the peptide existed as a monomer as determined by sedimentation equilibrium measurements and had no detectable secondary structure as determined by CD measurements. This indicates that subtle changes undetectable by CD may occur in the conformation of the peptide that favor calcium binding in high salt. In the presence of recombinant TF and 5 mM Ca2+, the peptide inhibited the amidolytic activity of rVIIa toward the synthetic substrate, S-2288. The concentration of the peptide required for half-maximal inhibition was ∼5-fold higher in the low salt buffer than that in the high salt buffer. From direct binding and competitive inhibition assays of active site-blocked 125I-rVIIa binding to TF, the Kd for peptide-TF interaction was calculated to be ∼15 μM in the high salt and ∼55 μM in the low salt buffer containing 5 mM Ca2+. Moreover, as inferred from S-2288 hydrolysis, the Kd for VIIa·TF interaction was ∼1.5 μM in the absence of Ca2+, and, as inferred from factor X activation studies, it was ∼10 pM in the presence of Ca2+. Thus, Ca2+ decreases the functional Kd of VIIa·TF interaction ∼150,000-fold. Furthermore, the amidolytic activity of VIIa·Ca2+, VIIa·TF, and VIIa·Ca2+·TF was increased ∼7-fold, ∼100-fold, and ∼350-fold, respectively, over that of factor VIIa alone; the half-maximal effect was observed at ∼200 μM Ca2+ when added.

INTRODUCTIONInterleukin-5 (IL-5)1( 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinCSFcolony-stimulating factorM-CSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorsGM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. )is a T-cell-derived cytokine that causes the differentiation of eosinophils from their bone marrow precursors and also plays a role in their activation processes. Normally, these cells are involved in the killing of parasites. However, in inflammatory diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis (Sanderson, 1992Sanderson C.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1992; 23: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, Takatsu, 1992Takatsu K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), eosinophil numbers are raised, and the presence of toxic eosinophil products has been detected. Furthermore, when monoclonal antibodies against IL-5 are given in guinea pig models of allergic asthma, there is a diminution of the eosinophil influx, and at high concentrations, a decrease in the bronchial hyperreactivity (a measure of the underlying inflammation (Mauser et al., 1993Mauser P.J. Pitman A. Witt A. Fernandez X. Zurcher J. Kung T. Jones H. Watnick A.S. Egan R.W. Kreutner W. Adams G.K. Am. Rev. Resp. Dis. 1993; 148: 1623-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Based on these data, an IL-5 antagonist would be expected to have useful pharmacological properties.We have previously expressed and purified recombinant human IL-5 (Proudfoot et al., 1990Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein is a disulfide-linked homodimer, and, although it is glycosylated in its natural form, the deglycosylated IL-5 is equipotent in all in vitro assays. IL-5 has been crystallized, and the three-dimensional structure solved at a resolution of 2.4 Å (Hassell et al., 1993Hassell A.M. Wells T.N.C. Graber P. Proudfoot A.E.I. Anderegg R. Burkhart W.

Nature. 1993; 363: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). IL-5 has a novel two-domain structure, with each domain showing a striking similarity to the four-helix bundle seen for IL-2 (Bazan and McKay, 1992Bazan J.F. McKay D.B. Science. 1992; 257: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); IL-4 (Smith et al., 1992Smith L.J. Redfield C. Boyd J. Lawrence G.M.P. Edwards R.G. Smith R.A.G. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); M-CSF (Pandit et al., 1992Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancaril J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and GM-CSF (Diederichs et al., 1991Diederichs K. Boone T. Karplus P.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Amongst these structures, IL-5 is unique in that the formation of each four-helix bundle domain requires the participation of two chains of IL-5.IL-5 binds to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of a specific α-chain, which binds its ligand at picomolar concentrations (Tavernier et al., 1991Tavernier J.

Migata M. Kikuchi Y. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Signaling requires the presence of a β-chain that is also shared with IL-3 and GM-CSF (Tavernier et al., 1991Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Studies to define the binding site for either of the receptor chains on IL-5 have been limited. The most detailed ones published to date, a series of human/mouse chimerae, have shown that the carboxyl-terminal third of the molecule is important in controlling the human to mouse species selectivity (McKenzie et al., 1991McKenzie A.N.J. Barry S.C. Strath M. Sanderson C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, chimeric proteins in which the last 36 residues of the protein had been replaced with those from the species of interest had retained biological activity. In addition, the importance of the carboxyl terminus in the biological activity of human IL-5 had been suggested from experiments where CNBr cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal 8 amino acids results in the loss of biological activity (Kodama et al., 1991Kodama S. Tsuruoka N. Tsujimoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although this may simply be a problem of protein denaturation. Early experiments using hybrid GM-CSF and IL-5 constructs suggested that the amino-terminal helix-A of IL-5 was required for high affinity binding to the receptor (Shanafelt et al., 1991Shanafelt A.B. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Kastelein R.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The binding site for the common β-chain of the receptor has been located on the first helix of IL-3 and GM-CSF (Lopez et al., 1992Lopez A.F. Shannon M.F. Barry S. Phillips J.A. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Simmons P. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11842-11846Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Barry et al., 1994Barry Jr., S.C. Bagley C.J. Phillips J. Dottore M.

Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 3500-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The key residue in GM-CSF is Glu-21, which is on the exposed face of helix-A. In IL-3, similar results have been obtained for Glu-22, which is predicted to be in the same position in helix-A.Previous studies of other four-α-helix bundle cytokines such as IL-4 or human growth hormone have shown that electrostatic interactions play a key role in the formation of the receptor-ligand complex (Cunningham and Wells, 1993Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar; Demchuk et al., 1994Demchuk E. Mueller T. Oschkinat H. Sebald W. Wade R.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 920-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The association rate constants for the receptor-ligand complexes in these cases predicted that electrostatic steering was important in the initial association event. We have therefore decided to initially study the charged residues of IL-5. In order to define which areas of the protein are important in binding to either the α- or the β-chain of the receptor, we have systematically analyzed all of the charged residues in IL-5. Using the alanine scanning mutagenesis technique (Cunningham and Wells, 1989Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have produced a set of mutant proteins where the charged side chains have been replaced by alanine. Alanine was chosen because it has a short nonpolar side chain, does not cause major conformational disturbances to the protein structure, and is also routinely found in both buried and solvent-exposed positions in proteins. By analyzing the activity of these mutant proteins in binding assays and cellular responses, we have been able to identify the two key charged interactions in the α-chain binding site and confirm the location of the β-chain binding site as Glu-12 on helix-A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of IL-5 MutantsThe synthetic gene for IL-5 was subcloned from the plasmid pLTEX4 (Tavernier et al., 1989Tavernier J. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Haquier G. Bauden R. Rache I. Kawashima E. Vanderkirkove J. Contreras R. Fiers W.

J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) into the mutated M13mp8 supplied with the SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.). Initially, we designed 15 mutants (designated A-O, see Fig. 1 and). These scanned the entire length of the IL-5 sequence, replacing the charged amino acids with alanine side chains. Multiple mutations were made where there was more than one charged side chain within a 5-amino acid stretch. All of the mutations therefore involved changes of between 1 and 3 amino acids, with the exception of mutant K, where there was a continuous run of 5 charged amino acids. Typical oligonucleotide lengths were 20-25 nucleotides. The mutated constructs were then subcloned back into the pLTEX4 vector for expression in the Escherichia coli strain W3110. Mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli, where all proteins formed inclusion bodies. Small scale cultures (500 ml) were grown in shaker flasks in all cases, and yields were typically 5 g of cell paste. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain good expression of mutant K, and therefore we were obliged to make the five point mutations scanning the region Glu-87 to Arg-91, and express them individually (see Table II). Since the data from the initial set of mutations suggested that mutants B (K11A,E12A) and C (H20A,R21A) had impaired binding to the β-chain of the receptor, we made the four further single mutations, K11A, E12A, H20A, and R21A in order to more precisely define the binding site of the receptor. Also, since studies on IL-4 (Kruse et al., 1993Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) had shown that replacement of the carboxyl-terminal aromatic group Tyr-124 with an acid produced an antagonist, we made the equivalent mutation (W110D) in IL-5.Table II: Open table in a new tab The proteins were purified and renatured as described previously (Proudfoot et al., 1990Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), adapting the column sizes for 5 g of cell paste. The refolding was carried out at slightly lower protein concentrations (2-5 μg/ml), and including an oxidation step to facilitate dimerization typically gave a 40% yield (Graber et al., 1993Graber P. Bernard A.R. Hassell A.M. Milburn M.V. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Wells T.N.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The quantity of each mutant protein was calculated from its UV absorbance using a specific absorbance value based on the published amino acid sequence. The amino acid composition of mutant proteins was verified in each case by overnight hydrolysis at 105°C in 6 M HCl and quantified using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer with a SICA integrator. The correct amino terminus was verified for several of the mutants using Edman degradation using an ABI 477A pulsed liquid phase sequencer. To confirm that the mutant proteins were correctly folded, 100-μg samples were placed in Centricon 10 filters and washed 5 times with 2 ml of Tris-d11-DCl buffer, pH 8.5, to remove proton-containing buffers and other exchangeable protons. NMR was carried out on a Brucker AMX-600 spectrometer using a 3-mm triple resonance microprobe. Jump-Return spectra (τ = 120 microsiemens, excitation maximum at 11 ppm), accumulated 2000 transients with a sweep width of 13 157.89 Hz.2( 2M. Banks, P. Graber, A. Proudfoot, C. Arod, B. Allet, A. Bernard, E. Sebille, M. McKinnon, T. Wells and R.

Luskinskas F.W. Kiely J.-M. Luis E.A. Darbonne W.C. Bennett G.L. Liu C.C. Obin M.S. Gimbrone M.A. Baker J.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3033-3040PubMed Google Scholar. Three micrograms of IL-5 were incubated with 500 μCi of [125I]NaI (Amersham Corp., IMS-30) in 50 μl of 1.5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a siliconized glass tube. Following the addition of 20 μl of chloramine T solution (0.1 mg/ml) the sample was incubated at room temperature for 2 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 M KI solution, and the 125I-labeled IL-5 was separated from the free [125I]NaI by gel filtration on a PD10 size exclusion column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), using 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The specific activity of these preparations was routinely between 1500 and 2000 Ci●mmol⁻1. In later experiments, commercially labeled IL-5 (Amersham Corp.) was used and gave identical results.Binding of IL-5 to TF-1 cellsTF-1 cells were washed once with medium and resuspended in the binding medium (RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% NaN3, and 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4). Binding experiments were performed at room temperature in 300 μl of binding medium containing 1 × 106 cells and 150-200 pM125I-labeled IL-5, in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild-type IL-5 or mutant IL-5. After a 2-h incubation period, the binding mixture was layered over 200 μl of oil (84% silicone oil, 16% paraffin oil) in 500-μl tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a bench-top microcentrifuge for 3 min. After rapid freezing, the tips of the tubes were cut just above the cell pellet and placed in vials, which were directly counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was defined as the residual radioactivity when the assay was carried out in a 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-5. Total specific binding was fitted to the equation for competition of ligand binding, using a single site model B = Bmaxˈ/(IC50+ [L]) where Bmaxˈ is the binding seen in the absence of competing ligand. Under circumstances where the formation of receptor ligand complex does not significantly lower the concentration of free ligand, the IC50 value is equal to the sum of the dissociation constant and the concentration of hot ligand added. Data were analyzed by Grafit 3.01 (Leatherbarrow, 1992Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit version 3.01. Erithacus Software, Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) using simple weighting. Since some of the mutants showed significant deviations from this model, all data were also fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation B = Bmax′/IC50+ [L])n+ background.Binding to Immobilized IL-5 Receptor α SubunitThe extracellular domains of the IL-5 receptor α-subunit were expressed as a fusion protein containing the IgG binding ZZ-domain at its carboxyl terminus (Moks et al., 1987Moks T. Abrahmsén B. sterlöf B. Josephson S. stling M. Enfors S.-O. Persson I. Nilsson B. Uhlén M. BioTechnology. 1987; 5: 37-42Google Scholar). This was expressed into the culture medium of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and purified as will be described elsewhere.3( 3B. Allet, A. Bernard, P. Graber, and T. N. C. Wells, unpublished results. )Binding of mutant versions of IL-5 was assessed by their ability to compete with radiolabeled wild-type IL-5 binding to receptor α-chains immobilized onto scintillation beads (Amersham Corp.). The linked scintillation proximity assay was carried out in white clear bottom microtitre plates in a final volume of 200 μl.2 Briefly, 5 ng●ml⁻1 of the fusion protein, 6.5 μg●ml⁻1 rabbit IgG- and 625 μg●ml⁻1 anti-rabbit IgG-coated fluoromicrospheres (Amersham Corp.), in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 8.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.5% (v/v) bovine serum albumin were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. 125I-labeled IL-5 (Amersham Corp.) was added to a final concentration of 100 pM and incubated at room temperature for between 4 and 24 h before being counted. Nonspecific binding was measured using a 500-fold molar excess of IL-5. Data were fitted to a single-site model for competition of binding using Grafit 3.01 (Leatherbarrow, 1992Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit version 3.01. Erithacus Software, Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar).TF-1 Proliferation AssayThe human erythroleukaemia cell line TF-1 proliferates in response to IL-5 (Kitamura et al., 1989Kitamura T. Tonge T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Proliferation assays were performed by incubating 5 × 103 cells in 100 μl of medium (RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm Hepes, 1% L-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum), and IL-5 wild-type or mutant was added in doubling dilutions with initial concentrations of 1-10 μg/ml. Plates were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 60-72 h. The level of proliferation induced was measured using Cell Titer 96TM nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega), which monitors the conversion of tetrazolium blue into its formazan product. Data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic curve using Grafit 3.01 with simple weighting.Adhesion of Purified Human EosinophilsThe adhesion of purified human eosinophils to an immobilized ICAM-ZZ fusion protein coated onto 96-well polystyrene plates was measured as described previously.4( 4D. Fattah, K. R. Page, S. Bezbaruah, R. C. Priest, C. M. Horgan, and R. Solari, submitted for publication. )Briefly, 5000 purified human eosinophils were mixed with IL-5 wild-type or mutant in a total volume of 100 μl and added to a 96-well microtitre plate that had been coated with the fusion protein ICAM-1-ZZ. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the induction of adhesion was assessed by measuring the endogenous peroxidase activity of the adherent eosinophils.RESULTSDefining the Regions of IL-5 Important in Biological ResponsesWe have systematically replaced the charged amino acids of IL-5 (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, and histidine) to alanine in groups of 1, 2 or 3 residues (Fig. 1). These proteins were expressed in E. coli, and the protein was purified and refolded as described previously (Proudfoot et al., 1990Proudfoot A.E.I. Fattah D. Kawashima E.H. Bernard A. Wingfield P.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All of the mutants expressed at between 1 and 20% of total cell protein, except for the mutant K, which was designed to remove all five charges from the second β-sheet. This was therefore subsequently made as a set of five single mutants: E87A, E88A, R89A, R90A, and R91A.Initially, all of the mutant proteins were tested in an assay for biological response in their ability to stimulate proliferation of the human erythroleukaemic cell line TF-1 (Kitamura et al., 1989Kitamura T. Tonge T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation, which fits to a background value, a maximum response, an EC50 (the concentration required for a 50% maximal response), and a slope of the curve. In this assay, the wild-type IL-5 gave a geometric mean EC50 of 4.1 pM and a slope of n = 0.78 ± 0.06. The assay to assay variation of EC50 values showed a relatively large variation, and so these proliferation assays were repeated at least 3 times (normally 5). The results for these assays are shown in Table I:, Table II:. The EC50 of the mutants is expressed as the ratio of the wild-type EC50 in that particular assay. In all cases except for mutant B, the mutants were capable of a complete agonist effect. That is to say, that the maximum proliferative response seen was not significantly different from the wild-type. Mutant B showed only 93 ± 2.8% maximal response. However, there were clear differences in the EC50 as can be seen in Table I and Fig. 2a, where a selection of the mutants showing a decrease in potency are shown (not all data are shown in the figure in the interests of clarity).Table I:0p4in cWe were unable to express this multiple mutant, and so the residues were mutated individually.

EC50 values were calculated as described in the text and are shown in Table I:, Table II:. The data shown are taken from a single experiment, but they are typical of those seen in three or more experiments. b, effect of double mutant B (K11A,E12A) (■) and the single mutation E12A (□) compared with wild-type IL-5 (○) showing that the single mutation produces a protein with partial agonist activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Four of the mutant proteins (B, C, M, and R90A) showed a greater than 10-fold reduction in potency in the TF-1 proliferation bioassays. In order to further define which of the residues in these multiple mutants were important in the interaction, single mutants were made for B (K11A,E12A) and C (H20A,R21A). Since previous studies have shown that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region as far as residue 112 has no effect on receptor binding or bioactivity, the important residue in mutant M can be assumed to be Glu-109. The mutant K11A was not well expressed in E. coli, and in addition we were unable to refold the H20A mutant. These mutants were all tested in TF-1 proliferation and receptor binding assays, as described previously, and the data are shown in Table II and Fig. 2a. These mutants also showed large shifts in potency. The E12A mutant exhibited partial agonist activity, since even at very high concentrations of ligand, the maximal proliferative response seen was only 64.7 ± 4.0% of that seen for the wild-type and the other mutants (Fig. 2b).In addition, we mutated Trp-110 to aspartate. This is the only tryptophan in the protein, and it aligns well with Tyr-124 in human IL-4. The mutant Y124D produces an antagonist in IL-4, and we were interested to know whether the same effect could be seen in IL-5. The protein shows a 10-fold reduction in activity in the TF-1 proliferation assay as compared to wild-type.Eosinophil Activation AssayAll mutants that showed a non-wild-type response in the TF-1 proliferation assay were also tested for their ability to activate LFA-1 on human eosinophils and therefore enhance the adherence to ICAM-1-ZZ-coated plastic.4 The wild-type protein showed an EC50 of 5 pm, using a four-parameter logistic equation (Fig. 3). Although the shape of the dose-response curve is steeper in this assay (typically giving a slope of 2-3), the relative EC50 values calculated in the two biological response experiments are similar. Data are shown for mutants B and M, which show the largest decrease in potency, and the parameters are listed in Table I.Figure 3:Dose-response curve for effect of wild-type and mutant IL-5 on the adhesion of eosinophils to ICAM-ZZ coated plates. The cytokines were added at the beginning of the assay, and incubated with 5000 eosinophils/well for 30 min at 37°C. After washing to remove nonadherent cells and medium, eosinophil peroxidase activity of the adherent eosinophils was measured. Data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation and are shown for wild-type IL-5 (○); mutant B (■); and mutant M (+). Data from mutant proteins giving values similar to wild-type are not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding to the Receptor α-ChainIn order to measure the affinity of the mutant proteins for their receptor, all mutants were tested for their ability to compete with wild-type 125I-labeled IL-5 for binding to the IL-5 receptor α-chain immobilized at the surface of scintillation proximity assay beads.2 In this assay, the wild-type protein competes with an IC50 value of 1 nm (Fig. 4). The data were fitted to a single-site model for competition of binding and showed no significant improvement if additional sites were added to the model or if the slope was allowed to vary. The data for the wild-type protein and for seven of the mutants that showed a significant difference from the wild-type activity are shown in Fig. 4 and Table I:, Table II:. The largest changes are for the mutants in the carboxyl-terminal region W110D, R90A, and mutant M (E109A,E113A) where 210-370-fold changes can be seen. The magnitudes of these changes were much larger than those seen in either of the biological response assays used. The only mutants where there was a much larger effect on the potency in the biological response assays than in the receptor α-chain binding assays were the mutant B (K11A,E12A) and the single mutant E12A.Figure 4:Competition of 125I-labeled IL-5 binding to immobilized IL-5 receptor α-chain by wild-type and selected mutants of IL-5. The curves are calculated using the equation for ligand competition from a single site. Data are shown for wild-type IL-5 (○) and for mutants showing a large change in binding affinity: (●), mutant C; (□), mutant D; (■), mutant B; (△), mutant E; (+), mutant M; (×), R90A; and (♦) W110D. Assays were performed at room temperature, and samples were incubated for 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding to the α/β Receptor ComplexMutant proteins that showed a significant deviation from the wild-type response in the TF-I proliferation assay were then tested for their ability to compete with 125I-labeled IL-5 for its binding sites on TF-1 cells, where both the α- and the β-chains of the receptor are present (Fig. 5a,). All data were initially fitted to an equation describing competition from a single binding site. However, in some cases, a better fit to the data was found using a four-parameter logistic equation, and this improvement in fit was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) for mutants D (E28A,R31A), E (H37A,K38A,H40A), W110D, and R90A (Fig. 5b).

In the present study, we have isolated genomic clones comprising the 5′-terminal region of the human prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) gene and identified and characterized the PC1 promoter region. We found multiple transcription start sites located within a 15-base pair region, 205 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon. The promoter region is not G+C-rich and does not contain a canonical TATA box nor a CAAT box. Transient expression assays with a set of human PC1 gene fragments containing progressive 5′ deletions demonstrate that the proximal promoter region is capable of directing high levels of neuroendocrine-specific expression of reporter gene constructs. In addition, the proximal promoter region confers both basal and hormone-regulated promoter activity. Site-specific mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that two closely spaced cAMP response elements within the proximal promoter region direct cAMP-mediated hormonal regulation of transcription of the PC1 gene.

A large number of secretory proteins is initially synthesized as part of larger precursors, which are post-translationally processed into mature bioactive products. This processing requires the activity of a family of endoproteolytic enzymes that has been discovered recently. The responsible enzymes are subtilisin-like serine endoproteases, and endoproteolysis generally occurs at sites consisting of paired basic amino acid residues. Until now, six prohormone- and proprotein-processing enzymes have been molecularly characterized, most of these by cDNA cloning. With respect to tissue distribution, they can be classified into different subclasses. The furin enzyme, which is encoded by the FUR gene, can be considered as the mammalian prototype of this enzyme family. The structure of the FUR gene has been analyzed extensively (see Ref. 1, and references therein). The gene is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, and furin appears to be responsible for the cleavage of precursor proteins within the constitutive secretory pathway(2Bresnahan P.A. Leduc R.

Evidence has been provided that PC1 and PC2 are involved in the tissue-specific processing of prohormones and neuropeptide precursors within the regulated secretory pathway, resulting in the release of mature products from their inactive precursor molecules. For example, PC1 and PC2 are capable of correctly cleaving the multifunctional precursor protein POMC, at distinct pairs of basic residues(11Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G.

Moreover, it has been shown that introduction of PC1 antisense RNA in the pituitary corticotroph-derived cell line AtT-20 results in a decrease of POMC processing(13Bloomquist B.T. Johnson R.C.

Understanding the mechanism governing neuroendocrine-specific expression of the human PC1 gene requires knowledge of the promoter functions of the gene. In our effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying neuroendocrine-specific human PC1 expression, we have cloned and sequenced the 5′-flanking region of the human PC1 gene, identified the transcription start sites, and localized transcriptional control elements. Moreover, the promoter region has been shown to direct neuroendocrine-specific reporter gene expression when analyzed in transfection experiments. The results indicate that tissue-specific expression and hormonal regulation of human PC1 expression is directed through two distinct CREs within the proximal promoter region. A human genomic library in λFixII (Stratagene) was screened with a 32P-labeled probe spanning 309 bp from the 5′-end of the published human PC1 cDNA sequence(18Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M.

The 1324-bp nucleotide sequence of the human PC1 gene (Fig. 1B) containing 0.8 kb of 5′-flanking region, the complete first exon, and part of the first intron was sequenced on both strands using the AutoRead Sequencing and Automatic Laser Fluorescence protocols (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).

Scanning of the putative promoter region for consensus binding sites of transcription factors was done using Signal Scan 3.0 (20Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 113-115PubMed Google Scholar) and Transcription Factor Data Base release 7.3(21Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3117-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A 30-nucleotide primer (PE-1), complementary to nucleotides −162 to −133 relative to the 3′-end of human PC1 exon 1, was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). The 32P-labeled PE-1 was annealed to 20 μg of total RNA from a human lung carcinoid tumor (18Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or to 20 μg of total RNA from human SCLC cell line NCI-H82 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) and extended by SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extension products were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 8 M urea. RNase protection experiments were performed essentially according to standard protocols(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In brief, a genomic fragment, corresponding to nucleotide −288 to −1 relative to the translation initiation codon ATG within exon 1, was subcloned and used as template for in vitro synthesis of antisense RNA probes. The 32P-labeled RNA probe was purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and hybridized to 20 μg of DNase-treated total RNA from a human lung carcinoid tumor. Control for protection specificity was carried out with tRNA. Subsequent RNase A (15 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (150 units/ml) treatment was carried out at 25 or 37°C. The protected products were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel. Total RNA was isolated from AtT-20, β-TC3, and COS-1 cells using the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (22). 20 μg of RNA was size-fractionated through a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Corp.), and hybridized to a human PC1 cDNA probe, according to standard procedures(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The human PC1-luciferase fusion gene expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning into the polylinker of the promoterless, luciferase encoding plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega). The 3′-end of all promoter constructs is at position −1 relative to the translation initiation codon in exon 1. Mutational analysis of the proximal promoter elements was done using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). In both CREs, the central AC dinucleotide core was mutated into a TG dinucleotide. Site-specific mutants were verified by sequencing. AtT-20 pituitary corticotroph cells (ATCC, CRL 1795), β-TC3 insulinoma cells(23Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and COS-1 kidney fibroblasts (ATCC, CRL 1650) were cultured according to the suppliers' protocols. DNAs were purified using anion exchange chromatography (Nucleobond AX, Machery-Nagel, Germany). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were propagated in the prescribed media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using cationic liposomes (Lipofectamine, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each experiment, luciferase activity was determined in duplicate or triplicate wells. The results are expressed as the mean of three to four individual transfection experiments. Cells were harvested at 24 h after start of the transfection, and luciferase reporter enzyme activity driven by the various human PC1 promoter fragments was determined with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Hormonal incubations were performed with cells shifted to serum-free medium 24 h prior to transfection. In studying intracellular cAMP signaling, transfected cells were cultured for 6 h in the presence or absence of 10 μM forskolin (Sigma), an adenylate cyclase activator, and 0.1 mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (Sigma). When indicated, transfected cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10 μM Rp-cAMP (BioLog, Bremen, Germany), a PKA inhibitor, for time periods indicated. CRF was tested at a final concentration of 10 nM or 100 nM. The dopamine agonist bromocryptine (Sigma), was tested at a 1 μM concentration in transient transfection experiments in which the luciferase constructs were cotransfected with a construct expressing the human dopamine D2 receptor(24Grandy D.K. Marchionni M.A. Makam H. Stofko R.E. Alfano M. Frothingham L. Fischer J.B. Burke-Howie K.J. Bunzow J.R. Server A.C. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9762-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Upon screening of a human genomic library with a human PC1 5′ cDNA fragment, three independent clones were isolated and shown to be overlapping by restriction site mapping. These clones cover 16 kb of the 5′-flanking region, the complete first exon, and the 5′-part of intron 1. A HindIII fragment, containing 4.5 kb of the upstream region, exon 1, and part of the first intron, was subcloned for restriction sites mapping and sequencing purposes. Fig. 1A shows a schematic representation of this fragment comprising the 5′-part of the human PC1 gene. Fig. 1B shows the 1324-bp sequence established from this clone. A splice donor sequence, CAG/gtaag, that resembles the consensus (C,A)AG/gt(a,g)ag (25Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) marked the 3′-end of the first exon. Both primer extension and RNase protection studies were performed to determine the transcription initiation sites of the human PC1 gene. Primer extension with primer PE-1 on RNA isolated from a human lung carcinoid tumor, expressing the endogenous PC1 gene (18Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) resulted in multiple specific products (Fig. 2A), as deduced from comparison with the NCI-H82 cell line, which does not express PC1 at detectable levels(18Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These multiple extension products point toward heterogeneous transcription initiation. The majority of the extension products appeared to be derived from transcripts initiated within a 15-bp region, 205 bp upstream of the translation start site. In order to test whether the extension products reflect legitimate transcription initiation and were not derived from stops of the reverse transcriptase due to secondary structure of the target RNA, RNase protection analysis was performed. A single-strand 32P-labeled RNase protection probe, corresponding to nucleotide −288 to −1 relative to the translation initiation codon, was hybridized to human lung carcinoid RNA. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, RNase protection, like primer extension, resulted in multiple protected fragments, with the major products terminating within a 15-bp region at −205 bp 5′ to the translation initiation codon. Minor products with either longer or shorter protected length, were also detected. The results demonstrate that the majority of the human PC1 transcripts originate from transcription starting within a 15-bp region, 205 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon in exon 1 of the human PC1 gene. In conclusion, the results of the RNase protection studies confirm the positions of the transcription initiation sites as observed in the primer extension experiments (Fig. 2). Thus, the first exon of the human PC1 gene consists of maximally 239 bp of 5′-untranslated sequences and contains the first 60 codons (Fig. 1B). Examination of the proximal 5′-flanking region revealed the absence of canonical TATA and CAAT boxes. In addition, the promoter region is not particular G+C-rich. One of the more upstream, although minor, transcription initiation site matches the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase Initiator core sequence, CATTCTGG(26Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), which is indicated as initiator element for TATA-less promoters(27Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Scanning of the proximal region for promoter regulatory elements revealed several potential binding sites for transcription factors (Fig. 1B). In more detail, a CRE consensus sequence (TGACGTCA(28Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar)) and a CRE-like motif containing a consensus CRE 5′-half site (TGACGTgt) are present within a 100-bp region upstream of the transcription initiation sites. A detailed, functional analysis of this region will be presented in the next sections. To test whether the 5′-flanking sequence of the human PC1 gene is capable of directing neuroendocrine-specific gene expression, a fusion gene construct was made, containing 4.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the human PC1 gene fused to the promoterless luciferase gene as present in pGL2-Basic. The resulting construct was assayed for promoter activity by transient transfections into several cell lines, of neuroendocrine as well as non-neuroendocrine origin. As a negative control, the promoterless luciferase encoding plasmid pGL2-Basic was used in parallel transfections of each cell line. In all cell lines tested, transfection of pGL2-Basic DNA resulted in very low, basal activity. As shown in Fig. 3, the highest levels of human PC1 promoter-driven luciferase activity were observed in the AtT-20 pituitary corticotroph cells and in the β-TC3 insulinoma cells. Both cell lines contain high levels of PC1 mRNA (Fig. 4). In contrast, luciferase activity was 10-12-fold lower in the non-neuroendocrine COS-1 cells that do not express PC1. The neuroendocrine-specific expression of the human PC1 promoter constructs suggests that the 4.5-kb 5′-flanking sequence contains signals for directing cell type-specific expression of the human PC1 gene. Sequential deletion of the region between position −4.5 kb and −971 bp had no significant effect on promoter activity (Fig. 3). Additional deletion of the promoter region up to −288 resulted in a 1.8-1.6-fold drop in luciferase activity in AtT-20 and β-TC3 cells. Further reduction of the upstream sequence to nucleotide −224 decreased promoter activity by 5-fold in AtT-20 and β-TC3 cells and 2-fold in COS-1 cells, indicating that the DNA sequence between −288 and −224 contains positive regulatory elements enhancing PC1 expression. In summary, the region between −288 and −1 represents a minimal core promoter that is capable of directing cell type-specific expression of the human PC1 gene.Figure 4:Northern blot analysis of PC1 gene expression.

Exposure time was 2 h at −80°C with an intensifying screen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proximal promoter region contains a consensus CRE (TGACGTCA, CRE-1) between −283 bp and −276 bp and a CRE-like motif (TGACGTGT, CRE-2) 20 bp downstream. Deletion of the proximal promoter region up to −224 bp resulted in a 5-fold drop in promoter activity when assayed in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 3). In order to investigate whether this region could confer cAMP responsiveness on human PC1 gene expression, we have analyzed CRE-1 and CRE-2 in more detail. AtT-20 and COS-1 cells, transfected with the −288 and −224 human PC1 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, were cultured in the presence or absence of forskolin and IBMX for 6 h. In this experiment, the −288 construct showed a specific activation upon incubation with forskolin and IBMX. The human PC1 promoter activity was enhanced 10-12-fold in COS-1 cells and 3-5-fold in AtT-20 cells (data not shown). In addition, complete loss of cAMP-mediated enhancement of PC1 promoter activity occurred when the region between −288 and −224 was deleted, suggesting the involvement of the CRE-1 and CRE-2 in cAMP-mediated transcriptional activation of the proximal human PC1 promoter. To investigate whether the lower activation in AtT-20 cells is due to constitutive, high intracellular cAMP levels and PKA activity, the experiments were repeated with transfected cells that were preincubated with Rp-cAMP, a specific PKA inhibitor. After an overnight preincubation with Rp-cAMP, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium with or without the addition of forskolin and IBMX for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 5, basal, non-induced human PC1 promoter activity of the −288 construct in AtT-20 cells is reduced 3-fold and cAMP-mediated promoter activation in AtT-20 was now 12-14-fold, as high as in COS-1 cells in the initial experiments, in which cells were not preincubated with Rp-cAMP. No reduction of non-induced activity of the −288 construct was observed in COS-1 cells, probably because low basal activity was already present. The activity of the −224 construct is not influenced by the Rp-cAMP treatment, which stresses the importance of CRE-1 and CRE-2 in the cAMP-mediated response. We also tested the −4.5-kb, the −3.5-kb, and the −971-bp constructs for cAMP-mediated activation of transcription. These constructs displayed a similar level of activation upon incubation with forskolin and IBMX. Since 5′-deletion up to −224 bp completely abolished transcriptional activation, the obtained data indicate that cAMP-mediated transcriptional activation is controlled by regulatory elements within the proximal −288 to −224 bp of the human PC1 promoter region. To further pinpoint the exact sites mediating the observed activation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to specifically modify one or both CRE motifs by mutating the central core AC dinucleotide to a TG dinucleotide. In double mutants, this completely abolished cAMP-mediated activation of both the −971-bp and −288-bp constructs (Fig. 6). This is in agreement with the previous observations and indicates that no additional elements in the upstream region between −971 and −288 are involved in cAMP-mediated promoter activation. In addition, mutation of CRE-1 almost completely abolished cAMP-mediated promoter activation in AtT-20 cells (Fig. 6A). However, in COS-1 cells this mutant can still be activated 4-fold (Fig. 6B). A differential effect is also observed when the CRE-2 mutant is tested. This construct displayed a 4-fold lower activation in COS-1 cells, whereas in AtT-20 cells, activation was only reduced 2-fold. This suggests differential regulatory mechanisms acting through the distinct elements CRE-1 and CRE-2 in AtT-20 and COS-1 cells. In order to study hormonal regulation of the human PC1 gene, we subsequently investigated whether CRF is able to activate human PC1 promoter activity in the pituitary corticotroph cell line AtT-20. This is of particular interest, since ACTH is one of the final products when POMC is processed by PC1 and CRF is a well known ACTH secretogogue. Moreover, it has been reported that in AtT-20 cells, PC1 mRNA is coregulated with its substrate POMC(29Bloomquist B.T. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 2014-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Binding of CRF to the adenylyl cyclase-coupled CRF receptor induces intracellular cAMP accumulation, which in turn results in activation of the cAMP-dependent PKA(30Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of Rp-cAMP-preincubated AtT-20 cells, cultured in serum-free medium with or without the addition of 10 nM CRF, a specific 7-fold activation of the human PC1 promoter was observed in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 7A). Upon site-specific mutation of the CRE motifs, activation of human PC1 transcription by CRF was completely abolished as observed in the previous forskolin/IBMX induction experiments. Dopamine is one of the inhibitory factors of PC1 expression in vivo(29Bloomquist B.T. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 2014-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 31Day R. Schäfer M.K.-H. Watson S.J. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this hypothalamic factor, by binding to a specific dopamine D2 receptor, exerts its effect, at least in part, by decreasing intracellular cAMP levels(32Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In line with the proposed mechanism of action of the D2 receptor is our observation that in AtT-20 cells, transfected with the dopamine D2 receptor and incubated with bromocryptine, the luciferase activity driven by the human PC1 promoter is decreased 3-fold to similar basal levels as observed in the previous experiments, in which AtT-20 cells were incubated with the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMP (Fig. 7B). In summary, our data provide the first clue on how transcriptional activity of the human PC1 gene is controlled. Hormonal regulation seems to be exerted via CRE motifs within the proximal promoter region, which also directs neuroendocrine-specific expression when analyzed in transfection experiments. In our effort to define DNA regulatory elements controlling neuroendocrine-specific human PC1 gene expression, we have cloned and sequenced the 5′-terminal region of the human PC1 gene, including 732 bp of 5′-flanking sequences, the complete 419-bp first exon, and 173 bp of the first intron. Using primer extension and RNase protection analysis, we have shown that the human PC1 gene has multiple, dispersed transcription start sites. The majority of the human PC1 encoding mRNAs originates from transcription initiation within a 15-bp region, 205 bp upstream of the translation start codon in exon 1. Primary structure analysis of the upstream sequence reveals the absence of canonical TATA or CAAT boxes. This may explain the observed dispersion of transcription initiation. These characteristics are also found in other neuroendocrine-specific promoters, like the type II sodium channel (33), D1A dopamine receptor(34Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Monsma Jr., F.J. Sibley D.R. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and brain-specific aldolase C(35Vibert M. Henry J. Kahn A. Skala H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding one of the minor transcription start sites of the human PC1 gene is homologous to the Initiator core sequence of the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene. This element is capable of directing the assembly of a transcription initiation complex at TATA-less promoters, resulting in efficient and discrete transcription initiation within the initiator(26Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 27Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this region in the human PC1 gene remains to be established, however, since it appears to constitute only a minor transcription start site. In addition, the 5′-flanking region of the human PC1 gene is not G+C-rich, which is in contrast to the high G+C content of the human PC2 5′-flanking region(36Ohagi S. LaMendola J. LeBeau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Takeda J. Smeekens S.P. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4977-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This difference could be an important factor in the observed differential regulation of PC1 and PC2 gene expression. Recently, the mouse PC1 gene was cloned(37Ftouhi N. Day R. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but no data on promoter activity and its hormonal regulation are available. Sequence comparison of the 5′-upstream region of the human and mouse PC1 genes shows a high degree of sequence conservation. Moreover, the homology of the proximal 5′-flanking region is even higher than the exon 1 sequence conservation, suggesting the presence of promoter regulatory elements within the proximal promoter region. In this paper, we have demonstrated that the 5′-flanking sequence of the human PC1 gene contains a functional promoter, which is highly active in neuroendocrine cells and displays only low activity in non-neuroendocrine cells. Deletion analysis clearly indicated that the core promoter region between −288 bp and −1 bp relative to the translation start codon exhibited substantial neuroendocrine specificity. Similarly, the core promoters of several other genes, such as POMC(38Jeannotte L. Trifiro M.A. Plante R.K. Chamberland M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4058-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), glucagon(39Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), synapsin I(40Sauerwald A. Hoesche C. Oschwald R. Killimann M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14932-14937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (41Bobola N. Hirsch E. Albini A. Altruda F. Noonan D. Ravazzolo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have been shown to direct neuroendocrine specificity. Pituitary-specific POMC gene transcription (42Therrien M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2342-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and α cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene (43Philippe J. Morel C. Cordier-Bussat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have been shown to be directed by the interaction of cell-specific transcription factors with distinct DNA elements within the proximal promoter region. In the present study, we have shown that hormonal regulation of human PC1 gene expression is directed through two distinct CRE motifs, separated by a 20-bp spacer, within the region from bp −288 to −1. In more detail, incubation of transfected AtT-20 cells with forskolin and IBMX, agents known to elevate intracellular cAMP levels, resulted in a 10-12-fold increase of promoter activity. Upon site-specific mutagenesis of both CREs, this activation is completely abrogated. In addition, basal, non-induced promoter activity of these mutants is also substantially reduced to levels that closely correspond to the activity observed when the wild-type human PC1 promoter-luciferase constructs are introduced into COS-1 cells. The importance of the CREs in regulating PC1 gene expression is also stressed by the sequence conservation of the CREs and flanking sequences in mice and man. Various hormones regulate gene expression via a cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway, which in turn modulates the function of transcription factors that bind to CRE motifs in the respective target genes(44Borelli E. Montmayeur J.P. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1992; 3: 321-338PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the presence of CREs within the proximal, TATA-less PC1 promoter is interesting, since evidence has been provided for the involvement of CRE binding transcription factors in recruiting components of the transcription initiation complex to cAMP-responsive, TATA-less promoters, similar to Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation(45Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Of particular physiological importance is our observation that CRF, a potent ACTH secretogogue, enhanced PC1 gene expression through transactivation of the proximal, CRE-containing promoter region. In this context, it is important to note that POMC gene transcription is also enhanced by CRF and that in AtT-20 cells PC1 mRNA has been shown to be coregulated with POMC in response to CRF(29Bloomquist B.T. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 2014-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have also established that dopamine D2 receptor-mediated down-regulation of PC1 promoter activity is mediated through the CREs. Inhibitory control of gene expression by dopamine has also been observed in studies with prolactin promoter constructs(46Elsholz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22919-22925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proper functioning of peptide secreting cells requires coordinate expression of hormone and its respective processing enzyme. The study of regulatory elements in the PC1 promoter will shed light on common regulatory pathways necessary for the functioning of neuroendocrine cells. We are currently characterizing factors involved in the cAMP-mediated regulation of PC1 gene expression. In conclusion, this paper describes the first features of the neuroendocrine-specific human PC1 promoter. Further analysis of the promoter regulatory elements and their binding factors should help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue specificity and hormone-regulated expression of the human PC1 gene.

One mutation (K37E) has been identified in a patient lacking dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity and has been reported previously (Liu, T.-C., Kim, H., Arizmendi, C., Kitano, A., and Patel, M. S.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Circular dichroic and fluorescence spectroscopic data illustrate the role of these amino acids in maintaining the structure and function of human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. While mutant H452Q is severely crippled in catalysis of the physiological reaction, the reverse reaction is affected in the E457Q mutant. The K37E mutant shows very little deviation from the wild-type enzyme.

One mutation (K37E) has been identified in a patient lacking dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity and has been reported previously (Liu, T.-C., Kim, H., Arizmendi, C., Kitano, A., and Patel, M. S.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 90, 5186-5190), while the other two mutations were previously generated specifically to address the role of the active-site base (His-452) and its ion pair (Glu-457). Circular dichroic and fluorescence spectroscopic data illustrate the role of these amino acids in maintaining the structure and function of human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. While mutant H452Q is severely crippled in catalysis of the physiological reaction, the reverse reaction is affected in the E457Q mutant. The K37E mutant shows very little deviation from the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2084815703,"The recognition of lysosomal enzymes by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal-enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase) is mediated by a protein structure on lysosomal enzymes. It has been previously demonstrated that lysine residues are required for phosphorylation of procathepsin L and are a common feature of the site on many lysosomal proteins. In this work, the procathepsin L recognition structure was further defined by identification of the region of the protein containing the structure and the critical lysine residues involved. Removal of the cathepsin L propeptide by low pH-induced autocatalytic processing abolished phosphorylation. The addition of either the purified propeptide or a glutathione S-transferase-propeptide fusion protein to the processed protein restored phosphorylation. Mutagenesis of individual lysine residues demonstrated that two propeptide lysine residues (Lys-54 and Lys-99) were required for efficient phosphorylation of procathepsin L. By comparison of the phosphorylation rates of procathepsin L, lysine-modified procathepsin L, and the procathepsin L oligosaccharide, lysine residues were shown to account for most, if not all, of the protein-dependent interaction. On this basis, it is concluded that the proregion lysine residues are the major elements of the procathepsin L recognition site. In addition, lysine residues in cathepsin D were shown to be as important for phosphorylation as those in procathepsin L, supporting a general model of the recognition site as a specific three-dimensional arrangement of lysine residues exposed on the surface of lysosomal proteins.

Cathepsin L is a cysteine protease that is targeted to lysosomes in mammalian cells via the mannose 6-phosphate recognition system(1Gal S. Willingham M.C. Gottesman M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 2Dong J. Prence E.M. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7377-7383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the acidic environment of the lysosome, it functions as a highly efficient, broad specificity protease involved in degradation of macromolecules delivered to lysosomes by both endocytic and autophagic processes(3Katunuma N. Kominami E. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1983; 22: 71-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L can also be secreted by transformed cells and other cells under a variety of conditions(4Sahagian G.G. Novikoff P.M. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 275-291Google Scholar), and the secreted enzyme is thought play a role in extracellular matrix modification(5Maciewicz R.A. Wardale R.J. Etherington D.J. Paraskeva C. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Yagel S. Warner A.H. Nellans H.N. Lala P.K. Waghorne C. Denhardt D. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3553-3557PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an understanding of the molecular interactions involved in the trafficking of cathepsin L and its regulation has implications for both its intracellular and extracellular functions. Cathepsin L is initially synthesized as a 334-amino acid (39-kDa) precursor containing a 17-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide followed by a 96-amino acid propeptide(7Erickson A.H. J. Cell Biochem. 1989; 40: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The signal peptide allows entry into the endoplasmic reticulum and is cleaved, and the protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation. Within the endoplasmic reticulum, the propeptide plays an important role in the proper folding of the molecule(8Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.-L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The high mannose oligosaccharide on the cathepsin L precursor, procathepsin L, is then phosphorylated by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal-enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. Mannose phosphorylation, the first step in lysosomal targeting, is dependent on recognition of a protein structure on procathepsin L and other lysosomal proteins by the transferase(9Reitman M.L.

Terminal GlcNAc moieties of the resulting phosphodiesters are then removed by the Golgi enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, thereby allowing mannose 6-phosphate receptors to bind and transport the phosphorylated proteins to lysosomes(18Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Once procathepsin L reaches a low pH compartment, its propeptide is cleaved, and the enzyme is activated. A substantial amount of work has been directed toward determining the nature of protein determinants on lysosomal proteins that are recognized by phosphotransferase. Such determinants were originally thought to comprise a common structure shared by mannose-phosphorylated proteins(9Reitman M.L. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11977-11980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a complete definition has not yet emerged, several features of the structure have been described. The Km values for phosphorylation of all lysosomal proteins studied to date, including procathepsin L, are in the low micromolar range (10-20 μM), suggesting that the interaction with the enzyme is similar for all lysosomal proteins (10, 17). Denatured lysosomal proteins are phosphorylated poorly, indicating that the native three-dimensional structure of the protein is important for recognition(9Reitman M.L. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11977-11980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Mutational analysis of cathepsin D and pepsinogen, a nonphosphorylated protein of similar-three dimensional structure, has yielded a considerable amount of information relating to the nature of the recognition site. Initially, a “minimal” site was identified by substituting regions of a glycosylated derivative of pepsinogen with corresponding regions from human cathepsin D(11Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The minimal site, which supported low but readily detectable phosphorylation of glycopepsinogen, was composed of two noncontiguous regions contained within the C-terminal domain of cathepsin D. Several amino acids residues, including lysine, were reported to be required for phosphorylation(11Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis indicated that the site that exists in the native cathepsin D protein is more complex, involving many amino acid residues spread over a large portion of the protein's surface(13Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Components required in the minimal site were not strictly required in the native protein, adding to the apparent complexity of the structure and raising the possibility that cathepsin D may possess multiple recognition sites for phosphotransferase(13Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, N- and C-terminal regions of cathepsin D have been shown to be involved in phosphorylation of both cathepsin D oligosaccharides(14Cantor A.B. Baranski T.J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23357-23363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dustin M.L. Baranski T.J. Sampath D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that lysine residues are a general component of the recognition site on procathepsin L and many other lysosomal proteins(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the nature of the procathepsin L site was further investigated, specifically focusing on the role of lysine residues in the structure. Using an in vitro phosphorylation assay, the proregion of cathepsin L was shown to be absolutely required for efficient phosphorylation of the protein. Two lysine residues within the proregion were found to be responsible for this effect. The contribution of lysine residues to the total binding energy for interaction of cathepsin L with phosphotransferase was determined and found to represent a major portion of the interaction. We also show that phosphorylation of cathepsin D is abolished by lysine modification, as observed previously for cathepsin L and other lysosomal proteins. Taken together, the results suggest that multiple lysine residues are the major determinants for mannose phosphorylation of cathepsin L, cathepsin D, and other lysosomal proteins.

[β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was prepared by the method of Reitman et al.(19Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except that isolation of the labeled product was performed by chromatography with QAE-Sephadex, as described previously(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) used for the preparation was obtained from DuPont NEN. Cathepsin L was isolated from the culture medium of Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by concanavalin A-Sepaharose chromatography and gel filtration as described previously(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine cathepsin D was isolated from bovine testis glycoproteins (20Distler J. Hieber V.

Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 as previously described(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured as described for Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, except that 10% fetal calf serum was used. Procathepsin L was isolated from Kirsten virus-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast medium and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase as described previously(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated protein was repurified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75 in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl. Methods for SNA modification of procathepsin L have also been described(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methods described by the vendor (Pierce) were used for iodination of procathepsin L with IODO-BEADS. The iodinated protein was reisolated by gel filtration through a Sephadex PD-10 G-25M column using 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl. Dephosphorylation of bovine cathepsin D (1 mg/ml) was performed at 37°C for 30 min in 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM HCl using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase at a concentration of 17.4 units/ml. After dialysis against 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, lysine residues of cathepsin D were modified by the addition of 0.5 M SNA in Me2SO to give a final SNA concentration of 20 mM. Me2SO alone was added to a control aliquot of cathepsin D. The modified and control cathepsin D samples were dialyzed separately against 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl. The procathepsin L propeptide was obtained by autocatalytic cleavage of the peptide from the mature portion of the protein. Cleavage was carried out by incubating 375 μg of procathepsin L in 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA for 6 h at 30°C. The propeptide was then purified by reverse-phase HPLC over a Vydac protein C4 column using a 25-40% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over a 90-min time period. The propeptide-containing fractions were identified by 16.5% SDS-PAGE according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow(21Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). As an alternative source, the cathepsin L propeptide was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Cathepsin L cDNA sequences corresponding to amino acids 19-113 were cloned in frame behind the glutathione S-transferase gene of pGEX-5X-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The resulting recombinant encodes a fusion protein in which the propeptide (minus its first N-terminal residue) is tethered to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase by a two-amino acid linker (GI). The sequence of residues attached to glutathione S-transferase is -GIP19KLDQ … LK113, where boldface letters represent propeptide residues. The propeptide residue Phe-21 was converted to leucine as a consequence of the subcloning procedure. The fusion protein was expressed using a 2-3-h isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction period as described previously(22Smith D.B. Cochran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 16.7.1-16.7.8Google Scholar) . The bacteria were lysed with lysozyme/EDTA, and the fusion protein was isolated with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) by glutathione elution. The purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, for use in phosphorylation assays. Procathepsin L (4.7 mg) was dialyzed twice against 4 liters of distilled H2O and lyophilized. The protein was resuspended in 50 μl of distilled H2O; 50 μl of a solution consisting of 1% SDS, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, and 280 μM E-64 was added; and the mixture was heated at 100°C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was diluted to 1 ml with 900 μl of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, and incubated overnight with 50 milliunits of endoglycosidase H. SDS-PAGE analysis of the endoglycosidase H-treated procathepsin L indicated that >95% of the protein had been deglycosylated. Endoglycosidase H was then inactivated by heating the reaction mixture at 100°C for 5 min. The released oligosaccharides were isolated by applying the reaction mixture to a 50 cm x 1-cm column of Sephadex G-50 and eluting with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% SDS. The oligosaccharides were detected by the phenol/sulfuric acid assay for hexoses(23Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41181) Google Scholar), and the oligosaccharide-containing fractions were pooled. The SDS was precipitated from the pooled fractions by the addition of saturated KCl to 10% saturation, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing the oligosaccharides was lyophilized, resuspended in 0.5 ml of distilled H2O, and desalted over a Sephadex G-25M column. In most cases, mannose phosphorylation of protein substrates was carried out as described previously (17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using partially purified UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal-enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase prepared from rat liver as described by Reitman et al.(19Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For experiments involving processed forms of cathepsin L, those reaction conditions were modified to maximize the stability of the proteins. The modified assay mixture contained 1000 units/ml phosphotransferase (15,000 units/mg of protein), 1 μM [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (80 Ci/mmol), 5 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM GlcNAc, 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the acceptor protein in a volume of 25 μl. One unit of phosphotransferase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 pmol of GlcNAc-1-P/h to α-methylmannoside. To prevent cathepsin L from degrading phosphotransferase or itself, 120 μM E-64 was also added to the reaction mixtures. The method described by Reitman et al.(19Reitman M.L. Lang L. Kornfeld S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for analysis of phosphorylated non-phosphotungstic acid-precipitable glycopeptide acceptors was used to compare the phosphorylation of procathepsin L, procathepsin L oligosaccharides, and SNA-treated procathepsin L. Substrates were dialyzed against water, dried down in Eppendorf tubes, and assayed under standard conditions as described previously(17Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the concentration of [β-32P]UDP-GlcNAc was raised to 100 μM (0.8 Ci/mmol). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 2.5 mM UDP-GlcNAc and heating for 5 min at 100°C. Pronase E (2 mg) was added to each sample, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 56°C. The phosphorylated oligosaccharides were applied to columns containing 0.6 ml of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B, and the columns were thoroughly washed with a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0. The concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B matrix was then rinsed out of the columns using 500 mM α-methylmannoside, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mM EDTA, and the amount of 32P-labeled oligosaccharide bound to the matrix was determined by scintillation counting in Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics, Inc.). Cathepsin L activity was determined according to the method of Barrett and Kirschke (24Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) using Z-Phe-Arg-NMec as a substrate. Cathepsin L (0.5-1.0 ng) was added to 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.05% Brij 35, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 μM Z-Phe-Arg-NMec. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 30°C and then terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 M sodium monochloroacetate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.3. The release of free N-methylcoumarin was measured by fluorescence relative to a 0.5 μMN-methylcoumarin standard using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. E-64 titrations to determine the amount of active cathepsin L were also performed as described by Barrett and Kirschke(24Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). The processing of procathepsin L was performed by incubating purified cathepsin L (13.5 μg) in a total volume of 0.1 ml at 30°C for 6 h in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA or for 30 min in a similar solution buffered with 50 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.0. Primers were designed to substitute alanine for lysine residues in the protein. The AAA codons of Lys-20, Lys-157, Lys-212, Lys-233, Lys-294, Lys-313, and Lys-316 were changed to GCA, and AAG codons of Lys-33, Lys-54, Lys-99, Lys-101, Lys-102, Lys-113, Lys-116, Lys-123, Lys-130, Lys-154, Lys-191, Lys-207, Lys-237, Lys-272, Lys-292, and Lys-299 were changed to GCG. The mutations were made in M13mp18-cathepsin L(25Stearns N.A. Dong J. Pan J.-X. Brenner D.A. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which has the cathepsin L cDNA inserted at the BamHI site of the vector. Mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel et al.(26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using a commercially available in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). Mutagenized DNAs were sequenced in the vicinity of the mutation to ensure that the desired changes had, in fact, been made. Mutated cathepsin L cDNAs were excised with KpnI and SalI and transferred to pMT2 (27Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) for expression in COS cells. COS cells were transfected with pMT2-cathepsin L recombinants and labeled using previously published methods(28Kaufman R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured for 60 h prior to labeling and were labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and/or 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate. Unless otherwise indicated, labeling was for 6 h. Immunoprecipitation and 12.5% SDS-PAGE of procathepsin L and procathepsin L lysine mutants were also carried out using previously published methods(8Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.-L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For quantitation of phosphorylation, transfected cells were double-labeled for 6 h with both [35S]methionine and [32P]phosphate, and mutant or wild-type cathepsin L proteins were immunoprecipitated. Unlabeled procathepsin L (4 μg) was added to each immunoprecipitate, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Cathepsin L bands were located by Coomassie Blue staining and excised from the gel. Cathepsin L proteins were extracted from the gel slices by overnight incubation in 1 ml of 1 N NaOH at room temperature. After neutralization with HCl, the amount of 32P and 35S in each band was determined by scintillation counting in Ecoscint A. Conformations of cathepsin L and cathepsin L mutants were probed by limited proteolysis as described(8Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.-L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), except that chymotrypsin instead of trypsin was used. COS cells were transfected with pMT2-cathepsin L or pMT2-cathepsin L mutants and labeled with [35S]methionine for 6 h. Cells extracts containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were treated with 3.3 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 30°C for 1 h with or without prior denaturation by heating at 100°C in 1% SDS. Cathepsin L was then immunoprecipitated with anti-cathepsin L serum, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis. Labeled bands were detected by fluorography. Three forms of cathepsin L were compared with respect to their abilities to serve as substrates for phosphorylation: procathepsin L, pH 5.8-processed cathepsin L, and pH 4.0-processed cathepsin L. The processed proteins were prepared by autolysis at low pH (Fig. 1A), a process known to result in cleavage of the protein at, or very close to, the propeptide processing site between residues 113 and 114(7Erickson A.H. J. Cell Biochem. 1989; 40: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Gel filtration of the pH 5.8-processed form showed that its molecular mass is very close to that of the cathepsin L precursor (Fig. 1B). SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C) indicated that this protein is composed of two polypeptide chains: the catalytic chain (31 kDa) and the propeptide (9 kDa). These results demonstrate that when cathepsin L is processed at pH 5.8, a major portion of the propeptide remains noncovalently bound to the protein. Autolysis at pH 4.0 resulted in a similar proteolytic cleavage; however, gel filtration analysis indicated that the protein was smaller than the precursor and the pH 5.8 form (Fig. 1B). SDS-PAGE indicated the presence of only the 31-kDa catalytic chain (Fig. 1C). Thus, it appears that at pH 4.0, the proregion is released from the protein and degraded. The availability of pH 5.8- and pH 4.0-processed forms of the protein permitted a direct determination of the role of the cathepsin L proregion in mannose phosphorylation. To assay pro and processed forms of cathepsin L as substrates for phosphotransferase, standard reaction conditions were modified to maximize the stability of the processed forms. The reactions were carried out at room temperature at pH 5.8, and bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. When assayed under these conditions, procathepsin L and the pH 5.8-processed protein were phosphorylated, whereas the pH 4.0-processed protein, which lacks the propeptide, was not (Fig. 2B). The levels of phosphorylation of the pH 5.8- and pH 4.0-treated proteins relative to procathepsin L were 104 and 2%, respectively. Mixing experiments showed that phosphotransferase remained fully active in reaction mixtures containing processed cathepsin L proteins, and examination of the reaction mixtures by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining indicated that the processed proteins remained intact throughout the incubation period (Fig. 2C). The proenzyme and the pH 5.8-processed protein were found to be inactive against the synthetic cathepsin L substrate Z-Phe-Arg-NMec, whereas the pH 4.0-treated protein was active. Titration of the pH 4.0-treated protein with E-64, a selective cysteine proteinase inhibitor, indicated that the enzyme was 87% active, and its kcat was estimated to be 28.6 ± 1.7 s-1, which is within the range determined for active two-chain cathepsin L p"

https://openalex.org/W2002931393,"In human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks), are activated within minutes upon stimulation with either chemoattractant formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). This activation of MAPKs coincides with the formation of superoxide anion, which occurs through the activation of a multiple-component NADPH oxidase pathway. MAPKs have thus been suggested to be involved in signal transduction leading to the oxidative burst. To investigate whether MAPK activation plays a central role in the oxidative burst, we evaluated the effect of cAMP on MAPK activation induced by fMLP and PMA. cAMP inhibits many PMN functional responses, including the oxidative burst, and has recently been shown to reduce growth factor- and PMA-induced MAPK activities in a variety of cells. We found that in differentiated, neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, while cAMP reduced PMA-induced MAPK activation, it had no effect on fMLP-induced MAPK activation. Despite the presence of unchanged levels of activated MAPKs, the fMLP-induced oxidative burst was substantially diminished by cAMP. By contrast, O2- production induced by PMA remained the same even though MAPK activation was inhibited. In PMNs, although the levels of O2- induced by either 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml PMA were similar, only 100 ng/ml could stimulate MAPK activation, suggesting that the oxidative burst could occur in the absence of detectable activation of MAPKs.

As a result of ongoing investigations to elucidate the mechanism by which retinol is transferred from plasma into the various cells, two hypotheses have been put forward. One of the hypothesis suggests that the retinol-RBP complex may dissociate in plasma and that free retinol could enter the cell by partitioning into the plasma membrane(3Noy N. Xu Z.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3878-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Fex G. Johannesson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 901: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The alternative hypothesis suggests that retinol may enter the cell subsequent to recognition of the retinol-RBP complex by a cell surface receptor specific for RBP(5Bok D. Heller J. Exp.

In these studies the binding of retinol-RBP has been shown to be saturable and specific. Also a putative RBP receptor has recently been isolated and its cDNA cloned from retinal pigment epithelial cells(11Bvik C.O. Busch C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23035-23042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bvik C.O. Levy F. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20540-20546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data are thus compatible with uptake of retinol in several cell types mainly as a consequence of receptor-mediated interaction with the retinol-RBP complex.The available data suggest that retinol may be released from RBP at two different locations following binding of retinol-RBP to the receptor. In most cells, retinol seems to be released from RBP and channeled through the membrane to cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) located in the cytoplasm while RBP remains bound to the plasma membrane, whereas in other cells the retinol-RBP complex seems to be internalized into the cells by endocytosis prior to the delivery of retinol to CRBP (reviewed in Refs. 1Blomhoff R. Green M.H. Berg T. Norum K.R. Science. 1990; 250: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar and 2Blomhoff R. Green M.H. Green J.B. Berg T. Norum K.R. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 951-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The receptor-mediated endocytosis of RBP has been best demonstrated in liver parenchymal and stellate cells(8Senoo H. Smeland S. Malaba L. Bjerknes T. Stang E. Roos N. Berg T. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Senoo H. Stang E. Nilsson A. Kindberg G.M. Berg T. Roos N. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1229-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Classically, receptor-mediated endocytosis has been considered to take place either through clathrin coated pits or via noncoated pits. Recently, an alternative mechanism called potocytosis has been described for uptake of small molecules such as the vitamin folate (14-18). Molecules taken up by potocytosis are first concentrated in specialized pits, called caveoli, located at the cell surface, which are subsequently invaginated into small vesicles located in the vicinity of the cell surface. The majority of the caveoli recycle back to the plasma membrane and are never transported deeper into the cytoplasm. Both the pits and the vesicles are coated with a protein called caveolin. Another characteristics of the caveoli is their ability to concentrate glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins such as the folate receptor and the enzyme 5′-nucleotidase (14Anderson R.G.W.

There are also specific markers which can be used to identify the organelles. Complementary information may be obtained by using two types of gradient media such as sucrose and Nycodenz. Nycodenz gradients are almost isotonic throughout, whereas in sucrose gradients tonicity varies with the density. Since endosomes and lysosomes are impermeable to sucrose, they loose water in hypertonic sucrose and hence express greater densities than in Nycodenz. In this way organelles not separating in one gradient can be separated in the other.The purpose of the present investigation was to trace the uptake of RBP in liver cells by means of both subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy. In this study we have compared the intracellular transport of RBP with that of asialo-orosomucoid. The latter ligand is taken up in the parenchymal liver cells by endocytosis via the galactose receptor. Thus, asialo-orosomucoid represents an ideal marker for the endocytic pathway of ligands taken up via clathrin-coated pits(19Schwartz A.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and ReagentsMale Wistar rats, weighing 200-300 g, were fed standard laboratory pellet ad libitum.

Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1980; 361: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They were both iodinated indirectly by the covalent attachment of iodogen-iodinated tyramine cellobiose adduct onto free amino groups of the protein(23Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R.

Radioactivity was measured in a Kontron MR252 γ counter.Subcellular Fractionation ProceduresRadioactive labeled ligands were injected into the right femoral vein. At different time points after injection of the ligand, liver lobules were tied off, removed, and immediately chilled in 0.25 M sucrose solution containing 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA.The liver samples were homogenized in a 0.25 M sucrose solution containing 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA, using a Dounce homogenizer(24Kindberg G.M.

A 10% cytoplasmic extract was prepared and layered onto linear Nycodenz (density ranging from 1.05 to 1.18 g/ml) or sucrose (density ranging from 1.10 to 1.24 g/ml) gradients(25Rickwood D. Rickwood D. Properties of Iodinated Density-Gradient Media. IRL Press, Oxford1983: 1-21Google Scholar). The volume of the gradients was 34 ml. The tubes were centrifuged at 85,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 4°C for 45 min (Nycodenz gradients) or 4 h (sucrose gradients). Following centrifugation, the gradients were divided into 18 fractions by upward displacement using Maxidens as displacement fluid. The densities of the fractions were calculated from their respective refractive indices(25Rickwood D. Rickwood D. Properties of Iodinated Density-Gradient Media. IRL Press, Oxford1983: 1-21Google Scholar).In some experiments isolated cells were prepared from the rest of the liver by collagenase perfusion as described previously(26Blomhoff R. Berg T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 58-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were separated by differential centrifugation and centrifugal elutriation and washed twice in 0.25 M sucrose containing 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA before homogenization.Degradation of the labeled ligand was followed by measuring radioactivity in the fractions soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Prior to acid precipitation, 0.5% (w/v, final concentration) albumin was added as a carrier. The distribution of marker enzymes for lysosomes (27Barrett A.T. Dingle J.T. Lysosomes: A Laboratory Handbook. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1972: 46Google Scholar) and plasma membrane (28El-Aaser A.A. Reid E. Histochem. J. 1969; 1: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were determined in each gradient system.Caveolin MeasurementsThe caveolin content of the different subcellular fractions of the liver homogenates were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The different fractions from the sucrose or the Nycodenz gradients were diluted 1:4000 in a 0.1 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The caveolin antibody and the conjugated secondary antibody were used in a 1:1000 dilution.Immunolabeling of Cryosections and Electron MicroscopyRats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and injected with 0.5 mg of human RBP and 3.3 mg of asialo-orosomucoid dissolved in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via the femoral vein. At various times after injection, livers were prepared for ultrathin cryosectioning as described by Griffiths et al.(29Griffiths G. McDowall A. Back R. Dubochet J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and Geuze et al.(30Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Schwartz A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1715-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The rat livers were fixed in situ with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.2 M PIPES (pH 7.4) by a modification of the perfusion fixation method(31Wisse E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1970; 31: 125-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Liver slices were further fixed by immersion in the same fixatives for 1 h, rinsed in 0.2 M PIPES (pH 7.4), and small pieces (1 mm3) from the fixed slices were then immersed in 2.3 M sucrose in O.2 M PIPES for 1 h for cryoprotection, before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Livers of control rats were fixed and prepared by the same procedure. Ultrathin sections of these specimens were cut on an LKB Ultratome V with a cryonova unit at approximately −100°C using improved glass knives(32Stang E. J. Microsc. (Oxford). 1988; 149: 77-79Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33Webster P. J. Microscopy. 1993; 169: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, sections were put on Formvar-carbon-coated copper grids.Indirect immunolabeling was carried out at room temperature. The cryosections were first incubated with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) for at least 15 min to block nonspecific binding of antibody, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 30 min with sheep anti-human RBP diluted 1:100 in 5% NCS. Sections were then rinsed with PBS, incubated with rabbit anti-sheep IgG diluted 1:100 in 5% NCS for 30 min, rinsed, and, finally labeled with protein A-colloidal gold (5-7 nm in diameter) for 20 min. The rinsing buffer contained 0.016 M glycine to quench the free aldehyde groups(34Tokuyasu K.T. Polak J.M. Varndell I.M. Immunolabeling for Electron Microscopy. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 71-82Google Scholar).Cryosections obtained from rats injected with both human RBP and asialo-orosomucoid were used for double labeling(35Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Polak J.M. Varndell I.M. Immunolabeling for Electron Microscopy. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 129-142Google Scholar). The sections were labeled in the following order: 1) sheep anti-human RBP, 2) rabbit anti-sheep IgG, 3) protein A-colloidal gold (d = 5 nm), and then with 4) rabbit anti-human orosomucoid and 5) protein A-colloidal gold (d = 10 nm). As a control for cross-reactivity, we also labeled some sections as follows: 1) rabbit anti-human orosomucoid, 2) swine anti-rabbit IgG, 3) protein A-colloidal gold (d = 5 nm), and then 4) sheep anti-human RBP, 5) rabbit anti-sheep IgG, and 6) protein-colloidal gold (d = 10 nm). Between the two labeling sequences, the cryosections were washed with PBS containing unconjugated protein A (0.05 mg/ml) and 5% NCS to block nonspecific binding of protein A-colloidal gold to free IgG.After immunolabeling, cryosections were stained and embedded in the mixture of 0.3% uranyl acetate in 2% methyl cellulose (36van Deurs B. Petersen O.W. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 117: 131-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) for 10 min on ice and then observed in a JEOL 100-CX electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. In control experiments, sections were incubated with sheep anti-human RBP and the same volume of 0.2 mg/ml human RBP, instead of sheep anti-human RBP alone.The sheep antibody against human RBP was characterized by Western blot analysis. The antibody was monospecific for human RBP, and it did not cross-react with purified rat RBP or RBP in rat serum. Cryosections of liver from control rats showed no positive reaction against sheep anti-human RBP.RESULTSIn order to elucidate the intracellular transport and degradation of endocytosed 125I-TC-RBP by liver cells, we compared the subcellular distribution of 125I-TC-RBP with that of 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid. The receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins by hepatic parenchymal cells has been thoroughly studied both in vivo and in vitro (19). By injecting the two types of labeled ligands simultaneously into the same rat, we could avoid differences due to variations in animals or gradients. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from total liver or isolated cells at different periods of time after injection of 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid. The distribution of acid-precipitable (undegraded) and acid-soluble (degraded) radioactivity and marker enzymes and proteins were analyzed after fractionation by two different kinds of density gradient procedures: isopycnic separation in sucrose gradients and sedimentation velocity separation in Nycodenz gradients. The density distribution of organelles will differ in the hypertonic sucrose gradients and the isotonic Nycodenz gradients. Conceivably, organelles that do not separate in the hypertonic sucrose gradients may do so in isoosmotic Nycodenz gradients (or vice versa).Subcellular Distribution of 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid after Fractionating Whole Liver Homogenates in Sucrose GradientsFig. 1 shows the distribution of radioactivity from 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid, after fractionating the whole liver homogenates in sucrose gradients. Five and 15 min after injection 125I-TC-RBP showed a dual distribution curve in sucrose gradients (Fig. 1, A and B); two peaks were detected at about 1.16 and 1.21 g/ml, respectively. The latter peak increased in size with time after injection, and after 30 and 60 min undegraded radioactivity was detected in only one peak at 1.21 g/ml (Fig. 1, C and D).During the first 15 min after injection of 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid, the radioactivity appeared in endosomes banding in the gradient at 1.09-1.11 g/ml (Fig. 1, A and B). Later (30 min), most of the undegraded ligand still remained in this region, whereas some activity started to appear at 1.20-1.21 g/ml (Fig. 1C), in the same position as acid-soluble degradation products appeared (see Fig. 6). After 60 min, almost all the undegraded ligand appeared in the organelle at 1.20-1.21 g/ml. These results show that radioactively labeled RBP is initially located in organelles which are distinctly different from the light vesicles containing 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid and that the two ligands might, subsequently end up in similar organelles.Figure 6:Localization of degradation products from 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid after fractionation of whole liver homogenates in sucrose and Nycodenz gradients. Sixty min after injection of 125I-TC-RBP (□) and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid (■), livers were homogenized in a 0.25 M sucrose solution containing 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA. A 10% cytoplasmic extract was layered onto linear sucrose gradients (A) and Nycodenz gradients (B), and the tubes were centrifuged at 85,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 4°C for 4 h and 45 min, respectively. Acid phosphatase activity (●) was also determined in each fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subcellular Distribution of 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid after Fractionating Whole Liver Homogenates in Nycodenz GradientsFive min after injection, 125I-TC-RBP was located in vesicles banding at about 1.15 g/ml in the Nycodenz gradients (Fig. 2A). A broad shoulder at slightly lower densities (1.12 g/ml) also appeared. Later (30 and 60 min), undegraded ligand showed a distinct dual distribution in the gradient at about 1.12 and 1.15 g/ml. At all time points studied, large amounts of radioactivity from RBP was detected at the top of the gradients. Since the homogenates were loaded at the top of the gradients, this radioactivity may represent RBP not taken up by any vesicles or RBP attached to structures that do not migrate into the gradient during centrifugation (see later).Figure 2:Subcellular distribution of 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid after fractionating whole liver homogenates in Nycodenz gradients. At different time points after injection (A = 5 min, B = 30 min, and C = 60 min) of 125I-TC-RBP (□) and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid (■), livers were homogenized in a 0.25 M sucrose solution containing 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA. A 10% cytoplasmic extract was layered onto linear Nycodenz gradients, and the tubes were centrifuged at 85,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 4°C for 45 min. The gradients were fractionated and radioactivity determined in each fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2 also shows that 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid is initially associated with endosomes at a density of 1.09 g/ml and, that in addition, from 15 min and onwards is transferred to a heavier organelle at a density of about 1.15 g/ml. These results confirm the data from sucrose gradients that endocytosed RBP and asialo-orosomucoid are initially transported by different routes in the liver cells.Comigration of 125I-TC-RBP with Caveolin and 5′-NucleotidaseThe experiments described above clearly show that endocytosed RBP does not follow the classical receptor-mediated endocytic pathway, which involves internalization via coated pits, transport in early endosomes and late endosomes (or multivesicular bodies) to the lysosomes. Potocytosis may represent an alternative uptake mechanism for RBP. We therefore determined the distribution of the potocytosis markers caveolin and a GPI-anchored protein (5′-nucleotidase) in whole liver homogenates separated in sucrose or Nycodenz gradients. As shown in Fig. 3A, both of the potocytosis markers peaked at about 1.18-1.21 g/ml in the sucrose gradient. In the Nycodenz gradient, both markers peaked at 1.15 g/ml (Fig. 3B). Thus, the distribution of both markers for potocytosis comigrated almost completely with the initial distribution of RBP in both gradients.Figure 3:Comigration of 125I-TC-RBP with caveolin and 5′-nucleotidase. Livers were homogenized in a 0.25 M sucrose solution containing 1 mM Hepes (pH 7.2) and 1 mM EDTA. A 10% cytoplasmic extract was layered onto linear sucrose (A) and Nycodenz (B) gradients, and the tubes were centrifuged at 85,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 4°C for 4 h and 45 min, respectively. The gradients were fractionated, and caveolin (□) and 5′-nucleotidase (■) activities were determined in each fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similarly as for RBP, significant activities of the potocytosis markers were found at the top of both gradients. This activity most likely represent caveolin and 5′-nucleotidase attached to regions of the cell membrane which do not form vesicles during homogenization and would therefore not migrate into the gradient during centrifugation.Uptake of 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid by Different Liver Cells in VivoWith the background that 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid is exclusively taken up in liver parenchymal cells, and from our previous demonstration that 125I-TC-RBP is taken up by both liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells (i.e. stellate cells)(8Senoo H. Smeland S. Malaba L. Bjerknes T. Stang E. Roos N. Berg T. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3616-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we sat out to determine the cellular distribution of RBP in the present experiments. The cells were prepared by collagenase perfusion 15 and 90 min after injection of the ligand. Parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were separated by differential centrifugation and centrifugal elutriation. The results confirmed that RBP was associated with both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells. The nonparenchymal cells (which comprise 35% of the liver cells) were by far the most active cells on a per cell basis, being responsible for 67 and 71% of total uptake after 15 and 90 min, respectively.Subcellular Distribution of 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid after Fractionating Parenchymal and Nonparenchymal Cell Homogenates in Sucrose GradientsTo compare the density distribution of undegraded 125I-TC-RBP and 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid in the whole liver with that of isolated parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells, their homogenates were prepared from the same liver. At 15 min after intravenous injection of the labeled ligands, liver perfusion was started. One liver lobe was removed during the pre-perfusion in Ca2+-free buffer. The rest of the liver was then collagenase treated to isolate the cells. Consequently, at the end of the perfusion and cell preparation, the cells had continued processing the ligands for a further 20-30 min after removal of the liver lobe.The sucrose gradients (Fig. 4) did not show any significant differences in distribution of RBP in whole liver and isolated cells. For whole liver, 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid was mainly found at 1.10 g/ml with some activity in denser regions of the gradient. After isolating the parenchymal cells, the activity was localized mainly in one peak at 1.20 g/ml which corresponded to the lysosomes. The change in distribution of 131I-TC-asialo-orosomucoid was due to the continued cellular processing of the liga"

A panel of eight variants of rPlg was constructed, in which progressively up to 6 basic amino acid residues in the hinge region of rPlg between the NH2-terminal acidic domain (“proactivation peptide”) and kringle 1 were substituted by neutral residues. Analysis of the cleavage rates of these variants by plasmin revealed that the peptide bond at Arg68 is most susceptible, followed by Lys62 and Lys77. A variant with all 6 basic residues substituted was cleaved at Lys20. Three of these variants, PlgB (R68A, R70A), PlgF (R68A, R70A, K77H, K78H), and PlgG (R61A, K62A, R68A, R70A, K77H, K78H), as well as rPlg, were analyzed in more detail. The conformation of these plasminogens was analyzed by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence upon binding of lysine analogs. This revealed that rPlg exhibits the native tight Glu1-plasminogen conformation, whereas PlgB, PlgF, and Plg G display an open conformation similar to Lys78-plasminogen, leading to an increased affinity for lysine analogs. This allowed a direct study of the impact of the activation-resistant conformation on the properties of Glu1-plasminogen. The open conformation of rPlg variants leads to an increased rate of activation by urokinase-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase and increased binding to a fibrin clot. Fibrin clot lysis mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator was accelerated for the variants as a result of a lower Km for tissue-type plasminogen activator-mediated plasminogen activation, resulting from the increased affinity of rPlg (variants) for intact fibrin. We conclude that the basic residues in the extremely plasmin susceptible hinge region of plasminogen are directly involved in maintaining the activation resistant Glu1-plasminogen conformation.

https://openalex.org/W1975572108,"We have studied the effect of several myogenic regulatory factors on the activity of the promoter for a mouse gene encoding a skeletal myosin heavy chain (MyHC) expressed in adult (type IIB) muscle fibers. Co-transfection of myogenic factors is necessary for activity of the IIB promoter in mouse C2 myotubes in culture but not in quail myotubes in culture. Although this promoter contains one E-box within the first 192 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site, mutations in this motif demonstrate that it is not required for the transactivation effect of the myogenic factors. Analysis of other mutants suggests that the MEF2 and MHox DNA-binding factor binds to an evolutionarily conserved AT-rich motif. In addition, the IIB promoter appears to require the conserved TATA motif (CTATAAAAG) in order to be activated by the AT-rich sequences. The IIB promoter constructs produce RNA transcripts which begin at the natural site of transcriptional initiation in quail myotubes and in mouse C2 myotubes after co-transfection with myogenic factors; a second, minor, start site is also used in the co-transfected C2 myotubes. Results obtained after transfection of the mouse IIB promoter constructs in quail myotube cultures suggest that the overexpression of myogenic factors in C2 cultures does not result in an environment in which the control of IIB MyHC promoter activity is aberrant.

The myogenic regulatory factors of the MyoD family possess the unique ability to induce a variety of vertebrate non-muscle cell types to differentiate into muscle (Olson, 1990Olson E.N.

The four myogenic factors, MyoD, myogenin, myf5, and MRF4/herculin (rat/mouse respectively), are expressed at different times of mammalian embryonic and fetal development which suggests that they are involved in specific functions of muscle determination and maturation (Buckingham, 1992Buckingham M.

There are relatively few examples of isolated genes that are expressed principally in mature muscle with which to study the maturational control of gene expression. One such gene is that encoding the adult fast IIB isoform of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC).1( 1The abbreviations used are: MyHCmyosin heavy chainbpbase pair(s)MLPmajor late promoterCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. )Although the physiological and molecular mechanism involved in the activation of this gene are not known, its mRNA appears within the first week after birth in rodents, and this induction requires appropriate levels of thyroid hormone (Russell et al., 1988Russell S.D. Cambon N. Nadal-Ginard B. Whalen R.G J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Russell et al., 1993Russell S.D. Cambon N.A. Whalen R.G. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The proximal, approximately 200 bp of the promoter region of the gene encoding the adult fast IIB MyHC contains six DNA sequence motifs which are highly conserved in evolution (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S.

The genes encoding the rat embryonic isoform and five chicken MyHC proteins are among the other MyHC genes containing these motifs (Kropp et al., 1987Kropp K.E. Gulick J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16536-16545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Bouvagnet et al., 1987Bouvagnet P.F. Strehler E.E. White G.E. Strehler-Page M.-A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Mol. Cell.

The conserved sequence motifs in these different promoters may thus have a common function in the formation of a proximal initiation complex (Roeder, 1991Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) specific to these MyHC genes. myosin heavy chain base pair(s) major late promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. In our previous study of the mouse IIB MyHC gene, various promoter constructs coupled to the CAT reporter gene were transcriptionally active after transfection into quail myotube cultures (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the IIB MyHC promoter was relatively inactive in homologous cultures of mouse C2 myotubes. This unexpected result provided a system with which to search for factors capable of activating the IIB MyHC promoter. Even though MyoD and myogenin are both expressed in muscle cells in culture, we have found that overexpression of any of the four myogenic factors in mouse C2 myotubes modifies the transcriptional specificity of these cells. This modification is detected by the activation of the transfected IIB MyHC promoter. The myogenic factors appear to act through a novel mechanism which does not require a cis-acting E-box but which is nonetheless critically dependent on the precise sequence of the promoter TATA motif. Either the myogenic factors themselves, or other proteins induced by them, seem to interact directly with the basal transcription machinery to allow muscle-specific gene expression. The promoterless CAT vector pCAT-Basic (Promega) was the backbone for all promoter-reporter constructs used in this paper. The IIB MyHC promoter constructs contained 40, 192, and 1430 bp of promoter DNA plus 13 nucleotides of exon 1 (see Fig. 1). An analogous construct containing 192 bp of promoter and 13 bp of exonic DNA was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a cloned fragment of the promoter of the chicken embryonic MyHC gene (provided by Dr. J. Robbins). For the preparation of all mutant promoter constructs reported in this paper, the method of Ho et al., 1989Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar was used. Chimeric promoter constructs were prepared by first introducing a PstI site between positions −40 and −41 bp in the 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter-CAT construct (labeled 192-PstI IIB in Fig. 4). The IIB MyHC core promoter region from positions −40 to +13 bp was removed and replaced with the analogous regions from the adenovirus major late promoter (40MLP) or the human IgH gene (40IgH; see Parvin et al.(1992)). This gave rise to the constructs labeled 192-41 IIB-40MLP and 192-41 IIB-40IgH. Transfections were carried out on subconfluent cultures of C2-18 (a subclone of C2 myoblasts isolated from a culture of C2C12 cells) using the transfection agent dioctadecylamidoglycyl spermine, according to the method described previously (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 2-h incubation in transfection medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and the DNA/dioctadecylamidoglycyl spermine mixture), this solution was removed and fusion medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum) was added to the cultures. Extracts were prepared for the CAT enzyme assay (Seed and Sheen, 1988Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) after 96 h in fusion medium, when the cells were well fused. Proliferating quail myoblasts, stably transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus mutant ts68 (Montarras and Fiszman, 1983Montarras D. Fiszman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3883-3888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected using the CaPO4 precipitation method (Gorman et al., 1982Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Fusion and differentiation were obtained by switching the cells from the viral permissive temperature of 35°C to the nonpermissive temperature of 41°C. All transfections were carried out in 6-cm culture dishes using 2 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of expression plasmid, when co-transfections were performed. For measurement of CAT activity, the expression vector pEMSVscribe containing no cDNA insert was included to establish the control level of vector-derived CAT activity. The myogenic factor MyoD was expressed using the same pEMSVscribe vector containing a cDNA insert, whereas herculin was a mouse genomic fragment expressed from the vector pECE (Miner and Wold, 1990Miner J.H. Wold B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from cells in culture using the guanidine isothiocyanate-CsCl method as described by Auradé et al., 1994Auradé F. Pinset C. Chafey P. Gros F. Montarras D. Differentiation. 1994; 55: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Primer extension experiments were carried out essentially as described by Ausubel et al.(1991) except that actinomycin D was added to a final concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. The oligonucleotide primer used corresponded to the antisense strand of the CAT gene and had the sequence: 5′-ATTGGGATATATCAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG-3′. The elongation reactions were incubated at 42°C for 1 h. The evolutionarily conserved DNA sequence motifs in the promoter region of the mouse adult fast IIB MyHC gene are found within the first approximately 200 bp upstream from the initiation of transcription. They include two AT-rich segments, an extended CArG box, a proximal dodecanucleotide, the TATA box region, and the sequence surrounding the Cap site; these motifs are designated as “myosin” motifs (i.e. mAT, mCArG, mProx, mTATA, and mCap, respectively). The sequences of these six motifs are 95% identical between the mouse IIB and the chicken embryonic MyHC genes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Although the IIB MyHC promoter is relatively inactive in C2 myotubes, we found that co-transfection with any one of the four myogenic regulatory factors of the MyoD family was able to activate IIB MyHC promoter fragments ranging in size from 40 to 1430 bp. This phenomenon is reproducibly observed in spite of the fact that MyoD and myogenin (and to a considerably lesser extent myf5 and MRF4/herculin) are expressed in these myotubes (Montarras et al., 1991Montarras D. Chelly J. Bober E. Arnold H. Ott M.-O. Gros F. Pinset C. New Biologist. 1991; 3: 592-600PubMed Google Scholar). These results are illustrated in Fig. 2A for three constructs, including the 192-bp IIB MyHC fragment which is the most active of all constructs tested. The CAT activities from a large number of transfection experiments are summarized in Table I. Fig. 2A also shows that a 192-bp fragment prepared from the promoter of the chicken embryonic MyHC gene was inactive in C2 myotubes unless co-transfected with one of the myogenic regulatory factors. Thus, this transcriptional activation can be obtained either with the murine or the avian proximal promoter sequences in mouse C2 cells; these observations support the hypothesis that the conserved sequence motifs are involved in this phenomenon.Table I:Activation of three IIB MyHC promoter-CAT constructs after co-transfection with vectors expressing the four different myogenic factors Open table in a new tab The myogenic regulatory factors are capable of binding to DNA sequences found in many muscle-specific genes which contain the consensus motif CANNTG, referred to as an E-box, and which was initially recognized in the immunoglobulin light and heavy chain enhancers (Church et al., 1985Church G.M.

Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). In cell culture systems, these factors are apparently capable of transactivating certain muscle promoters in an E-box-dependent fashion (Buskin and Hauschka, 1989Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell.

Although all four factors are capable of binding to such E-boxes in vitro, MRF4/herculin does not have the same transactivating specificity as the other three (Yutzey et al., 1990Yutzey K.E.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4334-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our experiments, mouse herculin (or rat MRF4; results not shown) is as active as MyoD and myogenin (Fig. 2A). The 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter construct contains one potential myogenic factor binding site, CAGCTG, centered at −63 bp, although the sequence around this motif does not conform well to the 14-bp consensus binding site for the myogenic factors (Buskin and Hauschka, 1989Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this E-box motif is not conserved at this position in any of the five chicken MyHC promoters (Kropp et al., 1987Kropp K.E. Gulick J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16536-16545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Takeda et al., 1992bTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Kahng L.S. Whalen R.G. C. R. Acad. Sci. 1992; 315: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar; see for example Fig. 1). Mutations in the E-box sequence of the IIB MyHC promoter, which are sufficient to abolish myogenic factor binding, did not prevent the activation of the promoter after co-transfection with either MyoD or herculin (Fig. 2B). Thus, the E-box is dispensable for the activation phenomenon observed here, a conclusion supported by the fact that the homologous 192-bp chicken embryonic MyHC promoter (which lacks the E-box) can also be stimulated by the myogenic factors (Fig. 2A). Likewise, the 40-bp IIB MyHC promoter construct, which does not contain the E-box sequence motif, is also significantly stimulated by the myogenic regulatory factors (Fig. 2A and). One of the conserved “myosin AT-rich” motifs (mAT1; see Takeda et al. (1992a)) is however critical for full activity of the 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter construct. We first isolated a mutation in this motif in which a single A residue was changed to a T. This construct was stimulated by the different myogenic factors (Fig. 3A), but only to a level similar to that obtained by the 40-bp core promoter construct (not shown). In order to determine which of the 23 nucleotides making up the mAT1 motif are important for full activity, a series of mutants was constructed (Fig. 3B). It is possible to localize the sequences required for transactivation to a region in the mAT1 motif which conforms to the two consensus motifs previously described for the muscle-specific factor MEF2 and the homeodomain protein MHox (Gossett et al., 1989Gossett L.A.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The mutated nucleotides in the mutD construction fall outside the minimal MEF2 consensus sequence; these flanking nucleotides may also be important for MEF2 binding or, alternatively, may fall within the binding site for an as yet unidentified factor. We confirmed experimentally that these two factors could indeed bind to their putative recognition sites in the adult IIB MyHC promoter by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting.2( 2M. M. Lakich and R. G. Whalen, manuscript in preparation. )Experiments carried out with extracts prepared from myotubes that had been transfected with any one of the four myogenic factors showed no differences in either electrophoretic mobility shift or DNase protection assays. MEF2 is known to be present in saturating amounts in C2 myotubes (Yu et al., 1992Yu Y.-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These various results indicate that not only are the MEF2 and MHox factors present in the C2 myotube cultures that we have used, but that these factors, and probably others, bind to the evolutionarily conserved mAT1 motif. Thus, the transactivation obtained by co-transfection of myogenic regulatory factors along with the IIB MyHC promoter constructs is unlikely to be explained by de novo induction of these mAT1 binding proteins. The 40-bp core IIB MyHC promoter construct (containing the mTATA motif and extending to position +13 of exon 1) can be substantially activated by myogenic factors (Fig. 2A and). The nucleotide sequence surrounding the Cap site shows some similarity to the consensus proposed from the so-called initiator element (Roy et al., 1991Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These sequences do not, however, appear to be essential for activity, since IIB MyHC promoter constructs extending to +3, +8, or +13 in exon 1 give equivalent activity (results not shown). The importance of the IIB MyHC promoter TATA box sequence for the transactivation activity was investigated further. Wefald et al., 1990Wefald F.C. Devlin B.H. Williams R.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar have shown that if the myoglobin TATA box (identical in sequence with that of the mouse IIB MyHC promoter) is converted to the TATA sequence found in the SV40 early promoter, the myoglobin enhancer fails to confer transcriptional activity to the modified promoter. We thus mutated the TATA box of the 40-bp or 192-bp IIB MyHC construct to the SV40 sequence (TATTTAT). This mutation substantially reduced the maximum activity of the IIB MyHC construct when stimulated by myogenic factors (Fig. 4A). In a second set of experiments, we prepared chimeric versions of the 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter construct. A PstI site was introduced between positions −40 and −41 bp (giving the 192-PstI IIB MyHC construct), and the core promoter region of the IIB gene was replaced by PstI-XbaI fragments containing the core region extending from −40 to +13 bp in the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) or in the human IgH gene. These two promoters were chosen because they have been shown to have different requirements for basal transcription factors (Parvin et al., 1992Parvin J.D. Timmers H.T.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). They also have different TATA box sequences although the MLP contains the same mTATA motif as does the mouse IIB MyHC promoter (see Fig. 4, bottom). The results of a series of experiments with these chimeric constructs are shown in Fig. 4B. The constructs containing only the core MLP and IgH promoters were both moderately activated by co-transfected myogenic factors. However, when the region containing the IIB MyHC promoter sequences (from −41 to −192 bp) was incorporated into the chimeric constructs, only the MLP core promoter formed a construct which was as active as the 192-PstI IIB MyHC promoter (Fig. 4B). Because co-transfection of the C2 cells leads to considerable overexpression of the myogenic factors, we investigated the effect of the different IIB MyHC promoter motifs in a different myogenic culture system. Since quail myotube cultures (but not quail myoblasts or fibroblasts) support transcriptional activity of transfected IIB MyHC promoter constructs (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the various mutant constructs in these cultures without co-transfection of myogenic factors. Fig. 5(upper panel) shows that these constructs behave in a way which very closely parallels the results obtained in co-transfected C2 cells (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). The E-box mutations have only moderate or no effect on activity, just as in C2 cells, and the mAT1 mutations within the MEF2 or MHox motifs generally diminish activity. The effect of the SV40 TATA box mutation is quite severe in quail cells, highlighting once again the functional importance of the conserved mTATA motif in the IIB MyHC promoter. Chimeric constructs (Fig. 5, lower panel) likewise behave similarly in quail and C2 cultures: the effect of the SV40 TATA box is severe, and the IIB MyHC sequences can activate the MLP core promoter which contains the mTATA motif. All the results obtained in quail cultures argue strongly that the overexpression of myogenic factors in C2 cultures does not result in an environment in which the control of IIB MyHC promoter activity is aberrant. To further examine the precision of transcription in these two cell culture systems used for the transfection experiments, we performed primer extension experiments on total cellular RNA. Transfection of a mouse muscle creatine kinase promoter-CAT construct into C2 myotubes either alone (Fig. 6A, lane 1) or along with herculin (A, lane 2) gave rise to the correct initiation site in both cases although the level of transcript was higher in the presence of co-transfected herculin. When the 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter-CAT construct was transfected into C2 cells, no transcript was detected by primer extension (Fig. 6B, lane 1). In contrast, when same construct was co-transfected with herculin, the correct initiation site was found to be used predominantly but a second transcript was also observed (B, lane 2), beginning approximately 10 nucleotides upstream from the major transcript produced from the natural start site of the IIB MyHC gene (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This minor, presumably unnatural, transcript may account for some of the residual CAT activity observed with the mutant IIB MyHC promoter constructs when they are co-transfected with myogenic factors in C2 cells. This upstream initiation site is in fact the only one used when the 40-bp core promoter is used in transfection experiments.3( 3T. Diagana, results not shown. )When the IIB MyHC promoter-CAT construct was transfected into cultures of quail myotubes, only one site of initiation was detected (B, lane 3). The results presented here suggest that the formation of an active transcription complex on the IIB MyHC promoter in mouse C2 and quail myotubes is critically dependent on interactions among the proteins binding to the evolutionarily conserved mAT and mTATA sequences. Several types of core promoter constructs (with different types of TATA box sequences) are active in C2 myotube cultures (Fig. 4 and additional results not shown); however, only the core promoter constructs from the IIB MyHC and the adenovirus major late gene, which both contain the mTATA motif (CTATAAAAG), are activated by the mAT-containing IIB MyHC sequences. The fact that the adenovirus MLP core promoter region can substitute for the IIB MyHC core sequences to allow transactivation of the chimeric construct (Fig. 4B (C2 myotubes) and 5B (quail myotubes)) provides strong evidence that the mTATA motif plays a major direct role in modulating the formation of an active transcriptional initiation complex involving the promoter elements specific to the IIB MyHC promoter. However, another novel and unexpected feature is required in order for productive interactions to take place between the mAT and mTATA motifs which seem to be so crucial for transcriptional activity of the IIB MyHC promoter. Our data demonstrate clearly that the expression of at least one of the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD, myogenin, myf5, or MRF4/herculin, is necessary for the transactivation of the IIB MyHC promoter although, surprisingly, no E-box sequence is needed to bind the myogenic factors to the IIB MyHC promoter DNA sequences. Other muscle-specific promoters such as those controlling the embryonic skeletal MyHC, β/slow-MyHC, MLC2, TN-C, or myoglobin genes demonstrate transcriptional activity in myotubes in culture and yet do not require E-box motifs (Bouvagnet et al., 1987Bouvagnet P.F.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the autonomous activity of these promoters in C2 myotubes is in direct contrast to the inactivity of the IIB MyHC promoter in the absence of exogenous myogenic factors. Thus, there would seem to be three classes of muscle promoters revealed by cell culture transfection experiments: those requiring cis-acting E-boxes for activity, those which rely on other sequence elements and which are normally active in myogenic cultures, and the currently unique example of the adult-fast IIB MyHC promoter which becomes active in C2 myotubes only following overexpression of myogenic factors but which does not require a cis-acting E-box. We cannot of course exclude that this proximal E-box is required for interaction with a more distal enhancer such has been shown in the case of the desmin promoter (Li and Capetanaki, 1994Li H. Capetanaki Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3580-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In principle, several different explanations could account for our results, and we will discuss three here. First, the overexpressed myogenic factors could titrate an inhibitor of IIB MyHC promoter transcription by dimerization through the HLH motif. However, neither AP4, another HLH protein, nor a non-myogenic mutant of myogenin (in which the basic domain is replaced by that of E12; Chakraborty and Olson, 1991Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6103-6108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can activate the IIB MyHC promoter (results not shown). It is also unlikely that any inhibitor could function by binding specifically to the E-box motif in the proximal promoter region since mutation of this E-box does not lead to up-regulation of the transfected promoter (Fig. 2). A second explanation could be that the myogenic factors themselves participate directly in the transcriptional initiation complex via protein-protein interactions simply because their concentrations are increased by overexpression in the co-transfected cultures. If this were the mechanism of activation, it could explain why the E-box of the IIB MyHC promoter is unnecessary. In order to bring endogenous myogenic factors close to the promoter sequence, we made IIB MyHC promoter constructs in which the MCK enhancer (containing two E-boxes; Lassar et al., 1989Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar and Gossett et al., 1989Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 8: 5022-5033Crossref Scopus (449) Google Scholar) or the 4R motif (containing four copies of the high affinity MCK E-box; Weintraub et al., 1990Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) were placed either 3′ or 5′ of the 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter-CAT sequences. The MCK enhancer and the 4R motif have both been shown to be capable of conferring myogenic factor-dependent activity on certain basal promoters due to their ability to bind myogenic factors. None of these modified IIB MyHC constructs demonstrated any increased activity in C2 myotubes; overexpression of the myogenic factors was still required to activate all the constructs to the same levels as the unmodified 192-bp IIB MyHC promoter construct (data not shown). Even the 1430-bp IIB MyHC promoter construct, which contains a MyoD binding site centered at −942 bp in its natural context (Takeda et al., 1992aTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Whalen R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16957-16967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), still requires transfected myogenic factors for activation in C2 myotubes (Fig. 2A and Table I). Thus, activation of the IIB MyHC promoter cannot be obtained in these cells even if the endogenous myogenic factors are directed to the IIB MyHC promoter DNA using these E-box sites or E-box-containing myogenic enhancer sequences. The simple presence of an E-box within or near the promoter is not sufficient, and the role of the myogenic factors must therefore be explained by some novel mechanism. Although a direct involvement of myogenic factors in the initiation complex remains a possibility, a third explanation invokes the participation of other transcription factors. Overexpression of myogenic factors in the environment of the differentiated myotube might thus induce factors other than bHLH proteins which are critical for the activity of the adult IIB MyHC promoter in these cells. This induction might primarily require high levels of the myogenic factors per se. Their overexpression could also lead to a secondary increase in the levels of the functionally active heterodimers of the myogenic factors and their partners such as E12 (Davis et al., 1990Davis R.L. Cheng P.-F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar; Lassar et al., 1991Lassar A. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar; Chakraborty and Olson, 1991Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6103-6108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, the myogenic factors would be inducing a new phenotype in the C2 cells if they act in this indirect way. This new, possibly developmentally more mature phenotype is detected in the present study by the ability of the myotubes to actively transcribe the adult fast IIB MyHC promoter. The induction by myogenic factors of a new transcriptional specificity not normally present in the myotube cultures is formally equivalent to the induction of the myogenic program by these factors in non-muscle cells. Based on the above considerations, we can propose the following working hypothesis for the protein-DNA interactions required for the formation of an active transcriptional initiation complex on the IIB MyHC promoter in both co-transfected C2 or quail myotubes. Either MEF2, or MHox, or both, bind to their recognition sequences found within the conserved mAT motifs. In the core promoter region, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) would interact with the mTATA motif and with other TBP-associated factors or TAFs (Roeder, 1991Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar; Greenblatt, 1992Greenblatt J. Nature. 1992; 360: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This large TFIID complex (Mr = 500-800,000; Meisterernst and Roeder(1992) and Timmers and Sharp, 1992Timmers H.Th.M. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 5: 1946-1956Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) may contain specific TAFs found only in differentiated myotubes or muscle fibers. Our results thus suggest that the factors binding to core promoter elements, notably the evolutionarily conserved mTATA motif (Takeda et al., 1992bTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Kahng L.S. Whalen R.G. C. R. Acad. Sci. 1992; 315: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar), are involved in determining MyHC-specific gene expression. In addition, any one of the four myogenic regulatory factors is required in order for productive interactions to occur among all the protein components bound to the IIB MyHC promoter DNA through the mAT and mTATA motifs. A cis-acting E-box is not required within the IIB MyHC promoter since the effect of the myogenic factors seems to act either directly via protein-protein interactions or indirectly via the induction of other genes. Thus, even though the mAT and mTATA motifs and the proteins that bind to them are important cis- and trans-acting elements, a function provided by the myogenic regulatory factors is critical for the induction of an active MyHC-specific transcriptional initiation complex. The observations presented here arose from the fact that the mouse adult fast IIB MyHC promoter is inactive in mouse C2 myotubes, and we were thus able to demonstrate the existence of a novel transcriptional stimulatory effect of the myogenic regulatory factors in differentiated, albeit immature, muscle cells. It is possible that the observed promoter activation applies only to certain skeletal muscle MyHC genes (Takeda et al., 1992bTakeda S. North D.L. Lakich M.M. Russell S.D. Kahng L.S. Whalen R.G. C. R. Acad. Sci. 1992; 315: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar), but, if so, then the mechanism has been conserved over several hundred million years since the chicken embryonic MyHC promoter is apparently subject to the same type of activation. Alternatively, the fact that we were able to detect such a phenomenon using a promoter for what is clearly an adult-specific gene may suggest that we have uncovered a mechanism that is used for obtaining high level expression of many genes in mature muscle fibers. Whatever the explanation for this novel transcriptional phenomenon, our results argue strongly for the existence of a mechanism by which the myogenic regulatory factors can influence muscle promoter activity independently of a cis-acting DNA binding site. Further support of these interpretations will require understanding the meaning of any minor transcription initiation events Nonetheless, the involvement of the conserved mTATA motif in this phenomenon suggests that, along with the myogenic regulatory factors, the core promoter elements and the proteins such as TBP and TAFs that bind directly to them may play a previously unsuspected role in determining muscle-specific gene expression. We are very grateful to H. Arnold, S. Konieczny, A. Lassar, J. Miner, E. Olson, J. Robbins, and W. Wright for generously providing expression vectors for the myogenic factors and other plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2079069988,"We investigated both conformational changes in the junctional foot protein (JFP) and Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in parallel after stimulation of triadic vesicles by the JFP-specific ligand, polylysine. To monitor protein conformational change, the JFP was labeled in a site-directed fashion with the fluorescent conformational probe methylcoumarin acetate (MCA) (Kang, J.

The induction of SR Ca2+ release by polylysine produced a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity of the JFP-bound MCA. The polylysine concentration dependence of the fluorescence change was essentially the same as that of Ca2+ release, suggesting that the two events are tightly coupled. However, the rate constant of MCA fluorescence change was much larger than that of Ca2+ release; i.e. the conformational change preceded Ca2+ release. Prevention of protein conformational change by lysine (0.2 M) inhibited Ca2+ release from SR. Inhibition of Ca2+ release by Mg2+ (5 mM), however, had little effect on the conformational change. These results suggest that binding of polylysine to the JFP produces conformational changes in the protein, which in turn activates the Ca2+ channel, leading to Ca2+ release from the SR.

The time course for inactivation most closely correlates with labeling of the A subunit.

The A subunit is labeled upon modification of both rapidly and slowly exchangeable sites whereas the B subunit is labeled upon modification of only rapidly exchangeable sites. Inhibition of V-ATPase activity correlates with labeling of the rapidly exchangeable sites. Amino acid sequence analysis of peptides derived from the 2-azido-[32P]ATP-labeled A subunit indicates labeling of two peptides: a 12-kDa fragment which begins at residue 511 and contains Cys532 and a 3-kDa fragment which begins at residue 233 and contains the glycine-rich loop and Cys254. Only the 12-kDa fragment is labeled upon modification of the rapidly exchangeable sites. A 12-kDa V8 peptide, which begins at residue 375 of the B subunit is also labeled by 2-azido-[32P]ATP under conditions which modify the rapidly exchangeable sites.

Both of these categories of tyrosine kinases are presumed to be critical players in the process of antigen-mediated signal transduction. Cross-linking of membrane immunoglobulin on the surface of B cells leads to the activation of Lyn, Fyn, and Blk, which presumably associate with the cytoplasmic tails of the membrane immunoglobulin-associated Igα/β heterodimer.

INTRODUCTIONMembrane immunoglobulins along with the associated Igα/β heterodimer and one or more Src family kinases constitute the B lymphocyte antigen receptor (Reth, 1992Reth M. Annu. Rev.

Four Src family tyrosine kinases, Lyn, Fyn, Lck, and Blk, have been demonstrated to be associated with the antigen receptor (Burkhardt et al., 1991Burkhardt A.L. Brunswick M. Bolen J.R. Mond J.J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2315-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and it is likely that they associate with the cytoplasmic tails of the Mb-1 and B29 proteins that constitute the Igα/β heterodimer (Clark et al., 1992Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition to the Src family kinases, Syk, a tyrosine kinase with tandem SH2 domains, has also been reported to be associated with the antigen receptor. Although initial studies suggested that Syk was constitutively associated with this receptor (Hutchcroft et al., 1992Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), growing evidence suggests that this tyrosine kinase is recruited to the receptor by receptor cross-linking (Law et al., 1993Law D.A. Chan V.W.F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 645-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 1994). Syk has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to antigen receptor ligation, and this modification has been correlated with an increase in catalytic activity of this kinase (Yamada et al., 1993Yamada T. Taniguchi T. Yang C. Yasue S. Saito H. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies on chicken B cells have suggested that Src family kinases might cooperate with Syk in signal transduction and that, at least in B cells of this species, Lyn and Syk are both essential components of the signaling machinery (Takata et al., 1994Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). ZAP 70, a tyrosine kinase that is structurally analogous to Syk, is recruited to the antigen receptor in T cells upon T cell receptor ligation (Chan et al., 1991Chan A.C. Irving B. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9166-9170Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 1992). Although it appears likely that ZAP 70 in activated T cells binds to phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the ζ chain, the mechanism by which Syk might interact with the antigen receptor in B cells remains largely unknown. The recruitment of Syk in activated B cells may well reflect its association with tyrosine-phosphorylated ARH11( 1The abbreviations used are: ARH1antigen receptor homology 1GSTglutathione S-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. )(antigen receptor homology 1) motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and β. Alternatively, Syk might interact with receptor-associated Src family kinases. Functional interactions between Src family kinases and Syk have been demonstrated (Kurosaki et al., 1994Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) but little is known about the structural basis for this type of physical interaction.Another tyrosine kinase relevant to B cell signaling is Bruton's tyrosine kinase. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase gene is known to be defective in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Tsukada et al., 1993Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O. Allen R.C. Klisak I. Sparkes R.S.

We and others have recently demonstrated that Bruton's tyrosine kinase is tyrosine phosphorylated and catalytically activated when the B cell receptor is cross-linked (Aoki et al., 1994aAoki Y.

Isselbacher K.J. Pillai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10606-10609Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Bruton's tyrosine kinase represents a third category of tyrosine kinase that is involved B cell receptor- and pre-B receptor-mediated signaling. It remains unclear whether these three categories of tyrosine kinases are arranged in a hierarchical cascade. The mechanisms by which these enzymes cooperate and interact with one another during antigen receptor-mediated signaling are clearly of great interest.Recent studies examining receptor-ligated B cells (Malek and Desiderio, 1993Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22557-22665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Aoki et al., 1994bAoki Y. Isselbacher K.J. Cherayil B.J. Pillai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4204-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have revealed a number of proteins that bind to the SH2 domains of B cell receptor-associated Src family kinases. We provide evidence that one of the Blk/Fyn/Lyn SH2-binding proteins found in lysates of antigen receptor-ligated B cells is the Syk kinase. These results provide a structural basis for Syk-Src family kinase interactions that occur in activated B cells and for the previously observed functional interaction of Syk with Src family kinases.DISCUSSIONA number of proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated and can be visualized bound to the SH2 domains of Blk, Lyn, and Fyn following B cell activation. We have demonstrated here that one of these proteins is the tandem SH2 domain containing Syk kinase. B cell activation has been previously demonstrated to be responsible for both the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and its concomitant increase in catalytic activity. Either or both of these linked events could account for the increased detectability of Syk eluted from Blk-SH2 fusion proteins in receptor-ligated B cells. We have also demonstrated that in activated B cells Syk binds to the Lyn and Blk Src family kinases.These results raise the possibility that during B lymphocyte activation, Syk may be recruited to the antigen receptor by a direct interaction with Src family kinases such as Blk, which in turn are associated with the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and Igβ. However, studies examining the interaction between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated ARH1 motif-based peptides with Src family kinases suggest that although nonphosphorylated ARH1 peptides can associate with the N termini of these kinases, phosphorylated peptides preferentially associate with the SH2 domains of these enzymes (Clark et al., 1994Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; Pleiman et al., 1994Pleiman C.M. Abrams C. Gauen L.T. Bedzyk W. Jongstra J. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4268-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is unlikely that an Src family kinase bridges the association of Syk with the antigen receptor in receptor-ligated cells (in which the ARH1 motifs of Igα and Igβ are tyrosine-phosphorylated). If some, relatively low level, tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk occurs in resting B cells it is conceivable that the association of Syk with antigen receptor in these cells (Hutchcroft et al., 1992Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Yamada et al., 1993Yamada T. Taniguchi T. Yang C. Yasue S. Saito H. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) might perhaps depend on a bridging role played by an Src family kinase. It is perhaps more likely that, in analogy to a model proposed to explain the interaction of activated ZAP 70 with Lck and the T cell receptor ζ chain (Duplay et al., 1994Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), B cell receptor ligation may initially lead to the phosphorylation of tyrosines in the ARH1 motifs (probably by Src family kinases) of the α/β heterodimer. This event may be followed by the subsequent recruitment of Syk to the phosphotyrosines in these motifs, followed by an interaction of activated Blk (or other Src family kinases) with receptor-bound Syk. Syk has been demonstrated to be recruited, in an activated B cell line, by chimeric proteins expressing the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and β individually (Law et al., 1993Law D.A. Chan V.W.F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 645-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In these studies, lysates made using detergents that destabilized the association of Lyn or Fyn with the α/β cytoplasmic tails did not affect the binding of these α/β tails to Syk. However, no direct interaction between Syk and these fusion proteins was actually demonstrated. We believe that models that suggest that Syk in activated cells binds to ARH1 motifs through its own tandem SH2 domains and also binds to Src family kinases via the SH2 domains of the latter should be given serious consideration. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that once B cells are activated, the SH2 domains of Src family kinases may associate with phosphotyrosines in the ARH1 motifs; competition between the tandem SH2-containing Syk kinase and Src family kinases for the ARH1 motif binding sites may be relevant in vivo.Src family kinases have been postulated to play a critical role in the interaction of ZAP 70 with the T cell receptor ζ chain (Chan et al., 1992Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar; Iwashima et al., 1993Iwashima M. Irving B. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1993; 263: 1136-1139Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar; Duplay et al., 1994Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether all four Src family kinases associated with the B cell antigen receptor actually play a role in signal transduction. The possibility that distinct Src family kinases may play distinguishable roles at different stages of B cell differentiation remains to be explored. Of these kinases, Blk is the only one that is B lineage-specific in its expression (Dymecki et al., 1990Dymecki S.M. Niederhuber J.E. Desiderio S.V. Science. 1990; 247: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Some evidence exists to suggest that Blk may play a functional role in immature B cells (Yao and Scott, 1993Yao X.-R. Scott D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7946-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the issue of functional redundancy of these kinases remains to be addressed systematically.How is Syk catalytically activated following B cell receptor ligation? It has been demonstrated that Src family kinases are activated in the 1st min after receptor ligation, while the catalytic activation of Syk peaks about 5 min later (Saouaf et al., 1994Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). There are two potential models that could readily be invoked to explain how Syk might require Src family kinase activity for activation. In both models Src family kinases may be activated by cross-linking and transphosphorylation, and this event may lead to the phosphorylation of ARH1 motifs and the recruitment of Syk. In the recruitment-activation model, merely recruiting Syk to cross-linked receptors may lead to its transphosphorylation either by neighboring Syk molecules or by Src family kinases. In the cooperative-activation model, recruitment of Syk may bring these two categories of tyrosine kinases generally close to one another, but the actual activation of Syk depends upon the formation of a complex between Src family kinases and Syk. The enhancement of Syk kinase activity by Lyn and Fyn, when these genes are overexpressed in transfected COS cells (Kurosaki et al., 1994Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), supports the notion of a functional basis for the interaction of Src family kinases with Syk during B cell signaling. Indeed, our data demonstrating the association of Src family kinases and Syk in activated B cells and a recent report from Sidorenko et al., 1995Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Chandran K.A. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, also demonstrating Src family kinase Syk interactions in B cells, may relate to cooperative interactions between these two categories of kinases during B cell activation. Although the molecular basis for the in vivo interaction of Syk and Src family kinases has not been previously elucidated, our results presented here may provide a structural basis for how this interaction actually occurs. INTRODUCTIONMembrane immunoglobulins along with the associated Igα/β heterodimer and one or more Src family kinases constitute the B lymphocyte antigen receptor (Reth, 1992Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Cambier et al., 1993Cambier J.C. Bedzyk W. Campbell K. Chien N. Friedrich J. Harwood A. Jensen W. Pleiman C. Clark M.C. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 85-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Four Src family tyrosine kinases, Lyn, Fyn, Lck, and Blk, have been demonstrated to be associated with the antigen receptor (Burkhardt et al., 1991Burkhardt A.L. Brunswick M. Bolen J.R. Mond J.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar; Yamanashi et al., 1991Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T. Mizuguchi J. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2315-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and it is likely that they associate with the cytoplasmic tails of the Mb-1 and B29 proteins that constitute the Igα/β heterodimer (Clark et al., 1992Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition to the Src family kinases, Syk, a tyrosine kinase with tandem SH2 domains, has also been reported to be associated with the antigen receptor. Although initial studies suggested that Syk was constitutively associated with this receptor (Hutchcroft et al., 1992Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), growing evidence suggests that this tyrosine kinase is recruited to the receptor by receptor cross-linking (Law et al., 1993Law D.A. Chan V.W.F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 645-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 1994). Syk has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to antigen receptor ligation, and this modification has been correlated with an increase in catalytic activity of this kinase (Yamada et al., 1993Yamada T. Taniguchi T. Yang C. Yasue S. Saito H. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies on chicken B cells have suggested that Src family kinases might cooperate with Syk in signal transduction and that, at least in B cells of this species, Lyn and Syk are both essential components of the signaling machinery (Takata et al., 1994Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). ZAP 70, a tyrosine kinase that is structurally analogous to Syk, is recruited to the antigen receptor in T cells upon T cell receptor ligation (Chan et al., 1991Chan A.C. Irving B. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9166-9170Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 1992). Although it appears likely that ZAP 70 in activated T cells binds to phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the ζ chain, the mechanism by which Syk might interact with the antigen receptor in B cells remains largely unknown. The recruitment of Syk in activated B cells may well reflect its association with tyrosine-phosphorylated ARH11( 1The abbreviations used are: ARH1antigen receptor homology 1GSTglutathione S-transferasePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. )(antigen receptor homology 1) motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and β. Alternatively, Syk might interact with receptor-associated Src family kinases. Functional interactions between Src family kinases and Syk have been demonstrated (Kurosaki et al., 1994Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) but little is known about the structural basis for this type of physical interaction.Another tyrosine kinase relevant to B cell signaling is Bruton's tyrosine kinase. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase gene is known to be defective in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Tsukada et al., 1993Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O. Allen R.C. Klisak I. Sparkes R.S.

A point mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of this kinase (seen in Xid mice; Thomas et al., 1993Thomas J.D. Sideras P. Smith C.I.E. Vorechovsky I. Chapman V. Paul W.E.

We and others have recently demonstrated that Bruton's tyrosine kinase is tyrosine phosphorylated and catalytically activated when the B cell receptor is cross-linked (Aoki et al., 1994aAoki Y.

Isselbacher K.J. Pillai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10606-10609Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Bruton's tyrosine kinase represents a third category of tyrosine kinase that is involved B cell receptor- and pre-B receptor-mediated signaling. It remains unclear whether these three categories of tyrosine kinases are arranged in a hierarchical cascade. The mechanisms by which these enzymes cooperate and interact with one another during antigen receptor-mediated signaling are clearly of great interest.Recent studies examining receptor-ligated B cells (Malek and Desiderio, 1993Malek S.N.

We provide evidence that one of the Blk/Fyn/Lyn SH2-binding proteins found in lysates of antigen receptor-ligated B cells is the Syk kinase. These results provide a structural basis for Syk-Src family kinase interactions that occur in activated B cells and for the previously observed functional interaction of Syk with Src family kinases.

We provide evidence that one of the Blk/Fyn/Lyn SH2-binding proteins found in lysates of antigen receptor-ligated B cells is the Syk kinase. These results provide a structural basis for Syk-Src family kinase interactions that occur in activated B cells and for the previously observed functional interaction of Syk with Src family kinases. DISCUSSIONA number of proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated and can be visualized bound to the SH2 domains of Blk, Lyn, and Fyn following B cell activation. We have demonstrated here that one of these proteins is the tandem SH2 domain containing Syk kinase. B cell activation has been previously demonstrated to be responsible for both the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and its concomitant increase in catalytic activity. Either or both of these linked events could account for the increased detectability of Syk eluted from Blk-SH2 fusion proteins in receptor-ligated B cells. We have also demonstrated that in activated B cells Syk binds to the Lyn and Blk Src family kinases.These results raise the possibility that during B lymphocyte activation, Syk may be recruited to the antigen receptor by a direct interaction with Src family kinases such as Blk, which in turn are associated with the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and Igβ. However, studies examining the interaction between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated ARH1 motif-based peptides with Src family kinases suggest that although nonphosphorylated ARH1 peptides can associate with the N termini of these kinases, phosphorylated peptides preferentially associate with the SH2 domains of these enzymes (Clark et al., 1994Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; Pleiman et al., 1994Pleiman C.M. Abrams C. Gauen L.T. Bedzyk W. Jongstra J. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4268-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is unlikely that an Src family kinase bridges the association of Syk with the antigen receptor in receptor-ligated cells (in which the ARH1 motifs of Igα and Igβ are tyrosine-phosphorylated). If some, relatively low level, tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk occurs in resting B cells it is conceivable that the association of Syk with antigen receptor in these cells (Hutchcroft et al., 1992Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Yamada et al., 1993Yamada T. Taniguchi T. Yang C. Yasue S. Saito H. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) might perhaps depend on a bridging role played by an Src family kinase. It is perhaps more likely that, in analogy to a model proposed to explain the interaction of activated ZAP 70 with Lck and the T cell receptor ζ chain (Duplay et al., 1994Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), B cell receptor ligation may initially lead to the phosphorylation of tyrosines in the ARH1 motifs (probably by Src family kinases) of the α/β heterodimer. This event may be followed by the subsequent recruitment of Syk to the phosphotyrosines in these motifs, followed by an interaction of activated Blk (or other Src family kinases) with receptor-bound Syk. Syk has been demonstrated to be recruited, in an activated B cell line, by chimeric proteins expressing the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and β individually (Law et al., 1993Law D.A. Chan V.W.F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 645-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In these studies, lysates made using detergents that destabilized the association of Lyn or Fyn with the α/β cytoplasmic tails did not affect the binding of these α/β tails to Syk. However, no direct interaction between Syk and these fusion proteins was actually demonstrated. We believe that models that suggest that Syk in activated cells binds to ARH1 motifs through its own tandem SH2 domains and also binds to Src family kinases via the SH2 domains of the latter should be given serious consideration. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that once B cells are activated, the SH2 domains of Src family kinases may associate with phosphotyrosines in the ARH1 motifs; competition between the tandem SH2-containing Syk kinase and Src family kinases for the ARH1 motif binding sites may be relevant in vivo.Src family kinases have been postulated to play a critical role in the interaction of ZAP 70 with the T cell receptor ζ chain (Chan et al., 1992Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar; Iwashima et al., 1993Iwashima M. Irving B. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A.

It is unclear whether all four Src family kinases associated with the B cell antigen receptor actually play a role in signal transduction. The possibility that distinct Src family kinases may play distinguishable roles at different stages of B cell differentiation remains to be explored. Of these kinases, Blk is the only one that is B lineage-specific in its expression (Dymecki et al., 1990Dymecki S.M. Niederhuber J.E. Desiderio S.V. Science. 1990; 247: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Some evidence exists to suggest that Blk may play a functional role in immature B cells (Yao and Scott, 1993Yao X.-R. Scott D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7946-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the issue of functional redundancy of these kinases remains to be addressed systematically.How is Syk catalytically activated following B cell receptor ligation? It has been demonstrated that Src family kinases are activated in the 1st min after receptor ligation, while the catalytic activation of Syk peaks about 5 min later (Saouaf et al., 1994Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). There are two potential models that could readily be invoked to explain how Syk might require Src family kinase activity for activation. In both models Src family kinases may be activated by cross-linking and transphosphorylation, and this event may lead to the phosphorylation of ARH1 motifs and the recruitment of Syk. In the recruitment-activation model, merely recruiting Syk to cross-linked receptors may lead to its transphosphorylation either by neighboring Syk molecules or by Src family kinases. In the cooperative-activation model, recruitment of Syk may bring these two categories of tyrosine kinases generally close to one another, but the actual activation of Syk depends upon the formation of a complex between Src family kinases and Syk. The enhancement of Syk kinase activity by Lyn and Fyn, when these genes are overexpressed in transfected COS cells (Kurosaki et al., 1994Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), supports the notion of a functional basis for the interaction of Src family kinases with Syk during B cell signaling. Indeed, our data demonstrating the association of Src family kinases and Syk in activated B cells and a recent report from Sidorenko et al., 1995Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Chandran K.A. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, also demonstrating Src family kinase Syk interactions in B cells, may relate to cooperative interactions between these two categories of kinases during B cell activation. Although the molecular basis for the in vivo interaction of Syk and Src family kinases has not been previously elucidated, our results presented here may provide a structural basis for how this interaction actually occurs. A number of proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated and can be visualized bound to the SH2 domains of Blk, Lyn, and Fyn following B cell activation. We have demonstrated here that one of these proteins is the tandem SH2 domain containing Syk kinase. B cell activation has been previously demonstrated to be responsible for both the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and its concomitant increase in catalytic activity. Either or both of these linked events could account for the increased detectability of Syk eluted from Blk-SH2 fusion proteins in receptor-ligated B cells. We have also demonstrated that in activated B cells Syk binds to the Lyn and Blk Src family kinases. These results raise the possibility that during B lymphocyte activation, Syk may be recruited to the antigen receptor by a direct interaction with Src family kinases such as Blk, which in turn are associated with the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and Igβ. However, studies examining the interaction between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated ARH1 motif-based peptides with Src family kinases suggest that although nonphosphorylated ARH1 peptides can associate with the N termini of these kinases, phosphorylated peptides preferentially associate with the SH2 domains of these enzymes (Clark et al., 1994Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; Pleiman et al., 1994Pleiman C.M. Abrams C. Gauen L.T. Bedzyk W. Jongstra J. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4268-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is unlikely that an Src family kinase bridges the association of Syk with the antigen receptor in receptor-ligated cells (in which the ARH1 motifs of Igα and Igβ are tyrosine-phosphorylated). If some, relatively low level, tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk occurs in resting B cells it is conceivable that the association of Syk with antigen receptor in these cells (Hutchcroft et al., 1992Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Yamada et al., 1993Yamada T. Taniguchi T. Yang C. Yasue S. Saito H. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) might perhaps depend on a bridging role played by an Src family kinase. It is perhaps more likely that, in analogy to a model proposed to explain the interaction of activated ZAP 70 with Lck and the T cell receptor ζ chain (Duplay et al., 1994Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), B cell receptor ligation may initially lead to the phosphorylation of tyrosines in the ARH1 motifs (probably by Src family kinases) of the α/β heterodimer. This event may be followed by the subsequent recruitment of Syk to the phosphotyrosines in these motifs, followed by an interaction of activated Blk (or other Src family kinases) with receptor-bound Syk. Syk has been demonstrated to be recruited, in an activated B cell line, by chimeric proteins expressing the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and β individually (Law et al., 1993Law D.A. Chan V.W.F.

Moreover, the P19 differentiated to a cardiac lineage responded to ET-1 with a 3-fold increase in the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide. In contrast, differentiation to a neural lineage, by aggregation and exposure to retinoic acid, was associated with the induction of predominantly ETB. Therefore, selective differentiation of the P19 led to the differential expression of endothelin receptors in a pattern consistent with that observed in normal myocardial and neural tissue.

Because this protein contains RNA helicase consensus motifs, among them a ""DEAD"" box, we have termed it HEL117 (for helicase of 117.4 kDa). Besides the helicase consensus motifs, HEL117 contains an arginine-serine (RS)-rich domain, which occurs in some proteins involved in RNA splicing. Moreover, the COOH-terminal region of 78 residues of HEL117 is 38.5% identical and 59% similar to the COOH-terminal region of a yeast PRP5 protein that is involved in RNA splicing. Rabbit antibodies generated against a synthetic peptide of HEL117 identified a single polypeptide not only in rat cells but also in cells of other mammals as well as chicken. The antibodies revealed a finely punctate and speckled intranuclear staining in immunofluorescence microscopy.

We have purified the supercoiling activity from the silkworm Bombyx mori and found that it consists of DNA topoisomerase II and the supercoiling factor(9Ohta T. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of a molar excess of DNA topoisomerase II and the factor, unconstrained negative supercoils are introduced into DNA at the expense of ATP. The factor is a heat-stable protein with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE.1( 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction. )To get more information on the factor, we have initiated molecular genetic studies on the factor. We describe here the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding the B. mori supercoiling factor. Unexpectedly, the present study reveals Ca2+-dependent activation of the supercoiling reaction. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction. The supercoiling factor has been purified from the posterior silk glands of B. mori as described previously (9Ohta T. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The purified factor (100 μg of Fraction V) was precipitated with 4 volumes of acetone, dissolved in 120 μl of 70% formic acid containing 30 μg/ml cyanogen bromide, and incubated at room temperature for 24 h in the dark. The sample was diluted with 1.2 ml of water, evaporated and dissolved in 10 μl of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresed through an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the peptides were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Imobilon, Millipore) at 100 V for 1 h. Peptides on the membrane were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Individual bands were cut out and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer. For tryptic digestions, the supercoiling factor (30 μg of Fraction V) was preciptitated with acetone as above, and dissolved in 10 μl of 8 M urea, 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.1). After addition of 1 μl of 45 mM dithiothreitol, the sample was incubated at 50°C for 15 min and cooled to room temperature. Then, 1.1 μl of 0.1 M iodoacetamide was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, followed by dilution with 36.3 μl of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate. One μg of trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The tryptic digest was diluted with 48.4 μl of 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded on a C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column (3.9 × 150 mm). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0-50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and individual peaks were collected onto glass fiber filters. The filters were dried and subjected to microsequencing as above. The first strand cDNA was synthesized on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the posterior silk glands of B. mori on the second day of the fifth instar, using a cDNA synthesis system (Amersham). The hybridization probe was then generated by PCR using the first strand cDNA as a template(10Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 0.1 μg of the first strand cDNA, 200 pmol of each primer (primers 1 and 2 in Fig. 1), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dNTP, and 0.5 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). DNA amplification was achieved with 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. The final cycle included a primer-extension step at 72°C for 7.5 min. The 59-base pair PCR product was purified by PAGE and cloned into the SmaI site of the pTZ18R vector for direct dideoxy sequence analysis(11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). 33P-Labeled probe for screening of a cDNA library was prepared by PCR using the cloned DNA as a template, primers 1 and 2, and [α- 33P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals). An oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of the posterior silk glands of B. mori on the second day of the fifth instar using the cDNA synthesis system. cDNAs were ligated into an EcoRI-cleaved λ ZAPII vector (Stratagene) and packaged using an extract purchased from Amersham. Approximately 2.5 × 105 plaques were screened by hybridization with the cloned PCR probe. Hybridizations were performed at 65°C in 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0))/5 × Denhaldt's solution (1 × Denhaldt's solution is 0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.5% SDS, 10 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed at 65°C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were plaque purified, and individual cDNA inserts were recovered as chimeric pBluscript SK(+) plasmids through site-specific recombination in Escherichia coli. One of the cDNA clones with the longest insert was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy method using a series of progressive deletions(11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). For Southern analysis, 3 μg of B. mori genomic DNA isolated from the posterior silk glands were digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham) (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from the middle or posterior silk glands or fat bodies of B. mori at different stages. Each 3 μg of the RNA was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out as described above using the 33P-labeled EcoRI-BamHI fragment (nucleotide position from 1 to 510 in Fig. 2) as a probe. The standard reaction mixture (12.5 μl) contained 12 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, 0.3 mM EDTA, 1.2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma, average molecular weight 104), DNase-free bovine serum albumin (30 μg/ml), 0.7 fmol (as a homodimer) of human DNA topoisomerase II(13Miller K.G. Liu L.F. England P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1.4 fmol of the supercoiling factor (9Ohta T. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and 0.13 fmol of 33P-labeled relaxed closed circular DNA of pHSAR. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 10 min, and DNA was recovered and analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously(9Ohta T. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). pHSAR was prepared by inserting the 1.3-kilobase pair HindIII-EcoRI fragment carrying the scaffold-associate region of the Drosophila histone gene cluster (14Adachi Y. Käs E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pBluescript II SK(+). pFbHX was prepared by inserting the fibroin gene DNA segment HindIII-XhoI (nucleotide position −860 to +510) between the HindIII and XhoI sites of the same vector, and used as a control lacking the scaffold-associate region. 33P-Labeled relaxed closed circular DNA was prepared as described(15Tabuchi H. Handa H. Hirose S. Biochem. Biophy Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli(16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Detection of Ca2+-binding proteins by 45Ca autoradiography was carried out by the published procedure(17Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The supercoiling factor was purified to apparent homogeneity from the posterior silk glands of the silkworm by conventional chromatography (9Ohta T. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and subjected to microsequence analysis after proteolytic digestions. We obtained partial amino acid sequences VPTNEE and EKELKAPNSEG from cyanogen bromide-cleaved peptides and LVFEADA and AEIIDKYDLFVGSQATDFGEALAR from the tryptic peptides. As shown in Fig. 1A, degenerated oligonucleotides were made against the longest amino acid sequence and used as primers for PCR. DNA complementary to poly(A)+ RNA from the posterior silk glands was used as a template. The unique product of the expected size was sequenced and found to be correct (Fig. 1B). After subcloning, this PCR fragment was used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of the posterior silk glands. From 2.5 × 105 plaques, 16 positive clones containing 2.2-2.9-kilobase pair inserts were obtained. Restriction analyses showed that all of them were derived from a single species of mRNA (data not shown). The longest clone (λSCF13) was chosen for sequence analysis. The cDNA sequence contains a single long open reading frame of 322 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35 kDa (Fig. 2). There are two candidate ATG codens for the translation start (nucleotide positions 223 and 259), but we believe that the 5′-most coden is the probable start because there is an in-frame stop coden just upstream (nucleotide position 214) and reasonable agreement with the consensus start sequence(18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). All four peptide sequences obtained from microsequence analysis were found as underlined in Fig. 2. When the cDNA insert in the pBluescript SK(+) vector was transcribed by phage T3 RNA polymerase and the resulting RNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate, the protein product showed the same mobility on SDS-PAGE as the supercoiling factor purified from the silkworm (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the open reading frame presented in Fig. 2 represents the entire protein sequence of the factor. The deduced amino acid sequence of the factor predicts an acidic protein (pI = 4.3). Approximately a quarter of the amino acids is occupied by acidic residues which are scattered throughout the molecule. The cDNA has a 1.6-kilobase pair 3′-untranslated sequence and a putative polyadenylation signal is present at an appropriate distance from the poly(A)+ tail (data not shown). Northern blot analyses of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the posterior silk glands identifies a single hybridizing RNA species of about 3.5 kb (Fig. 3A), indicating that λSCF13 contains complete coding and 3′-nontranslated sequences but lacks a portion of 5′-nontranslated sequence. The level of mRNA was high at the fourth molting stage and gradually decreased during the fifth feeding stage. Similar expression patterns were otained for the middle silk glands and fat bodies (data not shown). Southern blot hybridization of EcoRI, HindIII, or BamHI-digested genomic DNA showed a simple pattern indicating that there is a single gene for the factor within the genome (Fig. 3B). A local region of the factor (amino acid residues 261-283) shares a weak but significant homology with a part of bacterial DNA gyrase A subunit (Fig. 4A). Thus, the 23-amino-acid region shows 35% identity and 61% similarity to E. coli gyrase, and 22% identity and 57% similarity to Klebsiella pneumoniae enzyme. As schematically depicted in Fig. 4B, eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II consists of the N-terminal region homologous with DNA gyrase B subunit, the central region homologous with the N-terminal portion of DNA gyrase A subunit, and the C-terminal region sharing no homology with DNA gyrase (20Uemura T. Morikawa K. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2355-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Lynn R. Giaever G. Swanberg S.L. Wang J.C. Science. 1986; 233: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The homologous region we found in the C-terminal region of the factor corresponds to the central portion of DNA gyrase A subunit (Fig. 4B). The predicted amino acid sequence of the factor contains five regions homologous with the Ca2+-binding loops of the EF-hand domain (Fig. 5A). The EF-hand is a 29-amino-acid domain consisting of a helix-loop-helix motif, with the loop portion coordinating Ca2+ binding through side chain oxygens of Ser, Thr, Asp, Asn, Glu, or Gln(22Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These residues are assigned to the vertices of an octahedron: X (position 10), Y(12), Z(14), -X(18), -Z(21), while the oxygen at -Y(16) comes from the carbonyl group of the main chain. All five potential EF-hand sequences in the factor have five conserved residues with oxygen-containing side chains at positions X, Y, Z, -X, and -Z. Besides these oxygen-containing residues, most EF-hand containing proteins have a Gly at position 15, and this Gly has been implicated in the turning of the loop(22Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The conserved Gly is present in the potential EF-hand sequences 1, 3, and 4 but it is replaced by acidic residues in the sequences 2 and 5. Most Ca2+-binding loops of the EF hand are surrounded by two α-helical regions (positions 1-9 and 22-29)(22Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The potential EF-hand sequences 1, 3, and 5 suffice this context. But position 28 of the sequence 2, and positions 28 and 29 of the sequence 4 are Pro. Thus, the sequences 2 and 4 might have shorter helical regions following the loops. The putative Ca2+-binding loops in the sequences 1 and 4 and the helical regions behind them (amino acid residues 80-97 and 249-266) share significant homology and constitute direct repeats within the factor. Relative positions of the gyrase A homology region, EF-hands, and direct repeats are schematically shown in Fig. 6.Figure 6:Schematic structure of the supercoiling factor. The arrows indicate the two direct repeats. GyrA and Ca represent the region homologous to a part of DNA gyrase A subunit and the potential Ca2+-binding loops, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the DNA supercoiling factor actually binds Ca2+, the factor and several control proteins were electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and, after renaturation, allowed to bind radioactive Ca2+. Only calmodulin added as a positive control and the factor gave radioactive bands (Fig. 5B). From these results, we conclude that at least some of the EF-hand domains in the factor are functional and bind Ca2+. In the previous study, the DNA supercoiling reaction required large amounts of both DNA topoisomerase II and the supercoiling factor(9Ohta T. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5307-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we tried to improve the assay conditions to achieve the supercoiling with less amounts of both proteins. As shown in Fig. 7A, the reaction was stimulated with polyvinyl alcohol (compare sample 2 versus sample 1) and if substrate DNA carries the scaffold-associate region (14Adachi Y. Käs E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) in the Drosophila histone gene cluster (compare sample 2 versus sample 3). The effect of polyvinyl alcohol became more prominent with increasing concentration up to 2% (data not shown). From these observations, we included polyvinyl alcohol and pHSAR DNA containing the scaffold-associate region in the standard reaction mixture (see “Experimental Procedures”). Having established that the supercoiling factor binds Ca2+, we next asked whether the supercoiling reaction could be regulated by Ca2+. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 7B, the reaction was significantly activated by Ca2+ Thus, the supercoiling activity became detectable at 10 μM Ca2+, reached a maximum level at 100 μM Ca2+, and was inhibited with 100 μM EGTA. Supercoils thus generated are not constrained in protein-DNA interactions because they were readily relaxed by further incubation with DNA topoisomerase I (data not shown). These results indicate that Ca2+ can affect the superhelical state of DNA. This report describes the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding the DNA supercoiling factor. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA defines an acidic protein of molecular mass 35 kDa. However, both the factor purified from the silkworm and the in vitro translated protein migrated on SDS-PAGE at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 50 kDa (9, this study). Similar anomalous mobilities have been reported for other acidic proteins like nucleoplasmin and N1-N2(23Dingwall C. Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Kearsey S.E. Cox L.S. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Kleinschmidt J.A. Dingwall C. Maier G. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These proteins are highly negatively charged, and this may affect the mobility by reducing the binding of SDS. All our attempts to express the recombinant supercoiling factor in E. coli using the T7 expression system (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) or as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (26Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) were in vain. This is presumably due to the presence of unfavorable codens for E. coli in our cDNA sequence. For example, AGA and AGG codens for Arg at nucleotide positions 298, 430, 433, 550, 559, 607, 700, 709, 712, 754, 802, 943, 964, and 1174, and ATA coden for Ile at nucleotide positions 445, 457, and 481 are rarely used in E. coli(27Ikemura T. Ozeki H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 1087-1097Crossref Google Scholar). These rare codens are known to cause a long pause in polypeptide chain elongation which is detrimental to bacteria. Recently, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a Drosophila homologue of the supercoiling factor. The predicted amino acid sequences of the silkworm and the fly factors share homologies throughout the molecules, but their coden usages are quite different. We have succeeded in expression of the fly factor in E. coli and found that the recombinant factor is functional in both the Ca2+ binding and the supercoiling reaction.2( 2T. Ohta, M. Kobayashi, and S. Hirose, unpublished observation. ) The deduced amino acid sequence of the factor reveals a homologous region with the central portion of DNA gyrase A subunit. The portion corresponds to the domain between the active site Tyr and the heptapeptidic Leu repeat which might be involved in the dimerization of the polypeptide. DNA gyrase holoenzyme capable of catalyzing a supercoiling reaction consists of two molecules of A subunit and two molecules of B subunit and can thus be viewed as a dimer of an A-B complex(19Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Ikeda H. Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and Its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 1-18Google Scholar). Native form of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II without any supercoiling activity is a homodimer of a polypeptide consisting of the N-terminal region homologous to gyrase B subunit and the central region homologous to the N-terminal potion of gyrase A subunit (Fig. 4B). On the analogy of DNA gyrase, a dimer of an eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II-supercoiling factor complex may constitute the supercoiling activity. The cDNA sequence predicts two direct repeats in the supercoiling factor indicating an ancient duplication event. Each repeat unit consists of a potential EF-hand domain. Usually EF hands occur in one to three pairs(22Kretsinger R.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, the duplicated form seems to have a functional advantage. Three other potential EF-hand domains do not share apparent homology with each other and with the direct repeats. We show here clearly that the supercoiling factor is a Ca2+-binding protein and requires Ca2+ for its full activity. In prokaryotes, every cell has a potential to replicates its genome, and hence it always requires a DNA supercoiling activity. On the contrary, most cells in metazoans will not replicate DNA after differentiation. In such a system, DNA supercoiling activity is thought to be kept under strict control. It is most likely that the Ca2+ signal is chosen for the regulation. We thank Drs. S. Hayashi and H. Ueda for discussion and Y. Takada for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2054192356,"Three mitochondrial mutants were characterized that block the splicing of aI3α, a mobile group I intron of the <i>COXI</i> gene of yeast mtDNA. Mutant C1085 alters helical structures known to be important for splicing of group I introns. M44 and C1072 are point mutants in exon 3 that block correct splicing but allow some splicing at cryptic 5′-splice sites. M44 alters the P1 helix needed for 5′-splice site definition, while the mutation in C1072 is a new kind of mutation because it is located upstream of the exon sequence involved in the P1 helix. All three mutants accumulate novel proteins of 35 and 44 kDa (p35 and p44, respectively) detected both by labeling of mitochondrial translation products and by Western blotting. Partial protease digestions indicate that p44 and p35 are closely related, probably as precursor and processed protein. The level of the intron-encoded endonuclease activity, <i>I-Sce</i>III, is elevated ∼10-fold in the mutants. Partial purification of <i>I-Sce</i>III from the mutants showed that most, if not all, of the activity is associated with p35. Finally, because aI3α splices accurately in a petite mutant, we conclude that aI3α splicing does not depend on a mtDNA-encoded maturase."

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7908-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Glu-98 was esterified by the deoxyribosyl moiety of the substrate donor during catalysis(21Porter D.J.T. Merrill B.M. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15551-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). native nucleoside 2′-deoxyribosylnucleoside transferase a general term that denotes either a purine or pyrimidine native enzyme with an alanyl residue substituting for Glu-98 complex between enzyme and 2′-deoxyribosylnucleoside A or B enzyme intermediate that is the final product of the reaction of E with a 2′-deoxyribosylnucleoside in the absence of a purine or pyrimidine nucleobase complex between enzyme intermediate EX and nucleobase P or Q 2,6-diaminopurine. The steady-state kinetic data for transferase with numerous substrates are describe by a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism(6Danzin C. Cardinaud R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which suggested that the overall reaction is the sum of a donor and acceptor half-reaction. An alternative to a steady-state analysis of the reaction is a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis in which each half-reaction is examined independently. In the present studies, the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence by substrates was used to monitor the reaction 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides with native enzyme and a catalytically inactive mutant enzyme in which the catalytic nucleophile Glu-98 was replaced with an alanyl residue. By comparison of the kinetics of native and mutant enzyme with selective 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides, the fluorescence changes associated with esterification of Glu-98 were identified. The Lactobacillus leishmanii nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase and the mutant enzyme with an alanyl residue replacing Glu-98 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously(21Porter D.J.T. Merrill B.M. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15551-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transferase was assayed spectrophotometrically as described previously (21, 22). Purines, pyrimidines, and their corresponding 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides were from Sigma. The 2-deoxyribosyl ester of Glu-98 was generated in situ by mixing 3.9 μM transferase with 200 μM dIno. This solution of EX was used within 5 min of preparation. dIno was chosen for the esterification of Glu-98 for two reasons. First, excess substrate was required, because EX was slowly hydrolyzed to native enzyme (t = 20 s). Second, esterification of native enzyme with 200 μM dIno was relatively slow with a t of 1 s (see “Results”). This latter property was essential for studies involving the reaction of EX with nucleobases in which native enzyme was generated. Thus, the relatively slow rate of EX formation from 200 dIno and native enzyme guaranteed that insignificant amounts of EX would be reformed from native enzyme during the course of the experiments (<0.1 s). Initial velocities for the reaction of dAdo and Cyt with transferase were calculated from data collected spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (Δϵ280 = 2.9 mM-1 cm-1). Equation 1, which describes the substrate dependence of the initial velocity for a ping-pong kinetic mechanism, was fitted to the steady-state kinetic data for the reaction of dAdo (A) and Cyt (B) with transferase. υ/Et=kcat1+KA[A]+KB[B]Eq.1 Because the Kd of EX for Ade was approximately 5 μM (see “Results”) and Δϵ280 for the reaction was only 2.9 mM-1 cm-1, initial velocity data for the transfer reaction with Ade and dCyd as substrates were difficult to obtain spectrophotometrically. Consequently, a complete steady-state analysis for this direction of the reaction was not made and it was assumed that Equation 1 also described the initial velocity data for these substrates. The Km for dCyd was calculated from initial velocity data collected with the concentration of Ade 10-fold greater than its Km. The Km for Ade was determined using the integrated rate equation (23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 54Google Scholar) for spectrophotometric data collected with 20 μM Ade and with the concentration of dCyd 10-fold greater than its Km. Equation 2 was fitted to the time course of the fluorescence changes during the reaction of transferase with substrates. If the time course of the reaction was biphasic, F(t) is the observed signal at time equal to t, F1 and F2 are the respective amplitudes of the two phases; kobs,1 and kobs,2 are the respective pseudo first-order rate constants; and F0 is the final fluorescence intensity. F(t)=F1·exp(-kobs,1·t)F2·exp(-kobs,2·t)+F0Eq.2 If the time course of the reaction was first-order, F2 was set equal to zero. These pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs) were determined as a function of substrate concentration (S). Equation 3a, 3b, or 4 was fitted to these data, kobs=ks[S]+k0Eq.3a kobs=k∞[S]Kd+[S]Eq.3b kobs=(k∞-k0)[S]Kd+[S]+k0Eq.4 where k∞ is the value of the first-order rate constant extrapolated to infinite substrate concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, k0 is the ordinate intercept, and ks is the slope of the line. Titration of transferase (E) with ligand (L) was described minimally by Equation 5 and was monitored by fluorescence quenching of the enzyme upon formation of the enzyme inhibitor complex (EL). R+L⇋KdELEq.5 The percent change in fluorescence (ΔF(Lt)) is related to the total concentration of added inhibitor (Lt) by Equation 6 in which ΔF∞ is the percent fluorescence quenching of the enzyme resulting from conversion of E to EL. ΔF(lt)=ΔF∞[EL][Et]Eq.6 Because the concentration of enzyme was comparable with the dissociation constant of inhibitor, the concentration of EL is related to Lt by Equation 7, [EL]=[Lt]+[Et]+Kd2âˆ’([Lt]+[Et]+Kd)2âˆ’4[Et][Lt]2Eq.7 in which Kd is the dissociation constant of E for inhibitor. Equations 6 and 7 were fitted to the titration data to yield the dissociation constant (Kd) of transferase for the inhibitor and the enzyme concentration (Et). The time course of the reaction of dThd and dUrd with transferase was biphasic. The relative amplitude of the late phase of the reaction decreased asymptotically as the concentration of corresponding nucleobase (P) was increased. The relative amplitude of this phase of the reaction was related to the concentration of P by Equation 8, where Kd is the concentration of P that reduced the amplitude of this phase by 50%. Realtiveamplitude=1-[P]([P]+Kd)Eq.8 Fluorescence data were collected with a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorometer. Absorbance and conventional kinetic data were obtained from a Kontron UVIKON 860 spectrophotometer. The standard buffer for all determinations was 0.1 M potassium phosphate at pH 6.0 and 25°C. Rapid reactions were monitored on an Applied Photophysics SX. 17MV Spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, United Kingdom). Entrance and exit slits were 2 mm, and the path length of the excitation wavelength was 2 mm. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission wavelength was greater than 305 nm (305-nm cut-off filter). All fluorescence data were corrected for the absorbance of the titrant, the fluorescence of the titrant, and the dilution resulting from addition of the titrant. Corrected fluorescence data were normalized (100%) to the fluorescence of native enzyme. The appropriate equations were fitted to the data by nonlinear least squares using SigmaPlot from Jandel Scientific (Corte Madera, CA). DAP quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of transferase. Titration of the enzyme by DAP was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm and an emission wavelength of 340 nm to minimize the corrections for inner filter effects and fluorescence of the titrant. An example of a titration of a solution of transferase with an A278 = 3.9 cm-1 is given in Fig. 1. Equation 5 was fitted to data from three independent titrations to give a calculated enzyme concentration of 59 ± 3 μM, an apparent dissociation constant for DAP of 4.4 ± 0.4 μM, and a maximal fluorescence quenching of 84 ± 2%. The subunit extinction coefficient (ϵ278) based on these determinations of enzyme concentration and the absorbance of the enzyme solution at 279 nm was 66 mM-1 cm-1. The fluorescence of native enzyme was also quenched by 2′-deoxyribosylnucleoside substrates. However, these titrations were complicated by formation of nucleobase, which precluded a rigorous analysis of the data. E98A enzyme, which is catalytically incompetent due to substitution of the active site Glu-98 with an alanyl residue (21), was titrated with substrates of native enzyme without interference from the products of catalysis. The dissociation constants of E98A enzyme for DAP and selected 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides are summarized in Table I.Table I:Dissociation constants of E98A enzyme for selected ligands Open table in a new tab 2′-Deoxyribosylnucleosides (A) react with native enzyme (Scheme I) to give a nucleobase (P) and a covalently modified enzyme (EX) in which Glu-98 is esterified by a 2′-deoxyribosyl group(21Porter D.J.T. Merrill B.M. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15551-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because the fluorescence of native enzyme was quenched by DAP and selected 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides (Fig. 1 and), the time course of the reaction of the enzyme with substrates might be monitored by fluorescence quenching. However, when 0.75 μM native enzyme was reacted with 100 μM dAdo, a time-dependent change in the fluorescence was not observed on the stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (Fig. 2A). E=A⇌k-1k1EA⇌k-2k2EXP⇌k-3k3EX+PSCHEME I This result could occur if: 1) the reaction was completed within the mixing-time (1.6 ms) of the instrument, 2) the fluorescence values of E, EA, EXP, and EX were similar, or 3) even though the fluorescence of E and EX was different from that of EXP and EA, the latter never accumulated during the reaction. If either of the first two possibilities applied, then it is unlikely that experimental conditions could be altered sufficiently for the reaction to be observed by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry. However, if the third possibility applied, P could be included in the reaction to favor the accumulation of EXP. Thus, the fluorescence of native enzyme was quenched by 15% in a time-dependent manner when the reaction of 100 μM Ado with 0.75 μM native enzyme was repeated in the presence of 25 μM Ade (Fig. 2A). A time-dependent quenching of the enzyme fluorescence by Ade was not observed in the absence of dAdo. Because the quenching of the fluorescence of native enzyme by dAdo in the presence of Ade occurred without a lag, the binding of dAdo was a rapid equilibrium process (i.e. k-1 > k2+ k-2). The concentration dependence of the pseudo first-order rate constant for fluorescence quenching of native enzyme by dAdo in the presence of 100 μM Ade2( 2The binding constant of free enzyme (E) for Ade was estimated to be 500 ± 100 μM from the effect that Ade had on the pseudo first-order rate constant for the reaction of transferase with 250 μM dAdo. Based on this K value, the 100 μM Ade present during the reaction of dAdo with native enzyme would have less than a 20% effect on the measured K of dAdo. )was determined (Fig. 2B). Equation 4 was fitted to these data to give values for Kd, (k∞ - k0), and k0 of 200 ± 20 μM, 173 ± 3 s-1, and 52 ± 3 s-1, respectively. These parameters were interpreted in terms of the rate constants of as follows: Kd is equal to k-1/k1, k2 is equal to (k∞ - k0), and k0 is equal to k-2. Because excess Ade was present to ensure accumulation of EXP, estimates for the values of k3 and k-3 or their ratio were not possible from these data. However, the ratio of k3 to k-3 and an independent estimate for k-2 could be calculated from the concentration dependence of the pseudo first-order rate constants for the reaction of EX with Ade (Fig. 3). Equation 3b was fitted to these data to yield values for Kd and k∞ of 5.2 ± 0.5 μM and 55 ± 2 s-1, respectively. Because the reaction of EX with Ade occurred without a lag, the binding of Ade to EX was a rapid equilibrium process (i.e. k3 > k2+ k-2). In terms of the parameters of, Kd is equal to k3/k-3 and k∞ is equal to k-2. The value of k-2 determined from these data was similar to the value calculated from the data of Fig. 2B (52 s-1). dAdo was bound by catalytically inactive E98A enzyme with an affinity (260 μM, Table I) that was comparable with that of native enzyme (k-1/k1 in). However, the time-dependent fluorescence changes observed upon reaction of native enzyme with dAdo and Ade were absence with the E98A enzyme (Fig. 2A). Because E98A enzyme has an alanyl residue substituted for Glu-98, it cannot undergo 2-deoxyribosylation at this position. These results suggest that the time-dependent fluorescence changes observed with native enzyme are associated with esterification of Glu-98. The kinetic constants for the reaction of native enzyme with selected nucleosides are summarized in Table II.Table II:Summary of pre-steady-state kinetic constants for the reaction of selected 2′-deoxyribosylnucleotides with native enzyme Open table in a new tab In contrast to the monophasic time course for the reaction of native enzyme with the 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides listed in Table II, the time courses for reaction of dThd and dUrd with native enzyme were biphasic in the absence of added nucleobase (Fig. 4). Equation 2 was fitted to the time course for the reaction of dThd with native enzyme to give two pseudo first-order rate constants. The pseudo first-order rate constants for the early phase of the reaction were linearly dependent on the concentration of dThd (Fig. 5). Equation 3a was fitted to these data to give a ks of 0.438 ± 0.003 μM-1 s-1 and a ko of 42.2 ± 0.9 s-1. The pseudo first-order rate constant for the late phase of the reaction was hyperbolically dependent on the concentration of dThd. Equation 3b was fitted to these data to yield a k∞ of 8.5 ± 0.1 s-1 and a Kd of 64 ± 4 μM. The analogous values with dUrd as the substrate were ks = 0.92 ± 0.04 μM-1 s-1, k0 = 58 ± 8 s-1, k∞ = 10.4 ± 0.6 s-1, and a Kd = 31 ± 6 μM.Figure 5:Effect of dThd concentration on the pseudo first-order rate constants for reaction of dThd with native and E98A enzymes. The pseudo first-order rate constants for the early and late phases (inset) of the reaction of dThd with 4.8 μM enzyme were determined as a function of dThd concentration. The solid line for the early phase of the reaction was calculated with Equation 3a and values for ks = 0.44 μM-1 s-1 and k0 = 42 s-1. The solid line for the late phase of the reaction (inset) was calculated with Equation 3b and values for K = 64 μM and k∞ = 8.5 s-1. The pseudo first-order rate constants for the reaction of dThd with 4.8 μM E98A enzyme were also determined as a function of dThd concentration. The solid line was calculated with Equation 3a and values for ks = 0.31 μM-1 s-1 and k0 = 41 s-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time courses of the early phase of the reaction of native enzyme with dThd was not affected by including Thy in the reaction. In contrast, the amplitude of the late phase of the reaction was diminished by Thy and the value of the pseudo first-order rate constant was increased (Fig. 4). This observation suggested that the late phase of the reaction was associated with dissociation of Thy from the esterified enzyme (i.e. k3 in). The concentration dependence of the amplitude of the late phase on Thy was fitted to Equation 8 to yield an apparent Kdfor Thy of 105 ± 5 μM. The Kd for uracil binding to EX was calculated from analogous data to be 55 ± 2 μM. If the time-dependent fluorescence changes observed upon reaction of dThy with native enzyme were related to deoxyribosylation of Glu-98, these changes should be absent during the reaction of the E98A enzyme with dThd. However, dThd quenched the fluorescence of the E98A enzyme in a monophasic process. The amplitude (Fig. 4) and pseudo first-order rate constants for this reaction were similar to those for the early phase of the reaction of native enzyme with dThd. The pseudo first-order rate constants for the reaction of dThd with E98A enzyme were fitted to Equation 3a to yield ks = 0.305 ± 0.006 μM-1 s-1 and ko = 41 ± 1 s-1. Because the late phase of the reaction of dThd with native enzyme was absent from the analogous reaction of E98A enzyme, this phase of the reaction corresponded to deoxyribosylation of Glu-98 and/or product release, whereas the early phase of the fluorescence change monitored binding of dThd by transferase. The pseudo first-order rate constant for the initial phase of the reaction between dThd and native enzyme did not saturate at high concentrations of dThd (Fig. 4). Thus, the time courses for these reactions can be described by a simplified version of Scheme I (Scheme II) in which EA and EXP are kinetically a single species. In this scheme, k′-1 and k′3 are the apparent dissociation rate constants of A and P from the [EA ↔ EXP] complex. In the absence of nucleobase (P), E=A⇌[k-1k1EA⇌k-2k2EXP]⇌k-3k'3EX+PSCHEME II the observed rate constants for the early phase (kobs,1) and late phase (kobs,2) of the reaction are given by Equations 9a and 9b, respectively. kobs,1≅k'1+k-1+k'3Eq.9a kobs,1≅k'1[A]k'3kobs.1Eq.9b The values for the kinetic constants k1, k′-1, and k′3 for dThd were calculated with Equations 9a and 9b and the data of Fig. 5 to be 0.438 ± 0.003 μM-1 s-1, 33.7 ± 0.9 s-1, and 8.5 ± 0.1 s-1, respectively. The analogous values for these constants with dUrd as substrate were 0.92 ± 0.04 μM-1 s-1, 48.8 ± 8 s-1 and 10.4 ± 0.6 s-1. It was not possible to estimate values for k2 and k-2 from these kinetic data. To confirm that the kinetic constants determined from analysis of pre-steady-state data were relevant to catalysis, the overall equilibrium constant and the steady-state kinetic coefficients calculated from these value and the mechanism of I were compared with the experimental values. E=A⇌k-1k1EA⇌k-2k2EXP⇌k-3k3EX+PEX=B⇌k4k4EXB⇌k5k5EQ⇌k6k6E+QSCHEME III The equilibrium constant for the reaction of dAdo and Cyt (10) was determined from the absorbance change (Δϵ280 = 2.9 mM-1 cm-1) after mixing 100 μM dAdo (A) and 100 μM Cyt (B) or 100 μM Ade (P) and 100 μM dCyd (Q) in the presence of 0.1 μM enzyme. The average value of Keq from six determinations was 12.2 ± 0.2. Keq=[dAdo][Cyt][dCyd][Ade]Eq.10 Initial velocity data with native enzyme for five concentrations of dAdo (50-500 μM) and five concentrations of Cyt (50-500 μM) were analyzed with Equation 1 to yield values for kcat, KdAdo, and Kcyt of 86 ± 3 s-1, 120 ± 10 μM and 113 ± 9 μM, respectively. KAde was estimated to be 3.1 ± 0.4 (n = 2) by fitting the integrated rate equation to the time course for disappearance of 20 μM Ade in the presence of 300 μM dCyd. KdCyd and kcat were estimated from initial velocity data (10 concentrations of dCyd between 25 and 300 μM) with 100 μM Ade to be 81 ± 9 μM and 63 ± 3 s-1, respectively. The data summarized in Table III show that the kinetic constants determined from pre-steady-state data are consistent with the experimental values for the steady-state kinetic parameters and the equilibrium constant for the reaction of dAdo with Cyt.Table III:Summary of equilibrium constants and steady-state kinetic constants for the reaction of dAdo and Cyt with native enzyme Open table in a new tab 2′-Deoxyribosylnucleosides quenched the fluorescence of native enzyme and catalytically inactive E98A enzyme, which has Glu-98 replaced with an alanyl residue. The difference between the time courses for the fluorescence changes associated with the reaction of selected substrates (Fig. 2A and Fig. 4) with these enzymes enabled us to identify first-order processes associated with either a chemical reaction on the enzyme or a conformational change (k2 and k-2 in). Because Glu-98 is deoxyribosylated during catalysis(21Porter D.J.T. Merrill B.M. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15551-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), these first-order processes are assigned to the esterification (k2) or de-esterification (k-2) of Glu-98. The rate constants determined from analysis of these data with dAdo and Cyt as substrates were consistent with the experimental values for the overall equilibrium constant and the steady-state kinetic coefficients of the reaction (Table III). Correlation of the kinetic intermediates of with possible chemical intermediates involved in a half-reaction between native enzyme and dAdo (S) are outlined in Fig. SIV. The binding of dAdo to native enzyme (k1 and k-1) and Ade (P) to esterified enzyme (k3 and k-3) are rapid equilibrium processes. The catalytic step involving esterification of Glu-98 is described by k2 and k-2. This simplified scheme treats the esterification reaction as a nucleophilic displacement of Ade from dAdo by Glu-98. By analogy with glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, this step may be more complicated and involve transient formation of an oxocarbonium ion (24Mooser G. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1992: 187-233Google Scholar) that is subsequently trapped by Glu-98. Minimally, an amino acid residue not depicted in Fig. SIV functions as a general acid to assist departure of Ade during glycosidic bond cleavage. Several generalizations relating to the transfer reaction can be made from the kinetic constants of Table II. First, formation of the initial complex between 2′-deoxyribonucleoside and enzyme (K1) was less favorable than that between a nucleobase and EX (K3). Second, the rate constant for 2′-deoxyribosylnucleoside bond cleavage (EA to EXP) varied greatly (4-240 s-1). Third, the equilibrium constant for the interconversion of EA to EXP varied between 0.4 for dCyd and 4 for dAdo. On the basis of theoretical considerations, the equilibrium constant between enzyme-bound intermediates should be approximately one for an enzyme evolved to maximal catalytic efficiency(25Burbaum J.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9306-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This condition was approximately true for native enzyme with dAdo, dGuo, and dCyd as substrates. Comparison of the fluorescence changes associated with the reaction of native enzyme and catalytically inactive E98A enzyme has allowed us to identify first-order processes associated with esterification of Glu-98 by selected 2′-deoxyribosylnucleosides. These results clearly agree with our conclusion that Glu-98 is the active nucleophile of 2-deoxyribosyltransferase(21Porter D.J.T. Merrill B.M. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15551-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to Glu-98, other amino acid side chains are undoubtedly essential for catalysis. The comparison of pre-steady-state kinetic constants for esterification of native enzyme by dAdo with those for various mutant enzymes, as demonstrated in this study for E98A, will allow us to quantitatively evaluate the effects of specific amino acid substitutions on the esterification reaction. The identification of these amino acid residues and their position in the native enzyme as deduced from x-ray crystallographic data (22Cook W.J. Short S.A. Ealick S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2682-2683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) will provide a more complete understanding of the relationship between the architecture of the active site and the residue-specific chemistry involved in glycosidic bond cleavage and formation."

Electron micrographs showed 230 x 270-Å particles whose two components appear similar to individual U1 and U2 snRNPs. Electron micrographs of an A-complex-5′-biotinyl oligonucleotide-streptavidin-gold composite allowed identification of the U2 snRNP within the structure and the localization of the 5′-segment of U2 snRNA at a unique site in the A-complex. This region of U2 RNA is adjacent to the developing catalytic center of the spliceosome. Eukaryotic mRNA precursors include both the protein-coding information of exons and noncoding intron sequences. Introns are excised by a splicing organelle, the spliceosome, which is made up of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins or snRNPs1( 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinsnRNAsmall nuclear RNASAPspliceosome associated proteinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographycOmeRNAcomplementary 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotidecDNAcomplementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide. )and several spliceosome-associated proteins (SAPs)(1Lamm G.M.

It is thus understandable that the physical structure of the spliceosome is not well established. Spliceosomes have been visualized in electron micrographs, but these studies were limited by the small amounts of material, its potential heterogeneity, and the complexity of the purification procedures(14Reed R.

Detailed analysis of spliceosome structure will require isolation of homogeneous and well-defined forms of the particle as it occurs at specific steps of the splicing cycle. Specific spliceosome forms can be enriched using complementary oligodeoxynucleotide/RNase H-mediated destruction of selected snRNAs. Alternatively, splicing complexes have been trapped using complementary 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides that interfere in spliceosome assembly by blocking RNA-RNA interactions(27Barabino S. Sproat B. Ryder U. Blencowe B. Lamond A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4171-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Barabino S. Blencowe B. Ryder U. Sproat B. Lamond A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3373-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe extension of each of these strategies, allowing the isolation of significant amounts of a spliceosomal A-complex composed of pre-mRNA, U1 and U2 snRNPs, and probably several SAPs(10Zillman M. Zapp M. Berget S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Bennett M. Michaud S. Kingston J. Reed R.

We show electron micrographs of the HeLa cell A-complex and, using a 5′-biotinyl-2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide and a streptavidin-gold marker, we identify the snRNPs within the A-complex and localize the 5′ segment of the U2 snRNA and thus the developing center of catalysis in the spliceosome. A Milligen Cyclone DNA synthesizer was used to prepare both DNA and 2′-O-methyl RNA oligomers and in some cases to add a single 5′-biotin through a 9-carbon spacer. β-Cyanoethyl phosphoramidite precursors (32Sinha N.D. Biernat J. McManus J. Koster H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4539-4557Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) were purchased from Glen Research, and the Milligen program for RNA synthesis was used in the preparation of 2′-O-methyl RNA oligomers. All oligonucleotides were purified by ion exchange HPLC on a Bio-Rad TSK-DEAE-5-PW column(33Lasater L. Olson H.M. Cann P. Glitz D.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4687-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in these studies are listed in Table I.Table I:Oligonucleotides used in these experiments Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were grown to a density of 3-5 x 105 cells/ml and nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al.(34Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Thirty-two liters of HeLa cells typically produced 30 ml of nuclear extract containing 8-12 mg/ml protein. When used as 35% of a splicing reaction mixture this material gave reproducible and efficient splicing. Preparation of ribonuclease H-treated extracts followed Black and Steitz(35Black D. Steitz J. Cell. 1986; 46: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (0.8 ml) included 93% nuclear extract, 5 μM cDNA-U4D, 20 μM cDNA-U5E, 25 μM cDNA-U6B, 1.5 mM ATP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.05 unit/μl RNase H (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 0.09 unit/μl RNase-free DNase I (Stratagene) and incubation at 30°C for an additional 15 min. Small aliquots of extracts were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Adenovirus pre-mRNA was transcribed from a plasmid derived from the Bgl-cleaved pSPAd construct (36Black D. Chabot B. Steitz J. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 37Solnick D. Cell. 1985; 42: 157-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and supplied to us by Dr. D. Black. The Ambion SP6 in vitro transcription kit was used; full-length (417 nucleotide) transcripts were purified by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel and electroelution. Splicing reactions (25, 100, 300, or 750 μl) were conducted as described by Krainer et al.(38Krainer A. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), except RNasin and polyvinyl alcohol were omitted and final concentrations of 1.5 mM ATP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 2 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, and 0.05 μM pre-mRNA were used. Reaction mixtures lacking pre-mRNA were assembled with and without oligonucleotides 5′-biotinyl-cOmeRNA-U2A (8-10 μM), cOmeRNA-U4A (15 μM), and cDNA-U5C (25 μM) and incubated for 15 min at 30°C; pre-mRNA was then added and incubation was continued for 1 h at 30°C. Spliceosome complexes were analyzed by fractionation on nondenaturing 4% (80:1) polyacrylamide gels in 75 mM Tris glycine, pH 8.8. Samples (on ice) were adjusted to the same volume and composition by addition of cold H4 buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Heparin was added to a level of 0.17 mg/ml prior to electrophoresis at room temperature in a Bio-Rad Protean apparatus (30 min at 30 V followed by 1 h at 300 V and 1.5 h at 375 V). Splicing products were analyzed after isolation of the RNA from the splicing reactions(38Krainer A. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Reaction products were fractionated on 10% (19:1) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea in Tris borate-EDTA buffer, pH 8.3. Pre-mRNA, spliced product, exon 1, released intron lariat, and the lariat-exon 2 intermediate are each identified by their mobility (36). Splicing reaction mixtures containing trapped A-complex (100, 300, or 750 μl) were chilled on ice and 15 μg of carrier yeast RNA was added. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 x g and applied to a Pharmacia HR 10/30 Superose 6 FPLC column that had been equilibrated with ice-cold H4 buffer and adapted for use with a Waters HPLC system. A flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was maintained until the first (void volume) peak had been collected, at which point the rate was increased to 0.6 ml/min. In most instances the first 0.4 ml of the void volume peak from 100 μl of reaction mixtures was used for electron microscopy. The first fraction (1.2 ml) of the Superose 6 void volume peak from 0.75-ml splicing reaction mixtures was sometimes subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Samples were loaded on 37-ml 10-40% gradients prepared in H4 buffer and centrifuged for 15 h at 20,000 rpm in a Spinco SW28 rotor. Fractions corresponding to sedimentation values of about 40-50 S were found to contain A-complex. RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and fractionated on a 10% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The RNA was transferred electrophoretically to a GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) using 1 x hydrolink (J. T. Baker) buffer. Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) and [32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) at a specific activity of 1-3 mCi/μmol. Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 37°C according to the Bio-Rad protocol, and the blots were then washed three times with 6 x SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) plus 0.2% SDS at 23°C for 30 min (each) followed by one wash at 37°C for 10 min in the same solution. Anti-endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein 13D6/G8 (39Hortsch M. Avossa D. Meyer D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and anti-U1 70K protein (40Billings P. Allen R. Jensen F. Hoch S. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1176-1180PubMed Google Scholar) monoclonal antibodies were obtained as tissue culture supernatants from Dr. David Meyer and Dr. Sallie Hoch, respectively. Dr. E. DeRobertis contributed the anti-SM antibody(41Matter L. Schoffer K. Wilhelm J. Nyffenegger T. Parisot R. DeRobertis E. Arthr. Rheum. 1982; 25: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Antibodies in 1.5 M glycine plus 3 M NaCl, pH 8.9, were immobilized on Ultralink Protein A Plus beads (Pierce) by rocking on a nutator at 23°C for 1 h and washed with 20 bead volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus 150 mM KCl. To block nonspecific sites, rocking was continued for 16 h at 4°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA. The beads were then washed with a total of 20 bead volumes of IP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml yeast RNA, and 0.05 mM dithiothreitol). A 300-μl splicing reaction containing RNase H-treated nuclear extract was fractionated by Superose 6 chromatography and the early fraction (1 ml) was collected, adjusted to the IP buffer conditions, and divided into four aliquots (500 μl: about 0.06 A280/each). Each aliquot was added to 50 μl of immobilized antibodies, rocked at 4°C for 2 h, and then washed with 40 bead volumes of IP buffer. Bound RNAs were recovered from the support by proteinase K digestion. Samples were adsorbed to thin carbon support films, negatively contrasted using a double carbon technique (42Lake J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 105: 131-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and examined at 80,000 x magnification using a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Computer-generated images were produced by scanning individual particles with a Macintosh scanner and Quadra computer with the OFOTO program. Contrast was enhanced using Adobe Photoshop software, and images were printed at 300 dpi. Splicing reactions (100 μl) containing RNase H-treated nuclear extract were incubated with 8-10 μM 5′-biotinyl-cOmeRNA-U2A for 15 min at 30°C; pre-mRNA was then added and incubation was continued for 1 h. After Superose 6 chromatography, streptavidin-gold (5 nm, EY Laboratories) was added to the early fraction of the void volume peak at a final concentration of 2 μM. Samples were incubated for 1.5 h on ice and then prepared for electron microscopy as above. One way to halt spliceosome assembly at a specific stage is to destroy a component that is required later in the process(35Black D. Steitz J. Cell. 1986; 46: 697-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Hall K.B. Konarska M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10969-10973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 44Black D. Pinto A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have used RNase H treatment in conjunction with oligodeoxynucleotides that complement segments of U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs to destroy the tri-snRNP complex and cause the accumulation of A-complex. Oligonucleotides used in this work are listed in Table I. Nuclear extracts were supplemented with cDNAs U4D, U5E, and U6B and incubated with RNase H. Fig. 1 illustrates electrophoretic analysis of the result; snRNAs U4, U5, and U6 were present in control nuclear extracts but were undetectable in treated preparations whether in stained gels (Fig. 1A) or if probed by Northern analysis using two different sets of complementary oligonucleotides (Fig. 1, B and C). Much longer exposure of these blots still did not reveal snRNAs U4, U5, and U6. Treated preparations were examined for the ability to assemble splicing complexes and catalyze splicing. Control nuclear extracts sometimes included cOmeRNA-U2A or a 5′-biotinyl form of this oligoribonucleotide, both of which have been shown to trap the A-complex (16, 27, 30). Control and treated extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled adenovirus pre-mRNA under splicing conditions. Portions of each reaction mixture were brought to 0.17 mg/ml heparin (to minimize dissociation of higher molecular weight complexes(30Lamond A. Sproat B. Ryder U. Hamm J. Cell. 1989; 58: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) and fractionated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels (native gels); Fig. 2A shows that both the preparation treated with RNase H/cDNA and that trapped with cOmeRNA-U2A accumulate A-complex but, unlike the unblocked control, little or no B- or C-complex is apparent. RNA from each reaction was isolated and fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The intentionally overexposed gel in Fig. 2B shows no evidence of the lariat intermediate or the excised lariat in either the RNase H/cDNA-treated preparation or the cOmeRNA-U2A-trapped extract, confirming that the formation of the B-, C-, and I-complexes is fully blocked in these extracts. The untreated extract, however, shows appreciable quantities of the lariat intermediate and excised lariat. A second approach to the isolation of a homogeneous spliceosome population uses complementary 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides to block RNA-RNA interactions that are necessary at a specific assembly step and thus trap a defined intermediate form of the complex(16Ryder U. Sproat B. Lamond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7373-7379Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Barabino S. Sproat B. Ryder U. Blencowe B. Lamond A.

Cell. 1989; 58: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the cOmeRNA-U2A oligomer or its 5′-biotinyl equivalent traps the A-complex efficiently, subsequent attempts to purify the A-complex showed U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP contamination. To alleviate this problem we investigated A-complex trapping using cOmeRNA-U4A to destabilize the U4/U6 snRNP (16Ryder U. Sproat B. Lamond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7373-7379Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Blencowe B. Sproat B. Ryder U. Barabino S. Lamond A. Cell. 1989; 59: 531-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and cDNA-U5C, which should block an interaction of stem/loop 1 of U5 snRNA with exons 1 and 2 of the pre-mRNA that is necessary for B- and C-complex formation. DNA/RNA hybrids involving this segment of U5 snRNA are not susceptible to RNase H degradation(44Black D. Pinto A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Splicing reactions were conducted with nuclear extract that had been supplemented with cDNA-U5C alone or with cDNA-U5C, 5′-biotinyl-cOmeRNA-U2A, and cOmeRNA-U4A together as a “triple trap.” Spliceosome complex formation was evaluated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels (Fig. 2C) and the effectiveness of the traps was assessed by the amounts of lariat intermediate and excised lariat that could be detected in denaturing gels (Fig. 2D). It is clear that cDNA-U5C alone is unable to fully block the formation of B- and C-complexes, while the triple trap results in the accumulation of A-complex while allowing no detectable formation of B- or C-complexes and no accumulation of lariat forms. Addition of cOmeRNA-U4A alone also resulted in A-complex accumulation, and allowed formation of only small amounts of lariat products. Purification of the A-complex was based on the absence of other particles of similar size in RNase H-treated and triple trap-blocked trapped splicing extracts. Reaction mixtures of 100, 300, or 750 μl were fractionated on a Superose 6 (HR 10/30) FPLC column adapted for a Waters HPLC system; A-complex eluted in the void volume peak with the bulk of the radiolabeled RNA, while significant amounts of protein and nucleic acid were retarded (Fig. 3A). The void volume peaks were collected as three fractions: early, middle, and late. Fig. 3B shows an electron micrograph of the early fraction from a 100-μl RNase H-treated preparation; a nearly homogeneous population of bipartite particles is seen. To further verify the identity of the preparation as A-complex, early fractions from Superose 6 chromatography of 750-μl reaction mixtures of both RNase H-treated and triple trap blocked preparations were centrifuged through sucrose density gradients. In each case electron micrographs of material in fractions sedimenting at 40-50 S showed homogeneous populations of bipartite particles that were indistinguishable from those seen in the small scale preparations described above. Sample micrographs are shown in Fig. 4. Nondenaturing gel analysis and Northern hybridization showed that the 40-50 S sucrose fraction from the RNase H-treated preparation contained A-complex but no B/C- or E/H-complex, and confirmed the presence of U1 and U2 snRNAs. Portions of the early, middle, and late fractions of the void volume peak were analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5A). It is clear that the early fraction of the peak from the RNase H-treated preparation is highly enriched for A-complex. The triple trap blocking strategy appears somewhat less efficient, but some or all of the E/H-complex in the latter case may result from the destabilization of A-complex by cOmeRNA-U2A; several SAPs that interact with the targetted segment of U2 snRNA are thought to stabilize the interaction of pre-mRNA with the U2 snRNP(45Behrens S.

In addition, the binding of [32P]cOmeRNA-U2A to the A-complex in 100-μl assembly reactions was roughly quantitative when measured after Superose 6 chromatography, but after nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis its binding was markedly reduced. Previous preparations of the A-complex were formed on incomplete pre-mRNAs lacking functional 5′ or 3′ splice sites or used a temporal trap, and it is unclear that U1 and U2 snRNPs were simultaneously bound to the pre-mRNA(11Bennett M.

A 300-μl splicing reaction using cDNA/RNase H-treated nuclear extract was chromatographed on Superose 6 and equal portions of the early fraction were immunoprecipitated. The antibodies used were: anti-U1 (70-kDa), a monoclonal antibody to the 70-kDa protein of U1 snRNP(40Billings P. Allen R. Jensen F. Hoch S. J.

Schoffer K. Wilhelm J. Nyffenegger T. Parisot R. DeRobertis E. Arthr. Rheum. 1982; 25: 1278-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Lührmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar); and an antibody to an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, used as a control. After immunoprecipitation, the bound RNAs were isolated and fractionated on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane. An autoradiograph of the membrane prior to Northern hybridization showed radiolabeled pre-mRNA in the anti-U1 (70-kDa) and anti-SM immunoprecipitates, but not the control. Exposures of the same membrane are shown after successive Northern hybridizations with radiolabeled cDNA-U1A (Fig. 5B) and a mixture of labeled cDNAs U2B, U4D, U5E, and U6B (Fig. 5C). The presence of pre-mRNA, U1 and U2 snRNAs, but not U4, U5, or U6 snRNAs, is apparent prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 5). More important, the presence of these three components in the sample immunopreciptated with anti-U1 (70-kDa) antibodies (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 3) indicates that the A-complex in our preparation is composed of U1 and U2 snRNPs bound to the pre-mRNA. Electron micrographs of the A-complex show bipartite particles in a limited number of orientations, as illustrated in the gallery of Fig. 6. In the “double carbon” or “sandwich” technique we used the sample lies between two carbon films; the particles measure about 230 x 270 Å, and they are seen in a limited number of projections. In the most common view, a line of stain separates the ovoid particle into two sections, one of which is slightly smaller than the other. We have arbitrarily arranged the Figure to show the stain line horizontally, with the smaller segment of the particle to the top. The relative size of the two sections shows some variation; we interpret this as due to limited rotation of the particle about its horizontal axis. The separation between the two sections is also somewhat variable, sometimes resulting in the appearance of a small cavity near one end of the stain line or a larger separation of the two components at one end of the horizontal line. The particles also appear in two views that are mirror images of one another; these can arise if one region of the A-complex is preferentially adsorbed to the carbon surface and the carbon is folded over itself to trap the particles in the carbon sandwich. These enantiomorphic views are most easily seen in comparison of the images in columns A and B of rows 3 and 4 in Fig. 6.

While cis-acting regions involved in basal and tissue-specific control of the apoE gene have been identified by promoter mapping studies, much less is known about factors that regulate the gene. In this study, we demonstrate that the region between −94 and −84 upstream of transcriptional start site of the human apoE gene contains a binding site for the transcriptional repressor factor BEF-1, a tyrosine-phosphorylated nuclear protein that was first identified in HeLa cells. Using gel retardation assays, we show that HeLa cell-derived BEF-1 binds the apoE BEF-1 homology, and this binding can be competed with the prototype BEF-1 sequence, but not by a mutated sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the apoE- producing human liver HepG2 cell produces significant levels of BEF-1, which could bind to both the prototype BEF-1 sequence and the apoE homology, and be competed equivalently with cold BEF-1 or apoE homology. To determine if BEF-1 affected the expression of apoE, we performed competition experiments using plasmids containing the intact or mutated BEF-1 homology. The introduction of the intact BEF-1 site into HepG2 cells resulted in an induction of apoE mRNA, whereas control and mutated BEF-1-containing plasmids had no significant effect. We also found that increasing the level of nuclear BEF-1 by treatment of cells with orthovanadate resulted in a reduction in the level of apoE mRNA. Overall, our data suggest that the endogenous apoE gene in the human HepG2 cell line is repressed by the trans-acting influence of nuclear factor BEF-1.

There is mounting evidence that apoE plays a major protective role in the development of arteriosclerosis.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8300-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have identified a sequence homology to the binding site for the nuclear factor BEF-1, a transcriptional repressor. BEF-1 is a member of the NF-1 family of nuclear factors and was first identified as a transcriptional repressor within the enhancer of human BK virus(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J.

Both the level and binding activity of this factor have been shown to be regulated via intracellular signaling, as demonstrated by effects mediated through the viral oncogene E1a and through tyrosine phosphorylation(21Reifel-Miller A.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the potential role of the BEF-1 transcription factor in regulating the expression of apoE in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. We show that the BEF-1 homology in the apoE regulatory region binds to BEF-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HepG2 cells produce BEF-1 and that it binds both to the prototype BEF-1 binding site and to the BEF-1 site in the apoE promoter region with similar affinity. Following the transfection of plasmids containing BEF-1 binding sites into HepG2 cells to reduce available BEF-1, we show a concomitant induction of apoE mRNA. Conversely, increasing the level of intracellular BEF-1 resulted in a reduction of apoE mRNA. These data suggest that the expression of human apoE is regulated by the binding of the nuclear repressor factor BEF-1 at or near previously described positive cis-regulatory elements. pATBEF-1 and pATBEF-7 were constructed as described (21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by first ligating the phosphorylated oligonucleotides BEF-1 or BEF-7 (Fig. 1) with T4 DNA ligase. The ends of the ligated BEF-1 and BEF-7 oligonucleotides were then treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and cloned into the Klenow treated BamHI site of pAT153 (24Twigg A.J. Sherratt D. Nature. 1980; 283: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) creating pATBEF-1 and pATBEF-7, respectively. Following plasmid purification, the number of oligonucleotides present in pATBEF-1 and pATBEF-7 was determined. HepG2 cells were maintained in a medium comprised of a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12. The basal medium was supplemented with 10 nM selenium, 50 μM 2-aminoethanol, 20 mM HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. One day prior to transfection, HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/100-mm dish. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitates were prepared according to Wigler et al.(25Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) using 5-20 μg of pAT153, pATBEF-1, or pATBEF-7(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mock-transfections contained the calcium phosphate precipitation buffer and no DNA. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitates were allowed to form for 45 min and added to the culture plates. Each 100 mM culture dish received from 2.5-10 μg of DNA. The calcium phosphate DNA precipitates remained on the culture plates for 24 h before the medium was changed. Total RNA was isolated as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63230) Google Scholar) 96 h post-transfection using the Biotecx Ultraspec RNA isolation system. ApoE mRNA levels were analyzed by the ribonuclease protection assay (27Azrolan N. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Ambion RPA II Kit and an antisense riboprobe synthesized to the 3′ end of apoE. To control for the amount of RNA used in the ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) an antisense riboprobe synthesized to the 3′ end of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or actin was used. The 3′ antisense apoE riboprobe was prepared by first synthesizing a full-length apoE cDNA with EcoRI ends by polymerase chain reaction from poly(A) selected human liver RNA. The apoE cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM3Z (Promega) to make pGEM3Z-19A. pGEM3Z-19A was purified, digested with StuI, and the 3351-base pair fragment comprised of the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter positioned to synthesize run-off transcripts of the 3′ end of apoE was isolated and purified using the Bio-Rad Prep-A-Gene DNA purification kit. The 3′ antisense apoE riboprobe was transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP using the Promega Riboprobe Gemini II kit to produce a 336-nucleotide transcript which would protect a 265-base fragment. An antisense riboprobe to the 3′ end of GAPDH was similarly prepared to use as a control for the amount of RNA in the RPA. The cDNA for GAPDH was obtained from the ATCC cloned in pHcGAP(28Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). A 548-base pair XbaI to HindIII fragment of the 3′ end of GAPDH was cloned into the XbaI to HindIII site of the pGEM4Z (Promega) polylinker to make pGEM4Z-GAPDH. PGEM4Z-GAPDH was linearized with HindIII and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP using the Promega Riboprobe Gemini II kit to produce a 580-nucleotide transcript which would protect a 543-base fragment. The actin probe pTRI-actin-125-human was obtained from Ambion. The protected fragments were resolved on 5% TBE (0.1 M Tris, 0.09 M boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.4)-urea-polyacrylamide MiniPlus SepraGels (Integrated Separation Systems), and the apoE, and GAPDH or actin RNA levels from each culture condition were quantitated from the dried gels using the Betascope 603 Blot Analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA). The data presented are the result of three transfections. For each individual transfection, RPA analysis was performed in triplicate. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells as described by Dignam et al. (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The probes used for these assays (shown in Fig. 1) were BEF-1, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a previously identified BKV-P2 repressor binding site (21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and ABEF-1, a double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing a section of the regulatory region of human apoE which encompasses the apoE BEF-1 binding site. The oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). Nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.2-0.3 pmol of probe (approximately 10,000 cpm) at 25°C for 30 min. The 10-μl reaction mixture also contained 200 ng of poly(dI-dC)̇poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 15% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Following the 30-min incubation, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% low ionic strength polyacrylamide gel as described by Fried and Crothers (30Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). After the gel was dried, the proteiṅDNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography and were quantitated using the Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA). The prototype BEF-1 site and the homologous sequence present in the upstream regulatory region of human apoE are shown in Fig. 1. The apoE gene regulatory region contains a span of 14 base pairs of homology with two mismatches to the underlined prototype binding sequence. Both sequences begin with the TGA triplet previously shown to be essential for high affinity binding of BEF-1(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the BEF-1-like binding site in the apoE regulatory region was capable of binding BEF-1, we performed gel mobility retardation competition assays using oligonucleotides representing the prototype (BEF-1 oligonucleotide) and apoE BEF-1 (ABEF-1 oligonucleotide) binding sites, and a mutated binding site (BEF-7) containing a TGA to CTC change previously shown to substantially lower the affinity for BEF-1(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these studies we used HeLa cell nuclear extracts, which contain high levels of BEF-1(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the prototype BEF-1 binding site as a probe, a predominate proteiṅDNA complex was formed following incubation with HeLa nuclear extract containing BEF-1 (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 6, and 11). Lanes 2-5, lanes 7-10, and lanes 12-15 show the result of a titration of from 1.25- to 25-fold molar excess of cold BEF-7, ABEF-1, and BEF-1, respectively, into the BEF-1 binding reaction. As shown, cold ABEF-1 and BEF-1 competed the proteiṅDNA complex, whereas BEF-7, containing the mutated BEF-1 binding site, competed poorly. Similar competition experiments have been repeated with identical results using ABEF-1 as the probe with BEF-1, ABEF-1, and BEF-7 as the competitors (data not shown). These data suggest that the apoE BEF-1-like binding site is indeed capable of binding BEF-1. As reported previously (21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for BEF-7 and BEF-1, ABEF-1 (Fig. 2) also competes for the unidentified high molecular weight smear (seen above B1 in Fig. 2). To determine if the apoE-producing HepG2 cell line also produced BEF-1, we isolated nuclear extracts and performed gel mobility retardation assays, using both the prototype BEF-1 sequence and the apoE BEF-1 homology labeled to the same specific activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, the prototype BEF-1 oligonucleotide (lanes 2) bound a single major nuclear protein in the HepG2 cells. Moreover, the ABEF-1 oligonucleotide (lanes 3) formed a proteiṅDNA complex of the same mobility. Both bands could be competed with cold BEF-1 oligonucleotide, but not by BEF-7 (data not shown). With increasing concentration of HepG2 cell nuclear extract, we observed a concentration-dependent increase in nuclear factor binding to both probes, and upon quantitation, the amount of complex formation was the same. As shown by the competition experiment in Fig. 3B, both cold BEF-1 and ABEF-1 oligonucleotides gave an identical concentration response profile for inhibiting the major HepG2 nuclear protein bound to the apoE sequence. These data suggest that the HepG2 cell line produces BEF-1 and, as observed with HeLa cell BEF-1, the HepG2 protein binds with similar affinity to both the prototype BEF-1 binding sequence and the apoE BEF-1 homology. The minor bands observed migrating below the major HepG2 BEF-1 complex were not identified, but previous studies in HeLa cells have demonstrated the these bands represent minor interactions of the BEF-1 site with NF-1 family members(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because BEF-1 has been identified as a transcriptional repressor, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that apoE expression in HepG2 cells is under negative regulation by BEF-1. Previously, we demonstrated that titration of a plasmid containing the BEF-1 binding site into a cell could inhibit BEF-1 function by competing out the BEF-1 repressor protein, allowing expression to become de-repressed(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HepG2 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing multiple copies of the BEF-1 binding site (pATBEF-1), and 96 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, total RNA was isolated, and the level of apoE mRNA was determined by RPA analysis using a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe to the 3′ end of human apoE. A 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe to the 3′ end of GAPDH was used as an internal control in each RPA analysis. The effect of the parent plasmid without the BEF-1 binding sites (pAT153) and of a plasmid containing multiple copies of the mutated BEF-1 binding site (pATBEF-7) on apoE mRNA levels was also determined. Fig. 4 shows the effect of introducing competing BEF-1 sites on apoE mRNA level as a percentage increase over the control plasmid pAT153. In repeated experiments, apoE mRNA levels were 40-70% higher in the cells which were transfected with pATBEF-1 (contains the BEF-1 binding site) than from mock-transfected cells or from cells that were transfected with the control plasmid pAT153. Moreover, there was very little induction with pATBEF-7, containing the mutated site that binds BEF-1 poorly. These results provide strong evidence that apoE is under repression in HepG2 cells and that the repression is mediated through BEF-1 binding to the BEF-1 binding site in the apoE regulatory region. Having shown that introducing competing binding sites in the cell could increase apoE mRNA by titration of BEF-1, we sought to demonstrate that increasing BEF-1 in the cell would result in a concomitant decrease in apoE mRNA. Because the binding of BEF-1 has been shown to be controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation, experiments were performed to determine if treatment of cells with vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine-specific phosphatase activity, would increase the pool of active BEF-1. As shown in Fig. 5, we observed an approximate 50% increase in the level of BEF-1 in cells treated with vanadate. When we compared the level of apoE message in untreated and vanadate-treated cells, we observed a 40-50% decrease in apoE mRNA following vanadate treatment, providing further evidence that human apoE is under negative control by the BEF-1 repressor factor. In this study we have shown that the gene for human apoE in human liver HepG2 cells is under negative regulation, specifically mediated through the interaction of the nuclear factor BEF-1 with a specific DNA sequence upstream of the cap site. How BEF-1 might act as a repressor factor in the upstream regulatory region of apoE is not clear, and until we understand what factors bind to previously mapped elements in the upstream regulatory region (18Smith J.D.

Of relevance to this study, deletion mutagenesis experiments by Smith et al.(18Smith J.D. Melian A. Leff T. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8300-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested two positively acting elements between −103 to −84, one of which partially overlaps with the apoE BEF-1 site. Possibly BEF-1 acts by competing for or displacing the adjacent positively acting factors(s), a situation similar to the previously observed overlap of the BEF-1 site with an NF-1 site in the enhancer of BK virus(21Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The balance between various positive and negatively acting factors plays a critical role in controlling the developmental and tissue-specific expression of genes, and with regard to apoE, the nuclear repressor factor BEF-1 appears at least in part to play a role in determining expression of this lipoprotein. Studies to date have provided substantial evidence for a protective role of apoE in the development of atherosclerosis. Thus, understanding how factors such as BEF-1 control apoE regulation may lead to future strategies for the development of agents to modulate the expression of this important lipoprotein.

INTRODUCTIONIt has been reported that acid secretion is regulated by second messenger pathways; histamine-stimulated acid secretion appears to be mediated by an increase in cellular cAMP (1Soll A.H. Wollin A. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: E444-E450PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chew C.S. Hersey J. Sachs G. Berglindh T. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 238: G312-G320PubMed Google Scholar) and cholinergic stimulation to be mediated by an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration(3Chew C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is also reported that protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors reverse the inhibition of parietal cell secretion by transforming growth factor-α(4Tsunoda Y. Modlin I.M. Goldenring J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G351-G356PubMed Google Scholar). However, there has been no direct evidence to show that phosphorylation of sites other than the aspartic acid residues (involved catalytic cycle) is present in H+,K+-ATPase. The presence of a sequence of Arg-Arg-X-Ser near the carboxyl-terminal α-chains of H+,K+-ATPase (5Maeda M. Ishizaki J. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggested that a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates the enzyme as shown in Na+,K+-ATPase(6Carlsson T.M.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate whether some kinase-dependent phosphorylation occurs in H+,K+-ATPase, enzyme preparations were incubated with ATP, Mg2+, and vanadate. The data indicated that two Tyr residues, Tyr7 and Tyr10, present in the amino-terminal domain of the α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase (5Maeda M. Ishizaki J. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were sites of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by some membrane-bound tyrosine kinase and phosphatase.MATERIALS AND METHODSVesicles containing pig stomach H+,K+-ATPase (G1 fraction) were prepared, lyophilized, and stored in the presence of 250 mM sucrose containing 0.5 mM EGTA-Tris, pH 7.3, at −80°C(10Chang H. Saccomani G. Rabon E. Schackmann R. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 464: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); the specific activities of H+,K+-ATPase were 200-300 μmol/mg/h at 37°C. Concentrations of protein with bovine plasma albumin as a standard and the amount of phosphoenzyme and Pi were estimated as described(11Eguchi H. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).To phosphorylate H+,K+-ATPase preparations, lyophilized leaky vesicles or SDS-purified enzymes were incubated at 25°C in a final volume of 0.1-4 ml of buffer containing 30 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.3, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μM cAMP, 1 mM Na3VO4, 7.4% sucrose, 0.4 mg/ml enzyme protein, and 2 mM [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.). Phosphorylation was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and stopped with an equal volume of sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.00125% bromphenol blue for SDS gel electrophoresis using 10 or 18% polyacrylamide gels(12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted to Immobilon (0.45 μm, Millipore), using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) in buffer A (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at pH 8.3) under a constant current of 150 mA for 18 h at 10°C. Phosphotyrosine was identified with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Wako) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed). Blots were developed using Konica Immunostaining HRP-1000. The radioactivity of each band on the SDS gel was detected using an Image Plate (Fuji) and BASS 2000 system (Fuji). When biochemical properties of phosphorylated H+,K+-ATPase had to be studied, phosphorylation reactions were interrupted to remove phosphorylating substrates by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 5 min at 0°C (Optima, TLA 100.3, Beckman). 1) For tryptic digestion (1.5 mg of phosphorylated protein/ml, 25 mM imidazole HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM ATP-Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, and 15 μg of Sigma TPCK1( 1The abbreviations used are: TPCKtosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketoneHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. )-trypsin/ml at 37°C) and the isolation of phosphopeptides as well as for the dephosphorylation experiment, the precipitates were suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 250 mM sucrose and centrifuged again. These procedures were repeated two more times. The precipitates were suspended and homogenized to give around 3 mg of protein/ml, stored at −4°C, and used within a few days. 2) For reactivating activities of H+,K+-ATPase and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase inhibited by vanadate, the precipitates were suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 250 mM sucrose, 0.5 M NaCl, and 50 mM cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid-Tris, pH 7.4, and incubated at 0°C for 5 h and centrifuged. These procedures were repeated three times. The precipitates were suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 250 mM sucrose and centrifuged. These procedures were repeated two more times, and the membranes were suspended as described above.To analyze phosphoamino acid formed in the α-chain, the corresponding band stained with Coomassie Blue was cut out and suspended with 2 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% SDS in seamless cellulose tubing (size 18/32, Viskase Sales Corp) and electroeluted in the same buffer using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) under a constant current of 150 mA for 18 h. The α-chains thus extracted were separated by a refrigerated centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 10 min (05PR-2, Hitachi) after adding methanol to a final concentration of 80%. The resulting supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 10 min to precipitate the α-chain. The precipitates were solubilized with 2% SDS and hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under a vacuum for 2 h at 100°C. The sample was concentrated under a vacuum. The dried sample and the standard phosphoamino acids from Sigma (phosphoserine (Ser(P)) and phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))) were dissolved with H2O and spotted on filter paper (Toyo no. 50, size 30 × 30 cm). The sample was electrophoresed at 0°C in a buffer containing 2.2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid, pH 2.0, under a constant voltage of 2000 V for 180 min using a high voltage paper electrophoresis apparatus (Fujiox). The paper was dried, and the sample was subjected to electrophoresis in the perpendicular direction under 2000 V for 120 min in a buffer containing 5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine, pH 3.5. The radioactivity was detected as described above and Ser(P) and Tyr(P) were detected by ninhydrin reaction.Sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A gas-phase sequencer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were identified on an Applied Biosystems 120A analyzer.All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTime Course of 32P Incorporation into the Enzyme PreparationsAddition of [γ-32P]ATP to the H+,K+-ATPase preparations (G1 fraction) in the presence of Mg2+ and vanadate induced a rather slow incorporation of 32P to the G1 fraction to give 1.5 nmol/mg of protein with a t of around 20 min (Fig. 1A, open circles). Washing of the G1 fraction by suspension and ultracentrifugation with 20 mM Tris-HCl containing 250 mM sucrose had little influence on the incorporation of 32P in the presence of Mg2+ and vanadate. These data suggested the presence of membrane-bound kinase in the preparations. To investigate this point further, H+,K+-ATPase was partially purified by mild SDS treatment (0.2%) followed by a sucrose density gradient. The treatment increased both the specific activity of H+,K+-ATPase and the amount of phosphorylated intermediates to around 1.5-fold in the absence of vanadate (not shown), removed the time-dependent slow 32P incorporation observed in the G1 fraction, and revealed the presence of rather rapid (t < 2 min) incorporation giving 0.5 nmol/mg of protein (Fig. 1A, closed circles) in the presence of vanadate.To investigate whether incorporation occurred in H+,K+-ATPase, the ATPase preparations were phosphorylated in the presence of vanadate as described above and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. The G1 fraction gave three clear 32P-labeled bands: a 96-kDa peptide (α-chain) and two low molecular weight bands (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Although the G1 fraction was phosphorylated in the absence of vanadate to give three 32P-labeled bands, the extent of phosphorylation was reduced to below 0.1 (not shown). In the following experiments, vanadate was always included. The presence of cAMP was shown to have little influence on the amount of 32P incorporation. The enzyme partially purified by SDS showed no radioactivity either in the α-chain or in the low molecular weight protein band observed in the G1 fraction. It gave only the fastest moving band, the lowest molecular weight band (Fig. 1B, lane 4), which was assumed to be phospholipids because of the lack of reactivity to Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). The presence of only one radioactive band suggested that rapid incorporation into this band occurred (Fig. 1A, closed circles).The incorporation into the α-chain does not reflect the aspartylphosphate intermediate of the H+,K+-ATPase reaction, because it does not survive the alkaline conditions of SDS-gel electrophoresis (13Buss J.E. Stull J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the incorporation into the partially purified H+,K+-ATPase by SDS did not occur (Fig. 1B, lane 4).To determine phosphoamino acids formed, SDS gels containing the phosphorylated α-chain were cut out, treated with acid, and subjected to paper electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). The data clearly showed that the α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase from G1 preincubated with [γ-32P]ATP, Mg2+, and vanadate contained mainly 32P-labeled Tyr(P). The radioactivity of 32P-Ser was below 0.1 of that of 32P-labeled Tyr(P). A radioactive spot not identified seemed to be due to the incomplete hydrolysis of phosphopeptides. To investigate whether Tyr(P) residues had been present before the preincubation, reactivity to a phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was examined without or with preincubation. Reactivity to the Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody was detected only after the incubation of the G1 fraction with ATP (Fig. 2, right panel).Figure 2:Reactivity of phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase. The phosphorylations of 40 μg of protein from G1 and SDS-treated, partially purified H+,K+-ATPase were carried out at the indicated times. Then samples were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon and stained with Coomassie Blue (left) or enzyme-linked immunoassay (right) as described in the text. P-Tyr, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data clearly showed that the G1 fraction contained a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylated the Tyr residues in the α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase. Some preliminary experiments suggested that the tyrosine kinase was associated with the membranes and the mild SDS treatment inactivated the activity (Fig. 2, right panel).No significant change was detected in the Vmax values of H+,K+-ATPase and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activities under optimal assay conditions before and after the phosphorylation. During the preparation of this paper, it was reported that protein kinase C phosphorylated the α-chain of rat kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (1 mol of 32P/mol of Na+,K+-ATPase) without a direct effect on the ATPase Vmax(9Feschenko M.S.

However, more experiments are needed because enzymatic dephosphorylations might occur in the presence of Mg2+ as shown in H+,K+-ATPase as described below.Time-dependent Dephosphorylation of the α-ChainThe presence of some phosphatase in the G1 fraction was suggested because vanadate increased the amount of incorporation markedly as described above. To investigate this point, the phosphorylated G1 fraction was incubated with or without Mg2+ and with non-phosphorylated G1 with Mg2+ at 30°C. Aliquots of enzyme preparations were then subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 showed the disappearance of the radioactivity in the α-chain was rather slow (A), accelerated by Mg2+ (B), and occurred almost completely by the G1 with Mg2+ (C). Little change was observed in the radioactivity with time in two other low molecular weight bands such as shown in Fig. 1B, lane 3.Figure 3:Dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine from the α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase. The G1 fraction phosphorylated for 90 min was washed as described in the text, and 10 μg of phosphorylated and washed protein was incubated in 0.1 ml of solution containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, and 10 mM dithiothreitol with 5 mM EDTA-Tris (A), or with 10 mM Mg2+ (B) or with 10 μg of nonphosphorylated G1 and 10 mM Mg2+ (C) for the indicated time at 30°C. Each sample was subjected to autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data suggested that Tyr(P) present in the α-chain was hydrolyzed by a membrane-bound Mg2+-activated phosphatase, because the G1 fraction was prepared by sucrose density gradient (10Chang H. Saccomani G. Rabon E. Schackmann R. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 464: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and washed by suspension and ultracentrifugation several times as described.TPCK-trypsin Digestion of Phosphorylated α-Chain and Isolation of a Phosphopeptide and the Amino Acid SequenceTo determine the site of Tyr(P) residues in the α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase, 0.01 weight of TPCK-trypsin was added to the phosphorylated G1 fraction. Samples were taken at various times and were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. The radioactivity due to 32P-labeled Tyr(P) residues in the α-chain disappeared within 1 min (Fig. 4A, right panel) irrespective of the presence of a large amount of Coomassie Blue stained band corresponding to the α-chain (Fig. 4A, left panel) when the concentration of the gel was increased and the 32P-phosphopeptides appeared near the dye front only after TPCK-trypsin treatment (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Effect of TPCK-trypsin treatment on the liberation of 32P-peptides from the α-chain. Phosphorylated G1 was treated with TPCK-trypsin as described in the text for the indicated times, and samples were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis.

Autoradiograms near dye front without staining were shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To isolate phosphopeptides, TPCK-trypsin-treated samples were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 5 min. The radioactivity present in the α-chain was almost completely recovered in the supernatant. The supernatant was subjected to Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. A single peak of 32P-peptide, smaller than that of insulin, appeared (Fig. 5A), but a reversed-phase chromatography of the peak fraction gave two peaks with similar radioactivities (Fig. 5B, bottom). Each peak, peak I and peak II, was further purified using a Resource column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) under neutral (Fig. 5C) and acidic (Fig. 5D) conditions, respectively, each of which gave a single peak with respect to the radioactivity and the absorbance. Recovery of 32P-peptide in each purification step was around 60-80%, and the aliquot of each sample was sequenced.Figure 5:Purification of tryptic phosphopeptide by Sephadex G-50 and HPLC columns. The phosphorylation of G1 and the treatment with TPCK-trypsin for 5 min are described in the text. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was applied to a Sephadex G-50 superfine column (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with an elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). A, radioactivity and optical density were measured in each 0.5-ml fraction obtained at a flow rate 20 ml/h. B, radioactive tryptic fragments obtained as in A were applied to a C18 reversed-phase column (Biofine BRC-SC18, 4.6 × 250 mm, Japan Spectroscopic Co. Ltd.) equilibrated with 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 20 mM Na2SO4 and were eluted by increasing the concentration of acetonitrile in the buffer (0-100 min; 0-40%) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. C, the radioactive fraction eluted from the column (B) at a retention time of 36-40 min (peak 1) was applied to a C18 reversed-phase column (ResourceTM RPC, 3-ml column, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 20 mM Na2SO4 and eluted with a linear concentration gradient of acetonitrile in the buffer (0-150 min; 0-30%) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The peak fractions were concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator VC-60 (Taiyo) to remove acetonitrile and further applied to a C18 reversed-phase precolumn (Lichrolut RP-18, Merck). The column was washed with 1 ml of 0.15% pyridine/acetate, pH 7.0, to remove salts, and the peptide was eluted with the buffer containing 40% acetonitrile. D, trifluoroacetic acid was added to the second radioactive fraction at a retention time of 44-50 min (B, bottom) to give pH 3. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 10 min was applied to a ResourceTM RPC column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptides were eluted with a linear concentration gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0-5 min, 0-10%; 5-150 min, 10-60%) at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amino acid sequence of these two peaks was shown (Fig. 6, top) to be Gly-Lys-Ala-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Gln-. From comparison of the sequence deduced from cDNA from pig stomach(5Maeda M. Ishizaki J. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the sequence was shown to be the same as the amino-terminal sequence of the α-chain of H+,K+-ATPase, except that the initial Met1 was absent; mature H+,K+-ATPase may lack the Met. Comparison of the amounts of amino acids recovered in each Edman cycle in peak I showed 1 order of magnitude decreases in the recovery of both Tyr7 and Tyr10 preceding the increase in recovery of Glu8 and Gln11, respectively. However, the amount of amino acid recovered in the peak II clearly showed a 1 order of magnitude decrease in the recovery of only Tyr10 preceding the increase in recovery of Gln11. Such a decrease in the recovery of the Tyr residue was not present in the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of column-purified α-chain(14Lane L.K. Kirley T.L. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which was the same as the present data except Gly2 was absent. Although trypsin was reported to split between Lys47 and Asp48 and Arg673 and Ala674 in the α-chain(15Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), splitting of other bonds from Gly2 to Lys47 is highly possible because of the presence of 10 Lys and 1 Arg residues (Fig. 6, bottom). There are only two Tyr residues (Tyr7 and Tyr10) present from Gly2 to Lys47(5Maeda M. Ishizaki J. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); the molecular weights of both peptides were apparently smaller than insulin (Fig. 5A). These data clearly show that both Tyr7 and Tyr10 are sites of phosphorylation by a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase. The presence of two phosphopeptides with nearly the same total radioactivities containing both Tyr(P)7 and Tyr(P)10 (peak I) and Tyr(P)10 (peak II) was confirmed with increasing the concentration of [γ-32P]ATP to 4 mM.Figure 6:Amino acid sequence of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptides of pig stomach α-subunits of H+,K+-ATPase and alignment of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase.

The ratio of the total count of peak I to that of peak II increased from 0.5 at 20 min to 1 at 90 min. The data indicated the phosphorylation of Tyr10 occurred preceding that of Tyr7.The incorporation of 32P into the α-chain was around 0.7 mol/mol of phosphointermediates from ATP. If both residues were fully phosphorylated, it would be 2 mol/mol of phosphointermediate, because the enzymes did not contain Tyr(P) residues without preincubation with ATP (Fig. 2, right panel). One reason for this difference may be due to a phosphatase activity (Fig. 3).Some Similarity of the Amino-terminal Domain of the α-Subunits in H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPaseAmino acid sequences of the α-subunits of pig stomach H+,K+-ATPase (5Maeda M.

Although the Ser16 is not present in H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 6, bottom), there are two Ser residues in between Tyr10 and Ser27.Phosphorylations of amino acid residues can decrease the net charge by increasing two negative charge/phosphate groups at neutral pH. It may be possible that the dynamic change in the electrostatic interactions within the amino-terminal domain in the α-chain or with other domains on the same or on other proteins or phospholipids can be modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation for some regulatory mechanisms in both ATPases. Further studies are needed to clarify the details.

However, there has been no direct evidence to show that phosphorylation of sites other than the aspartic acid residues (involved catalytic cycle) is present in H+,K+-ATPase. The presence of a sequence of Arg-Arg-X-Ser near the carboxyl-terminal α-chains of H+,K+-ATPase (5Maeda M. Ishizaki J. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

INTRODUCTIONBiosynthetic maturation of bioactive peptides in the neural and endocrine system involves a variety of post-translational processing steps during transit of precursor proteins through the secretory compartments(1Sossin W.S.

Endoproteolytic cleavage and removal of COOH-terminal basic amino acids take place initially in the trans-Golgi network (TGN),1( 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkPAMpeptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenasePHMpeptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenasePALpeptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyaseDMEM/F-12Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture F-12 mixed in equal volumesTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisECLenhanced chemiluminiscenceERendoplasmic reticulumEndo Hendoglycosidase H.) continue in secretory granules and often result in the production of COOH-terminal Gly-extended peptides that are subsequently α-amidated to produce active peptides. Peptide α-amidation is often rate-limiting and essential for generating bioactive peptides(3Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 4Bradbury A.F. Smyth D.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 112-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Peptide α-amidation is a two-step reaction catalyzed in sequence by monooxygenase and lyase domains contained in a bifunctional enzyme, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM; EC 1.14.17.3). The first step of the reaction is catalyzed by peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and requires copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen; the second step is catalyzed by peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase (PAL) and generates α-amidated peptide and glyoxylate(5Eipper B.A. Perkins S.N.

This modification is a late step in the maturation of bioactive peptides beginning in the TGN after endo- and exoproteolytic cleavages but occurring mostly in secretory granules(3Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A.

The compartments in which specific processing events occur are determined by the maturation/activation of the enzymes, restricted localization of the enzymes, availability of substrate, and the physicochemical milieu of the compartments such as pH, divalent cations, and cofactors(11Fisher J.M.

First, PAM protein is targeted to the secretory granules when expressed in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells(23Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and PAM proteins are enriched in dense core vesicles in the central nervous system(24Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Second, proopiomelanocortin-derived α-amidated joining peptide immunoreactivity is detected in the TGN and secretory granules (10). Third, the TGN and secretory granules are the compartments in which Gly-extended peptide substrates and optimum pH are available.Although PAM proteins are subjected to glycosylation, sialylation, sulfation, and endoproteolytic processing(23Milgram S.L.

Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2579-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), little is known about where in the secretory compartment newly synthesized PAM proteins become enzymatically active. To address this question, we attached the ER retention/retrieval signal, KDEL, or an inactive homologue, KDEV (28), to the COOH terminus of a bifunctional soluble PAM protein (PAM-3) (Fig. 1). Both proteins were examined in stably transfected non-neuroendocrine cells (hEK-293) and neuroendocrine cells (AtT-20). We found that the PAM-3-KDEL protein was efficiently retained in the ER in both cell types and that ER-retained PAM-3-KDEL protein had enzyme activities similar to those of wild type PAM-3 and PAM-3-KDEV. Thus, acquisition of enzyme activities by PAM does not require transit beyond the cis-Golgi network.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid ConstructionpBluescript plasmids encoding PAM-3 with COOH-terminal KDEL or KDEV sequences were created using the polymerase chain reaction; pBS.KrPAM-3 was amplified using a sense primer in the PAL domain (nucleotides 2517-2533) and an antisense primer with an XbaI site (boldface) and codons for KDEL or KDEV following the COOH-terminal end of PAM-3 (underlined): 5′-CCTCTA-GACTACAGCTCGTCCTTGGAGGAAGGTGCAGGCTT-3′ for KDEL and 5′-CCTCTAGACTACACCTCGTCCTTGGAGGAAGGTGCAGGCTT-3′ for KDEV.

The cDNA region derived from polymerase chain reaction was verified by sequencing. The KrPAM-3-KDEL and KrPAM-3-KDEV cDNA was inserted into the pCIS.2CXXNH expression vector by ligation of the Bsp106I/XbaI fragment of pBS.KrPAM-3-KDEL or pBS.KrPAM-3-KDEV and the Bsp106I/XbaI vector fragment of pCIS.KrPAM-3.Cell Culture and TransfectionhEK-293 cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal clone serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics at 37°C in 5% CO2 as described(23Milgram S.L.

The apparent molecular masses of the immunoprecipitated proteins were determined by comparison with prestained molecular weight standards (Rainbow standards; Amersham Corp.). Densitometric analyses were performed using an Abaton Scan 300/GS linked to an Apple Macintosh IIci and NIH Image 1.35 software (National Institute of Mental Health). N-glycanase and endoglycosidase H treatment of immunoprecipitated PAM proteins were performed as described(27Maltese J.-Y.

We chose KDEV as a control sequence since it was inactive in ER retention and had no effect on normal secretion and processing when attached to the COOH terminus of proneuropeptide Y(28Andres D.A. Rhodes J.D. Meisel R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14277-14282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the COOH-terminal KDEL sequence on the intracellular distribution of PAM-3, transfected cells were fixed, permeabilized, and visualized with a PAM antibody. Both hEK-293 and AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-3-KDEL showed a typical ER-staining pattern with a diffuse, reticular network-like pattern extending throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and E). In contrast, hEK-293 and AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-3-KDEV protein exhibited staining patterns similar to those of wild type PAM-3 in the same cell type (Fig. 2, B, C and F, G)(23Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol.

PAM-3-KDEV expressed in hEK-293 cells exhibited concentrated staining in the perinuclear region, overlapping but more diffuse than a Golgi marker, wheat germ hemagglutinin. In transfected AtT-20 cells, PAM-3-KDEV displayed punctate staining throughout the cell body with concentrated staining at the tips of processes and some staining in the perinuclear region.Figure 2:Immunofluorescence staining. hEK-293 cells (A-D) and AtT-20 cells (E-H) expressing PAM-3-KDEL (A and E), PAM-3-KDEV (B and F), PAM-3 (C and G), or no exogenous PAM (D and H) were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody to PAL (antibody 471; 1:1500; A, B, E, and F) or to PHM (antibody 475; 1:1500; C, D, G, and H) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; CalTag, San Francisco, CA). Scalebar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the effect of addition of the KDEL sequence on the trafficking of PAM-3, hEK-293 cells expressing PAM-3-KDEL or PAM-3-KDEV were incubated with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 15 min (pulse) and then incubated with medium containing non-radioactive cysteine (200 μM) and methionine (114 μM) for 2 or 18 h (chase). Cell extracts and chase media collected from each time point were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). After the 15-min pulse, 0.5-1% of the protein synthesized (trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity) could be identified as a 95-kDa PAM-3 protein using antiserum to the PAM COOH-terminal domain. After 2 or 18 h of chase, the newly synthesized PAM-3-KDEL protein was still retained in the cells without significant loss of protein. Very little PAM-3-KDEL protein (<2% of the newly synthesized PAM-3-KDEL) appeared in the chase medium even after an 18-h chase. In contrast, about 50% of the newly synthesized PAM-3-KDEV protein was secreted during the initial 2-h chase. This rate of secretion is similar to the observed rate of constitutive secretion of wild type PAM-3 from transfected hEK-293 cells (30-50% of PAM-3 in the cell/h)(26Yun H.-Y. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10946-10955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2185-2196PubMed Google Scholar). After 18 h of chase, all of the PAM-3-KDEV found in the cell extract after the pulse was recovered in the chase medium with little loss of protein. Thus, the effect of the KDEL sequence on retention of PAM-3 in the cells is specific and efficient.Figure 3:Pulse-chase experiment and endoglycosidase H treatment. A, three identical wells of hEK-293 cells expressing PAM-3-KDEL or PAM-3-KDEV were incubated with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 15 min and harvested (0 h cell) or chased for the indicated times in complete serum-free medium. Equal amounts of cell extracts and chase media were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the COOH-terminal domain of PAM (antibody 571) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. B, selected samples from this and another pulse-chase experiment were immunoprecipitated and subjected to Endo H or N-glycanase (N-gly) treatment; control samples (Con) were from the same incubations without enzymes. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Similar results were obtained in two independent studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PAM-3 contains a single N-linked oligosaccharide at Asn765 in the PAL domain (25Yun H.-Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To test how far the cell-associated PAM-3-KDEL protein progressed through the cell, PAM-3 proteins immunoprecipitated from selected samples of cell extract or medium (Fig. 3A) were digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or N-glycanase (Fig. 3B); acquisition of resistance to digestion with Endo H is diagnostic of transit from the ER to the medial-Golgi compartment(33Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J.A.M. Nature. 1983; 304: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Immediately after the pulse (0 h cell), both newly synthesized PAM-3-KDEL and KDEV proteins were Endo H-sensitive. PAM-3-KDEL remained Endo H-sensitive up to 18 h after its biosynthesis. Thus PAM-3-KDEL protein expressed in hEK-293 cells is efficiently retained in the ER without significant degradation for up to 18 h. In contrast, as expected from its similarity to wild type PAM-3, ~50% of the newly synthesized PAM-3-KDEV protein was Endo H-resistant after a 1.5-h chase. The behavior of PAM-3-KDEV is consistent with its expected similarity to PAM-3, which has a t for ER to Golgi transit of about 1 h in AtT-20 cells(32Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PAM-3-KDEV protein that had been secreted into the medium was completely Endo H-resistant. These results together with immunocytochemistry data clearly demonstrate that PAM-3-KDEL protein is efficiently retained in the ER.In transfected AtT-20 cells, which possess a regulated secretory pathway and secretory granules, PAM-3 protein (95 kDa) is targeted to the secretory granules and cleaved into a 75-kDa bifunctional PAM protein lacking its COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 1)(23Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This endoproteolytic cleavage is blocked upon incubation at 20°C and is thought to occur after exit from the TGN, presumably in immature secretory granules(18Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 737-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-3-KDEL or PAM-3-KDEV were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with PHM antibody (Fig. 4). Extracts from PAM-3-KDEL cells showed only a 95-kDa PAM-3-KDEL protein; no 75-kDa cleavage product was detected, indicating that PAM-3-KDEL protein failed to reach the site where the cleavage normally occurs. Extracts of PAM-3-KDEV cells contained similar amounts of 95-kDa PAM-3-KDEV and 75-kDa PAM derived from cleavage of PAM-3-KDEV. Thus the presence of the COOH-terminal KDEL signal specifically blocked targeting of PAM-3 to the secretory granules.Figure 4:PAM-3-KDEL protein expressed in AtT-20 cells. Extracts of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-3-KDEL or PAM-3-KDEV were assayed for PHM activity, and equal amounts of PHM activity (10, 5, and 2.5 nmol/h) from each extract were analyzed by immunoblot with PHM antibody (antibody 474) and ECL. The PHM specific activities of PAM-3-KDEL and PAM-3-KDEV cell extracts were 1100 to ~1300 and 50 to ~100 pmol/μg/h, respectively. Similar data were observed on two separate set of extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Extracts of PAM-3-KDEL and PAM-3-KDEV AtT-20 cells were assayed for PHM activity. Western blot analysis indicated that samples with approximately equal amounts of PHM activity contained similar amounts of PAM protein (Fig. 4; densitometric values differed by <50% for PAM-3-KDEL and PAM-3-KDEV, n = 8). Since the endoproteolytic cleavage that separates the COOH-terminal domain from PAL affects PHM activity(34Husten E.J. Tausk F.A. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9709-9717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a more detailed analysis of the effect of the KDEL/KDEV sequence on enzymatic activity was carried out in hEK-293 cells, where endoproteolytic cleavages of this type do not occur.hEK-293 cells expressing wild type PAM-3, PAM-3-KDEL, or PAM-3-KDEV were assayed for PHM and PAL activities. To compare the specific activities of wild type and mutant PAM-3 proteins, equal amounts of PHM activity (1 nmol/h) were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A). The amounts of wild type and mutant PAM-3 protein detected by the COOH-terminal domain antibody were almost equal (densitometric values differed by <10% of wild type PAM-3, n = 2), indicating that the PHM specific activities of all three PAM-3 proteins were very similar. The ratios of PAL to PHM activity for PAM-3-KDEL and PAM-3-KDEV (~1.5) were indistinguishable from each other (p < 0.05, n = 4) but were significantly less than the PAL:PHM ratio of wild type PAM-3 (PAL:PHM ~2; p < 0.05, n = 4). Addition of the COOH-terminal KDEL/KDEV tetrapeptide does not cause more than a slight decrease of PAL activity. Thus we conclude that the ER/cis-Golgi network provides an environment sufficient for the maturation of fully active PAM-3 protein.Figure 5:PAM-3-KDEL protein expressed in hEK-293 cells. Extracts of hEK-293 cells expressing wild type PAM-3 (29), PAM-3-KDEL, or PAM-3-KDEV were assayed for PHM and PAL activities.

B, PAL activity/1 nmol/h of PHM activity for each cell extract; errorbars show standard errors obtained from quadruplicate assays. Similar data were observed on two separate sets of extracts. The specific activities of PHM and PAL in extracts of wild type hEK-293 cells were less than 1% of those activities in the transfected cells (29). WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWhen PAM proteins were expressed in neuroendocrine cells (i.e. AtT-20) or in non-neuroendocrine cells lacking a regulated secretory pathway (i.e. hEK-293), active PHM and PAL were produced(23Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2185-2196PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the regulated secretory pathway and secretory granules are not necessary for the maturation of active PAM proteins. For example, the 10 amino acid pro-region of PAM, which is well conserved in evolution, is removed in a post-TGN compartment in AtT-20 cells and is not removed in hEK-293 cells; PHM activity is unaffected by the presence of the pro-region (34). We wanted to identify the compartment in which maturation of PAM occurred. In this study, we created a mutant soluble bifunctional PAM protein with the COOH-terminal KDEL ER retention/retrieval signal (PAM-3-KDEL) to examine the effect of ER retention on enzyme activities. Based on immunofluorescence staining, pulse-chase experiment and Endo H sensitivity, the PAM-3-KDEL protein was efficiently retained in the ER/cis-Golgi network. The ER retention of PAM-3-KDEL was mediated by the genuine KDEL ER retention/retrieval mechanism since attachment of an inactive homologue, KDEV, to PAM-3 had little effect on trafficking of PAM-3.COOH-terminal attachment of the KDEL sequence was sufficient to cause extremely efficient retention/retrieval of PAM-3. In other secretory proteins examined after addition of the KDEL sequence, inefficient ER retention was often observed(35Rose-John S. Schooltink H. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Müllberg J. Heinrich P. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22084-22091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zagouras P. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2633-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Proteins that are efficiently retained in the ER are often distinguished by the presence of acidic amino acid residues upstream of the KDEL sequence(37Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 38Denecke J. De Ryke R. Botterman J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Addition of an acidic amino acid sequence found in an ER resident protein (i.e. protein disulfide isomerase) upstream of a COOH-terminal KDEL signal enhanced the ER retention efficiency of the secretory protein, interleukin-6(36Zagouras P. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2633-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus certain features of upstream sequence, such as acidic residues, may determine the efficiency of recognition by the KDEL receptor, and the acidic residues in the COOH-terminal ~30 amino acid region of PAM-3 (11 of 30 residues"

Kinetic isotope effects (KIE) and equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics (EIEK) have been used to probe the dynamic properties of the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme. Unlike the behavior of the wild-type enzyme, the observed kinetic isotope effect for 13C versus12C at the carbonyl group of carbamoyl phosphate (CP) increased upon the binding of ligands which promote the formation of the R-state (Asp, N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), or ATP). The maximum rate for the [14C]Asp ⇋ Carbamoyl aspartate (CAsp) exchange with the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme was 500-fold slower than for the wild-type enzyme; however, the rate for the [14C]CP ⇋ CAsp exchange was only 50-fold slower, reversing the relative rates observed with the wild-type enzyme. In addition, upon variation of substrate pairs involving Asp or CAsp, loss of inhibition effects in the CP ⇋ CAsp exchange indicated that the Glu-50 → Ala substitution caused the kinetic mechanism for the mutant enzyme to shift from ordered to random. Computer simulations of the EIEK data indicate that the Glu-50 → Ala mutation specifically causes strong decreases in the rates of catalysis and association-dissociation for Asp and CAsp, with minimal effects on the CP and Pi on-off rates. With substrates bound, the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme apparently does not attain a full R-state conformation. The PALA-activated Glu-50 → Ala enzyme, however, exhibits substrate affinities comparable to those for the wild-type enzyme, but fails to restore the preferred order substrate binding.

The T → R quaternary transition involves an expansion of the enzyme by 12 Å along the C3 axis, along with rotations of the catalytic subunits about the 3-fold axis and the regulatory subunits about their respective 2-fold axes. In addition to these quaternary structural changes, there are tertiary conformational changes within both the catalytic and regulatory chains. In particular, during the T- → R-transition the two folding domains of each catalytic chain close, while the two folding domains of each regulatory chain open. Site-specific mutagenesis experiments indicate that this domain closure is critical for the formation of the high activity, high affinity R-state of the enzyme, for homotropic cooperativity(5Kantrowitz E.R.

Chemical steps were determined to contribute about 50% of rate limitation in the forward direction, with the balance attributable to a conformational change occurring prior to catalysis. Equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics (EIEK) show that the kinetic mechanism of the wild-type holoenzyme is strongly ordered, with CP binding prior to Asp (28, 29). More importantly, EIEK methods have proven to be especially useful for defining which kinetic steps are altered by bound modifiers or by the mutation of a specific amino acid side chain(29Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4172-4181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Kantrowitz E.R. Middleton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17259-17265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both KIE and EIEK suggest that the kinetic mechanism may vary from random to ordered in relation to a number of factors, including the degree to which the enzyme has undergone the T → R transition. In particular, with complete closure of the catalytic chain domains, compulsory ordered substrate binding occurs, whereas a non-R-state enzyme may operate by a more random mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the present kinetic studies were carried out with the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme that appears to be unable to attain the R-state in the presence of CP and Asp. All biochemicals used were of the highest purity available from Sigma. Other chemicals were ACS Reagent grade (Fisher Scientific). The dilithium salt of CP was purified by recrystallization from 50% water/ethanol before use. The wild-type and the Glu-50 → Ala holoenzymes were purified as described previously(31Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [14C]Asp (Amersham, 50 μCi, 216 mCi/mmol) was purified as described previously(32Wedler F.C.

Enzyme activity was determined by one of three methods: by the [14C]Asp assay of Porter et al.(1Porter R.W. Modebe M.O. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1846-1859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by the continuous spectrophotometric monitoring of Pi release(33Wedler F.C. Ley B.W. Moyer M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or by a pH change method using bromthymol blue.2( 2B. H. Lee and M. H. O'Leary, manuscript in preparation. ) Isotope effects are described using the terminology of Northrop(34Northrop D.B. Cleland W.W. O'Leary M.H. Northrop D.B. Isotope Effects on Enzyme Catalyzed Reactions. University Park Press, Baltimore1977: 122Google Scholar). Thus, 13(V/K)CP represents the observed kinetic isotope effect for 13C versus12C at the carbonyl group of CP. 13(V/K)CP on the reaction catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamoylase was measured using the method of internal competition, in which changes in the isotopic composition of CP are measured over the course of the reaction(24Parmentier L.E. Weiss P.M. O'Leary M.H. Schachman H.K. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6577-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A 200 mM CP solution, pH 5.5, was prepared in water, sealed with a rubber septum, placed in an ice bath, and freed from CO2 by sparging with N2 for 1-2 h. A reaction flask fitted with a vacuum adapter and a side arm was charged with an appropriate amount of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM DTT and 0.2 mM EDTA, and this solution was sparged overnight with N2. A 100 mM Asp solution was prepared in this same buffer, sealed with a septum, and sparged with N2 overnight at room temperature. 50 mM ATP and CTP solutions were prepared in 50 mM HEPES containing 2 mM DTT and 0.2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and were likewise sparged. To the reaction flask containing HEPES buffer were added appropriate amounts of the Asp solution and enzyme. The reaction was initiated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold CP solution. At low Asp concentrations, in order to keep the Asp concentration constant, small amounts of degassed Asp solution were added dropwise at a rate calculated to keep the Asp concentration at the desired level. After a reaction time estimated to attain 50% reaction, 0.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the reaction mixture via a syringe, and the solution was warmed to 38°C for 2 h to convert unreacted CP to CO2 (>10 half-lives of CP hydrolysis; at pH 0.35, 37°C, the half-life for CP is ~11.3 min(35Allen C.B. Jones M.E. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). The resulting CO2 was collected by a high vacuum continuous distillation apparatus using two dry ice/isopropyl alcohol traps and a liquid nitrogen trap. The trapped CO2 was purified further by bulb to bulb distillations. The amount of CO2 produced was measured manometrically using a MKS PDR-D-1 READOUT pressure gauge calibrated with acidified K2CO3 solution. The isotopic content of the resulting CO2 was measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry on a Finnigan Delta-S isotope-ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a Heraeus combustion unit. Two methods were used to determine the isotopic content of unreacted CP. In the first, CP was converted to CO2 by acid treatment. 1 ml of sparged CP solution in water was added to a flask containing 15 ml of HEPES buffer solution. Acidification of this solution with 0.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid resulted, after 2.5 h at 38°C, in the complete decomposition of CP to give CO2, which was isolated and analyzed as described above. Alternatively, combustion analysis was used to obtain the isotopic content of CP. The two methods gave the same results, within experimental error. Equilibrium isotope exchange experiments were performed by established procedures(19Boyer P.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 218-221Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Wedler F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5080-5087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The concentrations of all possible substrate-product pairs were varied from well below to well above their half-saturation values in a buffered solution containing 100 mM PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mM KCl. After initial enzymic and thermal equilibration, isotopic exchange was initiated by the addition of labeled substrate, either [14C]Asp (0.1 μCi) or [14C]CP (0.01 μCi), an amount equal in micromoles to less than 1/1000th of the material in the unlabeled pool, to avoid perturbation of the equilibrium condition. Exchange reactions were typically carried out at 30°C with about 25 μg of the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme over 20 min for the CP ⇋ CAsp exchange, and with about 300 μg of the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme over 120 min for the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange, then quenched, and separated for counting, as described below. Incubation times or amount of enzyme used were about 10-100-fold less for the wild-type enzyme. [14C]-CP⇋CAsp exchange reactions (total volume = 0.1 ml) were carried out in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and were quenched by the addition of 0.15 ml of 5 N HCl. The tube caps were closed but pierced with a small hole, and [14C]CO2 was removed during a 75-min period in vacuo (≤0.5 mm Hg) using a Savant SpeedVac concentrator attached to a refrigerated trap and a 5 × 20-cm KOH (Ascarite) trap. [14C]Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange reactions (total volume = 0.1 ml) were quenched by the addition of 0.45 ml of ice-cold 0.02 M acetic acid, then stored on ice prior to separation of the labeled pools, which was carried out as described previously (cf. above purification of labeled Asp(36Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)), using a 1.0 × 3.5-cm column of Dowex 50 (H+, 100-200 mesh). For exchange of isotopic label at chemical equilibrium, X∗ ⇋ Y, the number of micromoles exchanged/min (R) was calculated according to the equation (19Boyer P.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 218-221Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) R = - X Y {ln(1-F)}/(X+Y) t where X and Y represent the micromoles of substrates present in a given reaction, t is the time (min), and F is the fraction of isotopic equilibrium attained, equal to y (X+Y)/(x+y) Y, where x and y are the disintegrations/minute observed in the Xand Y pools, respectively. The methods used for the analysis of the EIEK data have been described in detail(32Wedler F.C. Ley B.W. Lee B.H. O'Leary M.H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9725-9733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). 13C isotope effects were measured for the aspartate transcarbamoylase catalyzed reaction of CP with Asp by monitoring the 13C content of CP over the course of the reaction. The observed 13(V/K)CP values with Glu-50 → Ala holoenzyme exhibit a hyperbolic increase as a function of increasing Asp concentration, approaching a value near 1.04 (Fig. 1). Rates of [14C]Asp ⇋ CAsp and [14C]Cp ⇋ CAsp exchanges were determined for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme as a function of various combinations of reactant-product pairs. Saturation curves obtained upon variation of all substrates in constant ratio at chemical equilibrium are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Saturation curves obtained upon variation in constant ratio of the Asp/CAsp and CP/Pi reactant-product pairs are shown in Fig. 2, C and D, respectively. Several striking differences are observed in the data of Fig. 2 between the kinetic behavior of Glu-50 → Ala and that of the wild-type enzyme. First, the maximal Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange rate is decreased 500-fold, whereas that for CP ⇋ CAsp decreases only 50-100-fold. Second, the CP ⇋ CAsp exchange rate is greater than the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange rate at all substrate concentrations. This represents a complete inversion of the relative rates, compared to the wild-type enzyme. Third, inhibition effects in the CP ⇋ CAsp exchange arising from ordered binding of CP prior to Asp are not observed in the curves for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme; rather, all curves rise smoothly to maxima. The ISOBI-HS program was used to simulate the saturation curves in Fig. 2, starting with the kinetic constants derived previously for the wild-type enzyme(29Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4172-4181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several alternative hypotheses were formulated and tested as possible explanations for the altered kinetic behavior of the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme: (a) decreases in the forward and reverse catalytic steps, k and k′; (b) decreases in the on- and off-rates for the Asp/CAsp pair and the CP/Pi pair, with a disproportionately larger change for Asp and CAsp; and (c) combining the effects of (b) with changes in the Hill coefficient, nH, for Asp. None of these, tested individually, produced changes in the calculated saturation curves that matched the experimental data in Fig. 2. Substantial decreases in k and k′ made the CP ⇋ CAsp and Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange rates decrease and become more nearly equal, but also caused the apparent half-saturation values for both exchanges to increase dramatically. Decreases in kon and koff for the Asp/CAsp pair, proportionately or disproportionately, with or without changes in nH, also failed to produce changes that matched those observed. The outcome of extensive trial-and-error testing led to the conclusion that only multiple, combined effects produced a reasonable fit to the data. Specifically these were: decreasing the catalytic rates3( 3To ensure that catalysis is not rate limiting, values for k and k′ (36Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were chosen to be 10-100-fold larger than the minimum confidence limit. Thus, the initial values of k and k′ are ~105 and 10, respectively, compared to 3 × 109 and 5 × 105. Thus, the changes required to simulate the effects observed for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme (Table I) are much less than 104. )by a factor 3-5 × 106, decreasing nH(Asp) from 2.2 to 1.5, and decreasing the koff and kon for Asp and CAsp by 1000- and 200-500- fold, respectively, with <10-fold changes in association-dissociation rates for the CP/Pi pair. These changes are summarized in. To validate the set of constants listed in, several tests were performed. The constants were used first with the KINSIM program (37Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) to prove that the initial velocity in the forward direction agreed with the Vmax measured for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme (13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); this proved to be true within a factor of two. Second, the confidence limits (allowed variations) determined for each rate constant for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme were quite similar to those for the wild-type enzyme(36Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 316-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Third, it was calculated that, within these limits,3 the rate constants for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme provide thermodynamic balance within closed cycles on both sides of the ATCase reaction. In the original kinetic characterization of the the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme, Newton and Kantrowitz (13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported that unlike the wild-type enzyme ATP and CTP altered Vmax rather than [S]0.5Asp. The effects of these modifiers plus PALA, a bisubstrate analog, were investigated in greater detail for the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme using KIE and EIEK methods. 13(V/K)CP values for the Glu-50 → Ala mutant for varying concentrations of PALA, ATP, and CTP are shown in Fig. 3. In each case the initial concentration of Asp was 2 mM, which gives an intermediate value of the isotope effect (cf. Fig. 1). Binding of PALA and ATP increased the isotope effect to a value near that observed with high concentrations of Asp (Fig. 1). CTP binding increased the isotope effect, then caused it to decrease at concentrations of CTP above 0.5 mM. EIEK experiments revealed the kinetic changes caused by these heterotropic effectors with the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme (Fig. 4). Modifiers produced only minimal changes in the substrate saturation curve for the CP ⇋ CAsp exchange, with CTP causing a slight decrease in R′max (Fig. 4, bottom). In contrast, both ATP and CTP caused Rmax for the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange to decrease (Fig. 4, top), and ATP caused the S for the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange to decrease, while CTP caused a shift in the opposite direction. These results illustrate clearly once again the differential effects caused by ATP and CTP on the binding of Asp, delineated previously by EIEK studies with the wild-type enzyme(29Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4172-4181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that ATP causes a decrease in Rmax for the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange with the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme indicates a change in mechanism of action for ATP with this mutant, most likely by decreasing the Asp dissociation rate differentially, thus lowering [S]0.5Asp. In contrast, CTP may differentially decrease the Asp association rate, thus causing an increase in [S]0.5Asp. Initial velocity kinetics indicate that the bisubstrate analog PALA increased the Glu-50 → Ala activity by only about 2-fold, much less than with the wild-type enzyme(13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Much stronger activation effects were observed by EIEK, as shown in Fig. 5A. When substrate levels are near half-saturation (f = 0.4, cf. Fig. 3), the rates for the Asp ⇋ CAsp and CP ⇋ CAsp exchanges are enhanced about 20- and 8-fold, respectively. Even stronger activation was observed for the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange if substrate levels were held at lower fractional saturation values. Comparisons of EIEK substrate saturation curves for the wild-type versus the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme also illustrate these differences. At f = 0.4 in the presence of 10 μM PALA, the wild-type enzyme exhibits approximately 2-fold activation of both the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange (Fig. 5B) and the CP ⇋ CAsp exchange. In addition, the apparent S for Asp ⇋ CAsp decreases more strongly than does S for CP ⇋ CAsp. The concentration of PALA used here is lower than that used in previous experiments (29Hsuanyu Y. Wedler F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4172-4181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since above 10 μM, PALA produces inhibition effects (data not shown). At f = 0.1-0.2, the PALA activation of the Asp ⇋ CAsp exchange is much more pronounced than that of the Cp ⇋ Pi exchange. Activation of the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme requires much higher levels of PALA than are required for the activation of the wild-type enzyme(13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), e.g. 500 μM PALA was used with the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme (Fig. 5C). With the Glu-50 → Ala enzyme, PALA caused much larger increases in Rmax values, as well as decreases in the apparent S value, for both exchanges, compared to the value for the wild-type enzyme. Even with such large rate enhancements, the PALA-activated Glu-50 → Ala enzyme still exhibits maximal exchange rates that are 50-fold below those for the wild-type enzyme. Initial velocity kinetics reveal that the PALA-activated Glu-50 → Ala enzyme is only 10-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme(13Newton C.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The most striking conclusion from the present data is that the kinetic mechanism of aspartate transcarbamoylase is distinctly altered by the replacement of Glu-50 by Ala. Whereas over the rang"
