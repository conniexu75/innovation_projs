Factors in- fluencing the equilibria of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes have been examined. Conditions for obtaining complete oxidations of hydroxy- steroids or reductions of ketosteroids have been established. Quantitative oxidations of steroids have been obtained by using a high pH and adding a ketone-binding reagent. Complete reductions of ketosteroids have been achieved by the destruction with DPNase of DPNf formed in the reac- tion. The enzymes have been employed for the estimation of SOL-, 3&, and 17P-hydroxysteroids as well as 3- and 17-ketosteroids, singly as well as in mixtures. The sensitivity of the method is about 1 mpmole of ster- oid. The methods have been illustrated by the measurement of single steroids, steroid mixtures, and chromatographic fractions. These pro- cedures are also applicable to the determination of steroid purity and con- tamination by isomers. Some of the steroids used in these studies were generously donated by Dr. A. Zaffaroni, Syntex, S. A., Mexico, and Dr. E. W. Meyer, The Glid- den Company, Chicago. The authors are grateful to Mr R. C. Leek for aid in developing the system for silicic acid chromatography of steroids."

The basic biological science component (Table 2) increased from $18 to $26 million between 1952 and 1954 and to $30 million in 1955. Although a greater dollar amount is now available for basic research in the life sciences, the amount available in 1955 was proportionately a smaller part of the total than was the amount available in 1954. In 1955, $52 million was expended for activities which were not categorized as basic research. The needs and motivations of the major granting federal agencies are, and continue to be, primarily problem-and program-oriented."
