https://openalex.org/W1572595133,"Exogenous radioactive palmitic acid is incorporated post-translationally into the HLA-B and -DR heavy chains, but not HLA-A heavy chains or -DR light chains of the human B lymphoblastoid cells JY and T51 . Protease digestions localize the label to the transmembrane region of the B7 heavy chain. Both B7 and DR heavy chains have a cysteine in the transmembrane hydrophobic region, while the A2 heavy chain and DR light chains have none. Palmitic acid is covalently linked to these transmembrane cysteines via a thioester bond since: 1) the label is not removed by organic extraction or boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol, but is released at room temperature by methanolic KOH as methyl palmitate, and by hydroxylamine as palmitohydroxamate . 2) The pH sensitivity and kinetics of release by hydroxylamine and Tris are similar to those of palmitoyl-CoA (thioester linkage) and unlike those of methyl palmitate and palmitoyllysophosphatidylcholine ( hydroxyester linkages). 3) Neutral hydroxylamine treatment (but not neutral Tris treatment) generates sites that can be reduced and alkylated in the transmembrane region of B7 heavy chain and to a lesser extent in DR heavy chain. 4) Organic extraction of pronase digests of labeled B7 yields peptides containing palmitate and cysteine (but not serine or threonine) which co-migrate by thin layer chromatography. A population of beta 2-microglobulin molecules not associated with heavy chains is palmitylated , but not via a thioester linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2020125507,Spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in the BB rat is associated with the presence of antibodies to a 64-kilodalton rat islet cell protein. These protein antibodies appeared in young animals and remained for as long as 8 weeks before the clinical onset of IDDM. Antibodies to a 64-kilodalton human islet cell protein were found to be associated with human IDDM. Detection of the antibodies may therefore be used to predict an early immune reaction against pancreatic B cells.

https://openalex.org/W2090441564,"The avian analog of mammalian erythrocyte protein 4.1, a structural component of the membrane skeleton, has been identified. It is present at the plasma membranes of avian erythrocytes and lens cells, but has not been found elsewhere in comparable amounts. In chickens, it exists as six variants with molecular masses of 87, 100, 115, 150, 160, and 175 kd. The corresponding polypeptides in turkeys are each about 3 kd smaller, suggesting that all may be encoded by a single gene. These variants have similar solubility properties and nearly identical two-dimensional iodopeptide maps that are similar to those of mammalian protein 4.1, but they are differentially phosphorylated. The three smallest variants are the predominant forms in avian erythrocytes, while the two largest variants predominate in avian lens cells. In contrast, mammalian erythrocytes and lens cells exhibit patterns of variants that are more similar to each other. These results show that only a subset of spectrin-containing cells possess protein 4.1, and that these cells differentially express the variants of protein 4.1 in a manner that may reflect corresponding functional differences."

https://openalex.org/W1492676305,"The kinetics of incorporation of deoxynucleotide precursors directed by the promutagenic base, O6-methylguanine (m6Gua), was analyzed during in vitro replication of m6Gua-containing synthetic polydeoxynucleotides by T4 and T5 phage DNA polymerases and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. When poly(dT,m6dG) and poly(dC,m6dG) with covalently attached primers were replicated, O6-methylguanine paired with either thymine or cytosine but with a much higher preference for thymine. dCTP and dTTP acted as competitive inhibitors of each other during DNA synthesis. O6-Methylguanine also directed incorporation of dAMP by T5 DNA polymerase. This dAMP incorporation was not inhibited by dTTP. Contrary to theoretical predictions that the m6dG X dT pair should be comparable to the dA X dT pair, the presence of m6dG in the template inhibited DNA synthesis. Based on Kappm values, E. coli DNA polymerase I showed a much higher preference for dTMP incorporation over dCMP opposite m6dG in the template than T4 and T5 DNA polymerases. At the same time, there was a higher turnover of dCTP than of dTTP by the E. coli enzyme. However, in all cases, the turnover of deoxynucleotides during replication of m6Gua-containing templates was more than that observed with templates without the alkylated base."
https://openalex.org/W1589722764,"BC3H-1 myocytes were cultured with 32PO4 for 3 days to label phospholipids to constant specific activity. Subsequent treatment with physiological concentrations of insulin provoked 40-70% increases in 32PO4 levels (reflecting increases in mass) in phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, and polyphosphoinositides, and, lesser, 20-25% increases in phosphatidylserine and the combined chromatographic area containing phosphatidylethanolamine plus phosphatidylcholine plus phosphatidylcholine. Insulin-induced increases in phospholipids were significant within 5 min and near-maximal at 15-30 min. Comparable rapid insulin-induced increases in [3H]phosphatidylinositol were observed in myocytes prelabeled with [3H]inositol. These insulin effects (as per prolonged pulse-chase experiments) were due to increase phospholipid synthesis rather than decreased phospholipid degradation. Cycloheximide (and puromycin) pretreatment prevented insulin-induced increases in phospholipids and rapidly reversed ongoing insulin effects on phospholipids and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Insulin also rapidly increased diacylglycerol levels. These findings suggest that: (a) insulin provokes rapid increases in de novo synthesis of phosphatidic acid and its derivatives, e.g. phosphoinositides and diacylglycerol; (b) protein synthesis inhibitors diminish phospholipid levels in insulin-treated (but not control) tissues by increasing phospholipid degradation (?phospholipase(s) activation); and (c) changes in phospholipids and diacylglycerol may be important for changes in pyruvate dehydrogenase and other enzymatic activities during treatment with insulin and/or protein synthesis inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1532262523,"Recently we presented evidence that normal human foreskin fibroblasts (HF cells) limit the activity of secreted urokinase by secreting it as a proenzyme and by secreting protease nexin , an inhibitor of urokinase and certain other serine proteases (Scott, R.W., Eaton, D. L. Duran , N., and Baker, J.B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4397-4403). Using immunoaffinity chromatography we have now purified the HF cell urokinase proenzyme. It is a single 52-kDa polypeptide chain that is inactive toward both plasminogen and low molecular weight substrates. After proteolytic activation, this material (specific activity of 3 X 10(4) Committee on Thrombolytic Agents units/mg) is composed of two disulfide-bridged 33- and 19-kDa chains, and is thus similar to the predominant form of urokinase found in urine. Plasmin at 2 X 10(-10) M causes 50% activation of the proenzyme (1 X 10(-9) M) in 30 min at 37 degrees C. Thrombin and trypsin are one-twentieth as effective as plasmin. Activated HF cell 125I-urokinase forms sodium dodecyl sulfate stable complexes with purified protease nexin or protease nexin present in medium conditioned by HF cells. Purified protease nexin inhibits purified HF cell urokinase action on both plasminogen and low molecular weight substrates. The association rate constant for the reaction between protease nexin and HF cell urokinase is approximately 1.7 X 10(5) M-1 S-1. In contrast, the association rate constants for reactions between protease nexin and the one- and two-chain forms of tissue-type plasminogen activator are approximately 2 X 10(3) and approximately 3 X 10(4) M-1 S-1, respectively. The importance of protease nexin as a regulator of HF cell urokinase is supported by the finding that anti-protease nexin antibody potentiates the fibrinolytic activity of HF cell-conditioned medium incubated with plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1576590564,"Irradiation of intact rat adipocytes with high intensity ultraviolet light in the presence of 0.5 microM [3H] cytochalasin B results in the labeling of Mr 43,000 and 46,000 proteins that reside in the plasma membrane fraction. In contrast to the Mr 46,000 protein, the Mr 43,000 component is not observed in the microsome fraction and exhibits lower affinity for [3H]cytochalasin B. Photolabeling of the Mr 43,000 protein is inhibited by cytochalasin D, indicating it is not a hexose transporter component. The Mr 46,000 protein exhibits characteristics expected for the glucose transporter such that D-glucose or 3-O-methylglucose but not cytochalasin D inhibits its photolabeling with [3H] cytochalasin B. Furthermore, insulin addition to intact cells either prior to or after photoaffinity labeling of the Mr 46,000 protein causes a redistribution of this component from the low density microsomes to the plasma membrane fraction, as expected for the hexose transporter. Photolabeling of transporters in both the low density microsome and plasma membrane fractions is inhibited when intact cells are equilibrated with 50 mM ethylidene glucose prior to irradiation with [3H]cytochalasin B. Incubation of intact cells with 50 mM ethylidene glucose for 1 min at 15 degrees C leads to an intracellular concentration of only 2 mM. Under these conditions, the photoaffinity labeling in intact cells of hexose transporters that fractionate with the low density microsomes is unaffected, indicating these transporters are not exposed to the extracellular medium. In contrast, photolabeling in intact insulin-treated cells of hexose transporters that fractionate with the plasma membrane is inhibited under these incubation conditions. The results demonstrate that insulin action results in the exposure to the extracellular medium of previously sequestered hexose transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1972698132,"The human type C adenovirus E1a 13S messenger RNA encodes a gene product, that positively regulates the transcription of viral genes and certain cellular genes and is involved in the transformation of primary mammalian cells. The E1a gene product was expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. In a Xenopus oocyte microinjection assay, the purified Escherichia coli-produced protein activated the E1a-responsive adenovirus E3 promoter and functioned as efficiently as the E1a gene itself."
https://openalex.org/W1493809750,"Ribosomal protein L11 of Escherichia coli was bound to 23 S rRNA and the resultant complex was digested with ribonuclease T1. A single RNA fragment, protected by protein L11, was isolated from such digests and was shown to rebind specifically to protein L11. The nucleotide sequence of this RNA fragment was examined by two-dimensional fingerprinting of ribonuclease digests. It proved to be 61 residues long and the constituent oligonucleotides could be fitted perfectly between residues 1052 and 1112 of the nucleotide sequence of E. coli 23 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1621961391,"The mechanism by which insulin regulates cell surface insulin receptors was examined in primary cultured rat adipocytes. When cells were incubated in insulin-free medium, specific 125I-insulin binding progressively increased over 3-4 days followed by a plateau of binding. Insulin prevented up-regulation at low doses (1 ng/ml), while higher doses (5-25 ng/ml) resulted in a net loss of surface receptors. A lag period of 4-6 h preceded insulin-induced changes in receptor number, and such a lag was seen prior to the inhibitory effect of insulin on the insertion of nascent receptors into the plasma membrane. Regulation of surface receptors continued after the removal of insulin, consistent with the idea that insulin generates a signal which can sustain receptor regulation in the absence of ligand. Thus, a 1-h insulin pulse (100 ng/ml) was sufficient to block up-regulation, whereas longer exposure times (4-12 h) produced a net loss of surface receptors. When cells were exposed to insulin for a fixed time (5 h), subsequent receptor loss was insulin dose-dependent. Thus, the net number of cell surface insulin receptors is determined by both insulin concentration and the duration of insulin exposure. Time course studies after a 12-h insulin pulse revealed a progressive loss of surface receptors for up to 36 h. At later times receptor number returned toward control values, thus demonstrating that triggering of receptor regulation is reversible. To determine whether insulin-induced down-regulation was mediated by receptor loss, or by receptor translocation to an intracellular site, we measured receptor distribution (cell surface and intracellular pools) in control and 72-h insulin-treated adipocytes. These data revealed that down-regulation was mediated by a net loss of receptors rather than by receptor redistribution. An early biological response of adipocytes to insulin is rapid endocytosis of insulin-receptor complexes, and we found that insulin plays an important role in regulating this endocytotic uptake rate. Thus, compared to freshly isolated cells, adipocytes cultured for 72 h in insulin-free medium had an enhanced ability to internalize both insulin and insulin receptors, whereas cells chronically treated with insulin endocytosed insulin-receptor complexes at a much slower rate. These data are interpreted as an insulin-mediated change in one of the cellular responses of adipocytes to the biological action of insulin."

Pig brain was shown to contain an 87-kilodalton immunoreactive analog of protein 4.1 that has partial sequence homology with pig erythrocyte protein 4.1 and the same location as spectrin in the cortical cytoplasm of neuronal and glial cell types of the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W1508005690,"Formation of protein-linked Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 , Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 , and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 was detected in rat liver slices and Phaseolus vulgaris seeds incubated with [U-14C]glucose. Similar compounds were not synthesized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells incubated under similar conditions. Rat liver microsomes were incubated with [glucose-U-14C] Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol or UDP-[U-14C]Glc as glycosyl donors. Only in the latter condition protein-linked Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 were formed. Addition of mannooligosaccharides that strongly inhibited alpha 1-2-mannosidases to incubation mixtures containing rat liver microsomes and UDP-[U-14C]Glc did not prevent formation of protein-bound Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 . Furthermore, the presence of amphomycin in reaction mixtures containing liver membranes and UDP-[U-14C]Glc completely abolished synthesis of glucosylated derivatives of dolichol without affecting formation of protein-linked Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 , Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 , and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 . The results reported above indicated that under the experimental conditions employed protein-bound Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 , Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 , and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 were formed by glucosylation of unglucosylated oligosaccharides. Results obtained in pulse-chase experiments performed in vitro also supported this conclusion. UDP-Glc appeared to be the donor of the glucosyl residues. The rough endoplasmic reticulum was found to be the main subcellular site of protein glucosylation. It is tentatively suggested that this process could prevent extensive degradation of oligosaccharides by mannosidases during transit of glycoproteins through the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1519366937,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ADE4 encoding glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (amidophosphoribosyltransferase) has been cloned by complementation of an ade4 auxotroph. The nucleotide sequence of ADE4 along with upstream and downstream flanking sequences was determined. The ADE4 structural gene consists of 1530 base pairs from which a 510-amino acid translation product, Mr = 56,691, was deduced. Yeast amidophosphoribosyltransferase is homologous to the enzymes from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The active site cysteine residue in the bacterial amidophosphoribosyltransferases which functions in glutamine amide transfer is conserved in the yeast enzyme. Yeast amidophosphoribosyltransferase does not contain the previously deduced sequence required for binding of a [4Fe-4S] center indicating that a [4Fe-4S] center is an unlikely component of the yeast enzyme. Amidophosphoribosyltransferase was stable in growing and nongrowing cells and was not inactivated or degraded. Thus in the group, S. cerevisiae, E. coli, B. subtilis, the content of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in amidophosphoribosyltransferase correlates with a mechanism for oxygen-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. Northern blots demonstrate that ADE4 expression is transcriptionally regulated. The 5' end of the ADE4 mRNA was identified by nuclease S1 mapping."

https://openalex.org/W1540152632,"Abstract Calcium transport into everted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli was found to have two components, one phosphate-dependent and the other phosphate-independent. In vesicles prepared in a glycerol buffer, calcium/proton exchange was phosphate independent but net uptake of 45Ca2+ required phosphate. In vesicles prepared in a sucrose buffer both phosphate-independent and phosphate-dependent accumulation of 45Ca2+ occurred. Both calcium/proton exchange and phosphate-independent uptake of 45Ca2+ were inactivated by treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but not by N-ethylmaleimide. Phosphate-dependent uptake of 45Ca2+ was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide but not by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Under conditions permitting only phosphate-dependent uptake of 45Ca2+, concomitant uptake of 32Pi was also observed. Both uptake and efflux of the two ions occurred with a 1:1 ratio. These results imply the existence of two calcium transport systems in everted membrane vesicles, one of which catalyzes exchange of calcium ions and protons, the other of which catalyzes cotransport of calcium and phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1600274211,The rates of transition between the cruciform and linear conformations of a perfectly inverted repeated lac operator DNA sequence have been measured using a trimethylpsoralen intrastrand cross-linking assay. The rate and extent of the linear to cruciform transition were dependent on temperature and on the superhelical density of the DNA. Apparent half-lives for this transition were between 4-9 min at 37 degrees C for supercoiled DNAs as isolated from cells. The half-life for the cruciform to linear transition in relaxed DNA was about 30 s at 37 degrees C. Mg2+ stabilized both conformations but stabilized the linear form to a greater degree than the cruciform. The rates of transition were temperature dependent suggesting enthalpies of activation of 26.3 kcal mol-1 for the cruciform to linear transition and 33.4 kcal mol-1 for the linear to cruciform transition. The rate of the linear to cruciform transition was slower at 50 than 37 degrees C. Heating above 70 degrees C resulted in the loss of the cruciform structure.
https://openalex.org/W1485247673,"Chromatographic analysis of poly(dT) replication activity in fresh yeast extracts showed that the activities required co-fractionate with the yeast DNA polymerase I. Since poly(dT) replication requires both a primase and a DNA polymerase, the results of the fractionation studies suggest that these two enzymes might exist as a complex in the yeast extract. Sucrose gradient analysis of concentrated purified yeast DNA polymerase I preparations demonstrates that the yeast DNA polymerase I does sediment as a complex with DNA primase activity. Two DNA polymerase I peptides estimated at 78,000 and 140,000 Da were found in the complex that were absent from the primase-free DNA polymerase fraction. Rabbit anti-yeast DNA polymerase I antibody inhibits DNA polymerase I but not DNA primase although rabbit antibodies are shown to remove DNA primase activity from solution by binding to the complex. Mouse monoclonal antibody to yeast DNA polymerase I binds to free yeast DNA polymerase I as well as the complex, but not to the free DNA primase activity. These results suggest that these two activities exist as a complex and reside on the different polypeptides. Replication of poly(dT) and single-stranded circular phage DNA by yeast DNA polymerase I and primase requires ATP and dNTPs. The size of the primer produced is 8 to 9 nucleotides in the presence of dNTPs and somewhat larger in the absence of dNTPs. Aphidicolin, an inhibitor of yeast DNA polymerase I, is not inhibitory to the yeast DNA primase activity. The primase activity is inhibited by adenosine 5'-(3-thio)tri-phosphate but not by alpha-amanitin. The association of yeast DNA polymerase I and yeast DNA primase can be demonstrated directly by isolation of the complex on a column containing yeast DNA polymerase I mouse monoclonal antibody covalently linked to Protein A-Sepharose. Both DNA polymerase I and DNA primase activities are retained by the column and can be eluted with 3.5 M MgCl2. Part of the primase activity can be dissociated from DNA polymerase on the column with 1 M MgCl2 and this free primase activity can be detected as poly(dT) replication activity in the presence of Escherichia coli polymerase I."

https://openalex.org/W58133222,"The cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex was recently purified from Escherichia coli membranes (Miller, M. J., and Gennis , R. B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9159-1965). The complex contains two polypeptides, subunits I and II, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and three spectroscopically defined cytochromes, b558 , a1, and d. A mutant that failed to oxidize N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine was obtained which was lacking this terminal oxidase complex and was shown to map at a locus called cyd on the E. coli genome. In this paper, localized mutagenesis was used to generate a series of mutants in the cytochrome d terminal oxidase. These mutants were isolated by a newly developed selection procedure based on their sensitivity to azide. Two classes of mutants which map to the cyd locus were obtained, cydA and cydB . The cydA phenotype included the lack of all three spectroscopically detectable cytochromes as well as the absence of both polypeptides, determined by immunological criteria. Strains manifesting the cydB phenotype lacked cytochromes a1 and d, but had a normal amount of cytochrome b558 . Immunological analysis showed that subunit I (57,000 daltons) was present in the membranes, but that subunit II (43,000 daltons) was missing. These data justify the conclusion that subunit I of this two-subunit complex can be identified as the cytochrome b558 component of the cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1487994810,"The physical basis of ATP binding and activation of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was studied by an ultraviolet irradiation cross-linking technique. ATP and dATP were photocrosslinked to the alpha, tau, gamma, and delta subunits of holoenzyme; photocrosslinking of dATP was competitively inhibited by ATP. No photocrosslinking was observed with GTP or CTP, nor did GTP, CTP, or UTP inhibit cross-linking of ATP. ADP and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)-triphosphate, both potent inhibitors of ATP activation of holoenzyme, inhibited cross-linking of ATP to tau, gamma, and delta subunits, but not to the alpha subunit, suggesting that one or more of these subunits are ATP (or dATP)-binding sites. Photocrosslinking of dTTP to the ATP-activated holoenzyme was exclusively to the epsilon subunit, the dnaQ ( mutD ) gene product; dCTP and dGTP were not photocrosslinked to any subunit. Binding of dTTP was enhanced by ATP, but by no other nucleotide (or deoxynucleotide). This binding of dTTP to epsilon, a subunit likely responsible for regulation of proofreading by the holoenzyme, may function in the control of the fidelity of replication."
https://openalex.org/W127972909,"Biochemical fractionation of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed a novel DNA primase activity that copurifies with the major DNA polymerase activity. In the presence of RNA precursors and single-stranded DNA (poly(dT), M13), the DNA primase synthesizes discrete length oligoribonucleotides (apparent length, 8-12 nucleotides) as well as longer RNA chains that appear to be multiples of a modal length of 11-12 nucleotides. When DNA precursors are also present, the oligoribonucleotides are utilized by the accompanying DNA polymerase as primers for DNA synthesis. Copurification of these two enzymatic activities suggests their association in a physical complex which may function in the synthesis of Okazaki fragments at chromosomal replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W1502446830,"Abstract The cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex is one of two terminal oxidases in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli. Previous work has shown by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that this enzyme contains two subunits (I and II) and three cytochrome components, b558 , a1, and d. Reconstitution studies have demonstrated that the enzyme functions as a ubiquinol-8 oxidase and catalyzes an electrogenic reaction, i.e. turnover is accompanied by a charge separation across the membrane bilayer. In this paper, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to obtain structural information about the cytochrome d complex. It is shown that antibodies directed against subunit I effectively inhibit ubiquinol-1 oxidation by the purified enzyme in detergent, whereas antibodies which bind to subunit II have no effect on quinol oxidation. The oxidation rate of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, in contrast, is unaffected by antisubunit I antibodies, but is inhibited by antibodies against subunit II. It is concluded that the quinol oxidation site is on subunit I, previously shown to be the cytochrome b558 component of the complex, and that N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine oxidation occurs at a secondary site on subunit II. The antibodies were also used to analyze the results of a protein cross-linking experiment. Dimethyl suberimidate was used to cross-link the subunits of purified, solubilized oxidase. Immunoblot analysis of the products of this cross-linking clearly indicate that subunit II probably exists as a dimer within the complex. Finally, it is shown that the purified enzyme contains tightly bound lipopolysaccharide. This was revealed after discovering that one of the monoclonal antibodies raised against the purified complex is actually directed against lipopolysaccharide. The significance of this finding is not known."
https://openalex.org/W1509950311,"Fractions containing a high molecular weight form (Mr approximately equal to 2 X 10(6] of the activity that replicates in vitro both the 2-micron yeast DNA plasmid and the chromosomal autonomously replicating sequence ars 1 can be prepared from cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces. Protein complexes from the fractions associate in vitro with the replication origins of these DNA elements, as determined by electron microscopy. In the present study, the high molecular weight replicative fraction has been characterized in further detail. The DNA synthetic activity in the high molecular weight fraction was bound to the DNA and could be isolated with it. This binding of the replicating activity to the DNA was greatly reduced in the absence of the 2-micron origins of replication. Association of the protein complexes with DNA depended on the amount of replicating activity added, was sensitive to 0.2 M KCl, and exhibited a requirement for rATP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. It was not blocked, however, by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin or by the RNA polymerase inhibitor alpha-amanitin. The lack of inhibition by aphidicolin suggests that the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates may function as cofactors in the binding of protein complexes to DNA or as substrates for a polymerizing activity such as a primase. Binding of the protein complexes as well as actual DNA replication were heat sensitive in the high molecular weight fraction prepared from the temperature-sensitive mutant of the cell division cycle cdc 8. This suggests that the cdc 8 gene product is present in a replicative protein complex and strengthens the conclusion that the presence of the protein complexes on the DNA is associated with replication. Using independent enzyme assays, several other possible replication proteins (including DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase, DNA primase, and DNA topoisomerase II) have been identified directly in the high molecular weight replicative fraction. All of these results provide support for the idea that a protein complex (or replisome ) is involved in the replication of both the extrachromosomal 2-micron DNA and chromosomal DNA in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1542856216,"Mice immunized to ungulate insulins were found to develop antibodies of two specificities: insulin antibodies that were mostly IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies that acted both as anti-idiotypes to specific mouse insulin antibodies and as antibodies to the insulin receptor. There was a negative association between the presence of anti-idiotypic receptor antibodies and insulin antibodies bearing the specific idiotype; the specific idiotypic antibodies were confined to the early phase of the primary response while the anti-idiotypic receptor antibodies were detected only after the idiotypic antibodies had disappeared. To map the insulin epitope that triggered the specific idiotypic response, we chemically altered the insulin molecule so as to inhibit its interaction with the insulin receptor. The altered insulins triggered high titers of antibodies binding to antigenic determinants on native insulin, but no anti-idiotypic receptor antibodies. Thus, the epitope responsible for the specific idiotypic-anti-idiotypic network was probably the part of the insulin molecule whose conformation is recognized by the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1536862045,"Ribosomes from three previously described mutants of Escherichia coli lacking L11 ( AM68 , AM76 , and AM77 ) supported in vitro termination with release factor 1 very poorly, but with release factor 2 had a severalfold elevation in activity for this function compared with ribosomes from a control strain or from a mutant containing unmethylated L11. L11 exerts its effect on the binding of the factors into a functional ribosomal complex with the termination codon. Reconstitution of L11 back into the L11-lacking ribosomes restored them to the control phenotype. The NH2-terminal part of L11 (amino acids 1-64) seems critical in modulating release factor binding. This part of L11 has been localized with the use of fragment-specific antibodies on the three-dimensional model of the 50 S subunit in the region from where the L7/L12 stalk originates. IgG antibodies from an antiserum specific for this fragment but not a middle fragment of L11 (amino acids 65-102) strongly inhibited in vitro termination. The activities of the two factors were inhibited differentially by several anti-L11 preparations recognizing antigenic determinants in the NH2-terminal part of L11. In all but one case, release factor 1 was more sensitive. These studies indicate that there are significant differences in the binding domains for the two release factors which are affected by the NH2-terminal part of L11."
https://openalex.org/W1575608976,"The effects of the insulin-like growth factor, multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA), on chick myotube cultures were investigated. In serum-free media, MSA at levels reported to be present in fetal serum (5 ng/ml) significantly inhibited overall rates of protein degradation and stimulated protein synthesis and amino acid uptake. Half-maximal effects on protein degradation (-30%), synthesis (+25%), and amino acid uptake (+50%) occurred at approximately 0.05 micrograms/ml. In contrast, 10(2)-10(3)-fold higher concentrations (5 micrograms/ml) were required to stimulate transport of the glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. The results indicate that MSA is an effective anabolic agent regulating protein metabolism and amino acid uptake, but not sugar transport in these cells. Parallel studies conducted with insulin demonstrated similar size effects on protein metabolism and amino acid uptake in serum-free media. However, unlike MSA, insulin levels (10(-2) units/ml) well in excess of its normal physiological range were required to produce significant effects. In addition, the relative sensitivity of sugar transport with respect to protein metabolic effects differed for insulin and MSA. Thus, 2-deoxyglucose transport was approximately 10 times more sensitive to insulin than protein synthesis, proteolysis, or amino acid uptake in contrast to MSA where the reverse was true. However, despite the relatively higher sensitivity of sugar transport to insulin, supraphysiological levels (10(-3) units/ml) of this hormone were still required for significant stimulation. These results suggest a generally low insulin sensitivity in cultured chick myotubes relative to adult tissues. In contrast, the effects of MSA are consistent with a possible role of this or similar factors in regulating growth and development of embryonic muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1952032633,"Insulin receptors on isolated rat adipocytes were photoaffinity-labeled with a biologically active photo-derivative of insulin (iodinated B2 (2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)-des- PheB1 -insulin) in order to study the metabolism of surface receptors after binding insulin. Adipocytes were incubated with iodinated B2 (2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)-des- PheB1 -insulin (40 ng/ml) at 16 degrees C until specific binding reached equilibrium, subjected to photolysis, and then incubated at 37 degrees C to follow the metabolism of the covalent insulin-receptor complexes. Susceptibility of labeled insulin receptors to tryptic digestion was used to distinguish between receptors on the cell surface and those inside the cell. Following incubation of photoaffinity-labeled adipocytes at 37 degrees C, there was an initial rapid loss of insulin receptors from the cell surface. The internalization of insulin receptors occurred at a significantly faster rate than the loss of receptors from the cell, resulting in an accumulation of intracellular receptors. The proportion of surface-derived receptors inside the cell reached an apparent steady state after 30 min and represented about 20% of the labeled receptors originally on the cell surface. Chloroquine had no effect on the internalization of insulin receptors but inhibited their degradation. Cycloheximide inhibited both internalization and degradation of insulin receptors. After 60 min at 37 degrees C, the disappearance of insulin receptors from the cell surface slowed markedly and the overall loss of insulin receptors from the cell was minimal. If chloroquine was added at this time, there was a marked increase in the loss of receptors from the cell surface with a concomitant 2-fold increase in the intracellular pool of surface-derived receptors. From these observations, we conclude that 1) internalization is not rate-limiting in insulin receptor degradation, 2) chloroquine has no effect on the internalization of insulin receptors but inhibits the intracellular degradation of receptors, 3) cycloheximide interferes with both the internalization and degradation of insulin receptors, and 4) the plateau in the loss of labeled receptors from the cell surface after 60 min at 37 degrees C could be due to a new steady state balance between internalization and recycling of photoaffinity-labeled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W12239369,"Phospholipid turnover was studied in cultured neonatal rat pancreatic islets. In islets prelabeled with [32P]Pi, 15-min stimulation with glucose (16.7 mM) caused increased labeling of phosphatidic acid (93%) and phosphatidylinositol (94%) and decreased labeling of the polyphosphoinositides (20%). Omission of calcium ion during the period of glucose stimulation did not modify the changes in inositol phospholipids. In islets equilibrated with [32P]Pi in the presence and absence of stimulatory glucose concentrations (11.1 and 1.7 mM, respectively), chelation of calcium by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid prevented the increase in phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol labeling. However, the decrease in polyphosphoinositide labeling was inhibited by the chelator only in islets labeled in the absence of stimulatory glucose concentrations, the decrease persisting in islets labeled in the presence of glucose. This suggests that a specific pool of polyphosphoinositides is labeled in the presence of agonist and decreases in response to acute glucose stimulation irrespective of availability of external calcium. In the absence of calcium, the addition of [gamma-32Pi]ATP to a membrane preparation of cultured islets yielded three lipid phosphorylation products (phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate). In broken cell preparations, [32P]Pi-labeled phosphatidylinositol was also detected. The extent of all these phosphorylations was decreased by the presence of free calcium ion (40 microM). These data indicate that polyphosphoinositide turnover takes place after glucose stimulation independent of extracellular calcium and support the possibility that this may play a primary role in altering cell calcium availability."
https://openalex.org/W1567060155,"Abstract There is evidence that the Escherichia coli polymerase recognizes and binds to three sites on the promoter DNA: the -10, -35, and -16 regions. Sequence homology was noted among the -10 sites (Pribnow box) and among the -35s with consensus sequences, TATAAT and TTGACA , respectively. Weak nucleotide sequence homology was detected at -16. Since the polymerase recognizes these sites in a multitude of promoters, one expects similarities in the three-dimensional structures. To date, no data directly bearing on such structures exist. Recently, Calladine ( Calladine , C.R. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 161, 343-352) and, subsequently, Dickerson ( Dickerson , R.E. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 166, 419-441) suggested rules for doublestranded DNA structures which were tested against data from several known crystals. Using these rules, I compare the deviations from ideal B-DNA of the twist angles, base pair roll, sideways shift, and propeller suppression in 56 promoters at the three sites. I also appended to these the twist angle computations on additional 77 promoters from the recently published compilation of promoter sequences. For the latter, additional nucleotides from the spacer regions were added. The results display similarities at the -10 site. Equally strong similarities were obtained for the -35 and the -16 contact regions. The existence of structural differences for some sites is likely to account for the different degrees of efficiency of the polymerase recognition and transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1591918815,"The substrate binding reaction of the proline carrier was investigated in nonenergized conditions using cytoplasmic membrane vesicles prepared from the proline carrier-overproducing strain MinS/ pLC4 -45 of Escherichia coli K12. The binding activity specifically required both alkaline cations (X+), Na+ and Li+, and protons. The Na+-dependent binding activity was dependent on the proline carrier, which is the product of the putP gene, and was not affected by ionophores and energy transduction inhibitors. The parameters of proline binding were determined by double reciprocal plots in reaction media with various combinations of Na+ and H+ concentrations. The apparent dissociation constant was greatly affected by the Na+ and H+ concentrations of the medium and could be expressed as a combination of the reciprocals of the Na+ and H+ concentrations, while the maximum number of binding sites remained constant. The characteristics of proline binding to the carrier can be explained by a mechanism in which the unloaded carrier forms a carrier/H+/X+ (CH+X+) complex by a random equilibrium and only the CH+X+ complex binds substrate in nonenergized conditions, as proposed for the Na+/H+/glutamate symport carrier of E. coli B ( Fujimura , T., Yamato , I., and Anraku , Y.

https://openalex.org/W1521179317,"Mossbauer studies of rat erythrocytes infected by Plasmodium berghei malaria parasites, using 57Fe-enriched rat red blood cells, were carried out in order to determine the physical parameters which characterize the malarial pigment iron and to test the effect of the widely used antimalaria drug, chloroquine, on these parameters. The iron in the malarial pigment which is derived from hemoglobin digestion by the intracellular parasite was found to be trivalent, high spin, with Mossbauer parameters which are significantly different from those of any known iron porphyrin containing compound. No difference was found between the parameters obtained in erythrocytes infected by drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of P. berghei, both before and after the treatment with chloroquine. The iron compound consists of microaggregates, about 30 A in diameter. These are somewhat larger in chloroquine-resistant strains and tend to increase in size in chloroquine-sensitive strains upon treatment with the drug. Mossbauer spectra of erythrocytes infected by a chloroquine-resistant strain revealed pigment iron in relative amounts invariable of those found in chloroquine-sensitive strains, demonstrating that drug-resistant parasites indeed digest hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1584041244,"Phosphatidylethanolamine is the major membrane phospholipid of Escherichia coli, and two experimental approaches were used to investigate the metabolic activity of the fatty acids occupying the 1-position of this phospholipid. [3H]Acetate pulse-chase experiments with logarithmically growing cells indicated that 3-5% of the acyl groups were removed from the phosphatidylethanolamine pool/generation. The reacylation aspect of the turnover cycle was demonstrated by the incorporation of fatty acids into the 1-position of pre-existing phosphatidylethanolamine when de novo phospholipid biosynthesis was inhibited using the plsB acyltransferase mutant. 2- Acylglycerophosphoethanolamine would be the intermediate in a 1-position turnover cycle, and this lysophospholipid was identified as a membrane component that could re-esterified by a membrane-bound acyltransferase. The acyltransferase either utilized acyl-acyl carrier protein directly as an acyl donor or activated fatty acids for acyl transfer in the presence of ATP and Mg2+. Acyl-acyl carrier protein was also indicated as an intermediate in the latter reacylation reaction by the complete inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine formation from fatty acids by acyl carrier protein-specific antibodies and by the observation that the inhibition of the acyltransferase by LiCl was reversed by the addition of acyl carrier protein. Coenzyme A thioesters were not substrates for this acyltransferase. These results suggest the existence of a metabolic cycle for the utilization of 1-position acyl moieties of phosphatidylethanolamine followed by the resynthesis of this membrane phospholipid from 2- acylglycerophosphoethanolamine by an acyl carrier protein-dependent 1-position acyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1037383866,"The stoichiometric coupling mechanism of the membrane potential (delta psi) in the reaction of H+/proline symport was investigated kinetically, using cytoplasmic membrane vesicles of the proline carrier-overproducing strain of Escherichia coli MinS/ pLC4 -45. When a delta psi was imposed across the cytoplasmic membrane by respiration, the Michaelis constant of transport (Kt) was lowered to about 1 microM, which was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of passive influx and efflux, and the maximum velocity (Vmax) was concomitantly enhanced as an exponential function of delta psi. Thermodynamically, the carrier translocated proline with a stoichiometry of 2 mol of protons versus 1 mol of substrate when driven by a delta psi at pH 8.0. Data on the delta psi dependence of Vmax of proline transport could be explained quantitatively by the Geck-Heinz hypothesis (Geck, P., and Heinz, E. (1976) Biochim, Biophys. Acta 443, 49-63). A symmetrical model of the 2H+/proline symport via formation of a carrier/H+/substrate (CH+H+S) intermediate is proposed. In this model, the effect of delta psi on the Kt was resolved as stimulation of formation of a transport intermediate, whereas the effect of delta psi on the Vmax was explained by enhancement of translocation of loaded carriers between the two sides of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2029417973,"The dnaY gene of E. coli, thought to be involved in the polymerization phase of DNA replication, was localized on a fragment 118 base pairs in length. This fragment, cloned in two different vectors and tested in a dnaY (Ts) recA host, has dnaY + complementing activity. The nucleotide sequence of the 118 base pairs and flanking bases was determined. The dnaY complementing activity was inactivated by transposon insertion and by localized chemical mutagenesis. Three independent insertions of Tn5 into the 118 base pair region eliminated dnaY activity. Eight single-base-change mutations that resulted in loss of dnaY activity also were located within the 118 base pair region. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence reveals a potential promoter but reveals no open reading frames likely to be translated into polypeptides. However, an RNA transcript of the dnaY region is synthesized in vivo. Perhaps the active product of dnaY is a small RNA or perhaps the dnaY region functions as a site."
https://openalex.org/W1493291508,"The synthesis of serine hydroxymethyltransferase during methionine limitation is different in met A and met B auxotrophs, mutants defective in homocysteine biosynthesis, as compared to met E and met F auxotrophs, mutants which are unable to methylate homocysteine and thus unable to either synthesize methionine de novo or to regenerate it after use via methylation reactions. Methods for the measurement of intracellular concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids and nucleosides were developed and applied to cultures of the methionine auxotrophs. No definitive correlation between the absolute intracellular concentration of any single metabolite and the rate of serine hydroxymethyltransferase synthesis was found. However, a high correlation (0.92) was found with the ratio of homocysteine to S-adenosylmethionine, with the rate of enzyme synthesis being a hyperbolic function of the ratio. This is consistent with homocysteine acting as an inducer and S-adenosylmethionine as a corepressor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase synthesis with high affinity for a repressor molecule. This correlation holds only during methionine limitation, and was not observed during glucose limitation or in unrestricted cultures with added adenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1557250038,"Abstract Competitive binding curves for 125I-insulin on a cultured rat hepatoma, H4-II-E-C'3, indicated that low competitive insulin concentrations increased label binding. This upward deflection of the binding curve or hook effect occurred at physiological concentrations of insulin. Lectins capable of mimicking insulin also stimulated insulin binding on whole cells, membranes, and solubilized receptors, apparently by increasing the affinity of the receptor for the hormone. An anti-receptor antibody and derived FAB fragments also elicited a similar increase in insulin binding affinity. At insulin levels below 10 ng/ml, the binding curves exhibited sigmoidicity consistent with positive cooperativity. This property appears to be intrinsic to the receptor and may be due to its oligomeric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1509349467,"During development of fast contracting skeletal muscle in the rat hindleg, embryonic and neonatal forms of the myosin heavy chain are present prior to the accumulation of the adult fast type ( Whalen , R. G., Sell, S. M., Butler-Browne, G.S., Schwartz, K., Bouveret, P., and Pinset -H arstr om, I. (1981) Nature (Lond.) 292, 805-809). Polypeptide mapping of the heavy chain subunit using partial proteolysis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate has shown differences in the cleavage patterns for these various heavy chains. Using this technique, we have now examined subfragments, which represent functional domains, from several different myosin isozymes. The heavy chains of the S-1 subfragments containing either light chain 1 or light chain 3 are indistinguishable for the neonatal or fast myosin isozymes. We also isolated the S-1 fragments and the alpha-helical COOH-terminal half of the molecule (rod) from rat embryonic, neonatal, and adult fast and slow myosin, as well as myosin from cardiac ventricles. All of these S-1 and rod fragments were different, indicating that the previously reported differences among these different myosin heavy chain isozymes are located in both the S-1 and rod subfragments for all myosins examined. However, the polypeptide maps of neonatal and adult fast S-1 show clear similarities, as do the maps of slow and cardiac S-1. These similarities in the two pairs of polypeptide maps were confirmed by the results of immunoblotting experiments using antibodies to adult fast and to slow myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1572345716,"Abstract Serine hydroxymethyltransferase was synthesized as a constant fraction of total protein of Escherichia coli over a wide range of specific growth rates. This was observed in all strains when grown in glucose-limited chemostat cultures; in thymine-requiring mutants during thymidine-limited growth; and in met A and met B auxotrophs, defective in homocysteine biosynthesis, during methionine-limited growth. This behavior has been referred to by others as metabolic control. In addition, the synthesis of serine hydroxy-methyltransferase was subject to specific active control mechanisms, which responded to the needs of the cell for purine biosynthesis, methylation reactions, as well as to serine limitation. Under purine limitation, the rate of enzyme synthesis increased with decreasing growth rate, that is with increasing purine limitation. During methionine-limited growth of met E and met F auxotrophs (mutants unable to methylate homocysteine) the rate of enzyme synthesis increased with a decrease in specific growth rate from 0.65 to 0.30 h-1 but declined with further decrease in growth rate. Under serine limitation the rate of enzyme synthesis remained proportional to the growth rate, but at a rate twice that observed in unrestricted or glucose-limited growth. When purines were added to unrestricted or glucose-limited cultures, the rate of enzyme synthesis decreased by 40%, but remained proportional to growth rate. Addition of methionine or serine alone had no effect."
https://openalex.org/W1492365338,"Specific inhibition of 2H+/proline symport by syn-coupled ions (Na+, Li+, and H+) was investigated using cytoplasmic membrane vesicles prepared from the proline carrier-overproducing strain MinS/ pLC4 -45 of Escherichia coli K12. The 2H+/proline symport driven by the membrane potential generated via respiration with 20 mM ascorbate/Tris, 0.1 mM phenazine methosulfate was specifically inhibited by Na+. The inhibition by Na+ was described by a fully noncompetitive mechanism, and the apparent Ki for Na+ was 15 mM. A linear correlation between the apparent Vmax and the apparent Kd was observed. Li+ stimulated the transport activity 2-fold at 10 mM and inhibited it at concentrations above 50 mM. H+ caused fully noncompetitive inhibition of 2H+/proline symport, and its apparent Ki was 0.6 microM. These results indicate that the concentrations of Na+ and H+ strictly and independently regulate the amount of the active C state carrier responsible for 2H+/proline symport driven by the membrane potential by inhibiting the transition from the C* state carrier which exhibits Na+- and H+-dependent binding of proline and is predominant in nonenergized conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1640222839,"The stopped flow method has been used to determine the pH dependence of the kinetics of the binding of NADPH to chicken liver fatty acid synthase over the pH range 6.0-8.5. The kinetics is consistent with a one-step binding mechanism, and the pH dependence of the second order rate constant indicates that an ionizable group either on the enzyme or on NADPH with a pK alpha of 6.1 is of importance in the binding process. The isotope rate effects have been determined for the steady state reaction with (S)- and (R)-[4-2H] NADPH as substrates and are very small. The pH dependence of the rate constant characterizing the reduction of acetoacetyl by NADPH on the enzyme (beta-ketoacyl reductase) and the isotope rate effects on this constant with (S)-[4-2H]NADPH as substrate also have been measured with the stopped flow method. A small pH-dependent isotope rate effect is found; these results suggest hydride transfer is not rate limiting for the beta-ketoacyl reductase reaction on the enzyme surface. The pH dependence of this rate constant is bell shaped and is very similar to that of the turnover number for the overall reaction; this suggests that the beta-ketoacyl reductase reaction may be partially rate limiting for the overall reaction when the enzyme is saturated with substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1504120318,"The analysis of initial velocity kinetic data was used to examine the order in which fMet-tRNA and the coat cistron of genomic bacteriophage R17 or Q beta RNA bind to the 30 S ribosome subunit. These data were obtained using a quantitative assay for protein synthesis in Escherichia coli extracts where the rate of accumulation of protein product is dependent on the concentration of mRNA and is partially dependent on fMet-tRNA. Under the conditions of this assay, the amount of protein synthesized was proportional to the formation of ternary complexes between the mRNA, fMet-tRNA, and the 30 S ribosomal subunit. The results from the initial velocity and alternative substrate experiments are consistent with a rapid equilibrium ordered mechanism as opposed to a rapid equilibrium random mechanism. Analysis of the rate of coat protein synthesis at varied concentrations of mRNA and fixed concentrations of fMet-tRNA indicated that fMet-tRNA was the first substrate to bind to the 30 S subunit when either coat cistron was used as the mRNA. This scheme assumes the existence of a relatively slow step in protein synthesis that occurs after both the initiating tRNA and mRNA are bound to the ribosome and which allows substrate addition to reach thermodynamic equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1558697039,"Alleles of the yeast mitochondrial var 1 gene, which encode a protein (var 1) associated with the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, contain one or two identical GC clusters within the coding region that are transcribed and retained in the putative var 1 mRNA (Zassenhaus, H.P., and Butow, R. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8417-8421). By comparing peptide fragments generated by defined chemical and enzymatic cleavages of the products of these alleles, we show that these GC clusters encode amino acids in the var 1 protein. First, there is a strict correlation between the presence of an optional GC cluster in the var 1 gene and a corresponding increase in size of the peptide that would contain the extra amino acids encoded by that GC cluster. Second, we find proline residues in specific peptides of var 1 that, from DNA sequence, would only be present if the GC clusters were translated. Thus, although the yeast mitochondrial genome contains 70-100 GC clusters similar to those in var 1, the var 1 protein is the only mitochondrial translation product now known to contain amino acids encoded by these elements. We have also examined predictions of var 1 secondary structure and find little resemblance to the secondary structures predicted for most other ribosomal proteins. Finally, our analysis suggests a significant conformational difference between the var 1 protein containing amino acids encoded by the optional GC cluster and the form of the protein lacking those amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1626104976,"The present study provides evidence for a new rat liver microsomal enzyme, a short chain beta-ketoacyl (acetoacetyl)-CoA reductase, which is separate from the long chain beta-ketoacyl-CoA reductase component of the microsomal fatty acid chain elongation system. This microsomal reductase converts acetoacetyl-CoA to beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA at a rate of 70 nmol/min/mg of protein; the enzyme has a specific requirement for NADH and appears to obtain electrons directly from the reduced pyridine nucleotide without the intervention of cytochrome b5 and its flavoprotein reductase. The apparent Km of the enzyme of the acetoacetyl-CoA was 21 microM and for the cofactor, 18 microM. The pH optimum was broad, ranging from 6.5 to 8.0. The product formed is the D-isomer of beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. High carbohydrate fat-free diet resulted in a small but significant (35%) increase in microsomal acetoacetyl-CoA reductase activity. The cytosol also contains this enzyme activity, measuring approximately 57% of that found in the microsomes. The mitochondrial activity which is 20-25% higher than the microsomal activity appears to be due to L-beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase which converts acetoacetyl-CoA to L-beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The microsomal acetoacetyl-CoA reductase activity was extracted from the microsomal membrane by 0.4 M KCl, resulting in an 8- to 10-fold purification; in addition, the long chain fatty acid elongation system was unaffected by this extraction procedure. Employing beta- hydroxyhexanoyl -CoA as a substrate, evidence is also provided for a separate dehydratase which acts on short chain substrates. Lastly, the liver microsomes had no detectable acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase or acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase activities. Hence, the possible involvement of the rat hepatic microsomal short chain beta-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, short chain beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase, and the previously reported short chain trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase in the hepatic utilization of acetoacetyl-CoA and in the synthesis of butyryl-CoA for hepatic lipogenesis is discussed."

In this report we characterized the isolated enzyme with the help of a new assay system for measurement of proteoglycan core protein degradation, which utilizes aminopropyl glass beads derivatized with hyaluronic acid. This enzyme, with a neutral pH optimum and apparent molecular weight of about 30,000, is secreted into culture medium in an active form. It is resistant to cartilage-derived inhibitors and to alpha 2-macroglobulin as well as to synthetic and natural inhibitors of serine-, thiol- and carboxylproteinases . It is inhibited by a chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline and thiol compounds at relatively high concentrations, and therefore is probably a metalloproteinase. The enzyme degrades type V collagen, types I and II denatured collagen (gelatin), and casein in addition to cartilage proteoglycan, but not bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, fibrinogen, elastin or native collagen types I, II, III, and IV. These findings suggest that the Yoshida sarcoma may degrade cartilage matrix in vivo by means of a secreted, active, inhibitor-resistant enzyme."
