However, tomato inflorescences resemble wild ancestors, and breeders avoided excessive branching because of low fertility. We found branched variants carry mutations in two related transcription factors that were selected independently. One founder mutation enlarged the leaf-like organs on fruits and was selected as fruit size increased during domestication. The other mutation eliminated the flower abscission zone, providing “jointless” fruit stems that reduced fruit dropping and facilitated mechanical harvesting.

Exploiting natural and engineered alleles for multiple family members, we achieved a continuum of inflorescence complexity that allowed breeding of higher-yielding hybrids. Characterizing and neutralizing similar cases of negative epistasis could improve productivity in many agricultural organisms. The architectures of plant reproductive shoot systems—inflorescences—are major determinants of crop yield, and modified inflorescence complexity was a recurring target during crop domestication and improvement (Meyer and Purugganan, 2013Meyer R.S. Purugganan M.D. Evolution of crop species: genetics of domestication and diversification.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 840-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Prominent examples include the cereal crops barley, maize, rice, and wheat, for which humans selected variants with greater branching to increase flower and grain production (Boden et al., 2015Boden S.A.

Genet. 2011; 43: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Yet for many crops, particularly fruit-bearing species such as grape and tomato, inflorescence architecture has changed little from wild ancestors and, therefore, has been underexploited in breeding (Mullins et al., 1992Mullins M.G. Bouquet A. Williams L.E. Biology of the Grapevine. Cambridge Univ. Press, 1992Google Scholar, Peralta and Spooner, 2005Peralta I.E. Spooner D.M. Morphological Characterization and Relationships of Wild Tomatoes (Solanum L. Section Lycopersicon).Missouri Botanical Garden Press. 2005; 104: 227-257Google Scholar). Variation in inflorescence architecture is based on changes in the activity of meristems, small groups of stem cells located at the tips of shoots (Kyozuka et al., 2014Kyozuka J. Tokunaga H. Yoshida A. Control of grass inflorescence form by the fine-tuning of meristem phase change.Curr. Opin.

Meristem maturation and inflorescence architecture--lessons from the Solanaceae.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2014; 17: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During the transition to flowering, vegetative meristems gradually mature to a reproductive state and, depending on the species, terminate immediately in a flower or give rise to a variable number of new inflorescence meristems that become additional flowers or flower-bearing branches. In domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its wild progenitor S. pimpinellifolium, a new inflorescence meristem emerges at the flank of each previous meristem. Several reiterations of this process give rise to inflorescences with multiple flowers arranged in a zigzag pattern, resulting in the familiar “tomatoes-on-the-vine” architecture (Figure 1A) (Park et al., 2012Park S.J. Jiang K. Schatz M.C. Lippman Z.B. Rate of meristem maturation determines inflorescence architecture in tomato.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite a rich resource of wild relatives that develop weakly branched inflorescences with high fertility, improving tomato inflorescence architecture to boost flower production and yield has remained challenging due to genetic incompatibilities and the challenge of transferring complex polygenic traits (Lemmon et al., 2016Lemmon Z.H. Park S.J. Jiang K. Van Eck J. Schatz M.C. Lippman Z.B. The evolution of inflorescence diversity in the nightshades and heterochrony during meristem maturation.Genome Res. 2016; 26: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Lippman et al., 2008Lippman Z.B.

Cytogenetic Notes on Tomato Species and Hybrids.Genetics. 1947; 32: 165-177PubMed Google Scholar). Another potentially valuable source of inflorescence variation is rare natural and induced highly branched mutants in domesticated germplasm. We previously showed that branching in one of these variants and in a related wild species is due to an extended meristem maturation schedule, which allows additional inflorescence meristems to form (Lemmon et al., 2016Lemmon Z.H. Park S.J. Jiang K. Van Eck J. Schatz M.C. Lippman Z.B. The evolution of inflorescence diversity in the nightshades and heterochrony during meristem maturation.Genome Res. 2016; 26: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2012Park S.J. Jiang K. Schatz M.C. Lippman Z.B. Rate of meristem maturation determines inflorescence architecture in tomato.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that subtle modification of meristem maturation could provide beneficial changes in inflorescence architecture (Park et al., 2014aPark S.J. Eshed Y. Lippman Z.B. Meristem maturation and inflorescence architecture--lessons from the Solanaceae.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2014; 17: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Yet breeders typically select against even moderate branching, primarily due to imbalances in source-sink relationships that cause flower abortion and low fruit production, especially in large-fruited varieties (Stephenson, 1981Stephenson A.G. Flower and fruit abortion: proximate causes and ultimate functions.Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1981; 12: 253-279Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we explored a new class of branched variants from a large core collection and discovered mutations in two closely related MADS-box transcription factor genes, one of which arose during domestication and the other within the last century of crop improvement. Each mutation was selected separately for improved flower morphology and fruit retention traits. However, redundant roles in meristem maturation caused undesirable branching upon combining both mutations. Breeders overcame this negative epistasis by selecting suppressors of branching, but in so doing, they limited the potential to improve flower production through weak branching. By dissecting this interaction, we discovered a dosage relationship among natural and gene-edited mutations in multiple regulators of meristem maturation. Combining these mutations in homozygous and heterozygous states allowed us to create a quantitative range of inflorescence types and develop weakly branched hybrids with higher flower and fruit production. To explore the challenges with improving tomato inflorescences, we screened a core collection of 4,193 wild and domesticated accessions for deviation from the typical inflorescence architecture of multiple flowers arranged along a single branch (Figure 1A) (https://unity.phenome-networks.com, see STAR Methods). We previously reported 23 extremely branched accessions that were all defective in the gene COMPOUND INFLORESCENCE (S, homolog of Arabidopsis WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 9, WOX9) (Figure 1B) (Lippman et al., 2008Lippman Z.B. Cohen O. Alvarez J.P. Abu-Abied M. Pekker I. Paran I. Eshed Y. Zamir D. The making of a compound inflorescence in tomato and related nightshades.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e288Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, we also found three rare variants not allelic to s that branched less frequently and also lacked the abscission zone on the stems (pedicels) of flowers known as the “joint” (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1A–S1F ). Searching other germplasm sources provided one additional branched jointless mutant derived from an X-ray mutagenesis (Figures S1C and S1F) (Stubbe, 1972Stubbe H. Mutanten der Kulturtomate Lycopersicon esculentum Miller VI.Kulturpflanze. 1972; 16: 185-230Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Crosses among all four accessions failed to complement (Figures S1G–S1I). Thus, we collectively named these accessions compound inflorescence 2 (s2) and designated one accession as a reference (LA4371, see STAR Methods). An analysis of higher-order mutants between s and s2 showed an additive genetic relationship, indicating that the gene(s) underlying s2 function separately from the S gene (Figures 1C and S1J). We noted during the generation of s s2 plants that s2 segregated at a ratio of ∼1/16 (Figure 1E), suggesting that two unlinked recessive mutations underlie s2 phenotypes. Consistent with this, jointless plants (unbranched and branched) segregated as a single recessive mutation. This jointless trait resembled two classical jointless-2 (j2) mutants reported 50 years ago. The original j2 was discovered in the unbranched wild tomato species S. cheesmaniae from the Galapagos Islands (Rick, 1956aRick C.M. Genetic and Systematic Studies on Accessions of Lycospersicon from the Galapagos Islands.Am. J. Bot. 1956; 43: 687-696Crossref Google Scholar). A second allele arose spontaneously in an agricultural field, but this mutation was also associated with inflorescence branching that caused excessive flower production and poor fruit set due to epistatic interactions with the domesticated germplasm (Reynard, 1961Reynard G.B. New Source of the j2 Gene Governing Jointless Pedicel in Tomato.Science. 1961; 134: 2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Rick, 1956bRick C.M. A new jointless gene from the Galapagos L. pimpinellifolium.TGC Report. 1956; 6: 23Google Scholar). Breeders selected and utilized unbranched j2 because it reduced fruit dropping and enabled large-scale machine harvesting of processing tomatoes while maintaining good fruit set (Zahara and Scheuerman, 1988Zahara M.B. Scheuerman R.W. Hand-harvesting jointless vs. jointed-stem tomatoes.Calif. Agric. 1988; 42: 14Google Scholar). Notably, the jointless phenotype of s2 was allelic to j2 (Figure S1K), and we failed to find s2 plants with normal pedicels, suggesting that branching required the j2 mutation. We therefore designated the second locus enhancer-of-jointless2 (ej2). To better understand the developmental basis of s2 branching, we examined stages of meristem maturation during early inflorescence development. Tomato inflorescences develop according to the sympodial growth program (Park et al., 2014aPark S.J. Eshed Y. Lippman Z.B. Meristem maturation and inflorescence architecture--lessons from the Solanaceae.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2014; 17: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which each vegetative meristem matures into a transition meristem (TM) and terminates in a floral meristem (FM) that produces the first flower of the inflorescence. Additional flowers arise from iterative formation of specialized axillary (sympodial) inflorescence meristems (SIM), resulting in a multi-flowered inflorescence (Figure 1F). In s mutants, both TM and SIM maturation are severely delayed, allowing multiple SIMs to form at each cycle (Figure 1G) (Lippman et al., 2008Lippman Z.B. Cohen O. Alvarez J.P. Abu-Abied M. Pekker I. Paran I. Eshed Y. Zamir D. The making of a compound inflorescence in tomato and related nightshades.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e288Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2012Park S.J. Jiang K. Schatz M.C. Lippman Z.B. Rate of meristem maturation determines inflorescence architecture in tomato.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Additional SIMs also formed in s2 plants, but fewer than in s (Figure 1H). To determine if s2 was delayed in maturation, we performed RNA-seq on sequential s2 meristem maturation stages and compared transcriptome dynamics with existing maturation profiles for s and wild-type (WT) (see STAR Methods). A principal component analysis (PCA) using 2,582 maturation marker genes (Lemmon et al., 2016Lemmon Z.H. Park S.J. Jiang K. Van Eck J. Schatz M.C. Lippman Z.B. The evolution of inflorescence diversity in the nightshades and heterochrony during meristem maturation.Genome Res. 2016; 26: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that meristem maturation in s2 was delayed like in s, and subsets of TM and FM marker genes showed that this delay was weaker than s consistent with less branching in s2 inflorescences (Figures 1I–1K and S2). The j2 mutant was previously mapped to the centromere of chromosome 12, but poor recombination prevented identification of the responsible gene (Budiman et al., 2004Budiman M.A. Chang S.B. Lee S. Yang T.J. Zhang H.B. de Jong H. Wing R.A. Localization of jointless-2 gene in the centromeric region of tomato chromosome 12 based on high resolution genetic and physical mapping.Theor. Appl. Genet. 2004; 108: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2005Yang T.J. Lee S. Chang S.-B. Yu Y. de Jong H. Wing R.A.

To clone the genes underlying j2 and ej2, we generated two F2 populations from crossing s2 with the jointed (J2/J2) cultivar M82 and the wild ancestor of tomato, S. pimpinellifolium. In the intra-species F2 population, s2 plants segregated at the expected ratio of ∼1/16, but this segregation was substantially lower in the S. pimpinellifolium population, suggesting unknown modifier loci can suppress s2 branching (Figures S3A–S3C). To map j2 and ej2 simultaneously, we performed genome sequencing on pools of DNA from s2, j2, and WT F2 segregating plants (see STAR Methods). Comparing SNP ratios between s2 and WT pools in both populations revealed a region near the bottom of chromosome 3 and the centromere of chromosome 12 with a strong bias for SNPs from the s2 parent (Figures 2A, S3D, and S3E). SNP ratios between s2 and j2 revealed a bias only on chromosome 3. These results confirmed that j2 is located near the chromosome 12 centromere and revealed that ej2 resides on chromosome 3.Figure 2Mutations in Two SEPALLATA MADS-Box Genes Cause s2 BranchingShow full caption(A) Mapping-by-sequencing of s2.

USA. 2009; 106: 8392-8397Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The jointless1 mutant (j1) was mapped to chromosome 11 and was found to be mutated in a homolog of the Arabidopsis MADS-box flowering regulator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) (Mao et al., 2000Mao L. Begum D. Chuang H.W. Budiman M.A. Szymkowiak E.J. Irish E.E. Wing R.A. JOINTLESS is a MADS-box gene controlling tomato flower abscission zone development.Nature. 2000; 406: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We therefore searched the ∼6 Mbp j2 mapping interval for MADS-box genes, and among the 164 genes in this region, we found only one candidate, Solyc12g038510, a homolog of the Arabidopsis floral organ identity MADS-box gene SEPALLATA4 (SEP4) (Figure 2B) (Ditta et al., 2004Ditta G. Pinyopich A. Robles P. Pelaz S. Yanofsky M.F. The SEP4 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana functions in floral organ and meristem identity.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Previous transcriptional silencing of Solyc12g038510 resulted in jointless pedicels, but it was suggested that Solyc12g038510 and J2 were different genes because the published j2 mapping interval did not coincide with Solyc12g038510, likely from unreliable centromeric marker resolution (Budiman et al., 2004Budiman M.A. Chang S.B. Lee S. Yang T.J. Zhang H.B. de Jong H. Wing R.A. Localization of jointless-2 gene in the centromeric region of tomato chromosome 12 based on high resolution genetic and physical mapping.Theor. Appl.

However, our genomic sequencing of s2 and j2 mutants exposed a Copia-like Rider-type transposable element (TE) in the first intron of Solyc12g038510 that was absent in WT (Figure 2C). Furthermore, our s2 RNA-seq revealed that most Solyc12g038510 transcripts initiated in the first intron, resulting in an early nonsense mutation (Figures 2D and S3H). To validate that Solyc12g038510 is J2, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer loss-of-function mutations, and the resulting j2CR plants developed jointless unbranched inflorescences (Figures 2E and 2F). Moreover, progeny from crossing j2CR with s2-derived j2 had jointless and unbranched inflorescences (Figure 2G), and sequencing Solyc12g038510 in the original j2 S. cheesmaniae accession revealed an early stop codon (Figures S3F–S3H). Thus, the SEP4 gene Solyc12g038510 is J2, and two natural mutations arose independently (hereafter designated j2TE and j2stop) (Reynard, 1961Reynard G.B. New Source of the j2 Gene Governing Jointless Pedicel in Tomato.Science. 1961; 134: 2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Rick, 1956aRick C.M. Genetic and Systematic Studies on Accessions of Lycospersicon from the Galapagos Islands.Am. J. Bot. 1956; 43: 687-696Crossref Google Scholar). Both j2 and ej2 are required for s2 branching, suggesting that the underlying genes function redundantly, similar to SEP genes in Arabidopsis that control floral organ identity (Ditta et al., 2004Ditta G.

We searched the 66 genes in the 500 kbp ej2 mapping interval for MADS-box genes and found the tandemly arranged Solyc03g114830 and Solyc03g114840 (Figure 2H). Solyc03g114830 is a homolog of Arabidopsis FRUITFULL and knockdown of this gene causes subtle fruit-ripening defects (Bemer et al., 2012Bemer M. Karlova R. Ballester A.R. Tikunov Y.M. Bovy A.G. Wolters-Arts M. Rossetto P.d.B. Angenent G.C. de Maagd R.A. The tomato FRUITFULL homologs TDR4/FUL1 and MBP7/FUL2 regulate ethylene-independent aspects of fruit ripening.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 4437-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our genomic sequencing of s2 mutants did not reveal any Solyc03g114830 coding or noncoding SNPs or large indels, and s2 fruits ripened normally. In contrast, Solyc03g114840 is another homolog of SEP4, and we found a 564 bp insertion in the 5th intron of s2 mutants, which was absent in WT (Figure 2I). Notably, RNA-seq reads from s2 revealed a third of Solyc03g114840 transcripts was misspliced, suggesting that the insertion caused a partial loss of function (Figure 2J). To test this and uncover the phenotypic consequences of strong loss of EJ2 function, we engineered new alleles with CRISPR/Cas9 and found ej2CR inflorescences were unbranched, but the sepals (outermost leaf-like organs of the flowers) were exceptionally large and fruits were pear-shaped (Figures 2K and 2L). To determine if the original ej2 mutation impacted flower or fruit morphology, we backcrossed ej2 into M82 and measured relative sepal length (defined by sepal/petal length ratio). Notably, whereas there was no obvious change in fruit shape or size, ej2 sepals were 50% longer than WT but shorter than ej2CR, consistent with a weak allele (Figures 2M, 2N, and S3I). Importantly, flowers of F1 progeny from crossing ej2 and ej2CR also developed long sepals. Thus, Solyc03g114840 is EJ2, and the natural ej2 mutation is a weak loss-of-function allele (hereafter designated ej2w). Finally, we verified that the other s2 accessions carried mutations in both j2 and ej2. PCR genotyping showed all but"

https://openalex.org/W2614767307,"Intron removal requires assembly of the spliceosome on precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) and extensive remodelling to form the spliceosome’s catalytic centre. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-catalytic B complex spliceosome at near-atomic resolution. The mobile U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) associates with U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP through the U2/U6 helix II and an interface between U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U2 snRNP SF3b-containing domain, which also transiently contacts the helicase Brr2. The 3′ region of the U2 snRNP is flexibly attached to the SF3b-containing domain and protrudes over the concave surface of tri-snRNP, where the U1 snRNP may reside before its release from the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site. The U6 ACAGAGA sequence forms a hairpin that weakly tethers the 5′ splice site. The B complex proteins Prp38, Snu23 and Spp381 bind the Prp8 N-terminal domain and stabilize U6 ACAGAGA stem–pre-mRNA and Brr2–U4 small nuclear RNA interactions. These results provide important insights into the events leading to active site formation. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast spliceosome in a pre-catalytic state provides insights into the molecular events leading to formation of the spliceosome active site. Protein-coding regions of DNA can be interrupted by non-coding regions, or introns. A large multisubunit complex, the spliceosome, is used to excise introns from the messenger RNA before it is translated into protein. Formation of an active spliceosome complex on an intron requires stepwise assembly of subcomplexes, followed by their rearrangement and the loss of some factors. Kiyoshi Nagai and colleagues have solved the structure of the B complex spliceosome, poised in a pre-catalytic state. The detection of several factors that were not visualized in previous spliceosome structures provides new insights regarding the process by which the complex is activated."

They find genomic regions that were likely targets of domestication and perform genome-wide association analysis to identify candidate genes for agriculturally relevant traits. Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), a tropical grain legume with low input requirements, is expected to continue to have an important role in supplying food and nutritional security in developing countries in Asia, Africa and the tropical Americas. From whole-genome resequencing of 292 Cajanus accessions encompassing breeding lines, landraces and wild species, we characterize genome-wide variation. On the basis of a scan for selective sweeps, we find several genomic regions that were likely targets of domestication and breeding. Using genome-wide association analysis, we identify associations between several candidate genes and agronomically important traits. Candidate genes for these traits in pigeonpea have sequence similarity to genes functionally characterized in other plants for flowering time control, seed development and pod dehiscence. Our findings will allow acceleration of genetic gains for key traits to improve yield and sustainability in pigeonpea."

Although a genetic etiology is indicated by an increased recurrence risk, sporadic occurrence suggests that CHD genetics is complex. Here, we show that hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe CHD, is multigenic and genetically heterogeneous. Using mouse forward genetics, we report what is, to our knowledge, the first isolation of HLHS mutant mice and identification of genes causing HLHS. Mutations from seven HLHS mouse lines showed multigenic enrichment in ten human chromosome regions linked to HLHS. Mutations in Sap130 and Pcdha9, genes not previously associated with CHD, were validated by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in mice as being digenic causes of HLHS. We also identified one subject with HLHS with SAP130 and PCDHA13 mutations. Mouse and zebrafish modeling showed that Sap130 mediates left ventricular hypoplasia, whereas Pcdha9 increases penetrance of aortic valve abnormalities, both signature HLHS defects. These findings show that HLHS can arise genetically in a combinatorial fashion, thus providing a new paradigm for the complex genetics of CHD."

However, the role of PD-L1 and PD-1 in regulating pain and neuronal function is unclear. Here we report that both melanoma and normal neural tissues including dorsal root ganglion (DRG) produce PD-L1 that can potently inhibit acute and chronic pain. Intraplantar injection of PD-L1 evoked analgesia in naive mice via PD-1, whereas PD-L1 neutralization or PD-1 blockade induced mechanical allodynia. Mice lacking Pd1 (Pdcd1) exhibited thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. PD-1 activation in DRG nociceptive neurons by PD-L1 induced phosphorylation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, inhibited sodium channels and caused hyperpolarization through activation of TREK2 K+ channels. PD-L1 also potently suppressed nociceptive neuron excitability in human DRGs. Notably, blocking PD-L1 or PD-1 elicited spontaneous pain and allodynia in melanoma-bearing mice. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized role of PD-L1 as an endogenous pain inhibitor and a neuromodulator."
https://openalex.org/W2620133966,"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), usually considered to be a genetically homogeneous disease caused by mutations in PKHD1, has been associated with ciliary dysfunction. Here, we describe mutations in DZIP1L, which encodes DAZ interacting protein 1-like, in patients with ARPKD. We further validated these findings through loss-of-function studies in mice and zebrafish. DZIP1L localizes to centrioles and to the distal ends of basal bodies, and interacts with septin2, a protein implicated in maintenance of the periciliary diffusion barrier at the ciliary transition zone. In agreement with a defect in the diffusion barrier, we found that the ciliary-membrane translocation of the PKD proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 is compromised in DZIP1L-mutant cells. Together, these data provide what is, to our knowledge, the first conclusive evidence that ARPKD is not a homogeneous disorder and further establish DZIP1L as a second gene involved in ARPKD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2616960090,"The authors monitored neuronal activity in mouse visual cortex during visual-motion stimulation and perturbed retinal direction selectivity. After perturbation, the proportion of posterior-motion-preferring cortical cells decreased, and their response at higher stimulus speeds was reduced. Thus, functionally distinct, retina-dependent and retina-independent computations of visual motion exist in mouse cortex. How neuronal computations in the sensory periphery contribute to computations in the cortex is not well understood. We examined this question in the context of visual-motion processing in the retina and primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. We disrupted retinal direction selectivity, either exclusively along the horizontal axis using FRMD7 mutants or along all directions by ablating starburst amacrine cells, and monitored neuronal activity in layer 2/3 of V1 during stimulation with visual motion. In control mice, we found an over-representation of cortical cells preferring posterior visual motion, the dominant motion direction an animal experiences when it moves forward. In mice with disrupted retinal direction selectivity, the over-representation of posterior-motion-preferring cortical cells disappeared, and their responses at higher stimulus speeds were reduced. This work reveals the existence of two functionally distinct, sensory-periphery-dependent and -independent computations of visual motion in the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2618736903,"The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) integrates auditory nerve input with a diverse array of sensory and motor signals processed in circuitry similar to that of the cerebellum. Yet how the DCN contributes to early auditory processing has been a longstanding puzzle. Using electrophysiological recordings in mice during licking behavior, we show that DCN neurons are largely unaffected by self-generated sounds while remaining sensitive to external acoustic stimuli. Recordings in deafened mice, together with neural activity manipulations, indicate that self-generated sounds are cancelled by non-auditory signals conveyed by mossy fibers. In addition, DCN neurons exhibit gradual reductions in their responses to acoustic stimuli that are temporally correlated with licking. Together, these findings suggest that DCN may act as an adaptive filter for cancelling self-generated sounds. Adaptive filtering has been established previously for cerebellum-like sensory structures in fish, suggesting a conserved function for such structures across vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2618463222,"Tumour-initiating cells, or cancer stem cells (CSCs), possess stem-cell-like properties observed in normal adult tissue stem cells. Normal and cancerous stem cells may therefore share regulatory mechanisms for maintaining self-renewing capacity and resisting differentiation elicited by cell-intrinsic or microenvironmental cues. Here, we show that miR-199a promotes stem cell properties in mammary stem cells and breast CSCs by directly repressing nuclear receptor corepressor LCOR, which primes interferon (IFN) responses. Elevated miR-199a expression in stem-cell-enriched populations protects normal and malignant stem-like cells from differentiation and senescence induced by IFNs that are produced by epithelial and immune cells in the mammary gland. Importantly, the miR-199a-LCOR-IFN axis is activated in poorly differentiated ER- breast tumours, functionally promotes tumour initiation and metastasis, and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Our study therefore reveals a common mechanism shared by normal and malignant stem cells to protect them from suppressive immune cytokine signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2617454850,"Dating fossil hominids and reconstructing their environments is critically important for understanding human evolution. Here we date the potentially oldest hominin, Graecopithecus freybergi from Europe and constrain the environmental conditions under which it thrived. For the Graecopithecus-bearing Pikermi Formation of Attica/Greece, a saline aeolian dust deposit of North African (Sahara) provenance, we obtain an age of 7.37–7.11 Ma, which is coeval with a dramatic cooling in the Mediterranean region at the Tortonian-Messinian transition. Palaeobotanic proxies demonstrate C4-grass dominated wooded grassland-to-woodland habitats of a savannah biome for the Pikermi Formation. Faunal turnover at the Tortonian-Messinian transition led to the spread of new mammalian taxa along with Graecopithecus into Europe. The type mandible of G. freybergi from Pyrgos (7.175 Ma) and the single tooth (7.24 Ma) from Azmaka (Bulgaria) represent the first hominids of Messinian age from continental Europe. Our results suggest that major splits in the hominid family occurred outside Africa."

https://openalex.org/W2617086030,"Objective To explore the ways in which stigma is experienced in healthcare and dental settings by patients with a history of addiction and mental illness. Methods Audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews with a purposefully selected convenience sample of residents from two community treatment centres in Vancouver, Canada were conducted. The interview guide contained questions about experiences while seeking health and dental care and was based on an existing framework of labeling, stereotyping, exclusion, discrimination, and power imbalance. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for coding and thematic analysis. Results Twenty-five participants between 23 and 67 years of age were interviewed; 17 were males. Most had a self-reported history of depression combined with use of alcohol and crack-cocaine; most of them only sought dental care for emergency purposes. Textual analysis of more than 300 pages of transcribed interviews revealed that participants perceived stigma when they were negatively stereotyped as ‘unworthy’, labeled as ‘different’, excluded from the decision-making process, discriminated against, ‘treated unfairly’, and felt powerless when interacting in the heath and dental care systems. Conversely, positive experiences were characterized by empathy, reassurance and good communication, which were empowering for patients. Conclusions When associated with stigma, mental illness and addictions have negative implications for accessing health and dental care. From our participants’ perspectives, it seems that the lack of understanding about their life conditions by the healthcare professionals was the origin of stigma. We suggest that an increased social awareness of these health issues be enhanced among current and future health and dental care professionals to help improve care experiences for this marginalized population."

We identified only one study documenting surface disinfection efficacy against the Ebola virus, showing a >6.6 log reduction after 5-minute exposure to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) based on small-scale tests (Cook et al. (2015)). In preparation for future extensive, large-scale disinfection efficacy experiments, we replicated the Cook et al. experiment using four potential BSL-1 surrogates selected based on similarities to the Ebola virus: bacteriophages MS2, M13, Phi6, and PR772. Each bacteriophage was exposed to 0.1% and 0.5% NaOCl for 1, 5, and 10 minutes on stainless steel. MS2 and M13 were only reduced by 3.4 log and 3.5 log after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl, and would be overly conservative surrogates. Conversely, PR772 was too easily inactivated for surrogate use, as it was reduced by >4.8 log after only 1-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. Phi6 was slightly more resistant than the Ebola virus, with 4.1 log reduction after a 5-minute exposure and not detected after a 10-minute exposure to 0.5% NaOCl. We therefore recommend Phi6 as a surrogate for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine-based surface disinfectants against the Ebola virus."

Pyrgos Vassilissis and Azmaka are currently dated to the early Messinian at 7.175 Ma and 7.24 Ma. Mainly based on its external preservation and the previously vague dating, Graecopithecus is often referred to as nomen dubium. The examination of its previously unknown dental root and pulp canal morphology confirms the taxonomic distinction from the significantly older northern Greek hominine Ouranopithecus. Furthermore, it shows features that point to a possible phylogenetic affinity with hominins. G. freybergi uniquely shares p4 partial root fusion and a possible canine root reduction with this tribe and therefore, provides intriguing evidence of what could be the oldest known hominin."
https://openalex.org/W2617643277,"Miniproteins simplify the protein-folding problem, allowing the dissection of forces that stabilize protein structures. Here we describe PPα-Tyr, a designed peptide comprising an α-helix buttressed by a polyproline II helix. PPα-Tyr is water soluble and monomeric, and it unfolds cooperatively with a midpoint unfolding temperature (TM) of 39 °C. NMR structures of PPα-Tyr reveal proline residues docked between tyrosine side chains, as designed. The stability of PPα is sensitive to modifications in the aromatic residues: replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine, i.e., changing three solvent-exposed hydroxyl groups to protons, reduces the TM to 20 °C. We attribute this result to the loss of CH-π interactions between the aromatic and proline rings, which we probe by substituting the aromatic residues with nonproteinogenic side chains. In analyses of natural protein structures, we find a preference for proline-tyrosine interactions over other proline-containing pairs, and observe abundant CH-π interactions in biologically important complexes between proline-rich ligands and SH3 and similar domains."

In the current study, we investigated the effect of autophagy inhibitor to gefitinib (Ge) in TNBC cells in vitro and in nude mice vivo. Our study demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by 3-Methyladenine or bafilomycin A1 improved Ge’s sensitivity to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, as evidence from stronger inhibition of cell vitality and colony formation, higher level of G0/G1 arrest and DNA damage, and these effects were verified in nude mice vivo. Our data showed that the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway was activated in favor of promoting apoptosis in the therapy of Ge combined autophagy inhibitor, as the elevation of BAX/Bcl-2, Cytochrome C, and CASP3.

The link between high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) remains unclear. Methods From March to October 2014, gynecological examinations and questionnaires were conducted on 1218 married women. Cervical secretions and vaginal swab specimens were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), yeast, clue cells and HR-HPV. Results Laboratory results were available for 1195 of 1218 married women. HR-HPV was detected in 7.0% of participants. Forty-seven percent of women had lower genital tract infections (LGTIs). UU was the most common infection (35.5%), followed by bacterial vaginosis (BV) (10.5%), yeast infection (3.7%), CT (2.2%), and Trichomonas vaginalis (1.7%). BV was associated with an increased risk of HR- HPV (P < 0.0001; odds ratio, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.7–5.4]). There was a strong correlation between abnormal cervical cytology and HR-HPV infection (P < 0.0001). Conclusions The prevalence of LGTIs in Beijing is at a high level. It is clinically important to screen for the simultaneous presence of pathogens that cause co-infections with HR-HPV."

Methods: Archived plasma samples were randomly selected within age strata from 960 children less than 145 months of age admitted to Kilifi County Hospital pediatric wards between 2007 and 2010. Samples were tested for antibodies to RSV using crude virus IgG ELISA. Seroprevalence (and 95% confidence intervals) was estimated as the proportion of children with specific antibodies above a defined cut-off level. Nested catalytic models were used to explore different assumptions on antibody dynamics and estimate the rates of decay of RSV specific maternal antibody and acquisition of infection with age, and the average age of infection.

Results: RSV specific antibody prevalence was 100% at age 0-<1month, declining rapidly over the first 6 months of life, followed by an increase in the second half of the first year of life and beyond. Seroprevalence was lowest throughout the age range 5–11 months; all children were seropositive beyond 3 years of age. The best fit model to the data yielded estimates for the rate of infection of 0.78/person/year (95% CI 0.65–0.97) and 1.69/person/year (95% CI 1.27–2.04) for ages 0-<1 year and 1-<12 years, respectively. The rate of loss of maternal antibodies was estimated as 2.54/year (95% CI 2.30–2.90), i.e. mean duration 4.7 months. The mean age at primary infection was estimated at 15 months (95% CI 13–18).

Conclusions: The rate of decay of maternal antibody prevalence and subsequent age-acquisition of infection are rapid, and the average age at primary infection early. The vaccination window is narrow, and suggests optimal targeting of vaccine to infants 5 months and above to achieve high seroconversion."

Few reports have comprehensively investigated multiple cytokine profiles in cord blood and precisely identified surrogate markers for intrauterine inflammation.To identify the cytokines and surrogate markers associated with intrauterine inflammation and subsequent neonatal complications.We analyzed cord blood samples from 135 patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Sasebo City General Hospital. We retrospectively determined the associations between the presence of neonatal complications and cord blood cytokines, prenatal factors, and laboratory data at birth. A total of 27 cytokines in the cord blood were measured using a bead-based array sandwich immunoassay.Both Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were low, whereas the levels of growth factors and chemokines were high. In particular, chemokines IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1α were significantly higher in very premature neonates when compared with more mature neonates. In addition, some have been shown to be associated with multiple neonatal complications, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and chronic lung disease (CLD). Similarly, the levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, nucleated RBC, and urinary β2-microglobulin were associated with these complications and chemokine levels.Our results suggest the association of inflammatory chemokines IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1α with intrauterine inflammation, premature birth, and neonatal complications in these perinatal subjects. Furthermore, the association of the aforementioned biomarkers with PDA, RDS, and CLD may help establish early diagnostic measures to predict such neonatal complications following intrauterine inflammation."

Anthropogenic activities lead to the release of increasing amounts of uranium and depleted uranium (DU) in the environment, posing potential risks to aquatic organisms due to radiological and chemical toxicity of this radionucleide. Although environmental contaminations with high levels of uranium have already been observed, chronic exposures of non-human species to levels close to the environmental quality standards remain scarcely characterized. The present study focused on the identification of the molecular pathways impacted by a chronic exposure of zebrafish to 20 μg/L of DU during 10 days. The transcriptomic effects were evaluated by the use of the mRNAseq analysis in three organs of adult zebrafish, the brain the testis and the ovaries, and two developmental stages of the adult fish progeny, two-cells embryo and four-days larvae. The results highlight generic effects on the cell adhesion process, but also specific transcriptomic responses depending on the organ or the developmental stage investigated. The analysis of the transgenerational effects of DU-exposure on the four-day zebrafish larvae demonstrate an induction of genes involved in oxidative response (cat, mpx, sod1 and sod2), a decrease of expression of the two hatching enzymes (he1a and he1b), the deregulation of the expression of gene coding for the ATPase complex and the induction of cellular stress. Electron microscopy analysis of skeletal muscles on the four-days larvae highlights significant histological impacts on the ultrastructure of both the mitochondria and the myofibres. In addition, the comparison with the transcriptomic data obtained for the acetylcholine esterase mutant reveals the induction of protein-chaperons in the skeletal muscles of the progeny of fish chronically exposed to DU, pointing towards long lasting effects of this chemical in the muscles. The results presented in this study support the hypothesis that a chronic parental exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of DU could impair the progeny development with significant effects observed both at the molecular level and on the histological ultrastructure of organs. This study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset useful for ecotoxicological studies on other fish species at the molecular level. It also provides a key DU responsive gene, egr1, which may be a candidate biomarker for monitoring aquatic pollution by heavy metals."

Recently, the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathogen-host interactions have been highlighted. In the present study, we performed comprehensive miRNA profiling in EV71- and CA16-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at multiple time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 135 known miRNAs exhibited remarkable differences in expression. Of these, 30 differentially expressed miRNAs presented opposite trends in EV71- and CA16-infected samples. Subsequently, we mainly focused on the 30 key differentially expressed miRNAs through further screening to predict targets. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed the enrichment of 14 biological processes, 9 molecular functions, 8 cellular components, and 85 pathways. The regulatory networks of these miRNAs with predicted targets, GOs, pathways, and co-expression genes were determined, suggesting that miRNAs display intricate regulatory mechanisms during the infection phase. Consequently, we specifically analyzed the hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in biological adhesion. The results indicated that the distinct changes induced by EV71 and CA16 infection may be partly linked to the function of the blood-brain barrier. Taken together, this is the first report describing miRNA expression profiles in HUVECs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our data provide useful insights that may help to elucidate the different host-pathogen interactions following EV71 and CA16 infection and offer novel therapeutic targets for these infections."

Raman micro-spectroscopy allows the non-invasive evaluation of the molecular composition of cells, based on the inelastic scattering of laser photons by vibrating molecules. The aim of this work was to assess the biochemical modifications of both the zona pellucida and cytoplasm of vitrified/warmed in vitro matured bovine oocytes at different post-warming times. By taking advantage of Principal Component Analysis, we were able to shed light on the biochemical transformation induced by the cryogenic treatment, also pointing out the specific role of cryoprotective agents (CPs). Our results suggest that vitrification induces a transformation of the protein secondary structure from the α-helices to the β-sheet form, while lipids tend to assume a more packed configuration in the zona pellucida. Both modifications result in a mechanical hardening of this cellular compartment, which could account for the reduced fertility rates of vitrified oocytes. Furthermore, biochemical modifications were observed at the cytoplasmic level in the protein secondary structure, with α-helices loss, suggesting cold protein denaturation. In addition, a decrease of lipid unsaturation was found in vitrified oocytes, suggesting oxidative damages. Interestingly, most modifications were not observed in oocytes exposed to CPs, suggesting that they do not severely affect the biochemical architecture of the oocyte. Nevertheless, in oocytes exposed to CPs decreased developmental competence and increased reactive oxygen species production were observed compared to the control. A more severe reduction of cleavage and blastocyst rates after in vitro fertilization was obtained from vitrified oocytes. Our experimental outcomes also suggest a certain degree of reversibility of the induced transformations, which renders vitrified oocytes more similar to untreated cells after 2 h warming."

Erythromycin-resistance was observed in 25 isolates possessing ermB, mef or a 23S rRNA A2061G point mutation; 2 penicillin-resistant isolates had recombinant pbp1a, pbp2a and/or pbp2x; 3 tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM; and 1 isolate was multidrug-resistant. Virulence factor analysis indicated a high level of homogeneity among the 22F/ST433 clonal complex strains. A group of 6 phylogenetic outlier strains had differing MLST, antimicrobial resistance and molecular profiles suggestive of capsule switching events. While capsule switch events among S. pneumoniae serotype 22F has been observed, increasing prevalence of S. pneumoniae serotype 22F can be attributed to an evolving homogenous clone expanding nationally through local transmission events."
https://openalex.org/W2618155223,"Background Although the occupational health field has identified psychosocial factors as risk factors for low back pain that causes disability, the association between disabling low back pain and psychosocial factors has not been examined adequately in Japanese hospital workers. Therefore, this study examined the association between low back pain, which interfered with work, and psychosocial factors in Japanese hospital workers. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted at a hospital in Japan. In total, 280 hospital workers were recruited from various occupational settings. Of these, 203 completed a self-administered questionnaire that included items concerning individual characteristics, severity of low back pain, fear-avoidance beliefs (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), somatic symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8), psychological distress (K6), workaholism, and work-related psychosocial factors (response rate: 72.5%). Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with disabling low back pain. Results Of the 203 participants who completed questionnaires, 36 (17.7%) reported low back pain that interfered with their work. Multivariate analyses with individual factors and occupations adjusted for showed statistically significant associations between disabling low back pain and fear-avoidance beliefs (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.619, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.003–6.538], somatic symptoms (OR: 4.034, 95% CI: 1.819–9.337), and interpersonal stress at work (OR: 2.619, 95% CI: 1.067–6.224). Conclusions Psychosocial factors, such as fear-avoidance beliefs, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal relationships at work, were important risk factors in low back pain that interfered with work in Japanese hospital workers. With respect to occupational health, consideration of psychosocial factors is required to reduce disability related to low back pain."
https://openalex.org/W2618394802,"The level of perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) was determined in North East Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) liver samples from 15 Norwegian fjords and harbors. Five harbors in the eastern part of Norway, six harbors in the western part and four harbours in the northern part. A total of 200 samples were analyzed for 16 PFAS. Determination of PFAS were carried out by LC-MS/MS following sample clean up by solid phase extraction and ultracentrifugation. The predominating PFAS was PFOS, which was found to be higher than the level of quantification (1.5 μg kg-1 wet weight) in 72% of the samples. The highest level of PFOS found was 21.8 μg kg-1 wet weight in a sample from Kragerø in the eastern part of Norway. A significantly higher level of PFOS was found in the eastern fjords and harbors compared to fjords and harbors in the western and northern part of Norway. Within the northern fjords and harbors elevated PFOS levels were found in Narvik, which may indicate a local source there. Variations in PFOS of the cod livers thus reflect differences in levels of pollution between the areas."
https://openalex.org/W2618660946,"This paper concerns the changes occurred over both decennial and millennial spans of time in a sponge assemblage present in coralligenous biogenic build-ups growing at 15 m depth in the Ligurian Sea (Western Mediterranean). The comparison of the sponge diversity after a time interval of about 40 years (1973–2014) showed a significant reduction in species richness (about 45%). This decrease affected mainly the massive/erect sponges, and in particular the subclass Keratosa, with a species loss of 67%, while the encrusting and cavity dwelling sponges lost the 36% and 50%, respectively. The boring sponges lost only one species (25%). This changing pattern suggested that the inner habitat of the bioconstructions was less affected by the variations of the environmental conditions or by the human pressures which, on the contrary, strongly affected the species living on the surface of the biogenic build-ups. Five cores extracted from the bioherms, dating back to 3500 YBP, allowed to analyse the siliceous spicules remained trapped in them in order to obtain taxonomic information. Changes at generic level in diversity and abundance were observed at 500/250-years intervals, ranging between 19 and 33 genera. The number of genera showed a sharp decrease since 3500–3000 to 3000–2500 YBP. After this period, the genera regularly increased until 1500–1250 YBP, from when they progressively decreased until 1000–500 YBP. Tentatively, these changes could be related to the different climatic periods that followed one another in the Mediterranean area within the considered time span. The recent depletion in sponge richness recorded in the Ligurian coralligenous can be considered relevant. In fact, the analysis of the spicules indicated that the sponges living in these coralligenous habitats remained enough stable during 3000 years, but could have lost a significant part of their biodiversity in the last decades, coinciding with a series of warming episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2619702868,"Background Health-related Quality of Life (HrQoL) is probably the most important outcome parameter for the evaluation and management of chronic diseases. As this parameter is subjective and prone to bias, there is an urgent need to identify objective surrogate markers. Gait velocity has been shown to be associated with HrQoL in numerous chronic diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). With the development and wide availability of simple-to-use wearable sensors and sophisticated gait algorithms, kinematic gait parameters may soon be implemented in clinical routine management. However, the association of such kinematic gait parameters with HrQoL in PD has not been assessed to date. Methods Kinematic gait parameters from a 20-meter walk from 43 PD patients were extracted using a validated wearable sensor system. They were compared with the Visual Analogue Scale of the Euro-Qol-5D (EQ-5D VAS) by performing a multiple regression analysis, with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model as a framework. Results Use of assistive gait equipment, but no kinematic gait parameter, was significantly associated with HrQoL. Conclusion The widely accepted concept of a positive association between gait velocity and HrQoL may, at least in PD, be driven by relatively independent parameters, such as assistive gait equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2619762340,"Spermatogenesis is a complex process that involves many elements. However, until now, little is known at the molecular level about spermatogenesis in poultry. Here we investigated microRNAs and their target genes that may be involved in germ cell development and spermatogonial in chicken. We used next-generation sequencing to analyze miRNA expression profiles in three types of germline cells: primordial germ cells (PGCs), spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), and spermatogonia (Sp) during early stage of spermatogenesis. After validated the candidate miRNAs and corresponding genes’ expression in three types of cells, we found 15 miRNAs that were enriched 21 target genes that may be involved in spermatogenesis. Among the enriched miRNAs, miR-202-5p/3p were up-regulated in the Sp library and down-regulated in the PGCs library. Through RT-qPCR and Dual-Luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed that miR-202-5p bind to LIMK2 and involved in germ cell development. Collectively, we firstly discover the novel miRNAs, like miR-202-5p, and its related genes and pathways, expressed during the early spermatogonial stage in chicken, which will provide new clues for deciphering the molecular mechanism of the miRNAs regulating germline stem cell differentiation and spermatogenesis in chicken."
https://openalex.org/W2619833189,"Accurate modeling of enzyme activity and stability is an important goal of the protein engineering community. However, studies seeking to evaluate current progress are limited by small data sets of quantitative kinetic constants and thermal stability measurements. Here, we report quantitative measurements of soluble protein expression in E. coli, thermal stability, and Michaelis-Menten constants (kcat, KM, and kcat/KM) for 129 designed mutants of a glycoside hydrolase. Statistical analyses reveal that functional Tm is independent of kcat, KM, and kcat/KM in this system, illustrating that an individual mutation can modulate these functional parameters independently. In addition, this data set is used to evaluate computational predictions of protein stability using the established Rosetta and FoldX algorithms. Predictions for both are found to correlate only weakly with experimental measurements, suggesting improvements are needed in the underlying algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2618086411,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and hemoglobin E (HbE, β26 Glu-Lys) are two common red cell disorders in Southeast Asia. G6PD deficiency produces hemolytic anemia, which can be triggered by certain drugs or infections. HbE is asymptomatic or is manifested as microcytic, minimally hemolytic anemia. The association between G6PD deficiency and HbE is little understood. This study aimed to investigate G6PD deficiency and HbE in a Kachin ethnic group in the China-Myanmar border area. G6PD enzyme activity was measured using a quantitative G6PD assay, G6PD variants genotyped by the SNaPshot assay, and an HbE gene mutation identified by an amplification refractory mutation system and subsequently confirmed by using a reverse dot blot hybridization assay from 100 unrelated individuals in the study area. G6PD enzyme activity ranged from 0.4 to 24.7 U/g Hb, and six males had severe G6PD deficiency (<0.12–1.2 U/g Hb), while six males and 12 females had mild G6PD deficiency (>1.2–4.5 U/g Hb). Among the 24 G6PD-deficient subjects, 22 (92%) had the Mahidol 487G>A mutation (12 male hemizygotes, one female homozygote, and nine female heterozygotes), while the G6PD genotypes in two female subjects were unknown. HbE was identified in 39 subjects (20 males and 19 females), including 15 HbEE (seven males and eight females) and 24 HbAE (13 males and 11 females). Twenty-three subjects co-inherited both G6PD deficiency and HbE (22 with HbAE and one with HbEE). Whereas mean Hb levels were not significantly different between the HbA and HbE groups, G6PD-deficient males had significantly lower Hb levels than G6PD-normal males (P < 0.05, t-test). However, it is noteworthy that two G6PD-deficient hemizygous males with HbAE were severely anemic with Hb levels below 50 g/L. This study revealed high prevalence of co-inheritance of G6PD deficiency with HbAE in the Kachin ethnicity, and a potential interaction of the G6PD Mahidol 487G>A and HbAE in males leading to severe anemia. The presence of 6% males with severe G6PD deficiency raised a major concern in the use of primaquine for radical cure of vivax malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2618141110,"Benzo[a]pyrene, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has been suggested to be capable of initiating and/or accelerating atherosclerosis. Accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vessel intima is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Nitric oxide (NO) can suppress VSMCs proliferation and induce VSMCs apoptosis. NO plays a compensatory role in the vascular lesions to reduce proliferation and/or accelerate apoptosis of VSMCs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether benzo[a]pyrene can affect VSMCs growth and apoptosis induced by NO. Benzo[a]pyrene (1-30 μmol/L) did not affect the cell number and cell cycle distribution in VSMCs under serum deprivation condition. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in VSMCs. Benzo[a]pyrene significantly suppressed SNP-induced cell viability reduction and apoptosis. VSMCs cultured in conditioned medium from cells treated with benzo[a]pyrene could also prevent SNP-induced apoptosis. Benzo[a]pyrene was capable of inducing the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in VSMCs. Both NF-κB inhibitor and p38 MAPK inhibitor significantly reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of benzo[a]pyrene on SNP-treated VSMCs. Incubation of VSMCs with benzo[a]pyrene significantly and dose-dependently increased interleukin (IL)-6 production. A neutralizing antibody to IL-6 effectively reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of benzo[a]pyrene on SNP-treated VSMCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that benzo[a]pyrene activates IL-6 induction and protects VSMCs from NO-induced apoptosis. These findings propose a new mechanism for the atherogenic effect of benzo[a]pyrene."
https://openalex.org/W2619643043,"Density-dependent (DD) and density-independent (DI) habitat selection is strongly linked to a species’ evolutionary history. Determining the relative importance of each is necessary because declining populations are not always the result of altered DI mechanisms but can often be the result of DD via a reduced carrying capacity. We developed spatially and temporally explicit models throughout the Chena River, Alaska to predict important DI mechanisms that influence Chinook salmon spawning success. We used resource-selection functions to predict suitable spawning habitat based on geomorphic characteristics, a semi-distributed water-and-energy balance hydrologic model to generate stream flow metrics, and modeled stream temperature as a function of climatic variables. Spawner counts were predicted throughout the core and periphery spawning sections of the Chena River from escapement estimates (DD) and DI variables. Additionally, we used isodar analysis to identify whether spawners actively defend spawning habitat or follow an ideal free distribution along the riverscape. Aerial counts were best explained by escapement and reference to the core or periphery, while no models with DI variables were supported in the candidate set. Furthermore, isodar plots indicated habitat selection was best explained by ideal free distributions, although there was strong evidence for active defense of core spawning habitat. Our results are surprising, given salmon commonly defend spawning resources, and are likely due to competition occurring at finer spatial scales than addressed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2619174872,"Laboratory animals are still necessary in scientific investigation and vaccine testing, but while novel methodological approaches are not available for their replacement, the search for new, humane, easy, and painless methods is necessary to diminish their stress and pain. When multiple blood samples are to be collected from hamsters and guinea pigs, the number of available venipuncture sites–which are greatly diminished in these species in comparison with other rodents due to the absence of a long tail–, harasses animal caregivers and researchers. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate if gingival vein puncture could be used as an additional route to obtain multiple blood samples from anesthetized hamsters and guinea pigs in such a way that animal behavior, well-being or hematological parameters would not be altered. Thus, twelve anesthetized Syrian golden hamsters and English guinea pigs were randomly allocated in two groups: a control group, whose blood samples were not collected, and an experimental group in which blood samples (200 microliters) were collected by gingival vein puncture at weekly intervals over six weeks. Clinical assessment, body weight gain and complete blood cell count were evaluated weekly, and control and experimental animals were euthanized at week seven, when the mentolabial region was processed to histological analyses. Multiple blood sampling from the gingival vein evoked no clinical manifestations or alteration in the behavioral repertoire, nor a statistically significant difference in weight gain in both species. Guinea pigs showed no alteration in red blood cell, leukocyte or platelet parameters over time. Hamsters developed a characteristic pattern of age-related physiological changes, which were considered normal. Histological analyses showed no difference in morphological structures in the interdental gingiva, confirming that multiple blood sampling is barely traumatic. Thus, these results evidence that blood collection from multiple gingival vein puncture is minimally invasive and traumatic to hamsters and guinea pigs, and that it can be accomplished during at least six weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2617031324,"Resistance towards antiparasitic agents in the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a widespread problem along the Norwegian coast, reducing treatments efficacies and slowing down the envisioned expansion of Norwegian salmon production. The present study was conducted in order to assess the efficacies of two of the most widely used anti-parasitic substances-azamethiphos and deltamethrin-as well as assessing the benefit of having a resistant genotype compared to being fully sensitive when exposed to one of these substances. Atlantic salmon were exposed to a mix of salmon lice copepodids from a fully sensitive, a double resistant and a multi-resistant strain. Once the lice reached pre-adult stages, one group was exposed to 100 μg/L azamethiphos for 60 minutes, the other to 2 μg/L deltamethrin for 30 minutes, and the last was kept in a seawater control. Detached lice were collected at a series of time points following exposure, and all lice (immobilized and surviving) were analysed for both pyrethroid (sensitive ""S"" and resistant ""R"") and azamethiphos (fully sensitive ""SS"", heterozygous resistant ""RS"" and fully resistant ""RR"") resistance markers. We found that the efficacies of deltamethrin on parasites with genotype S and R were 70.3 and 13.2%, respectively. The overall efficacy of the deltamethrin treatment was 32.3%. The efficacies of azamethiphos on parasites with genotype SS, RS and RR were 100, 80 and 19.1%, respectively. The overall efficacy of the azamethiphos treatment was 80.4%. Survival analyses revealed that the median survival time in deltamethrin-sensitive and-resistant parasites were 16.8 and >172 hours, respectively. The differences were even more pronounced in the azamethiphos-treated group, where SS, RS and RR parasites survived for 0.26, 6.6 and >172 hours, respectively. The substantial differences in survival between sensitive and resistant lice following treatment demonstrate the ability of medicinal treatments to drive genetic selection towards a much more resistant salmon lice population within a very short time span if there is no influx of sensitive genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2617402460,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) has proven to be the cause of several severe clinical conditions on the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, oropharynx and penis. Several studies have assessed the costs of cervical lesions, cervical cancer (CC), and genital warts. However, few have been done in Africa and none in Swaziland. Cost analysis is critical in providing useful information for economic evaluations to guide policymakers concerned with the allocation of resources in order to reduce the disease burden. Materials and methods A prevalence-based cost of illness (COI) methodology was used to investigate the economic burden of HPV-related diseases. We used a top-down approach for the cost associated with hospital care and a bottom-up approach to estimate the cost associated with outpatient and primary care. The current study was conducted from a provider perspective since the state bears the majority of the costs of screening and treatment in Swaziland. All identifiable direct medical costs were considered for cervical lesions, cervical cancer and genital warts, which were primary diagnoses during 2015. A mix of bottom up micro-costing ingredients approach and top-down approaches was used to collect data on costs. All costs were computed at the price level of 2015 and converted to dollars ($). Results The total annual estimated direct medical cost associated with screening, managing and treating cervical lesions, CC and genital warts in Swaziland was $16 million. The largest cost in the analysis was estimated for treatment of high-grade cervical lesions and cervical cancer representing 80% of the total cost ($12.6 million). Costs for screening only represented 5% of the total cost ($0.9 million). Treatment of genital warts represented 6% of the total cost ($1million). Conclusion According to the cost estimations in this study, the economic burden of HPV-related cervical diseases and genital warts represents a major public health issue in Swaziland. Prevention of HPV infection with a national HPV immunization programme for pre-adolescent girls would prevent the majority of CC related deaths and associated costs."
https://openalex.org/W2618578309,"To deal with the conflicts between left-turn and through traffic streams and increase the discharge capacity, this paper addresses the pre-signal which is implemented at a signalized intersection. Such an intersection with pre-signal is termed as a tandem intersection. For the tandem intersection, phase swap sorting strategy is deemed as the most effective phasing scheme in view of some exclusive merits, such as easier compliance of drivers, and shorter sorting area. However, a major limitation of the phase swap sorting strategy is not considered in previous studies: if one or more vehicle is left at the sorting area after the signal light turns to red, the capacity of the approach would be dramatically dropped. Besides, previous signal control studies deal with a fixed timing plan that is not adaptive with the fluctuation of traffic flows. Therefore, to cope with these two gaps, this paper firstly takes an in-depth analysis of the traffic flow operations at the tandem intersection. Secondly, three groups of loop detectors are placed to obtain the real-time vehicle information for adaptive signalization. The lane selection behavior in the sorting area is considered to set the green time for intersection signals. With the objective of minimizing the vehicle delay, the signal control parameters are then optimized based on a dynamic programming method. Finally, numerical experiments show that average vehicle delay and maximum queue length can be reduced under all scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2618201504,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are mRNA-regulatory molecules that fine-tune gene expression and modulate both processes of development and tumorigenesis. Our previous studies identified progranulin A (GrnA) as a growth factor which induces zebrafish hepatic outgrowth through MET signaling. We also found that miR-145 is one of potential fine-tuning regulators of GrnA involved in embryonic hepatic outgrowth. The low level of miR-145 seen in hepatocarinogenesis has been shown to promote pathological liver growth. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of miR-145 in embryonic liver development. In this study, we demonstrate a significant decrease in miR-145 expression during hepatogenesis. We modulate miR-145 expression in zebrafish embryos by injection with a miR-145 mimic or a miR-145 hairpin inhibitor. Altered embryonic liver outgrowth is observed in response to miR-145 expression modulation. We also confirm a critical role of miR-145 in hepatic outgrowth by using whole-mount in situ hybridization. Loss of miR-145 expression in embryos results in hepatic cell proliferation, and vice versa. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GrnA is a target of miR-145 and GrnA-induced MET signaling is also regulated by miR-145 as determined by luciferase reporter assay and gene expression analysis, respectively. In addition, co-injection of GrnA mRNA with miR-145 mimic or MO-GrnA with miR-145 inhibitor restores the liver defects caused by dysregulation of miR-145 expression. In conclusion, our findings suggest an important role of miR-145 in regulating GrnA-dependent hepatic outgrowth in zebrafish embryonic development."

Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is a causative factor of AD. Drp1 (Dynamin-related protein 1), a regulator of mitochondrial fission, shows neuroprotective effects on Parkinson’s disease. In this study, we investigate the effect and mechanism of Drp1 on Aβ42 transgenic Drosophila. Methods Elav-gal4/UAS>Aβ42 transgenic Drosophila model was constructed using Elav-gal4 promoter. The effects of Drp1 on the lifespan, motor ability and neuronal degeneration of the transgenic Drosophila were explored by over-expressing Drp1 in the Aβ42 transgenic Drosophila. ATP levels in the brain tissues of Aβ42 transgenic Drosophila were detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results Exogenous expression of Drp1 promoted crawling ability, reduced the levels of ATP in Drosophila brain and suppressed the neuronal degeneration. Conclusion The protective effect of Drp1 on the Aβ42 transgenic Drosophila was achieved by protecting the mitochondrial function, suggesting that Drp1 may be a potential therapeutic strategies for AD."
https://openalex.org/W2617384824,"Perceptual judgments are an essential mechanism for our everyday interaction with other moving agents or events. For instance, estimation of the time remaining before an object contacts or passes us is essential to act upon or to avoid that object. Previous studies have demonstrated that participants use different cues to estimate the time to contact or the time to passage of approaching visual stimuli. Despite the considerable number of studies on the judgment of approaching auditory stimuli, not much is known about the cues that guide listeners' performance in an auditory Time-to-Passage (TTP) task. The present study evaluates how accurately participants judge approaching white-noise stimuli in a TTP task that included variable occlusion periods (portion of the presentation time where the stimulus is not audible). Results showed that participants were able to accurately estimate TTP and their performance, in general, was weakly affected by occlusion periods. Moreover, we looked into the psychoacoustic variables provided by the stimuli and analysed how binaural cues related with the performance obtained in the psychophysical task. The binaural temporal difference seems to be the psychoacoustic cue guiding participants' performance for lower amounts of occlusion, while the binaural loudness difference seems to be the cue guiding performance for higher amounts of occlusion. These results allowed us to explain the perceptual strategies used by participants in a TTP task (maintaining accuracy by shifting the informative cue for TTP estimation), and to demonstrate that the psychoacoustic cue guiding listeners' performance changes according to the occlusion period."

The rodent model is especially important for evaluation of pre-erythrocytic (PE) stage therapies, especially as current efforts to develop new PE vaccines and drugs is limited by access to P. falciparum and P. vivax sporozoites. Developing a more effective method for cryopreservation of sporozoites would help improve access to sporozoites for laboratories lacking suitable insectary facilities. In this study, P. berghei GFP-expressing sporozoites were purified from infected mosquitoes by manual dissection of salivary glands and different commercially-available, serum-free cryopreservative solutions were evaluated for efficient cryopreservation of the sporozoites. The cryopreservative solutions evaluated included CryoStor CS2, CryoSolutions DX5, CryoSolutions MC, Hestar 200, Voluven, Hetastarch, and Glycerolyte 57. The viability of fresh and post-thaw cryopreserved sporozoites was determined as a function of the relative sporozoite infectivity by infecting HC-04 cells in vitro, monitoring invasion and growth and development of liver stage parasites. Flow cytometer-based counting provided unbiased and fast quantitative assessment of parasite in vitro infection in infected HC-04 and in vivo infectivity was validated by injecting sporozoites IV into mice. CryoStor CS2 delivered the highest post-thaw recovery and infectivity of cryopreserved sporozoites. Sporozoites cryopreserved in CryoStor CS2 achieved 38% complete development of hepatic stages in HC-04 and 100% infectivity in mice. The cryopreservation method described here demonstrates a viable alternative for fresh Plasmodium sporozoites. The use of cryopreserved sporozoites should facilitate greater access to sporozoites for chemotherapeutic and vaccine research."
https://openalex.org/W2619824579,"Tumor perfusion can be evaluated by analyzing the time-signal intensity curve (TIC) after dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging. Accordingly, TIC profiles are characteristic of some benign and malignant salivary gland tumors. A carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA) arises from a long-standing pleomorphic adenoma (PA) and has a distinctive prognostic risk depending on the tumor growth potential such as invasion beyond the preexisting capsule. Differentiating CXPA from PA can be very challenging. In this study, we have attempted to discriminate CXPA from PA based on a two-dimensional TIC mapping algorithm. TIC mapping analysis was performed on 8 patients with CXPA and 20 patients with PA after dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging using a 1.5-T MR system. The TIC profiles obtained were automatically categorized into 5 types based on the enhancement ratio, maximum time, and washout ratio (Type 1 TIC with flat profile, Type 2 TIC with slow uptake, Type 3 TIC with rapid uptake and a low washout ratio, Type 4 TIC with rapid uptake and a high washout ratio, and Type 5 TIC not otherwise specific). The percentage tumor areas with each of the 5 TIC types were compared between CXPAs and PAs. Stepwise differentiation and cluster analysis using multiple TIC cut-off thresholds distinguished CXPAs from PAs with 75% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 86% accuracy, and 86% positive and 90% negative predictive values, when tumors with ≤1.1% Type 1 and ≥15% Type 4, or those with ≤1.1% Type 1, ≥78.1% Type 2, ≥16.1% Type 3, and <15% Type 4, or those with >1.1% Type 1, ≥78.1% Type 2, and ≥16.1% Type 3 areas were diagnosed as CXPAs. The overall TIC profiles predicted some aggressive CXPA growth patterns. These results suggest that stepwise differentiation based on TIC mapping is helpful in differentiating CXPAs from PAs."

Still, efficient design and higher-order assembly of genome-scale DNA constructs remains a labor-intensive process. Given the complexity, computer assisted design tools that fragment large DNA sequences into fabricable DNA blocks are needed to pave the way towards streamlined assembly of biological systems. Here, we present the Genome Partitioner software implemented as a web-based interface that permits multi-level partitioning of genome-scale DNA designs. Without the need for specialized computing skills, biologists can submit their DNA designs to a fully automated pipeline that generates the optimal retrosynthetic route for higher-order DNA assembly. To test the algorithm, we partitioned a 783 kb Caulobacter crescentus genome design. We validated the partitioning strategy by assembling a 20 kb test segment encompassing a difficult to synthesize DNA sequence. Successful assembly from 1 kb subblocks into the 20 kb segment highlights the effectiveness of the Genome Partitioner for reducing synthesis costs and timelines for higher-order DNA assembly. The Genome Partitioner is broadly applicable to translate DNA designs into ready to order sequences that can be assembled with standardized protocols, thus offering new opportunities to harness the diversity of microbial genomes for synthetic biology applications.

Methods Ten healthy young male volunteers participated in the study. Before the training, stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were measured in all subjects under 0, 4, 8, and 12 cmH2O NPPV at rest. Then, the subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer at 60% of pre-training for 30 min daily for 5 consecutive days with/without NPPV. The 5-day exercise protocol was repeated after a three-week washout period without/with NPPV. The primary endpoint was changes in . The secondary endpoints were changes in SV, CO, maximum heart rate (HRmax), maximum respiratory rate (RRmax), maximum expiratory minute volume (VEmax) and the percent change in plasma volume (PV). Results NPPV at 12 cmH2O significantly reduced SV and CO at rest. significantly increased after 5 days training with and without NPPV, but the magnitude of increase in after training under 12 cmH2O NPPV was significantly higher than after training without NPPV. VEmax significantly increased after training under NPPV, but not after training without NPPV. HRmax and RRmax did not change during training irrespective of NPPV. The percent change in PV was similar between training with and without NPPV. The 5-day training program with NPPV resulted in greater improvement in than without NPPV. Conclusions Aerobic training under NPPV has add-on effects on and exercise-related health benefits in healthy young men."
