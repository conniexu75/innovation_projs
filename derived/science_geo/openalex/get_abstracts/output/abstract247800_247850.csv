https://openalex.org/W2049145344,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been designed and successfully synthesized by condensation reactions of phenyl diboronic acid {C 6 H 4 [B(OH) 2 ] 2 } and hexahydroxytriphenylene [C 18 H 6 (OH) 6 ]. Powder x-ray diffraction studies of the highly crystalline products (C 3 H 2 BO) 6 ·(C 9 H 12 ) 1 (COF-1) and C 9 H 4 BO 2 (COF-5) revealed expanded porous graphitic layers that are either staggered (COF-1, P 6 3 / mmc ) or eclipsed (COF-5, P 6/ mmm ). Their crystal structures are entirely held by strong bonds between B, C, and O atoms to form rigid porous architectures with pore sizes ranging from 7 to 27 angstroms. COF-1 and COF-5 exhibit high thermal stability (to temperatures up to 500° to 600°C), permanent porosity, and high surface areas (711 and 1590 square meters per gram, respectively)."
https://openalex.org/W2069251911,"Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2148558073,"How cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its proinflammatory metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) enhance colon cancer progression remains poorly understood. We show that PGE2 stimulates colon cancer cell growth through its heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor, EP2, by a signaling route that involves the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and the protein kinase Akt by free G protein βγ subunits and the direct association of the G protein α s subunit with the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of axin. This leads to the inactivation and release of glycogen synthase kinase 3β from its complex with axin, thereby relieving the inhibitory phosphorylation of β-catenin and activating its signaling pathway. These findings may provide a molecular framework for the future evaluation of chemopreventive strategies for colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2169587278,"Nonhost resistance describes the immunity of an entire plant species against nonadapted pathogen species. We report that Arabidopsis PEN2 restricts pathogen entry of two ascomycete powdery mildew fungi that in nature colonize grass and pea species. The PEN2 glycosyl hydrolase localizes to peroxisomes and acts as a component of an inducible preinvasion resistance mechanism. Postinvasion fungal growth is blocked by a separate resistance layer requiring the EDS1-PAD4-SAG101 signaling complex, which is known to function in basal and resistance ( R ) gene–triggered immunity. Concurrent impairment of pre- and postinvasion resistance renders Arabidopsis a host for both nonadapted fungi."

https://openalex.org/W2105051672,"The disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ( DISC1 ) gene is a candidate susceptibility factor for schizophrenia, but its mechanistic role in the disorder is unknown. Here we report that the gene encoding phosphodiesterase 4B ( PDE4B ) is disrupted by a balanced translocation in a subject diagnosed with schizophrenia and a relative with chronic psychiatric illness. The PDEs inactivate adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger implicated in learning, memory, and mood. We show that DISC1 interacts with the UCR2 domain of PDE4B and that elevation of cellular cAMP leads to dissociation of PDE4B from DISC1 and an increase in PDE4B activity. We propose a mechanistic model whereby DISC1 sequesters PDE4B in resting cells and releases it in an activated state in response to elevated cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2114314151,"A great deal of attention has recently been focused on a new class of smart materials--so-called left-handed media--that exhibit highly unusual electromagnetic properties and promise new device applications. Left-handed materials require negative permeability micro, an extreme condition that has so far been achieved only for frequencies in the microwave to terahertz range. Extension of the approach described in ref. 7 to achieve the necessary high-frequency magnetic response in visible optics presents a formidable challenge, as no material--natural or artificial--is known to exhibit any magnetism at these frequencies. Here we report a nanofabricated medium consisting of electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits a strong magnetic response at visible-light frequencies, including a band with negative micro. The magnetism arises owing to the excitation of an antisymmetric plasmon resonance. The high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals itself via optical impedance matching. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering magnetism at visible frequencies and pave the way towards magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics."
https://openalex.org/W2071884490,"We have examined the architecture of a protein complex in the absence of bulk water. By determining collision cross sections of assemblies of the trp RNA binding protein, TRAP, we established that the 11-membered ring topology of the complex can be maintained within a mass spectrometer. We also found that the binding of tryptophan enhances the stability of the ring structure and that addition of a specific RNA molecule increases the size of the complex and prevents structural collapse. These results provide definitive evidence that protein quaternary structure can be maintained in the absence of bulk water and highlight the potential of ion mobility separation for defining shapes of heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2078387056,"The immunological synapse is a specialized cell-cell junction that is defined by large-scale spatial patterns of receptors and signaling molecules yet remains largely enigmatic in terms of formation and function. We used supported bilayer membranes and nanometer-scale structures fabricated onto the underlying substrate to impose geometric constraints on immunological synapse formation. Analysis of the resulting alternatively patterned synapses revealed a causal relation between the radial position of T cell receptors (TCRs) and signaling activity, with prolonged signaling from TCR microclusters that had been mechanically trapped in the peripheral regions of the synapse. These results are consistent with a model of the synapse in which spatial translocation of TCRs represents a direct mechanism of signal regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2125134214,"The long-favored paradigm for the development of continental crust is one of progressive growth beginning at ∼4 billion years ago (Ga). To test this hypothesis, we measured initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf values of 4.01- to 4.37-Ga detrital zircons from Jack Hills, Western Australia. ϵ Hf (deviations of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf from bulk Earth in parts per 10 4 ) values show large positive and negative deviations from those of the bulk Earth. Negative values indicate the development of a Lu/Hf reservoir that is consistent with the formation of continental crust (Lu/Hf ≈ 0.01), perhaps as early as 4.5 Ga. Positive ϵ Hf deviations require early and likely widespread depletion of the upper mantle. These results support the view that continental crust had formed by 4.4 to 4.5 Ga and was rapidly recycled into the mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2090438862,"The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for maintaining genome stability. Eukaryotic cells repair DSBs by both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. How chromatin structure is altered in response to DSBs and how such alterations influence DSB repair processes are important issues. In vertebrates, phosphorylation of the histone variant H2A.X occurs rapidly after DSB formation1, spreads over megabase chromatin domains, and is required for stable accumulation of repair proteins at damage foci2. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphorylation of the two principal H2A species is also signalled by DSB formation, which spreads ∼40 kb in either direction from the DSB3. Here we show that near a DSB phosphorylation of H2A is followed by loss of histones H2B and H3 and increased sensitivity of chromatin to digestion by micrococcal nuclease; however, phosphorylation of H2A and nucleosome loss occur independently. The DNA damage sensor MRX4 is required for histone loss, which also depends on INO80, a nucleosome remodelling complex5. The repair protein Rad51 (ref. 6) shows delayed recruitment to DSBs in the absence of histone loss, suggesting that MRX-dependent nucleosome remodelling regulates the accessibility of factors directly involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination. Thus, MRX may regulate two pathways of chromatin changes: nucleosome displacement for efficient recruitment of homologous recombination proteins; and phosphorylation of H2A, which modulates checkpoint responses to DNA damage2."
https://openalex.org/W2062738834,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that acts through a quaternary receptor signaling complex containing alpha (IL-2Rα), beta (IL-2Rβ), and common gamma chain (g c ) receptors. In the structure of the quaternary ectodomain complex as visualized at a resolution of 2.3 angstroms, the binding of IL-2Rα to IL-2 stabilizes a secondary binding site for presentation to IL-2Rβ. γ c is then recruited to the composite surface formed by the IL-2/IL-2Rβ complex. Consistent with its role as a shared receptor for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, γ c forms degenerate contacts with IL-2. The structure of γ c provides a rationale for loss-of-function mutations found in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (X-SCID). This complex structure provides a framework for other γ c -dependent cytokine-receptor interactions and for the engineering of improved IL-2 therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2157319590,"Silicified plant tissues (phytoliths) preserved in Late Cretaceous coprolites from India show that at least five taxa from extant grass (Poaceae) subclades were present on the Indian subcontinent during the latest Cretaceous. This taxonomic diversity suggests that crown-group Poaceae had diversified and spread in Gondwana before India became geographically isolated. Other phytoliths extracted from the coprolites (from dicotyledons, conifers, and palms) suggest that the suspected dung producers (titanosaur sauropods) fed indiscriminately on a wide range of plants. These data also make plausible the hypothesis that gondwanatherian mammals with hypsodont cheek teeth were grazers."
https://openalex.org/W2047580124,"Binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to macrophages results in proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In extreme cases it leads to endotoxic shock. A few innate immunity antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) neutralize LPS activity. However, the underlying mechanism and properties of the peptides are not yet clear. Toward meeting this goal we investigated four AMPs and their fluorescently labeled analogs. These AMPs varied in composition, length, structure, and selectivity toward cells. The list included human LL-37 (37-mer), magainin (24-mer), a 15-mer amphipathic α-helix, and its d,l-amino acid structurally altered analog. The peptides were investigated for their ability to inhibit LPS-mediated cytokine release from RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived primary macrophages, to bind LPS in solution, and when LPS is already bound to macrophages (fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal microscopy), to compete with LPS for its binding site on the CD14 receptor (flow cytometry) and affect LPS oligomerization. We conclude that a strong binding of a peptide to LPS aggregates accompanied by aggregate dissociation prevents LPS from binding to the carrier protein lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, or alternatively to its receptor, and hence inhibits cytokine secretion.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). LPS is released from the bacteria during cell division, cell death, or in particular, as a result of antibiotic treatment against bacterial infection (2Hopkin D.A. Lancet. 1978; 2: 1193-1194PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hancock R.E. Scott M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Upon its release, LPS is recognized by mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and macrophages), which are part of the innate immunity of the host, and activates them. This results in an increase in their phagocytic activity and significantly enhances the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and others (4Rietschel E.T.

Although pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion is essential for the development of the local inflammatory response, an unbalanced and overproduction of such cytokines may lead to septic shock characterized by endothelial damage, loss of vascular tone, coagulopathy, and multiple system organ failure, often resulting in death (7Hardaway R.M. Am. Surg. 2000; 66: 22-29PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism of macrophages by LPS starts when LPS (through its toxic entity, lipid A) binds with LPS-binding protein (LBP), accelerating the binding of LPS to CD14, the primary receptor of LPS, which is expressed mainly on macrophages (9Wright S.D.

In an attempt to understand the mechanism of macrophage stimulation by LPS, two major approaches have been reported. The first one utilized LPS receptor antagonists including anti-CD14 antibodies, anti-LBP antibodies, and lipid A analogs, all of which bind to essential components participating in the signaling mechanism (17Schimke J.

The second approach utilized LPS blockers such as anti-lipid A antibodies and modified liposomes, both of which bind to LPS itself and prevent its ability to activate the macrophages (19David S.A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 370-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Manocha S. Feinstein D. Kumar A. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 1795-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Note, however, that although these studies have helped us to understand the steps involved in LPS neutralization, the approaches used could not deal with the bacteria from which the LPS is derived (19David S.A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 370-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a few antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) also have the potential to neutralize LPS-induced endotoxic effects. These peptides are important components of the innate defense system of all species of life (21Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). They are produced in large quantities at the site of infection and/or inflammation and act rapidly to clear microbes (22Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6575) Google Scholar). Several AMPs prevent LPS-dependent cytokine induction in macrophages and block sepsis in animal models (23Larrick J.W. Hirata M. Balint R.F. Lee J. Zhong J. Wright S.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hirata M. Zhong J. Wright S.C. Larrick J.W. Prog. Clin. Biol.

These studies also showed a direct correlation between the ability of AMPs to bind LPS and their antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, it has been shown that other factors are involved, such as peptide hydrophobicity and amphipathicity and a defined structure (28David S.A. Awasthi S.K. Balaram P. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Scott M.G. Vreugdenhil A.C. Buurman W.A. Hancock R.E. Gold M.R. J.

Immunol. 2002; 9: 972-982PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism by which AMPs block LPS-dependent cytokine induction and the peptide properties required for this activity, we investigated four AMPs and their fluorescently labeled analogs. The peptides vary in their amino acid composition, length, structure, and selectivity toward different cells. The list includes two native antimicrobial peptides, human LL-37 (37-mer) and magainin (24-mer), as well as a 15-mer amphipathic α-helical peptide composed of Leu and Lys, and its d,l-amino acid diastereomer, a structurally altered analog. The peptides were investigated for their ability to inhibit LPS-induced cytokine release and to bind LPS in solution and when bound to macrophages and affect its oligomerization, as well as to compete with LPS on its binding site on the CD14 receptor and LBP. The results are discussed in view of the essential properties of a particular peptide required for LPS detoxification, as well as plausible modes of action. Materials—Rink amide MBHA resin and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Other reagents used for peptide synthesis included trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, Aldrich), methylene chloride (peptide synthesis grade, Bio-Lab), dimethylform-amide (peptide synthesis grade, Bio-Lab), and benzotriazolyl-n-oxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP, Sigma). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, amphotericin B antibiotics, and nonessential amino acid solution (1:100) were supplied by Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel. Bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone. TRI-reagent, RedTaq™ DNA polymerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and TNF-α primers for PCR, oligo(dT) for RT-PCR, lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 0111: B4, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated lipopolysaccharide were supplied by Sigma. dNTP mix (10 μm) was supplied by Promega. SuperScript RNase H- reverse transcriptase was purchased from Invitrogen. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—The peptides were synthesized by a solid phase method on rink amide MBHA resin (0.05 meq) by using an ABI 433A automatic peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Labeling of the N terminus of the peptides with 5,6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl (NBD) was done on the resin-bound peptide as described previously (31Pouny Y. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9482-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resin-bound peptides were cleaved from the resins by trifluoroacetic acid, washed with dry ether, and extracted with 30% acetonitrile/water. Trifluoroacetic acid cleavage of the peptides bound to rink amide MBHA resin, which resulted in C terminus-amidated peptides. Each crude peptide contained one major peak, as revealed by RP-HPLC, that was 50-70% pure by weight. The peptides were further purified by RP-HPLC on a C18 reverse-phase Bio-Rad semipreparative column (250 × 10 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size). The column was eluted in 40 min by using a linear gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile in water, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The purified peptides were shown to be homogeneous (>98%) by analytical HPLC. The peptides were further subjected to amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectroscopy to confirm their composition and molecular weight. Antibacterial Activity of the Peptides—The antibacterial activity of the peptides was examined in sterile 96-well plates (Nunc F96 microtiter plates) in a final volume of 100 μl as follows. Aliquots (50 μl) of a suspension containing bacteria (midlog phase) at a concentration of 106 colony-forming units/ml in culture medium (LB medium) were added to 50 μl of water containing the peptide in serial 2-fold dilutions in water. Inhibition of growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm with a Microplate autoreader El309 (Bio-Tek Instruments) after an incubation of 18-20 h at 37 °C. Antibacterial activities were expressed as the minimal inhibitory concentration, the concentration at which 100% inhibition of growth was observed after 18-20 h of incubation. Two strains of Gram-negative bacteria were used: E. coli D21 and Acinetobacter baumannii (ATCC 19606). Primary Murine Bone Marrow Macrophage Cultures—Primary cultures of murine bone marrow macrophages were established with cells harvested from the femurs and tibias of 8-week-old BALB/c mice. The marrow cells were flushed from the bones with phosphate-buffered saline. Following centrifugation, the cells were resuspended to a final concentration of 106 cell/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 15% L-sup (supplement from the medium of L-929 cells that produces macrophage-stimulating factor), 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% sodium pyruvate. Cells were seeded in 35-mm-diameter plastic bacterial culture dishes for 1 week at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were then removed by washing the adherent cells and were cultured in 96-well plates, 5 × 105 cells/well. Cytotoxicity Assays (XTT Proliferation Assay)—RAW264.7 murine macrophages were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 and 95% air (unless mentioned otherwise). Cells were passaged twice a week. A 96-well plate (Falcon) was used for this assay. Each well contained cell suspension (90 μl) in medium with 10% bovine serum (104 RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells/well). Wells in the first and second columns served as blanks (medium only) and 100% survival controls (cells and medium only), respectively. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (10 μl) was added to the first and second columns, and various concentrations of peptides (10 μl each), freshly prepared from the stock solution (1 mg/ml in water), were added to the remaining columns (two wells for each concentration of peptide solution). The plate was then incubated for 3 h before adding to each well 50 μl of XTT reaction solution (sodium 3′-[1-(phenyl-aminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate and N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate, mixed in a proportion of 50:1). The optical density was read at 450 nm wavelength in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader after a 2-h incubation of the plates with XTT (37 °C and 5% CO2 + 95% air). Cell viability was determined relative to the control, and final results were recorded. The results were confirmed using replications in at least three independent experiments. The LC50 value for each peptide was obtained from the curve of cell viability versus the concentration of peptide and was taken from the concentration at which cell viability was 50%. The Effect of AMPs on LPS-FITC Binding to RAW264.7 Cells Using Flow Cytometry—RAW264.7 cells (106 cells) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with LPS-FITC (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of the peptides (1 and 10 μm final concentration) in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum. Preincubated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then the peptides were added for another 30 min and then washed again. After the wash, the binding of LPS-FITC to RAW264.7 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Effect of Peptides on LPS-dependent Cytokine Induction—RAW264.7 cells were plated in six-well plates (106 cells/well) and cultured overnight. Cells were stimulated without (negative control) or with 10 ng/ml LPS in the presence or absence of 10 μm peptide in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum for 3 h. After stimulation, the cells were detached from the wells and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA was extracted using TRI® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and quantity of the RNA samples were determined. The RNA samples were used as a template in RT-PCR. The cDNA products were amplified in the presence of 3′ and 5′ primers (TNF-α, 5′-TCTCAGCCTCTTCTCATTCC-3′ and 5′-GTCCCAGCATCTTGTGTTTC-3′; IL-6, 5′-CCAGAAACCGCTATGAAGTTCC-3′ and 5′-TAGCCACTCCTTCTGTGACTCC-3′). A housekeeping gene, GAPDH (5′-CCATCAACGACCCCTTCATTGAC-3′ and 5′-GGATGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3′), was amplified in each experiment to evaluate the extraction procedure and to eliminate the possibility of genomic DNA contamination. The cycling condition steps for the amplification reaction consisted of a single 2-min heating step at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles (for IL-6) or 20 cycles (for TNF-α) of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 61 °C (for IL-6) or 56 °C (for TNF-α and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) for 1 min, and an extension at 72 °C for 1 min. After the last cycle, the reaction mixture was incubated at 72 °C for 10 min and then cooled to 4 °C. The PCR-amplified products were electophoresed and visualized on 1% agarose gel. The intensities of the amplified products were analyzed by a MultiImager Fluor-S™ image analysis system (Bio-Rad). Evaluation of TNF-α Release from RAW264.7 Macrophages and Bone Marrow-derived Primary Macrophages—RAW264.7 macrophages were cultured overnight in 96-wells plate (2.5 × 105 cells/well). The medium was then removed followed by the addition to each well of fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% of bovine serum. The cells were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml final concentration) in the presence of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 μm amphipathic-l, amphipathic-d, LL-37, or magainin. In another experiment, bone marrow-derived macrophages (5 × 105 cells/well) were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS in the presence of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 μm amphipathic-l and magainin. Cells that were stimulated with LPS alone, and untreated cells served as controls. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C after which samples of the medium from each treatment were collected. TNF-α concentration in the samples was evaluated using a mouse TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (ELISA, Biosource). All experiments were done in duplicate. Binding Assay—The experiments were conducted as described previously (32Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS (estimated molecular weight of 4000 g/mol) solution (20 ng/μl double distilled water) was added successively to 0.5 μm NBD-labeled peptide (amphipathic-l, amphipathic-d, magainin, and LL-37, all dissolved in double distilled water). The changes in NBD emission (530 nm; ΔF) were monitored as a function of the LPS/peptide molar ratio using a SLM-Aminco® luminescence spectrometer with excitation set at 467 nm (8-nm slit) until the system reached equilibrium. To account for the background, the emission of both double distilled water and LPS alone at the same wavelength was monitored. The changes in the probe emission represented the amount of LPS bound to the peptide, because NBD is known to change its emission in a hydrophobic environment (32Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby enabling us to evaluate the LPS binding to the peptides. Our system reached binding equilibrium (Fmax) at a certain LPS/peptide ratio, and therefore the affinity constant could be calculated from the relationship between the equilibrium level of NBD-labeled peptide emission and the LPS concentration, using a steady-state affinity model. The affinity constants were thus determined by nonlinear least-squares (NLLSQ) and Scatchard plot. The NLLSQ fitting was done using the following equation, Y(x)=Ka×X×Fmax/(1+Ka×X)(Eq. 1) where X is the LPS concentration, ΔFmax is the maximal difference in the emission of NBD-labeled peptide before and after the addition of LPS (it represents the maximum LPS bound or the equilibrium-binding response), and Ka is the affinity constant. In the Scatchard plot, ΔF/Fmax values were plotted against (ΔF/Fmax)/Lfree. ΔF/Fmax represents the number of moles of LPS bound, and (ΔF/Fmax)/Lfree represents the ratio of the bound to free LPS. Effect of Peptides on LPS-FITC Aggregates—The assay was done as described previously (33Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS-FITC (0.5 μg/ml) was treated with increasing concentrations of the peptides. The changes in the emission of FITC (515 nm) were monitored by using a SLM-Aminco® luminescence spectrometer with excitation set at 488 nm (8-nm slit). The emissions of both double distilled water and the peptides alone were taken as a background level. Dissociation of the aggregates results in an increase in the fluorescence of FITC because of dequenching (34de Haas C.J. van Leeuwen H.J. Verhoef J. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 242: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The changes in emission were tracked until the system reached equilibrium. Co-localization and Visualization of Peptides and LPS Binding to Cells Using Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—RAW264.7 cells (104 cells/chamber) were plated in an 8-chamber Lab-Tek-chambered coverglass system (Nagle Nunc) and cultured overnight. The cells were washed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with LPS-FITC (100 μg/ml) in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum. After incubation, the cells were washed and incubated under the same conditions with rhodamine-labeled peptides (0.1 μm). Nonincubated cells and cells that were incubated only with LPS-FITC or only with rhodamine-labeled peptides were used as controls. The cells were washed and covered with fresh medium. The co-localization and visualization of the rhodamine-labeled peptides and LPS-FITC on the cells was analyzed using fluorescence confocal microscopy. Antimicrobial Activity and Cytotoxicity—Four AMPs were synthesized and investigated. The list includes human LL-37, magainin, a model 15-mer peptide composed of only Lys and Leu, and its d,l-amino acid analog (Table 1). The 15-mer was designed to form an amphipathic structure as depicted in a Schiffer and Edmundson wheel structure (not shown) (35Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The data reveal that all AMPs are active against both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains tested (Table 2). The fluorescently labeled peptides preserved the activity of the unlabeled peptides (data not shown). The peptides were not toxic to macrophages at the concentrations tested in the LPS detoxification assay.TABLE 1Designations, sequences, and retention times of the peptides investigatedPeptide designationSequenceaUnderlined and bold amino acids are d-enantiomers.

Untreated cells served as a negative control. The results shown in Fig. 1A (10 μm peptide) and quantified in Fig. 1B (1 and 10 μm peptides) reveal that LL-37, amphipathic-l, and amphipathic-d inhibit LPS-FITC binding to the macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, whereas magainin did not significantly inhibit LPS-FITC binding to the cells. Amphipathic-l was the most active peptide and reduced the binding of LPS by 35 and 90% at 1 and 10 μm, respectively, whereas amphipathic-d was active only at 10 μm. Inhibition of LPS-mediated Cytokines Expression—RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) with or without the peptides (10 μm). Total RNA extraction served as a template for RT-PCR to determine the inhibitory effect of the peptides on TNF-α and the IL-6 mRNA level. The results, shown in Fig. 2, reveal that besides magainin, which was only slightly active, all other peptides were potent inhibitors. Quantitative analysis showed that amphipathic-l and LL-37 caused a marked decrease in mRNA expression, at times much below the basal level, whereas amphipathic-d brought it back to the basal level. These results correlate with the potency of the peptides to inhibit the binding of LPS to macrophages (Fig. 1) but do not correlate with their antimicrobial activity, their tendency to form an α-helical structure, or the extent of their binding to LPS (which will be discussed in the following paragraphs). Note that in some assays different amounts of LPS-FITC were used depending on the sensitivities of these assays. However, because saturation of binding to LPS for all the peptides is at an ∼1:1 molar ratio (see paragraph on the binding of the peptides to LPS), all the experiments were done under conditions of a large excess of peptides compared with LPS. Inhibition of TNF-α Secretion—We used a TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit to evaluate TNF-α concentration in the cell medium after stimulation with LPS (10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml for RAW264.7 and bone marrow primary macrophages, respectively) in the presence of different concentrations of AMPs. Fig. 3A shows a dose-dependent effect, which reveals activities similar to those obtained in the RT-PCR experiments. The three active peptides at a concentration of 10 μm brought the TNF concentration close to the basal level (36 ± 5 pg/ml). Amphipathic-l, the most active peptide, was evaluated together with the inactive magain"

Carriers were accelerated by band-bending at the suspension interface, and they created excitons that radiatively recombined. This excitation mechanism is ∼1000 times more efficient than recombination of independently injected electrons and holes, and it results from weak electron-phonon scattering and strong electron-hole binding caused by one-dimensional confinement. The ensuing high excitation density allows us to observe emission from higher excited states not seen by photoexcitation. The excitation mechanism of these states was analyzed."

We show that GTF2IRD1 is a genetic determinant of mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development, and we implicate another member of the TFII-I transcription factor family, GTF2I , in both aspects. Gtf2ird1 -null mice exhibit phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS); craniofacial imaging reveals abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through misregulation of goosecoid , a downstream target of Gtf2ird1 . In humans, a rare WBS individual with an atypical deletion, including GTF2IRD1 , shows facial dysmorphism and cognitive deficits that differ from those of classic WBS cases. We propose a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2169915413,"The TRPV4 cation channel exhibits a topology consisting of six predicted transmembrane domains (TM) with a putative pore loop between TM5 and TM6 and intracellular N- and C-tails, the former containing at least three ankyrin domains. Functional transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are supposed to result following the assembly of four subunits. However, the rules governing subunit assembly and protein domains implied in this process are only starting to emerge. The ankyrin, TM, and the C-tail domains have been identified as important determinants of the oligomerization process. We now describe the maturation and oligomerization of five splice variants of the TRPV4 channel. The already known TRPV4-A and TRPV4-B (Δ384–444) variants and the new TRPV4-C (Δ237–284), TRPV4-D (Δ27–61), and TRPV4-E (Δ237–284 and Δ384–444) variants. All alternative spliced variants involved deletions in the cytoplasmic N-terminal region, affecting (except for TRPV4-D) the ankyrin domains. Subcellular localization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, glycosylation profile, and functional analysis of these variants permitted us to group them into two classes: group I (TRPV4-A and TRPV4-D) and group II (TRPV4-B, TRPV4-C, and TRPV4-E). Group I, unlike group II variants, were correctly processed, homo- and heteromultimerized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and were targeted to the plasma membrane where they responded to typical TRPV4 stimuli. Our results suggest that: 1) TRPV4 biogenesis involves core glycosylation and oligomerization in the endoplasmic reticulum followed by transfer to the Golgi apparatus for subsequent maturation; 2) ankyrin domains are necessary for oligomerization of TRPV4; and 3) lack of TRPV4 oligomerization determines its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W2040114624,"Wnt signaling is essential for many developmental processes, including skeletogenesis. To investigate the effects of Wnt signaling during skeletogenesis we studied the effects of Wnt on cultured chondrocytic cells and differentiating limb-bud mesenchyme. We showed that Wnt3a strongly repressed chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression. Canonical Wnt signaling was responsible for the repression of differentiation, as evidenced by results showing that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 or expression of β-catenin caused similar repression of differentiation. Significantly, we showed that the transcription repressor Twist1 is induced by canonical Wnt signaling. Expression of Twist1 strongly inhibited chondrocyte gene expression and short hairpin RNA knockdown of Twist1 transcript levels caused increased expression of the chondrocyte-specific genes aggrecan and type II collagen. Interestingly, Twist1 interfered with BMP2-induced expression of aggrecan and type II collagen expression and knockdown of Twist1 augmented BMP2-induced aggrecan and type II collagen expression. These data support the conclusions that Twist1 contributes to the repression of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression resulting from canonical Wnt signaling and that Twist1 interferes with BMP-dependent signaling.

These data support the conclusions that Twist1 contributes to the repression of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression resulting from canonical Wnt signaling and that Twist1 interferes with BMP-dependent signaling. Wnt signaling is divided into canonical and non-canonical pathways. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates the protein levels of β-catenin (βcat). 2The abbreviations used are: βcatβ-cateninGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 3shRNAshort hairpin RNABMP2bone morphogenetic protein 2bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixRNAiRNA interference. The binding of Wnt ligands to cell-surface receptors leads to the activation of the intracellular protein Dishevelled. When activated, Dishevelled is released from the receptor complex at the cell surface and interacts with the multiprotein complex that controls βcat levels. This complex includes axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), βcat, and other proteins (1Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Within the complex, phosphorylation of βcat by GSK3 leads to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. GSK3 is inhibited by activated Dishevelled. This in turn stabilizes βcat, thereby increasing the amount of βcat, which accumulates in the nucleus and regulates gene expression in conjunction with the TCF/Lef family of transcription factors. Thus the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is in part a transcription control pathway that regulates the levels of the transcription co-activator βcat. Non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways are subdivided into the Wnt-calcium and planar cell polarity pathways (2Peifer M. McEwen D.G. Cell. 2002; 109: 271-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Yamanaka H. Moriguchi T. Masuyama N. Kusakabe M. Hanafusa H. Takada R. Takada S. Nishida E.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The Wnt-calcium pathway increases intracellular calcium levels in response to Wnt signaling. Like canonical Wnt signaling, this pathway also requires Dishevelled (5Sheldahl L.C. Slusarski D.C. Pandur P. Miller J.R. Kuhl M. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The release of calcium stimulates calcium-dependent kinases and transcription factors, like the nuclear factor of activated T-cells family of transcription factors (6Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y.

The planar cell polarity pathway, also linked to Dishevelled activation, requires the Rho family GTPases and Jun kinase. Through this pathway Wnt signaling regulates polarized cell movements. β-catenin glycogen synthase kinase 3 short hairpin RNA bone morphogenetic protein 2 basic helix-loop-helix RNA interference. A hierarchy of Wnt signaling regulates diverse developmental processes. During skeletal development, Wnt signaling regulates a series of developmental steps. The earliest stages of limb initiation require Wnt signaling operating through a regulatory loop with FGF10 (8Kawakami Y. Capdevila J. Buscher D. Itoh T. Rodriguez Esteban C. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 891-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This directs the anatomical site for initiation of the limb bud. Later during limb-bud development Wnt signaling initiates and maintains the apical ectodermal ridge and regulates formation of the dorsal-ventral axis (9Barrow J.R. Thomas K.R. Boussadia-Zahui O.

Cell. 1995; 83: 631-640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). As the bone rudiments of the skeleton are formed, Wnt signaling is also essential. Chondrogenesis, one of the earliest steps of bone development, begins as mesenchymal cells aggregate forming the earliest outline of nascent bones. The cell condensations differentiate into chondrocytes thereby forming the template of the endochondral skeleton. Wnt signaling has a vital role during chondrogenesis and chondrocyte differentiation. The effects of Wnt signaling on chondrocytes and chondroprogenitor cells are complex, as demonstrated by results showing both stimulation and inhibition of differentiation. In assays of chondrogenesis using limb-bud mesenchyme, the application of Wnts both stimulates and inhibits differentiation (11Church V. Nohno T. Linker C. Marcelle C. Francis-West P. J.

Ablation of βcat, and thereby canonical Wnt signaling, in cultured limb mesenchyme stimulates cartilage development (15Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2404-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, targeted disruption of βcat signaling in the developing skeleton of mice causes a skeletal dysplasia with repressed chondrocyte differentiation (15Guo X. Day T.F. Jiang X. Garrett-Beal L. Topol L. Yang Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2404-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 16Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M.

Development. 2005; 132: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In addition, mice expressing a stabilized form of βcat, thereby augmenting canonical Wnt signaling, surprisingly also exhibit a skeletal dysplasia with diminished chondrocyte differentiation (16Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R. McCrea P.D. de Crombrugghe B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1072-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The findings indicate that 1) Wnts can both stimulate and inhibit chondrogenesis and 2) overexpression or targeted deletion of βcat has similar consequences on chondrocyte differentiation. This suggests that Wnt signaling regulates different target genes or proteins depending on the context of the cell or stage of differentiation. These targets may also differ depending on whether canonical or non-canonical Wnt signaling is operative. This suggests that understanding the effects of Wnts on chondrocytes will require greater knowledge of the contribution of canonical or non-canonical Wnt pathways and the specific targets of Wnt signaling that regulate differentiation. To gain insight into the Wnt signaling pathways and targets of Wnt signaling that control chondrogenesis and chondrocyte differentiation, we studied chondrogenesis using cultured limb-bud mesenchyme and the chondrogenic cells ATDC5. We find that Wnt3a represses chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression. The repression of chondrogenesis by Wnt signaling is through canonical Wnt signaling as evidenced by repression resulting from inhibition of GSK3 with the pharmacological antagonist SB216763 or expression of a stabilized form of βcat. Significantly, we identified a transcriptional target of canonical Wnt signaling, Twist1, that repressed chondrocyte gene expression. Accordingly, knockdown of Twist1 expression with shRNA augmented chondrocyte gene expression. Also, expression of Twist1 inhibited chondrocyte gene expression following stimulation with BMP2 and conversely, shRNA knockdown of Twist1 augmented chondrocyte gene expression at low concentrations of BMP2. These data support our conclusion that Twist1 is an important target of Wnt signaling that contributes to the repression of chondrogenesis by canonical Wnt signaling. These data also suggest that Twist1 regulates chondrocyte gene expression through interactions with BMP-dependent pathways. Growth Factors—Growth factors and inhibitors were obtained from the following suppliers: SB216763 (Tocris, Ellisville, MO), Wnt3a and BMP2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). These materials were solubilized according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture—ATDC5 (RIKEN cell bank) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Limb bud mesenchyme was prepared from C57Bl/6 mouse embryos at 11.5 days postcoitus and grown as described previously (18Tomita M. Reinhold M.I. Molkentin J.D. Naski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42214-42218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—ATDC5 cells treated with Wnt3a or SB216763 were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer, sheared by passage through a 25-gauge needle, and 15 μg of total protein was fractionated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with I-Block (Tropix, Bedford, MA), probed with either anti-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-actin (Chemicon) followed by a goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (ICN/Cappel, Aurora, OH) and developed by chemiluminescence (West Dura-extended, Pierce). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cells using RNeasy according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed as described previously (19Reinhold M.I.

Firulli, Indianapolis, IN) and β-catenin S45A cDNA (generously supplied by D. Rimm, New Haven, CT) were subcloned into the pShuttle vector (BD Bioscience) and then transferred into a replication-deficient, Ad5 genome via a set of unique restriction sites (I-CeuI and PI-SceI) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA). Adenoviral supernatants were prepared from infected HEK293 producer cells as described previously (18Tomita M. Reinhold M.I. Molkentin J.D. Naski M.C. J. Biol.

The next day, the volume of virus necessary for >90% infection was added to 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the mixture was briefly vortexed. After addition of 25 μl of 1 m CaCl2 the mixture was briefly vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Following removal of the media from the cells, the 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the Ad-calcium phosphate precipitate was added to the dish and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time period. RNA Interference—The small interference RNA oligonucleotide against mouse Twist1 was designed as previously described (22Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). The target sequence is AAGCTGAGCAAGATTCAGACC. A negative control shRNA oligonucleotide from the BD Knock-out RNAi System, unrelated to Twist1, was used as control. The BD Knock-out RNAi System (BD Biosciences) was used for generating small interference RNAs. Briefly, a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing the shRNA and BamHI and EcoR1 overhangs was cloned into the BamHI- and EcoR1-digested RNAi-Ready pSIREN-Shuttle vector, an expression vector designed to express shRNAs using the U6 promoter. The construct was verified by sequencing. ATDC5 cells wherein steady-state Twist1 transcripts were reduced by the shRNA were prepared by stable transfection of pSIREN containing control or Twist1 shRNA and pcDNA3.1 at 1:14 ratio. Stable transfectants were selected in growth medium containing 450 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Individual clones were isolated and assayed for Twist1 expression by real-time quantitative PCR. ATDC5 cells were transiently transfected with shRNA plasmids using Nucleofection (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution T and transfected with 5 μg of DNA using Program T-20. Transfection efficiency using these conditions was shown to be >80%. 24 h post transfection cells were treated with BMP2 and harvested 16 h later. RNA was prepared from cells using an RNeasy (Qiagen) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Methods—Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05. To better understand the regulation of chondrogenesis by Wnt signaling we investigated early steps of chondrocyte differentiation as determined by the regulation of the cartilage-specific genes aggrecan and type II collagen in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5. Wnt signaling was initiated by adding Wnt3a to the medium or by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity with the pharmacological antagonist SB216763. Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that aggrecan and type II collagen expression was dramatically inhibited by either Wnt3a or the inhibitor of GSK3. Both Wnt3a and the GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 activate canonical Wnt signaling in ATDC5 cells as evidenced by increased levels of βcat (Fig. 1, C and D). Wnt signaling also inhibited chondrogenesis in a limb-bud mesenchyme differentiation assay. Mesenchyme from mouse embryos e11.5 days post-coitus was prepared and plated at high density to initiate differentiation into cartilage. Fig. 1E shows that chondrogenesis is dramatically inhibited by canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 with SB216763 repressed the formation of cartilage nodules. The inhibition evidenced by the culture morphology was corroborated by gene expression studies showing that aggrecan and collagen type II gene expression was strongly repressed (Fig. 1F). As expected, the βcat-inducible gene conductin (23Jho E.H. Zhang T. Domon C. Joo C.K. Freund J.N. Costantini F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was strongly induced. The expression of type I collagen was unchanged. Significantly, the expression of Wnt5a, Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Wnt11 diminished as chondrocyte differentiation ensued (Fig. 1G). The expression of Wnt2, -4, -5b, -9a, and -10a was largely unchanged, whereas Wnt8b, -9b, and -10b increased during the time course of the assay (data not shown). The expression of Wnt1, -3, -3a, and -8a was not detectable. These data support the view that certain Wnt ligands act to repress differentiation. In particular, Wnt7a, -7b, and -11 have been shown to activate canonical Wnt signaling (24Wang Z. Shu W. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5022-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25Tao Q. Yokota C. Puck H. Kofron M. Birsoy B. Yan D. Asashima M. Wylie C.C. Lin X. Heasman J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21653-21660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, the diminished expression of these Wnts may contribute to increased differentiation. These data showed that inhibition of GSK3 with Wnt3a or the directacting antagonist repressed chondrocyte gene expression and chondrogenesis. This suggests that canonical Wnt signaling is primarily responsible for the inhibition. To test this directly, we investigated the effects of a stabilized form of βcat. ATDC5 cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus containing either a protease-resistant form of βcat (S45A) or β-galactosidase as a control. Consistent with canonical Wnt signaling repressing chondrogenesis, transduction of βcat inhibited aggrecan and type II collagen expression (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the stabilized form of βcat inhibited cartilage development in the limb-bud chondrogenesis assay (Fig. 2B). From these results we conclude that Wnt signaling represses chondrogenesis through a βcat-dependent pathway. Canonical Wnt signaling stabilizes βcat resulting in nuclear accumulation of βcat and induction of βcat-responsive genes. Because we observed strong inhibition of aggrecan and collagen expression, we hypothesized that canonical Wnt signaling induced a transcriptional repressor that contributes to the inhibition of chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression. Therefore we searched for transcription repressors that are induced by canonical Wnt signaling in ATDC5 cells. The transcription repressors snail, slug, or engrailed1 were not induced by Wnt signaling, and engrailed2 was only slightly induced (data not shown). Significantly, the transcriptional repressor Twist1 was induced in response to Wnt signaling. Fig. 3A shows that Twist1 was induced following inhibition of GSK3 with SB216763 or Wnt3a. Twist1 expression was also induced following inhibition of GSK3 in limb-bud mesenchyme (Fig. 3B) or following adenoviral transduction of βcat in ATDC5 cells (Fig. 3C). Lastly, we observed diminished expression of Twist1 as cartilage developed in the limb-bud differentiation assay (Fig. 3D). As shown in Fig. 1G, the expression of Wnt7a, -7b, and -11 decreased as differentiation occurred. Because these Wnt can activate canonical Wnt signaling cascades, diminished expression may contribute to the decrease in Twist1 expression. These data support our conclusion that canonical Wnt signaling induces Twist1 and that Twist1 contributes to the repression of chondrogenesis. We showed that canonical Wnt signaling induces the transcriptional repressor Twist1 and represses chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression. We then hypothesized that Twist1 is responsible for the repression of chondrocyte gene expression produced by canonical Wnt signaling. To examine this, we asked if Twist1 repressed chondrocyte gene expression. ATDC5 cells were infected with a Twist1 adenovirus, and the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Fig. 4 (A and B) show that Twist1 caused strong repression of both aggrecan and type II collagen, respectively. To further examine the effects of Twist1 on chondrocyte gene expression, we studied the effects of Twist1 on aggrecan or the type II collagen promoters. Co-transfection of Twist1 with luciferase reporters containing promoters from the type II collagen or aggrecan genes caused repression of both promoters (Fig. 4, C and D). The expression of aggrecan and type II collagen is synonymous with the chondrocyte cell lineage. Because Twist1 repressed the expression of both genes this suggested that Twist1 interacts with regulatory pathways that are central to chondrocyte differentiation. BMP signaling is essential for chondrogenesis (28Yoon B.S. Ovchinnikov D.A. Yoshii I. Mishina Y. Behringer R.R. Lyons K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5062-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen. Therefore, we asked if Twist1 interferes with aggrecan and type II collagen expression in response to BMP signaling. Twist1 or β-galactosidase as a control was virally transduced into ATDC5 cells, and thereafter cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml BMP2. Significantly, we found that Twist1 strongly inhibited the induction of aggrecan and type II collagen by BMP2 (Fig. 4, E and F). Moreover, inhibition of GSK3 with SB216763, and thereby induction of Twist1, also repressed the induction of aggrecan and type II collagen by BMP2 (Fig. 4, G and H). These data showed that Twist1 is induced by canonical Wnt signaling and that, like canonical Wnt signaling, Twist1 represses chondrocyte gene expression. Because we showed that forced expression of Twist1 repressed chondrocyte gene expression, we hypothesized that knockdown of Twist expression by RNA interference would increase chondrocyte gene expression. To knockdown Twist1 expression we stably transfected ATDC5 cells with a Twist1 shRNA expression plasmid. This hairpin RNA effectively reduced Twist1 expression without altering expression of the related bHLH protein Twist2 (data not shown). We obtained clones wherein steady-state levels of Twist1 mRNA were suppressed as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5A). Significantly, the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen was dramatically increased in these cells (Fig. 5, B and C). To further study the effects of Twist1 knockdown on aggrecan and type II collagen, we co-transfected ATDC5 cells with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the collagen II or aggrecan promoters together with the Twist1 shRNA expression plasmid. Consistent with Twist1 acting to repress chondrocyte gene expression, we observed that Twist1 knockdown augments the activity of both the aggrecan and collagen II promoters (Fig. 5, D and E). Knockdown of Twist1 expression in stably transfected cells resulted in increased expression of aggrecan and type II collagen (Fig. 5, B and C). Interestingly, transient knockdown of Twist1 by transient transfection of the shRNA expression vector did not alter the steady-state mRNA levels of type II collagen or aggrecan expression (data not shown). We therefore reasoned that the effects of Twist1 on aggrecan and collagen expression are indirect and require a longer period of time to integrate the effects of Twist1 knockdown (as expected following stable knock-down of Twist1). Consistent with an indirect effect, we showed that Twist1 interfered with the induction of aggrecan and type II collagen by BMP2. We then hypothesized that transient knockdown of Twist1 expression with the shRNA may augment aggrecan and type II collagen expression at a submaximal dose of BMP2. To test this, we transiently knocked down Twist1 levels by transient transfection of the shRNA expression plasmids and stimulated the cells with 25 ng/ml BMP2. We observed that this concentration of BMP2 only slightly affected aggrecan and type II collagen expression in control cells (Fig. 6, A and B). However, treatment of cells with this concentration of BMP following transient knockdown of Twist1 caused significant increases in both aggrecan and collagen II expression (Fig. 6, A and B). The knockdown of Twist1 expression was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 6C). Our data show that Wnt signaling represses chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression. These data corroborate other results showing that Wnt signaling represses chondrocyte differentiation (14Hartmann C. Tabin C.J.

Also, while the manuscript for this report was under review additional reports were published showing that Wnt signaling has inhibitory effects on chondrocyte development from immature precursors (31Day T.F.

Cell. 2005; 8: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Additional data however show that Wnt signaling stimulates chondrocyte differentiation (13Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3141-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, Wnt5a and -5b stimulate chondrogenesis in limb-bud chondrogenesis assays (11Church V. Nohno T. Linker C. Marcelle C. Francis-West P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4809-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells adopt the chondrocyte phenotype when stimulated with Wnt 3a (33Fischer L. Boland G. Tuan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30870-30878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, Wnt 5a null mice exhibit delayed chondrocyte differentiation, suggesting that Wnt signaling stimulates differentiation. Because of the complexity of Wnt signaling, it is possible that conflicting effects of Wnt signaling are a consequence of canonical versus non-canonical Wnt signaling. To investigate this we performed experiments that only stimulate canonical Wnt signaling. Non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways require activation of Dishevelled (34Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T.

https://openalex.org/W2074389578,"We investigated and compared the mechanisms by which two dust mite proteolytic allergens, Der p 1 and Der p 3, and a peptide agonist of proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2AP) trigger interleukin (IL)-8 release from human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549). Although all three stimuli tested induced the up-regulation of IL-8 (mRNA and protein), the Der p 1-mediated signaling events did not exactly match those induced by PAR2AP and Der p 3. First, Der p 1 was less effective in stimulating IL-8 gene transcriptional activity than PAR2AP and Der p 3. Second, Der p 1-mediated IL-8 expression was mainly dependent on NF-κB, whereas Der p 3 and PAR2AP regulated IL-8 expression through the activation of both NF-κB and AP-1. Third, although all three MAP kinases, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, were activated, Der p 1 induced IL-8 release exclusively via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas PAR2AP and Der p 3 also involved the other kinases. Fourth, in HeLa cells, Der p 1 was able to up-regulate IL-8 secretion independent of PAR2 expression, and in contrast with PAR2AP and Der p 3, Der p 1 was unable to affect calcium signaling via PAR2 in PAR2-expressing KNRK cells. Finally, cleavage by Der p 1 of a synthetic peptide representing the N-terminal activation-cleavage site of PAR2 did not release a high potency activator of PAR2 as does Der p 3. We conclude that Der p 1 (but not Der p 3)-induced IL-8 production in A549 epithelial cells is independent of PAR2 activation.

House dust mites are a major source of allergens that contribute to the rising incidence of allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma, perennial rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis (1Busse W.W.

At least 17 allergen groups have been identified in the two predominant dust mite species, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae (4Fahy J.V. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: S46-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Allergens from group 1 (Der p 1 and Der f 1) display cysteine proteinase activity, whereas group 3, 6, and 9 allergens are serine proteinases that share sequence identity with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and collagenase, respectively. Although the precise pathophysiological role of the proteolytic activity of these house dust mite allergens has not been fully elucidated in vivo, recent data provide evidence that the proteinase activity amplifies allergen-induced bronchial asthma. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated that Der p 1 is capable of cleaving human proteins with potentially immunomodulatory effects, including A1-Pi (α1-proteinase inhibitor) (5Brown A. Farmer K.

Moreover, incubation of confluent airway epithelial cells with Der p 1 or the serine proteinases Der p 3, Der p 6, or Der p 9 has been shown to lead to cleavage of the tight junction adhesion proteins, such as ZO-1, causing an increase in the epithelial permeability and access of allergens to dendritic cells (10Winton H.L.

This event appears to depend on the proteolytic activity of these allergens, since these changes in allergen-induced permeability can be prevented by cysteine or serine proteinase inhibitors.

These mediators trigger the accumulation of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils and neutrophils, to perpetuate the chronic allergic inflammation of the airways. The expression of these cytokines and chemokines has been shown to depend on the enzymatic activity of these dust mite allergens, but the allergen-induced signal transduction mechanism(s) in human epithelial cells has not yet been studied in any depth. The relationship between the proteolytic activity of these allergens and their induction of chemokine production has been strengthened by data pointing to a potential role for proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) 1 and 2 in the action of Der p 1, 3, and 9 (15Sun G.

PAR1 and PAR2 belong to a new subfamily of proteolytically activated G protein-coupled receptors with seven putative transmembrane domains. Activation of PARs is achieved when the extracellular amino terminus of the receptor is cleaved to expose a tethered ligand sequence that binds to the extracellular body of the receptor, leading to the G protein-coupled signal transduction (e.g. activation of phospholipase C, generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, increased intracellular Ca2+, and activation of protein kinase C (reviewed in Ref. 18Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar)). Synthetic peptides based on the sequence of the tethered ligand can bind to and activate the receptor, bypassing the requirement for proteolysis (19Hollenberg M.D. Compton S.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The chemokine IL-8, which is a major chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils, appears to play a key role in the pathophysiology of asthma (20Mukaida N. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 72: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mukaida N. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 284: L566-L577Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Indeed, IL-8 expression is increased in the airway epithelium of patients with asthma (22Hoshi H. Ohno I. Honma M. Tanno Y. Yamauchi K. Tamura G. Shirato K. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1995; 25: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Patients with status asthmaticus also exhibit dramatic increases of this cytokine in their airways (23Lamblin C. Gosset P. Tillie-Leblond I. Saulnier F. Marquette C.H. Wallaert B. Tonnel A.B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-8 has also been found to be an eosinophil chemoattractant relevant to the problem of asthma (21Mukaida N. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 284: L566-L577Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). IL-8 secretion and mRNA synthesis are strongly regulated by more than 100-fold by a plethora of external stimuli (24Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major part of this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. A relatively small region of the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene (nucleotides –1 to –133) is essential and sufficient for its transcriptional induction by most stimuli (24Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter contains an NF-κB element that is required for activation in all cell types studied as well as AP-1 and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (NF-IL6) binding sites. The latter two sites are not essential for induction but are required for maximal gene expression (24Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, numerous lines of functional evidence indicate that the activity of transcription factors that can bind to NF-κB, AP-1, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (NF-IL-6) binding sites in the IL-8 promoter are regulated by the coordinated activation of the MAP kinases ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK) in response to stimuli that induce IL-8 production (reviewed in Ref. 25Hoffmann E. Thiefes A. Buhrow D. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Schneider H. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9706-9718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which all three types of MAP kinases regulate onset, duration, or extent of IL-8 mRNA synthesis are still not completely elucidated. In this study, we have investigated and compared the mechanisms whereby Der p 1, Der p 3 and an agonist peptide-activator of PAR2 (PAR2AP) induce the expression and the production of IL-8 in human airway epithelial cells. Our data demonstrate that, although Der p 1 and Der p 3 have both been described to trigger cytokine release from respiratory epithelial cells by activation of PAR2, the signaling events mediated by Der p 1 do not exactly match those induced by either Der p 3 or PAR2 activation in terms of the transcription factors and MAP kinases mediating IL-8 expression. Moreover, we show that the ability of Der p 1 to up-regulate IL-8 secretion in HeLa cells, in contrast with Der p 3, cannot be attributed to the activation of PAR2. Finally, we find that cleavage by Der p 1 of a synthetic peptide sequence representing the N-terminal activation-cleavage site of PAR2 does not release a high potency activator of PAR2, as does Der p 3. All of our data lead us to conclude that, in contrast with Der p 3, Der p 1-induced IL-8 production in human airway epithelial cells appears to be independent of PAR2 activation. Materials—The receptor-selective PAR2 agonist (PAR2AP; SLIGRL-NH2) and the standard PAR2-inactive control (α-PAR2AP; LRGILS-NH2) peptide, P20 (corresponding to rat PAR2 residues 30–45, 30GPNSKGRSLIGRLDTP45yggc (sequence of PAR2 in uppercase letters); yggc added for labeling and coupling) as well as a 27-mer P27 peptide (corresponding to human PAR2 residues 28–54, Ac-28GTNRSSKGRSLIGKVDGTSHVTGKGVT54-NH2) were synthesized by solid-phase methods (Peptide Synthesis Facility, University of Calgary, Faculty of Medicine). HPLC analysis, mass spectral analysis, and quantitative amino acid analysis confirmed the composition and purity of all peptides. Stock solutions were prepared in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Trypsin and TNF-α were purchased from Sigma and R&D, respectively. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Cell Signaling. The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, the JNK inhibitor, SP 6001125, and actinomycin D were purchased from Calbiochem. Der p Allergen Preparation—Natural Der p 1 was isolated from whole D. pteronyssinus culture extracts by immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized 4C1 anti-Der p 1 monoclonal antibody (Indoor Biotechnologies). To obtain Der p 3, the flow-through of the Der p 1 affinity chromatography column was submitted to a 60% final saturation (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. After ultracentrifugation (45 min, 149,000 × g), the supernatant was applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose 4 fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Tris buffer (50 mm), NaCl (0.5 m), pH 7.4. Der p 3 was eluted from the column with 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.5, and each 1-ml fraction was immediately equilibrated at pH 7.5 with 75 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 9.5. Fractions containing Der p 3 were pooled, concentrated (Amicon-Millipore regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes, nominal molecular weight limit, 10 kDa), and applied on a Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.3. Purified Der p 3 was concentrated and stored at –20 °C. The purity of the natural allergens was estimated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. The proteins were detected after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and murine polyclonal antibodies directed to recombinant ProDer p 1 and ProDer p 3 were used to verify the absence of cross-contamination (Fig. 1). The authenticity of Der p 1 and Der p 3 was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Recombinant ProDer p 1 from CHO spent culture medium was purified to homogeneity as previously described (26Massaer M. Mazzu P. Haumont M. Magi M. Daminet V. Bollen A. Jacquet A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2001; 125: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Before use, natural Der p 1 was activated for 15 min at room temperature in PBS, pH 7.3, containing 10 mm l-cysteine. In some experiments, Der p 1 was heat-denatured for 5 min at 100 °C in the presence of 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The catalytic activity of Der p 1 was determined in a continuous rate (kinetic) assay using the fluorogenic peptide substrate N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)). Briefly, Der p 1 was activated for 15 min in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, and 10 mm cysteine. The substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC (20 μl, 7.5 mm stock in Me2SO, 75 μm final concentration; Bachem, Torrance, CA) was then added. The rate of the enzymatic activity was measured for 10 min using an AMINCO-Bowman® Series 2 Luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Unicam, Rochester, NY) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission recorded at 460 nm. The amount of substrate cleaved was determined by measuring the fluorescence of known concentrations of AMC (0.75, 1.5, and 2.25 μm; Sigma). The activity of the Der p 1 used for our work (house units/mg) ranged between 200 and 300 units/mg (nmol of Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC cleaved/min/mg of protein). Sample calculation was as follows: activity = (0.00536697 fluorescence units/s × (2.25 nmol/ml)/(2.41545 fluorescence units) × 2 ml × 60 s/min)/0.0021 mg of Der p 1; activity = 282 nmol of Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC cleaved/min/mg of protein. A molecular weight of 30,000 was used to calculate the molar concentrations of Der p 1. The enzymatic activity assay for trypsin (2 nm) and Der p 3 (2 nm) using the same substrate, Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC (75 μm), in buffer (50 mm Tris, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) yielded activities of the two enzymes: 28,700 units/mg (nmol of substrate cleaved/min/mg) for trypsin and 1900 units/mg (nmol of substrate cleaved/min/mg) for Der p 3. Cell Culture—A549 cells, a human alveolar type II pneumocyte cell line (a kind gift from Prof. J. Pestel, Institut Pasteur, Lille) and HeLa cells (obtained from the European Collection of Cell Culture) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passed without the use of trypsin by scraping to minimize the proteolytic activation of the PARs. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with human PAR2 using the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector, as outlined below. KNRK rat kidney cells permanently transfected with rat PAR2 (27Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar) or with the human PAR2 variant lacking an N-terminal glycosylation site, PAR2N30A (28Compton S.J. Renaux B. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as previously described (27Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar, 28Compton S.J. Renaux B. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured by resuspension in calcium-free isotonic saline/EDTA solution without the use of trypsin. Activation of A549 and HeLa Cells—A549 and either vector-alone or PAR2-transfected HeLa cells were cultured to 80% confluence and then incubated in serum-free DMEM for a further 24 h. One hour before stimulation, the growth medium was replaced by fresh serum-free DMEM. Cells were then incubated with different concentrations of Der p 1 (25–250 nm) or Der p 3 (5–60 nm) for 7 h. In some experiments, cells were then exposed to optimum concentrations of native Der p 1 or Der p 3 for different periods of time in serum-free DMEM. As controls, cells were also incubated with activating peptide (SLIGRL-NH2) or the standard PAR2-inactive reverse sequence peptide (αPAR2; LRGILS-NH2) (final concentration 25 μm), trypsin (final concentration 10 nm), TNF-α (final concentration 10 ng/ml), heat-denatured Der p 1, recombinant ProDer p 1 (allergens used at a final concentration of 150 nm), or native Der p 3 treated with the serine proteinase inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride or aprotinin. When appropriate, A549 cells were treated for 1 h at 37°C with 25 μm of the specific MEK inhibitor U0126 (Cell Signaling) or the specific p38 MAP kinase or JNK kinase inhibitors (SB203580 and SP6001125, respectively; Calbiochem) prior to the addition of Der p 1, Der p 3, or positive controls. Negative control cells were preincubated with equivalent amounts of Me2SO. Culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and stored at –80 °C. In another set of experiments, a 1-h activation of A549 cells with Der p 1, Der p 3, or PAR2AP was followed by incubation with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Measurement of IL-8 Secretion—After stimulation, cell-free supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min and assayed for IL-8 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. IL-8 concentrations were determined by interpolation from a standard curve performed with purified human IL-8. Detection of IL-8 mRNA Expression by Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured A549 cells using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment (RNase-free DNase; Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplification of IL-8 transcripts was accomplished with primers chosen according to the published sequence of human IL-8 cDNA (29Lindley I. Aschauer H. Seifert J.M. Lam C. Brunowsky W. Kownatzki E. Thelen M. Peveri P. Dewald B. von Tscharner V. Walz A. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9199-9203Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The housekeeping gene fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used for verification of equal loading and of RT-PCR efficiency. The sequences of the primers (Invitrogen) were as follows: IL-8, sense 5′-TTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT-3′ and antisense 5′-AACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTG-3′ (PCR product, 203 bp); GAPDH, sense 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and antisense 5′-ATGTCGTTGTCCCACCACCT-3′ (PCR product, 405 bp). The PCRs were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600) with the following conditions: 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 1 min), annealing (55 °C for 1 min), extension (72 °C for 1 min), and final extension for 7 min at 72 °C for GAPDH and IL-8. The intensity of the amplification bands was quantified with the NIH-Image program (version 1.62). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The vectors encoding either the wild-type IL-8 promoter (–133/+44)/luciferase reporter, or site mutations of one of the binding sites (AP-1, NF-IL-6, or NF-κB) in the IL-8 promoter region were kindly provided by Dr. N. Mukaida (Division of Molecular Bioregulation, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Japan). The constructs were described in detail in the publications from Mukaida's laboratory (30Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Yasumoto K. Rice N. Ishikawa Y. Horiguchi H. Murakami S. Matsushima K. J. Biol.

The AP-1-luc construct, driven by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements within the 517-bp promoter of the human collagenase gene (MMP-1-luc) (31Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B.

Angel (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) and Dr. C. Van Lint (Institut de Biologie et de Médecine Moléculaires, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Gosselies, Belgium), respectively. A549 cells were transfected using Fugene (Roche Applied Science) with one of these vectors for 4 h and then cultured in serum-free medium for a further 16 h before the Der p 1, Der p 3, or PAR2AP treatment for 60 min. The cells were then collected and lysed. Supernatants were evaluated for firefly luciferase activity with a luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting Analysis—Treated A549 cells were washed in cold PBS, lysed with Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% bromphenol blue), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies specific for both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38 MAP kinase, or JNK (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling) as described previously (41Brasier A.R.

The intensities of the bands on the immunoblot were quantified with the NIH-Image program (version 1.62). Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts from A549 cells were prepared as previously described (32Adam E. Quivy V. Bex F. Chariot A. Collette Y. Vanhulle C. Schoonbroodt S. Goffin V. Nguyen T.L.

Briefly, treated A549 cells were scraped and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 500 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). The cells, swollen at 4 °C for 10 min, were lysed in the presence of 0.4% Nonidet P-40. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and left for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation (20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), the resulting supernatant was diluted by the addition of 150 μl of cold buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and then stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as previously described (41Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding sites for double-stranded oligonucleotides, NF-κB(5′-CGTGGAATTTCCTCTG-3′; bp –83 to –68) and AP-1 (5′-GTGATGACTCAGGTT-3′; bp –130 to –116) from the IL-8 promoter were endlabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and were used as probes. The binding reactions were performed at room temperature. Nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) was first incubated for 20 min in the absence of probe in a 16-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μg of DNase-free bovine serum albumin (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) as nonspecific competitor DNA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Thirty thousand counts/min of probe was then added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature on 6% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 2–3 h in 1× TGE buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3), 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at –70 °C. The intensities of the bands on the immunoblot were quantified with the NIH-Image program (version 1.62). For supershift experiments, antibodies (1 μg/reaction) to p50 (sc-114), p52 (sc-298), p65 (sc-372), c-Rel (sc-70), c-Jun (sc-1694), Jun B (sc-8051), Jun D (sc-74), c-Fos (sc-8047), Fra-1 (sc-605), and Fra-2 (sc-171) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with the extracts at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probes.

https://openalex.org/W2017048635,"β-Catenin is a structural component of adherens junctions, where it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin cell adhesion molecules. β-Catenin is also a transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it binds to Tcf/Lef family transcription factors. In the absence of a Wnt signal, nonjunctional β-catenin is present in a multiprotein complex containing the proteins axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), both of which bind directly to β-catenin. The thermodynamics of β-catenin binding to E-cadherin, Lef-1, APC, axin, and the transcriptional inhibitor ICAT have been determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Most of the interactions showed large, unfavorable entropy changes, consistent with these ligands being natively unstructured in the absence of β-catenin. Phosphorylation of serine residues present in a sequence motif common to cadherins and APC increased the affinity for β-catenin 300-700-fold, and surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed that phosphorylation of E-cadherin both enhanced its on rate and decreased its off rate. The effects of the N- and C-terminal “tails” that flank the β-catenin armadillo repeat domain on ligand binding have also been investigated using constructs lacking one or both tails. Contrary to earlier studies that employed less direct binding assays, the tails did not affect the affinity of β-catenin for tight ligands such as E-cadherin, Lef-1, and phosphorylated APC. However, the β-catenin C-terminal tail was found to decrease the affinity for the weaker ligands APC and axin, suggesting that this region may have a regulatory role in β-catenin degradation. β-Catenin is a structural component of adherens junctions, where it binds to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin cell adhesion molecules. β-Catenin is also a transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it binds to Tcf/Lef family transcription factors.

The protein β-catenin serves several roles in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. It is a structural component of cell-cell contacts and is also a transcriptional coactivator in the Wnt signaling pathway that controls cell fate determination. The multiple functions of this protein depend upon its interactions with several distinct protein ligands. In adherens junctions, β-catenin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins and with α-catenin, which functionally connects the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. The levels of nonjunctional β-catenin are determined by the presence or absence of Wnt growth factor stimulation. In the absence of a Wnt, cytosolic β-catenin is targeted for degradation by a multiprotein complex containing axin and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC). 3The abbreviations used are: APCadenomatous polyposis coli proteinarmarmadilloβ-cat fullfull-length β-cateninβ-cat-armβ-catenin armadillo repeat domainβ-cat-arm-Ntβ-catenin N-tail + arm domainβ-cat-arm-Ctβ-catenin arm domain + C-tailBEcytobiotinylated E-cadherin cytoplasmic domainCK1casein kinase 1EcytoE-cadherin cytoplasmic domainGSK-3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βICATinhibitor of catenin and TCFICAT-hICAT helical domainITCisothermal titration calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonance spectroscopyDTTdithiothreitolTEVtobacco etch virusMCSmultiple cloning siteGSTglutathione S-transferaseIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: APCadenomatous polyposis coli proteinarmarmadilloβ-cat fullfull-length β-cateninβ-cat-armβ-catenin armadillo repeat domainβ-cat-arm-Ntβ-catenin N-tail + arm domainβ-cat-arm-Ctβ-catenin arm domain + C-tailBEcytobiotinylated E-cadherin cytoplasmic domainCK1casein kinase 1EcytoE-cadherin cytoplasmic domainGSK-3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βICATinhibitor of catenin and TCFICAT-hICAT helical domainITCisothermal titration calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonance spectroscopyDTTdithiothreitolTEVtobacco etch virusMCSmultiple cloning siteGSTglutathione S-transferaseIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideNTAnitrilotriacetic acid. The axin-APC complex binds to β-catenin and also recruits casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). These kinases phosphorylate β-catenin, flagging it for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. In the presence of a Wnt signal, phosphorylation of β-catenin is inhibited. The resulting stabilized pool of β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the Tcf/Lef family transcription factors. The β-catenin-Tcf complex recruits general transcription factors, resulting in a complex that activates Wnt target genes. adenomatous polyposis coli protein armadillo full-length β-catenin β-catenin armadillo repeat domain β-catenin N-tail + arm domain β-catenin arm domain + C-tail biotinylated E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain casein kinase 1 E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor of catenin and TCF ICAT helical domain isothermal titration calorimetry surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy dithiothreitol tobacco etch virus multiple cloning site glutathione S-transferase isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside nitrilotriacetic acid. adenomatous polyposis coli protein armadillo full-length β-catenin β-catenin armadillo repeat domain β-catenin N-tail + arm domain β-catenin arm domain + C-tail biotinylated E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain casein kinase 1 E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor of catenin and TCF ICAT helical domain isothermal titration calorimetry surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy dithiothreitol tobacco etch virus multiple cloning site glutathione S-transferase isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside nitrilotriacetic acid. The primary structure of β-catenin consists of an N-terminal region of ∼150 amino acids, followed by a central armadillo (arm) repeat domain of ∼520 residues and a C-terminal “tail” of about 100 amino acids. Many β-catenin ligands, including cadherins, Tcfs, APC, axin, and the transcriptional inhibitor ICAT, bind to the arm repeat domain. This region consists of 12 arm repeats, each of which is composed of three α-helices, which pack together to form a highly elongated structure with a positively charged groove (1Huber A.H.

Cell. 2002; 10: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have revealed that an extended peptide present in these ligands binds to the portion of the groove formed by repeats 5-9 (Fig. 1). In addition to this common binding feature, each ligand forms unique interactions with other portions of the β-catenin arm domain. For example, sequences in E-cadherin N- and C-terminal to the extended groove-binding peptide interact with all of the other arm repeats, and ICAT has an N-terminal helical domain that interacts with arm repeats 11 and 12. Tcfs contain an amphipathic helix C-terminal to the groove-binding peptide that interacts with repeats 3-5. This region is also exploited when APC 20-mers or cadherin are phosphorylated; phosphorylation of serine residues in the sequence SLSSL shared by these proteins results in ordering of this region and formation of interactions similar to those made by the Tcf helix. In the case of APC, binding of the phosphorylated sequence results in additional contacts made by the 18 amino acids C-terminal to the SLSSL sequence (7Xing Y. Clements W.K. Le Trong I. Hinde T.R. Stenkamp R. Kimelman D. Xu W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Ha N.-C. Tonozuka T. Stamos J.L. Choi H.-J. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Axin is unique among the known arm-domain binding ligands because it does not interact with the repeat 5-9 groove; instead, it binds as a 17-residue α-helix to the groove formed by repeats 3 and 4 (11Xing Y. Clemens W.K. Kimmelman D. Xu W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Several studies of the interaction between β-catenin and Tcf-4, E-cadherin, and APC have identified key residues or “hot spots” in the ligands responsible for the majority of the binding energy. The extended peptide common to most β-catenin ligands can be described by the consensus DXθθXϕX2-7E, where θ is an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid, and ϕ is an aromatic side chain (9Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mutation and binding studies with Tcf-4 peptides indicate that the consensus Asp and the aromatic side chain confer much of the binding energy in the groove (12Fasolini M. Wu X. Flocco M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7107-7117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tcf-4 residues Leu41 and Leu48, which are present on one side of an amphipathic helix that binds to β-catenin arm repeats 3-5, are also important determinants of binding energy in this case (Fig. 1) (12Fasolini M.

The sequence SLSSL, which is present in both cadherins and the β-catenin-binding sequences in APC consisting of homologous 20 amino acid sequences, binds when these sequences are phosphorylated; the two Leu residues make the same packing interactions as Leu41 and Leu48 of the Tcf helix (2Huber A.H.

Most of the β-catenin ligands discussed herein are natively unstructured proteins, i.e. they do not adopt a single ordered structure in the absence of β-catenin or other partners. Nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and fluorescence anisotropy measurements have shown that the entire cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured in the absence of β-catenin (14Huber A.H. Stewart D.B. Laurents D.V. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12301-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and circular dichroism measurements of Tcf4-(1-65) and Tcf4-(1-130) likewise show a lack of secondary structure (15Knapp S. Zamai M. Volpi D. Nardese V. Avanzi N. Breton J. Plyte S. Flocco M. Marconi M. Isacchi A. Caiolfa V.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The regions of APC and axin that bind to β-catenin are short peptides that are unlikely to form stable structures in solution, and in the case of APC-R3 the lack of electron density for the last 25 residues in the unphosphorylated structure provides direct crystallographic evidence for a lack of structure when not bound to β-catenin (8Ha N.-C. Tonozuka T. Stamos J.L. Choi H.-J. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The lack of structure appears to have several functional implications. For example, β-catenin colocalizes with cadherin as soon as the latter appears in the endoplasmic reticulum; the two proteins move as a unit to the cell surface (16Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and disruption of this interaction results in proteosomal degradation of cadherin due to exposure of a PEST sequence present in cadherin (14Huber A.H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the case of cadherins and APC, the lack of structure of certain regions when not bound to β-catenin probably enables modification by kinases and phosphatases that can modulate binding affinity (2Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In the cell, it is likely that large portions of these proteins are bound to β-catenin or other partners. For example, in the absence of β-catenin Tcf/Lefs serve as transcriptional repressors through their association with TLE/Groucho family proteins (18Hurlstone A. Clevers H.

In contrast to the wealth of structural knowledge of the β-catenin arm domain and its interactions with ligands, little is known about the N- and C-terminal regions. The N- and C-tails of β-catenin appear to have important roles in preventing β-catenin from binding to desmosomal cadherins, which share significant similarity with classical cadherins found in adherens junctions (23Wahl J.K.I Nieset J.E.

Several reports suggest that these tails modulate the E-cadherin-β-catenin interaction by binding directly to the arm domain, thereby competing with the ligand (25Piedra J. Martínez D. Castaño J.

The C-tail appears to interact directly with the arm domain, an interaction that has been mapped to the last 22 amino acids of the protein (26Castaño J. Raurell I. Piedra J.A. Miravet S. Duñach M. García de Herreros A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31541-31550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The N-tail also appears to interact with the arm domain, but only in the presence of the C-tail (26Castaño J. Raurell I. Piedra J.A. Miravet S. Duñach M. García de Herreros A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31541-31550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although E-cadherin and Tcfs have overlapping interactions with the arm domain, Tcf binding was found to be independent of the C-tail (25Piedra J. Martínez D. Castaño J. Miravet S. Duñach M.

Although crystal structures have defined the atomic basis of ligand interactions with β-catenin, they do not provide any information about thermodynamics. Understanding the strengths of these interactions is important for dissecting the mechanism of adhesion (28Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J.

Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and how β-catenin can displace corepressors from Tcfs as part of transcriptional activation (30Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Moreover, dysregulation of β-catenin destruction and consequent inappropriate transcriptional activation by β-catenin underlie a number of cancers (31Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar), so there is intense interest in developing inhibitors that can selectively block its interactions with Tcfs while permitting its interactions with components of the destruction complex and cell adhesion molecules (32Lepourcelet M.

However, the interactions of β-catenin with many of its ligands have been assessed by qualitative or only semi-quantitative means. Here we present a systematic, quantitative analysis of β-catenin binding to E-cadherin, Lef-1, APC-R3, axin, and ICAT determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We also used this method, as well as surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, to assess the effect of phosphorylation on the cadherin and APC interactions and the effects of the β-catenin N- and C-terminal tails on ligand interactions. The thermodynamics correlate well with the structural data. It is found that the β-catenin tails influence the binding of some ligands, but the data rule out a direct intramolecular interaction between the tails and the β-catenin arm repeat domain. Construct Design and Overexpression in Escherichia coli—Four different murine β-catenin constructs, encoding the full-length protein (β-cat-full:1-781), the N-terminal + arm domain (β-cat-arm-Nt:1-671), the arm + C-terminal domain (β-cat-arm-Ct:134-781), and the arm domain alone (β-cat-arm:134-671) were used in these studies (Fig. 2). All were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The β-cat-arm construct contains a thrombin cleavage site after the GST (1Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar); the other constructs have an N-terminal GST followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site using a modified pGEX-KG vector, pGEX-TEV. DNA fragments encoding β-cat-arm-Nt and β-cat-arm-Ct were obtained by PCR and inserted into pGEX-TEV. The full cytoplasmic domain of murine E-cadherin (Ecyto:577-728) (14Huber A.H. Stewart D.B. Laurents D.V. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12301-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was used for ITC experiments and pulldown assays. Full-length ICAT and the helical domain of ICAT (residues 1-61; ICAT-h) were used for ITC experiments and were expressed as a GST-fused form and an N-terminal His6-tagged form, respectively, as described (9Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 573-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Two different murine Lef-1 constructs, Lef-1-(1-65) and Lef-1-(1-131), encoding residues from 1 to 65 and from 1 to 131, respectively, were expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged forms as described (30Daniels D.L. Weis W.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated 20-amino acid repeat 3 of APC (APC-R3:1484-1528) and the β-catenin binding domain of human axin fragment (residues 436-498) were used for ITC experiments and were expressed as GST fusion proteins as described previously (8Ha N.-C. Tonozuka T. Stamos J.L. Choi H.-J. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Each protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C until the A600 of cells reached 0.6-0.8 and were then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after additional growth of cells for 3-4 h at 30 °C, and the cell paste was stored at -80 °C. Vector Construction for Expression of Biotinylated Ecyto—A new vector, pAN-N1, that adds a biotin ligase consensus site to the N terminus of a protein was constructed from the vector pAN-1 (Avidity, LLC). A consensus cleavage site for the TEV protease was placed between the biotin ligase consensus and the new multiple cloning site (MCS) so that the affinity tag could be removed. Part of the biotinylation consensus, the TEV site, and the MCS was generated by overlap-extension PCR using standard methods and the following three oligonucleotides: 5′-AAATTTCGAAGCGCAGAAAATTGAATGGCATGAAAACCTGTATTTCCAAG-3′; 5′-CATGAAAACCTGTATTTCCAAGGATCCGGAGCTCGAGGCCTGCAGGGC-3′; and 5′-TATAAAGCTTCTAGAATTCCGCGGTACCCGGGCCCTGCAGGCCTCGAGC-3′. The PCR product and the pAN-1 vector were digested with BstBI and HindIII, and the biotinylation/TEV/MCS insert was ligated into pAN-1, generating pAN-N1. The PCR insert, in conjunction with a portion of the biotin consensus tag from pAN-1, encoded the following N-terminal fusion sequence: MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHENLYFQGSGARGLQGPGTAEF. The biotin ligase consensus site consists of residues 3-17 (33Schatz P.J. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 34Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Biotin-protein ligase covalently couples biotin to residue Lys12. Residue Glu17 functions as the C-terminal residue of the biotin ligase consensus and the N-terminal glutamate of the TEV protease consensus site (ENLYFQG) (35Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C. Cary S.M.

Cloning into the BamHI site leaves a single serine between the C terminus of the TEV consensus site and the sequence of interest. pAN-N1 and a construct described previously containing the mouse E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail (Ecyto) (37Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.W. Murphy-Erdosh C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The digest product, encoding residues 580-728 of mature E-cadherin, was ligated into pAN-N1 to yield pAN-Ecyto. E. coli strain BL21 containing an IPTG-inducible biotin-ligase gene (birA) in vector pACYC-184 (Avidity, LLC) was transformed with the IPTG-inducible pAN-Ecyto. This system did not reliably produce sufficient quantities of biotinylated Ecyto, possibly because induced biotin ligase expression competed with Ecyto fusion protein synthesis. In an attempt to improve the yield of biotinylated Ecyto fusion protein, the biotinylation/TEV/MCS region of pAN-N1 was moved to vector pET28a (Novagen), which utilizes a strong bacteriophage T7 expression system. The pAN-N1 biotinylation/TEV/MCS region was PCR-amplified using the following oligonucleotides: A, 5′-ATACCATGGCCGGCCTGAACGACATCTTC-3′, and B, 5′-ATAAAGCTTCTAGAATTCCGCGGTA-3′. Oligonucleotide A added a 5′-NcoI restriction site and changed the N terminus of the pAN-N1 fusion peptide from Met-Ser to Met-Ala. Amplified insert and pET28a were digested with NcoI and HindIII and the appropriate products ligated to form pET28ahh. pET28ahh was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated with the same BamHI/EcoRI fragment of E-cadherin originally ligated into pAN-N1 (above) to form pET28ahh-Ecyto. Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—For ITC experiments, β-cat-full, β-cat-arm, β-cat-arm-Nt, β-cat-arm-Ct, Ecyto, ICAT, axin, and APC-R3 were purified from their GST fusion forms, and Lef-1-(1-65), Lef-1-(1-131), and ICAT-h were purified from the N-terminal His6-tagged forms. Protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Applied Science) was added into thawed cell paste, and the cells were lysed by French press. After centrifugation of lysed cells at 40,000 rpm for 30 min, cleared lysates were removed and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for GST fusion proteins or Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads for His6-tagged protein for 1 h at 4°C. For GST fusion proteins, glutathione-agarose beads were washed first with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and then with cleavage buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Cleavage of the GST tag was performed by the addition of TEV protease (β-cat-full, β-cat-arm-Nt, β-cat-arm-Ct, APC-R3, and axin) or thrombin (β-cat-arm, Ecyto, and ICAT), and the cleavage reaction was incubated at 4 °C for overnight (TEV protease) or for 2 h (thrombin). The cleaved protein was collected from flowthrough and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer E (25 mm ethanolamine, pH 9.5, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm NaCl for β-cat-arm and buffer A (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm NaCl for others and was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl. Mono Q-purified protein was loaded onto a Superdex S200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer T1 (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 0.15 m KCl), buffer T2 (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 m NaCl), or buffer H (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm EDTA) for ITC experiments. For purification of Lef-1-(1-65), Lef-1-(1-131), and ICAT-h with the N-terminal His6 tag, Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were washed with 10 mm imidazole, after 1 h of incubation. Each His6-tagged protein was eluted using 300 mm imidazole, and its His6 tag was removed by TEV protease. After incubation of the cleavage reaction mixture at 4 °C overnight, imidazole was dialyzed out to reload the cleavage reaction onto Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads. Cleaved protein was collected from flowthrough and was further purified using gel filtration chromatography, equilibrated with buffer T2 or H. Each purified protein was spin-concentrated, and the final concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm. Phosphorylated Ecyto was prepared as described using purified Ecyto and commercially available casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) (2Huber A.H. Weis W.I.

Here we show that nodal membranes isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals restricted neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons. Proteomic analysis of these membranes revealed several inhibitors of neurite outgrowth, including the oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp). In rat spinal cord, OMgp was not localized to compact myelin, as previously thought, but to oligodendroglia-like cells, whose processes converge to form a ring that completely encircles the nodes. In OMgp-null mice, CNS nodes were abnormally wide and collateral sprouting was observed. Nodal ensheathment in the CNS may stabilize the node and prevent axonal sprouting."

https://openalex.org/W2071830962,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular gram-negative pathogen and the etiologic agent of significant ocular and genital tract diseases. Chlamydiae primarily infect epithelial cells, and the inflammatory response of these cells to the infection directs both the innate and adaptive immune response. This study focused on determining the cellular immune receptors involved in the early events following infection with the L2 serovar of C. trachomatis. We found that dominant negative MyD88 inhibited interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion during a productive infection with chlamydia. Furthermore, expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 was required for IL-8 secretion from infected cells, whereas the effect of TLR4/MD-2 expression was minimal. Cell activation was dependent on infection with live, replicating bacteria, because infection with UV-irradiated bacteria and treatment of infected cells with chloramphenicol, but not ampicillin, abrogated the induction of IL-8 secretion. Finally, we show that both TLR2 and MyD88 co-localize with the intracellular chlamydial inclusion, suggesting that TLR2 is actively engaged in signaling from this intracellular location. These data support the role of TLR2 in the host response to infection with C. trachomatis. Our data further demonstrate that TLR2 and the adaptor MyD88 are specifically recruited to the bacterial or inclusion membrane during a productive infection with chlamydia and provide the first evidence that intracellular TLR2 is responsible for signal transduction during infection with an intracellular bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1990520168,"Acid β-glucosidase (GCase) is a 497-amino acid, membrane-associated lysosomal exo-β-glucosidase whose defective activity leads to the Gaucher disease phenotypes. To move toward a structure/function map for disease mutations, 52 selected single amino acid substitutions were introduced into GCase, expressed in an insect cell system, purified, and characterized for basic kinetic, stability, and activator response properties. The variant GCases from Gaucher disease patients and selected variant GCases from the mouse had decreased relative kcat and differential effects on active site binding and/or attachment of mechanism-based covalent (conduritol B epoxide) or reversible (deoxynojirimycin derivatives) inhibitors. A defect in negatively charged phospholipid activation was present in the majority of variant GCases but was increased in two, N370S and V394L. Deficits in saposin C enhancement of kcat were present in variant GCases involving residues 48-122, whereas ∼2-fold increases were obtained with the L264I GCase. About 50% of variant GCases each had wild-type or increased sensitivity to in vitro cathepsin D digestion. Mapping of these properties onto the crystal structures of GCase indicated wide dispersion of functional properties that can affect catalytic function and stability. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues showed that the disulfide bonds, Cys4-Cys16 and Cys18-Cys23, and a free Cys342 were essential for activity; the free Cys126 and Cys248 were not. Relative kcat was highly sensitive to a His substitution at Arg496 but not at Arg495. These studies and high phylogenetic conservation indicate localized and general structural effects of Gaucher disease mutations that were not obvious from the nature of the amino acid substitution, including those predicted to be nondisruptive (e.g. Val → Leu). These results provide initial studies for the engineering of variant GCases and, potentially, molecular chaperones for therapeutic use. Acid β-glucosidase (GCase) is a 497-amino acid, membrane-associated lysosomal exo-β-glucosidase whose defective activity leads to the Gaucher disease phenotypes. To move toward a structure/function map for disease mutations, 52 selected single amino acid substitutions were introduced into GCase, expressed in an insect cell system, purified, and characterized for basic kinetic, stability, and activator response properties. The variant GCases from Gaucher disease patients and selected variant GCases from the mouse had decreased relative kcat and differential effects on active site binding and/or attachment of mechanism-based covalent (conduritol B epoxide) or reversible (deoxynojirimycin derivatives) inhibitors. A defect in negatively charged phospholipid activation was present in the majority of variant GCases but was increased in two, N370S and V394L. Deficits in saposin C enhancement of kcat were present in variant GCases involving residues 48-122, whereas ∼2-fold increases were obtained with the L264I GCase. About 50% of variant GCases each had wild-type or increased sensitivity to in vitro cathepsin D digestion. Mapping of these properties onto the crystal structures of GCase indicated wide dispersion of functional properties that can affect catalytic function and stability. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues showed that the disulfide bonds, Cys4-Cys16 and Cys18-Cys23, and a free Cys342 were essential for activity; the free Cys126 and Cys248 were not. Relative kcat was highly sensitive to a His substitution at Arg496 but not at Arg495. These studies and high phylogenetic conservation indicate localized and general structural effects of Gaucher disease mutations that were not obvious from the nature of the amino acid substitution, including those predicted to be nondisruptive (e.g. Val → Leu). These results provide initial studies for the engineering of variant GCases and, potentially, molecular chaperones for therapeutic use.

The mature glycoprotein has 497 amino acids that are derived from 517- or 536-amino acid precursors containing leader sequences that are removed during transit through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (3.Bergmann J.E.

Cotranslational glycosylation occurs at four of five N-glycosylation sites (5.Berg-Fussman A. Grace M.E. Ioannou Y. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol.

This glycosylation is essential for the development of a catalytically active conformer, specifically with N-glycosylation of the first sequon (5.Berg-Fussman A. Grace M.E. Ioannou Y. Grabowski G.A.

The primary sequence does not provide clues to the tight membrane association of GCase, since typical hydrophobic transmembrane domains are not present in the mature sequence (7.Tsuji S.

The newly synthesized enzyme is trafficked to the lysosome via mannose 6-phosphate and oligosaccharide-independent pathways (8.Jonsson L.M. Murray G.J. Sorrell S.H. Strijland A. Aerts J.F. Ginns E.I.

Once resident in the lysosome, the enzyme has a half-life of ∼60 h in fibroblasts, and glycosylation is important to maintaining this survival (8.Jonsson L.M. Murray G.J. Sorrell S.H. Strijland A.

GCase cleaves a variety of glucosyl ceramides and synthetic β-glucosides using detergent or phospholipid-based systems for in vitro assays (for a review, see Ref. 2.Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3635-3668Google Scholar). The major natural substrate is the glycosphingolipid, glucosyl ceramide, with the deacylated analogue, glucosylsphingosine, being a minor, but pathologically important, substrate. GCase defects lead to accumulation of these substrates in a tissue-specific manner (2.Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3635-3668Google Scholar). GCase is a typical retaining β-glucosidase, whose catalytic cycle proceeds through a two-step reaction mechanism requiring glucosylation of the active site by substrate followed by deglucosylation with a release of β-glucose (11.Withers S.G.

The nucleophile in this active site function is Glu340, and the presumptive acid/base is Glu235 (14.Miao S. McCarter J. Tull D. Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Withers S.G. Aebersold R. J. Biol.

The O-glucosidic bond of substrates is protonated by the acid/base (Glu325) and is then attacked by the nucleophile (Glu340). Glucose becomes covalently attached, and the leaving group is removed. This is followed by deprotonation of water by the acid/base with attack of the enzyme-glucose complex by the liberated nucleophile and release of β-glucose. The enzyme requires membrane interfaces, with preference for negatively charged phospholipids, to enhance the in vitro enzyme activity from near zero in a completely delipidated form. The presence of a naturally occurring 80-amino acid activator protein, saposin C, has additional effects on the activity of the negatively charged phospholipid-activated GCase (18.Vaccaro A.M.

The exact activation mechanisms of the negatively charged phospholipids and/or saposin C remain to be determined, but the lipids appear to alter the enzyme into a catalytically active conformer that is receptive to the function of saposin C in vivo (19.Qi X. Qin W. Sun Y. Kondoh K. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6874-6880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20.Qi X. Grabowski G.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The genetic absence of saposin C leads to a deficiency of glucosyl ceramide cleavage and a Gaucher-like disease (24.Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25.Pampols T. Pineda M. Giros M.L. Ferrer I. Cusi V. Chabas A. Sanmarti F.X. Vanier M.T. Christomanou H. Acta Neuropathologica. 1999; 97: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). About 200 different point mutations encoding amino acid substitutions have been identified in patients with Gaucher disease, but few have been subjected to functional assessment (26.Sidransky E. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Many of these mutations seem obviously detrimental because the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be highly disruptive (e.g. large charge and/or side chain changes), whereas others do not (e.g. substitutions of two different branched-chain amino acids). Furthermore, the relationships of genotype to phenotype in Gaucher disease should be based on known disruptive functional changes derived from mutations. For example, highly disruptive mutations could produce more significant effects on catalytic function and/or enzyme instability, leading to more severe or progressive disease manifestations. Also, knowledge of the distribution of the mutations and their functional effects on catalytic or stability properties of GCase could have significant implications for the design and/or development of new therapeutic agents for enzyme, chaperone, or genic therapeutic approaches. The vast majority of point mutations occur as compound heterozygotes with two different mutant alleles expressed in the same cells, obviating the direct characterization of the specific GCase properties. Separation of these alleles in recombinant systems allows for in vitro characterization of these properties. Here, analyses of 42 point mutations identified in Gaucher disease patients, seven mutations of cysteine residues that are either involved in disulfide formation or are free, and three mutations of C-terminal histidines were conducted to gain insight into their effects on structure and function of GCase. These properties are correlated with the crystal structure of human GCase, along with comparisons of the properties of selected corresponding mutant mouse GCases to develop contextual insights into mutational effects. The following were from commercial sources: QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA); Bac-N-Blue transfection kit (Invitrogen); Sf9/Sf21 cells (BD Biosciences); SF900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen); spinner tanks (Fisher); dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine, Triton X-100, sodium azide, ammonium sulfate, sodium acetate, and enzyme grade sodium citrate (Sigma); protease inhibition mixture (mixture III; Calbiochem); octyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences); butanol, glycerol, and ethelene glycol (Fisher); fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences); 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (4MUG) (Biosynth AG); cathepsin D, sodium taurocholate, and conduritol B epoxide (CBE) (Calbiochem); brain phophatidylserine (Avanti); AP color developing kit and goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad); N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs); BCA protein concentration assay (Pierce); YM10 Microcons (Amicon/Millipore); and magnesium chloride heptahydrate (Acros Organics). Cerezyme was a gift from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit anti-human GCase (EC 3.2.1.45) was as described (27.Fabbro D. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 40: 15-31PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation Identification—The mutations were identified in genomic DNA from enzymatically confirmed Gaucher disease patients (i.e. those with defective acid GCase) from a variety of ethnic and demographic backgrounds. Two approaches were used with amplified genomic DNA: 1) exons alone were sequenced, or 2) the GCase genes were amplified by long range PCR and sequenced in their entireties. Sequences were analyzed by fluorescent labeling using the ABI capillary electrophoresis system. All sequence reads were verified by direct visualization following automatic base calls with Sequencher (GeneCodes; Ann Arbor, MI) or Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, Inc., State College, PA). Many of the patients were submitted through the ICGG (International Collaborative Gaucher Group) program for GCase DNA sequence analysis. The majority of samples did not have readily identifiable clinical information and/or were heteroallelic for GCase mutations. Available phenotypic information is provided in Table 1. The objective of this work was to verify the pathogenic nature of the mutation (i.e. the predicted amino acid substitution) and its effects on in vitro enzymatic function. Additional mutagenesis was conducted to evaluate the effects of specific amino acids (e.g. the seven cysteines). Serine was chosen as an isosteric substitution for cysteines 4, 16, 18, 23, 126, and 248. The first four cysteines participate in disulfide bonds as follows: Cys4-Cys16 and Cys18-Cys23. Cys126, Cys248, and Cys342 are free (see “Results”). C342G and C16S are naturally occurring mutations from Gaucher disease patients (28.Grace M.E. Desnick R.J. Pastores G.M. J. Clin.

The mutant enzymes, R495H, R496H, and R495H/R496H (a double mutant), were produced to evaluate the potential effects of the R495H substitution in the commercially available enzyme replacement product, Imiglucerase™, and the mutation found in Gaucher disease patients, R496H, compared with the wild-type Arg495/Arg496 enzyme, as determined by amino acid sequence analysis of the wild-type enzyme from human placenta (7.Tsuji S.

Pathol. 2003; 163: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were isolated, reverse transcribed, sequenced, and cloned into the Bac-N-Blue vectors for recombination into baculovirus (see below). All cDNAs were completely resequenced to ensure that no spurious mutations were introduced. The wild-type and mutant cDNAs were inserted into the baculovirus by homologous recombination using the Bac-N-Blue system. The individual viruses were amplified in and purified from Sf9 cells as described (31.Grace M.E. Graves P.N. Smith F.I. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6827-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. He G.-S. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2283-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GCases expressed from these cDNAs were obtained from media of Sf21 cells that had been adapted to serum/protein-free medium. Each GCase was partially purified by batch hydrophobic chromatography following n-butanol extraction as follows: 1) delipidation (n-butanol, 1:4, v/v), 2) batch binding to octyl-Sepharose (1:10, v/v), 3) step batch washing (2 bed volumes) with 50 mm phosphate, pH 5.8, containing 20 or 50% ethylene glycol; 4) GCase elution (100% ethylene glycol). All GCases had very similar purification properties requiring only minor modifications of the procedure. The only exception was the incorporation of protease inhibitor mixture III into the medium and butanol extraction steps for the Δ36, F397S, D409H, and D409V mutants, since they were rapidly digested without added mixture III by proteases released from Sf21 cells into the SF900II medium. Following hydrophobic chromatography, all GCases could be stored for up to 3 months without evidence of proteolytic digestion. The wild-type, N370S, V394L, D409H, and D409V mouse GCases were expressed and purified as above to evaluate the potential effects of multiple amino acid substitutions on GCase properties from different species. The comparative properties for these specific GCase variants were from Grace et al. (31.Grace M.E. Graves P.N. Smith F.I. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6827-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. He G.-S. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2283-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the properties of N370S were reverified here. Additional GCase sequences from other mammalian species (chimpanzee, orangutan, porcine, fugu, partial rat, mouse, honey bee, and Caenorhabditis elegans) were obtained from public data bases and aligned using DNASIS 3.7 (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., San Francisco, CA). The canine GCase cDNA sequence was determined from a clone isolated from a constructed cDNA library using canine brain total RNA (Lambda AP kit). Enzyme Purification and Crystallization—Wild-type GCase for crystallization was purified from Cerezyme™ to remove nonprotein components. During the conduct of these experiments, Sussman and co-workers (17.Premkumar L. Sawkar A.R. Boldin-Adamsky S. Toker L. Silman I. Kelly J.W. Futerman T. Sussman J.L. J. Biol.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) solved the GCase crystal structure at ∼2.0 Å level. Our crystal structure was highly similar, except that the active site region had greater resolution than that of Dvir et al. (33.Dvir H. Harel M. McCarthy A.A. Toker L. Silman I. Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The deglycosylation procedure developed here provides fully active GCase prior to crystallization. To achieve this, deglycosylated GCase was purified on octyl-Sepharose, and active fractions (70-90% ethylene glycol) were pooled and exchanged into 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, immediately before the crystallization. This allowed for recoveries of 85-93% of initial enzyme activity. In comparison, the exchange into MES, pH 6.6 (33.Dvir H. Harel M. McCarthy A.A. Toker L. Silman I. Futerman A.H. Sussman J.L. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 704-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), was shown in preliminary experiments to irreversibly inactivate GCase. Final protein concentration was estimated by BCA protein assays to be 10 mg/ml. Activities for GCase to be crystallized were determined with 4MUG (4 mm) as substrate in the presence of brain phosphatidylserine and purified recombinant human saposin C in 25 mm citrate, 50 mm phosphate, pH 5.5. Recombinant human saposin C was expressed and purified as described (34.Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of N-glycanase-treated GCase were obtained by vapor diffusion at room temperature. Relative Catalytic Activity—Comparisons of the catalytic activity, relative kcat, were determined by referencing to cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM) and expressed as CRIM specific activity (CRIM SA). This approach was needed, since the degree of purity of each GCase was not identical, but all activity toward the 4MUG substrate within each preparation was completely inhibitable by CBE, consistent with being a GCase. CRIM SA for each GCase variant was determined using immunoblots developed with anti-human GCase polyclonal antisera (27.Fabbro D. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 40: 15-31PubMed Google Scholar) and assuming equal reactivity of the GCase variants and wild-type GCase. Predetermined amounts of GCase activity were applied to SDS gels in amounts equivalent to standards of known masses of homogeneous human GCase (2.5, 5, and 10 ng). These amounts of GCase were known to provide readings in the linear range of the densitometer. The CRIM SA was determined from duplicates for each sample based on the standard curve densities. Wild-type and Mutant GCase Characterization—Immunoblot analyses were as described using rabbit anti-human GCase polyclonal antiserum produced against purified human placental GCase (27.Fabbro D. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 40: 15-31PubMed Google Scholar). The pH optimum profiles were developed using citrate/phosphate buffers over the range of pH values from 4.4 to 7.2. pKa values were estimated from a diprotic model and varied by ±0.3-0.6 pH units (n"

Although the molecular basis by which protein kinase A (PKA) regulates the stability of hedgehog downstream transcription factor cubitus interruptus, the Drosophila homologue of vertebrate Gli molecules, is well documented, the mechanism by which PKA inhibits the functions of Gli molecules in vertebrates remains elusive. Here, we report that activation of PKA retains Gli1 in the cytoplasm. Conversely, inhibition of PKA activity promotes nuclear accumulation of Gli1. Mutation analysis identifies Thr374 as a major PKA site determining Gli1 protein localization. In the three-dimensional structure, Thr374 resides adjacent to the basic residue cluster of the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Phosphorylation of this Thr residue is predicted to alter the local charge and consequently the NLS function. Indeed, mutation of this residue to Asp (Gli1/T374D) results in more cytoplasmic Gli1 whereas a mutation to Lys (Gli1/T374K) leads to more nuclear Gli1. Disruption of the NLS causes Gli1/T374K to be more cytoplasmic. We find that the change of Gli1 localization is correlated with the change of its transcriptional activity. These data provide evidence to support a model that PKA regulates Gli1 localization and its transcriptional activity, in part, through modulating the NLS function.

In Drosophila, SMO stabilization triggers complex formation with Costal-2, Fused, and Gli homologue cubitus interruptus (CI), which prevents CI degradation and formation of a transcriptional repressor (7Jia J.

PKA fulfills its negative role by phosphorylating full-length Ci (Ci155) at several Ser/Thr residues, priming it for further phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase I (CKI) (20Chen Y.

Hyperphosphorylation of Ci155 targets it for proteolytic processing to generate the repressor form (Ci75) (23Aza-Blanc P. Ramirez-Weber F.A. Laget M.P. Schwartz C. Kornberg T.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar).

Genetics. 2001; 158: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its inhibitory effects, PKA phosphorylation at the C terminus of SMO in Drosophila, but not in mammals, enhances hedgehog-mediated signaling (25Jia J. Tong C. Wang B. Luo L. Jiang J.

While the regulation of CI cleavage by PKA phosphorylation is well documented, very little is known about the role of PKA in Gli regulation. In vertebrates, there are three Gli molecules, Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3. Gli3 can be processed in a manner similar to CI, a process regulated by PKA (27Wang B. Fallon J.F. Beachy P.A.

The fact that Gli3 expression is often not detectable in human cancer suggests that Gli3 does not play a significant role in hedgehog-driven carcinogenesis (29Zhu Y. James R.M. Peter A. Lomas C.

Here, we report that the cAMP/PKA signaling axis regulates Gli1 protein localization, in part, through phosphorylation of Gli1 at a site near the nuclear localization signal (NLS). We propose that this unique regulation is an important mechanism by which PKA inhibits transcriptional activity of Gli molecules. Cell Culture and Plasmids—COS7 and NIH3T3 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (the ratio of plasmid (μg) to lipid (μl) was 1:2.5). Stable expression of a luciferase reporter under the control of Gli responsive elements in NIH3T3 cells was achieved through selection with G418 for 3 weeks after transient transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two clones with good responses to Gli1 expression (over 20-fold) were selected from a total of 80 clones. Cells with expression of Gli1 (with C-MYC tag) were treated with 10 μm H89 (Calbiochem) or 0.4 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB, Sigma) for 8 h. For forskolin treatment (20 μm for 8 h), cells were pretreated with phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (100 μm) for 30 min before addition of forskolin. Immunofluorescent detection of C-MYC-tagged Gli1 was performed as described previously with Cy3-conjugated MYC antibody 9e10 (Sigma) (1:100 dilution) (37Athar M. Li C. Tang X. Chi S. Zhang X. Kim A.L. Tyring S.K. Kopelovich L. Hebert J. Epstein Jr., E.H. Bickers D.R. Xie J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7545-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Gli1 localization was detected under a fluorescent microscope; the percentage of Gli1 in the nucleus or the cytoplasm was calculated for each experiment from over 200 Gli1-expressing cells, and the experiment was repeated three times. Gli1 cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein and cloned into pCDNA3.1 with a C-MYC tag at the N terminus. Gli1-GFP construct was made by subcloning Gli1 cDNA into pEGFP-3C using BamHI (5′) and NotI (3′) sites. Point mutations of Gli1 were made by in situ mutagenesis in our DNA Recombinant Laboratory Core Facility or by PCR-based mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the entire coding region. Clones containing only the targeted mutations were used in the studies. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed using Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer 48 h following Gli1 transfection. C-MYC-tagged Gli1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-MYC 9B11 antibody (Cell Signaling Inc.) for 3 h followed by incubation with A/G plus beads (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were divided into two portions. One portion (20%) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-MYC antibody 9B11. The remaining 80% of them were incubated with 0.6 ng of recombinant PKA catalytic subunit with ADBI buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithionthreitol) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reactions were terminated by adding 4× SDS sample buffer, and the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried on Whatman paper, followed by autoradiography. Western blotting analysis was performed according to a previously published procedure (37Athar M. Li C. Tang X. Chi S. Zhang X. Kim A.L. Tyring S.K. Kopelovich L. Hebert J. Epstein Jr., E.H. Bickers D.R. Xie J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7545-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cellular PKA Activation Assay—COS7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates the day before the experiment. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then treated with 20 μm H89, 20 μm forskolin or both for 45 min. 100 μm IBMX was added for 30 min prior to treatment with forskolin. Cellular PKA activity in the above-described conditions was determined using a PKA activation assay (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), in which Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) was used as the substrate (38Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were prepared using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After sonication, the cell lysates were collected at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. 10-μl cell lysates were incubated with 10 μm ATP containing 10μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol)], 250 μm Kemptide substrate in ADBI buffer at 30 °C for 10 min. Background was determined from reactions without substrate, and the total PKA activity was estimated in reactions containing 20 μm dibutyryl-cAMP. Aliquots were spotted onto Whatman P-81 paper, and the filters were washed in 0.75% phosphoric acid three times for 5 min per wash. 32P incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by a kit from Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad protein assay). Data are representative of three independent experiments. Cell Fractionation—Following transfection, the COS7 cells were maintained in 10 cm cell culture dishes for 48 h. Before harvest, the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline for each 10-cm dish, and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 s. One-fifth of the lysates were collected for detection of Gli1 expression by Western blotting. The cell pellets were incubated with 60 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml, 1 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/ml, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630). After 10 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet (containing the nuclei) was resuspended in buffer B (buffer A containing 1.0 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The purified nuclei (pellets) were incubated in 30 μl buffer C (10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml, 1 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 1 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/ml, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml) after vigorous vortex and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatant fractions were collected. All extracts were normalized for protein amounts determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE for further analysis (39He N. Li C. Zhang X. Sheng T. Chi S. Chen K. Wang Q. Vertrees R. Logrono R. Xie J. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 42: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Antibodies to β-tubulin (Sigma) and Lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used to detect the purity of cytoplasmic (β-tubulin) and nuclear (Lamin A/C) fractions using Western blotting analysis. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—For luciferase assay, NIH3T3 cells with stable expression of the Gli luciferase reporter were transfected with Gli1 constructs (0.5 μg/well) and the TK-Renilla control plasmid (5 ng/well) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 5 h, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium and the cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight. Following treatment with forskolin or other compounds, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, the transfected cells were lysed in the 6-well plates with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer and the lysate transferred into Eppendorf tubes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at top speed for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. 20 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of buffer LAR II, and the absorbance was immediately measured (the first reading). After 3 s, 100 μl of Stop & Glo ® Reagent was added to measure the Renillar luciferase activity (the second reading). The value from the first reading was divided by the value from the second reading of each sample to obtain the luciferase activity. Each experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Gli1 is not only a downstream effector but also a target gene of the hedgehog pathway (40Stecca B. Mas C. Ruiz i Altaba A. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 199-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of the mechanism by which PKA phosphorylation regulates Gli1 functions will help us understand signal transduction of the hedgehog pathway in cancer. First, we tested whether Gli1 protein localization can be altered by accumulation of the cellular cAMP level in COS7 cells. After transient transfection, the protein localization of Gli1 was detected by immunofluorescent staining of the C-MYC tag at the Gli1 N terminus and by cell fractionation. In the presence of 20 μm forskolin, which directly activates adenylyl cyclase and raises the cyclic AMP level (41Laurenza A. Sutkowski E.M. Seamon K.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 442-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we observed that the percentage of cytoplasmic Gli1 was increased over 5-fold, whereas the percentage of nuclear Gli1 was reduced by 80% (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect seems to be direct because the change in Gli1 localization can be observed 20 min after forskolin treatment. Conversely, addition of PKA inhibitor H89 led to a shift of Gli1 localization to the nucleus (Fig. 1, A and B). As a consequence of forskolin treatment, the cellular PKA activity was increased 2-fold (Fig. 1C). Conversely, addition of H89 into the medium inhibited the cellular PKA activity by 70% (Fig. 1C). Thus, Gli1 localization was correlated with the cellular PKA activity. To confirm the data from the immunofluorescent staining, we performed cell fractionation analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, more Gli1 were in the nuclear fraction following H89 treatment whereas forskolin caused an increase of cytoplasmic Gli1 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we monitored localization of Gli1-GFP fusion protein with a time-lapse microscope in the presence of H89 or forskolin. Forskolin retained Gli1-GFP in the cytoplasm whereas H89 promoted nuclear accumulation of this fusion protein (data not shown). All these data indicate that Gli1 localization can be regulated by modulating the cellular PKA activity. Gli1 protein shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm was interrupted by inhibition of nuclear export with LMB, a specific inhibitor for CRM1-mediated nuclear export, resulting in nuclear accumulation of all Gli1 proteins (Fig. 1, A and B), supporting that Gli1 localization is a dynamic process and is tightly regulated. Our data suggest that direct phosphorylation of Gli1 by PKA is responsible for regulation of Gli1 protein localization. Sequence analysis predicts five putative PKA sites in Gli1. The sequence around these PKA sites is highly conserved among Gli proteins (Fig. 2A). Several point mutations of Gli1 were made to test Gli1 regulation by PKA (see the diagram in Fig. 2B). These mutations were made by in situ mutagenesis in our DNA Recombinant Laboratory Core Facility or by PCR-based mutagenesis. Using these mutant constructs, we assessed Gli1 localization in cultured cells. We found that mutation at Thr374 (Gli1/T374V) significantly affects Gli1 localization (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the response of Gli1/T374V to forskolin treatment was nearly diminished (in response to forskolin treatment, 5-fold increase in cytoplasmic protein for wild type Gli1 but only 40% increase for Gli1/T374V) (also see the supplemental figure). In contrast, the protein localization of Gli1/S544G and Gli1/S544G/S560A was not different from the wild type Gli1 (supplemental figure). A mutant Gli1 (Gli1/T374V/S544G/S560A) with triple mutations at the PKA sites behaved like Gli1/T374V (supplemental figure), indicating that Ser544 and Ser560 are not involved in regulation of Gli1 localization. On the other hand, a mutation at S640A had only slight effects on Gli1 protein localization in response to forskolin (supplemental figure). These data indicate that Thr374 is the major site responsible for Gli1 protein localization in cultured cells. Consistent with the role of Thr374 for Gli1 protein localization, we also confirmed that Thr374 can be phosphorylated by recombinant PKA in vitro (Fig. 2D). We performed PKA phosphorylation with Gli1 protein purified by immunoprecipitation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant PKA in test tube and found that Gli1 was highly phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (Fig. 2D, left panels, first lane). Gli1 with mutations of all five PKA sites (PKAΔ) could not be phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 2D, left panels, right lane). To test whether the Thr374 site of Gli1 is phosophorylated by recombinant PKA, we used a Gli1 fragment containing only two PKA sites: Thr296 and Thr374. We found that this Gli1 fragment (1–514 aa) with a mutation at Thr374 was not able to be phosphorylated by recombinant PKA in vitro (Fig. 2D, center panels). Even a single point mutation at Thr374 significantly reduced PKA-mediated phosphorylation of full-length Gli1 (Fig. 2D, right panels), indicating that the Thr374 site is a major PKA site of Gli1 phosphorylation. In addition, our data also suggested that Ser544, Ser560, and Ser640 can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (data not shown here). The above data indicate that Thr374 is a major PKA site involved in regulation of Gli1 protein localization. In the three-dimensional structure, Thr374, together with the adjacent Asp375, is close to the first basic residue cluster (Arg380/Lys381/His382) of the bipartite motif (the classic NLS) in Gli1 (Fig. 3A) (42Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). It is known that protein phosphorylation at the residue next to the bipartite motif inhibits its binding affinity to importins, leading to reduced nuclear localization of the target protein (43Harreman M.T. Kline T.M. Milford H.G. Harben M.B. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20613-20621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We predict that phosphorylation of Thr374 will increase the local negative charge, leading to reduced NLS functions and accumulation of Gli1 in the cytoplasm. Indeed, Gli1/T374D was preferentially localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). Conversely, Gli1/T374K has a high local positive charge near the NLS, and we found that Gli1/T374K predominantly localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3B). Localization of these Gli1 proteins was further confirmed by cell fractionation (Fig. 3B). These data support our hypothesis that one mechanism by which the cellular PKA activity regulates Gli1 localization is through altering the local charge nearby the NLS of Gli1. If Gli1 nuclear localization is regulated by PKA phosphorylation through a NLS-dependent mechanism, disruption of the NLS should affect localization of these mutant Gli1 molecules. As shown in Fig. 3C, we found that Gli1/K381E, which is predicted to disrupt the NLS, was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm, confirming the role of NLS in Gli1 localization (12Wang Q.T. Holmgren R.A. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 5097-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Gli1/T374K localizes predominantly to the nucleus, additional mutation at K381 (K381E) retained Gli1/T374K to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C), suggesting that regulation of Gli1 localization by T374 phosphorylation requires the intact NLS. The ultimate effect of Gli1 is transcriptional activation of the downstream target genes. To assess whether Gli1 localization affects its transcriptional activity, we established stable expression of Gli1 luciferase reporter under the control of Gli responsive elements in NIH3T3 cells (13Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By measuring the reporter luciferase activity, we examined the association of Gli1 localization with its transcriptional activity (Fig. 3D). If Gli1/K381E remains preferentially in the cytoplasm, the transcriptional activity was low. In contrast, Gli1 with a defective NES (Gli1/L496V/L498V), which localizes predominantly in the nucleus, was more active (Fig. 3D). Thus, the Gli1 luciferase reporter activity in these cells is very sensitive to Gli1 localization. We examined the effects of forskolin to Gli1-mediated transcriptional activity in this NIH3T3 stable cell line. Like the wild type Gli1, Gli1/T374V can activate the Gli luciferase reporter (Fig. 3E). Consistent with its cytoplasmic localization, the luciferase activity in cells expressing the wild type Gli1 was reduced after forskolin treatment (Fig. 3E). In contrast, Gli1/T374V-mediated reporter gene activity was not affected by forskolin (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that Thr374 is an important PKA site responsible for PKA phosphorylation and for the transcriptional activity of Gli1. Based on these data, we proposed a mechanism by which the cAMP/PKA signaling axis mediates regulation of Gli1 localization. Gli1 enters the nucleus through a nuclear localization signal. With the accumulation of cAMP in the cell, Thr374 gets phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Thr374 will increase the local negative charge nearby the NLS, which results in inhibition of NLS function. Consequently, Gli1 is retained in the cytoplasm and is unable to activate the target genes. Since this Thr residue is highly conserved among Gli proteins, we anticipate that the same mechanism is applicable to PKA regulation of other Gli molecules. In our study, we provide direct evidence to support that the cAMP/PKA signaling axis regulates Gli1 protein localization primarily through a site at Thr374. Our data further indicate that PKA-mediated regulation of Gli1 localization is through Thr374, possibly through interfering with the NLS function. Although our studies demonstrated that Thr374 is a major site for PKA-mediated regulation of Gli1 localization (Figs. 2 and 3 and supplemental figure), mutation at this site did not completely abolish the effects of forskolin (supplemental figure). To identify an additional site required for this regulation, we made double and triple point mutations of Gli1 at the PKA sites (Fig. 2B). Our data indicate that mutations at Thr374 and Ser640 completely abolished the response to forskolin treatment, indicating that Ser640 is another site involving PKA-mediated regulation of Gli1 localization (supplemental figure). However, mutation at Ser640 alone had no effect on Gli1 protein localization and had only a slight effect in response to forskolin treatment, suggesting that Ser640 is not a primary site for Gli1 regulation. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that Gli1/S640E and Gli1/S640R, unlike Gli1/T374D and Gli1/T374K, did not alter Gli1 protein localization (data not shown here). Thus, we believe that additional structural information of Gli1 near the Ser640 region is required to understand the molecular mechanism by which PKA phosphorylation at Ser640 affects Gli1 localization. Further studies of Gli1 phosphorylation can be facilitated by measuring the stoichiometry of phosphorylation for Gli1. Currently, a large amount of purified Gli1 protein is not available, making it difficult to calculate the stoichiometry of phosphorylation for such a large protein (150 kDa for Gli1). This issue may be addressed in the future using highly purified Gli1 fragments from bacteria. In addition, our data indicate that Ser544 and Ser560 residues are not involved in regulation of Gli1 protein localization. It will be interesting to know how these two sites are involved in regulation of Gli1 functions. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2060467273,"Many lines of research implicate cyclooxygenase 2-derived prostaglandins in tumor growth and metastasis. More specifically, we have shown that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes cell proliferation and invasion through transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, initiates immune evasion through induction of decay accelerating factor, and transactivates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ, leading to increased polyp size and multiplicity. We continue to identify novel PGE2 target genes in colorectal carcinoma cells and report here that an immediate early gene, nuclear factor NR4A2 (Nurr1), is induced by PGE2 that in turn regulates cell death. Originally described as a critical dopaminergic neuron growth factor receptor, NR4A2 expression is rapidly but transiently induced by PGE2 in a cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent manner. NR4A2 binds to the cognate NBRE response element and enhances transcription of a reporter construct in colorectal carcinoma cells. Furthermore, NR4A2 expression is elevated in Apc-/+ mouse adenomas and its levels were further increased following PGE2 treatment. Human colorectal cancers relative to matched normal mucosa showed increased NR4A2 expression. Although not previously described in epithelial tissues, NR4A2 protein localizes to proliferating crypts of Apc-/+ mouse intestine. Finally, functional studies reveal that PGE2-mediated protection from apoptosis is completely inhibited by a dominant-negative NR4A2 construct. Building on previous reports from our group on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family of nuclear receptors, these most recent data suggest that NR4A2, a member of another family of nuclear receptors can stimulate progression of colorectal cancer downstream from cyclooxygenase 2-derived PGE2.

Med. 1993; 122: 518-523PubMed Google Scholar), can be generated from arachidonic acid by either COX-1 or COX-2. PGE2 signals by binding to four distinct G protein-coupled cell surface receptors (EP1–EP4): leading to increased calcium flux (EP1), increased (EP2 and -4) or decreased (EP3) cAMP levels all of which modulate downstream networks (20Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Our laboratory is actively investigating precisely which genes are regulated by PGE2 in colorectal cancer and during embryogenesis (21Cha Y.I. Kim S.H. Solnica-Krezel L. Dubois R.N. Dev. Biol. 2005; 282: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We now show that expression and activity of NR4A2, a nuclear receptor superfamily member, are induced in colorectal carcinoma cells by PGE2. Transcription factors in the nuclear receptor superfamily regulate gene expression upon ligand binding (22Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar, 23Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Well known steroid receptors including progestins, estrogens, androgens, glucocorticoids, and mineralcocorticoids comprise the type I group. Conversely, receptors of thyroid hormone, all-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic acid, and vitamin D3 (VDR) belong to the type II group. The orphan receptors comprise a third class for which physiologic ligands have yet to be identified. The type III group includes, among others, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and the NR4A family of receptors. The NR4A family includes three members: Nur77 (NGIF-B/NR4A1), Nurr1 (NOT/NR4A2), and Nor-1 (MINOR/NR4A3). NR4A can transactivate target genes through monomer binding of a consensus NBRE sequence (AAAGGTCA) or homodimer binding of the palindromic NurRE sequence (AAAT(G/A)(C/T)CA) (24Wilson T.E.

NR4A1 and NR4A2 have also been shown to heterodimerize with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) through DR5 elements in mediating retinoid signaling (27Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M.

Crystal structure and NMR data indicate that NR4A2 can function as a ligand-independent transcription factor because the putative ligand binding domain is occupied by several bulky hydrophobic side chains (29Wang Z.

Preliminary reports suggest a role for this family of receptors in rheumatoid arthritis and cancer through modulation of apoptosis (38Wu Q. Liu S. Ye X.F. Huang Z.W. Su W.J.

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). With regard to aromatase, our results may help explain another mechanism by which PGE2 regulates its expression in certain contexts. We seek a more complete understanding of the role of prostaglandins and downstream targets in epithelial biology, developmental biology, and colorectal carcinogenesis. We have identified key genes that are regulated by PGE2 in colorectal carcinoma cells. Here we present data suggesting that the nuclear receptor NR4A2 is regulated by PGE2 in colorectal cancer. This is the first demonstration that prostaglandins regulate this family of transcription factors in neoplastic cells. Ultimately, this novel observation may shed light on the precise role of PGE2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. Reagents—PGE2 was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). LY294002 and H-89 were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies to NR4A were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) (catalog number SC-990) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) (catalog number AF2156). β-Actin antiserum was obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—LS-174T, HT-29, LoVo, HCT-15, HCT-116, and SW480 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and HCA-7 cells were a generous gift from Susan Kirkland. These cells were maintained in McCoys 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells by TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Five μg of total RNA was fractionated with a MOPS/formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N1 membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following UV cross-linking, the blots were pre-hybridized for 30 min at 42 °C in Hybrisol I (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY), hybridized using 32P-labeled cDNA in the same buffer at 42 °C, and subjected to autoradiography. The 0.35-kb NR4A2 (NM_006186) probe was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers 5′-CACAGGTTGCAATGCGTTCG-3′ (sense: 1746–1765) and 5′-TCAATTATTGCTGGCGGTGG-3′ (antisense: 2089–2105). Quantitative Real-time PCR—cDNA for each RNA sample was synthesized in 20-μl reactions using the SuperScript First Strand synthesis system for reverse transcriptase-PCR (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers for PCR were designed using Primer3 software. The real-time PCR contained iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad), 50 ng of each primer, and 5 μl of 1/1000 diluted reverse transcriptase template in a 25-μl reaction volume. Amplification was carried out using the MyiQ Single Color Real-time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad), with incubation times of 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 63 °C for 30 s. Specificity of the amplification was checked by melt-curve analysis. Relative levels of mRNA expression were calculated according to the ΔΔCT method (BMC Biotechnol). Individual expression values were normalized by comparison with β-actin mRNA expression. Oligonucleotide sequences used were: human NR4A2 forward, 5′-GTCTCAGCTGCTCGACACG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTTTGCACTGTGCGCTTAAA-3′; mouse NR4A2 forward, 5′-GCTTACAGGTCCAACCCAGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-AATGCAGGAGAAGGCAGAAA-3′; β-ACTIN forward, 5′-AGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCA-3′. Western Blotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors from Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then separated on precast SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Expression Constructs—3xNBRE-Luc and Nurr1-pCMX constructs were kindly provided by Thomas Perlmann (Karolinska Institute, Sweden). Dominant-negative Nurr1 was generated through PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as published (39Lammi J. Huppunen J. Aarnisalo P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used: forward, 5′-CGAACTTGTGAGGGCGGCAAAGGTTTCTTTAACCGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCGGTTAAAGAAACCTTTGCCGCCCTCACAGGTGCG-3′. Following amplification of the Nurr1-pCMX construct using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), the PCR product was digested with DpnI enzyme and transformed into DH5α-competent cells. Each construct was sequence-verified before further evaluation. The C283G mutation disrupts Nurr1 binding to the NBRE (39Lammi J. Huppunen J. Aarnisalo P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assays, 1.3 × 105 LS-174T cells were cultured in a 12-well plate 24 h before transfection. The transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in serum-free media containing 100 ng of reporter plasmid and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-SV40 as an internal control following the manufacturer's protocol. This transfection mixture was added to cells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Prostaglandins and other reagents were added after 24 h and incubated for an additional 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Luminometer. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla values. Immunohistochemistry—Adult Apc-/+ mice were treated with PGE2 or vehicle for 7 weeks, as previously described (43Wang D. Wang H. Shi Q. Katkuri S. Walhi W. Desvergne B. Das S.K. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Tissue sections from intestine were stained as follows. After CO2 asphyxiation, the intestine was dissected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Paraffin sections (5 μm) were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated; the epitopes were revealed following treatment in a microwave oven. Once endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched, nonspecific immunoglobulins were blocked with normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat monoclonal antibody against NR4A2 at a dilution of 1:25 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Negative controls received no primary antibody. The Vectastain ABC peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for immunodection following the manufacturer's instructions, and immunolocalization was visualized with the peroxidase substrate 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. All results were verified by a blinded second independent observer. Apoptosis Assay—HCT-116 cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plate) were transfected with empty vector or a dominant-negative NR4A2 construct. 24 h after transfection the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with (10%) or without serum containing different concentrations of PGE2. FACS analysis was used to measure apoptotic cells using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D System). Briefly, the cells were harvested, washed, and then incubated with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide followed by FACS analysis. This method allows the identification of different apoptotic cell populations: early apoptotic cells (annexin V-FITC positive), late apoptotic cells (annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide positive), necrotic cells (propidium iodide positive), and viable cells (both negative). Human Colorectal Tissue Samples—Human colorectal tumor specimens were obtained from surgical resections with Vanderbilt Internal Review Board approval. For each tumor sample, matched adjacent normal mucosa was collected for comparison. All samples were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Tissue RNA was prepared with TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) as described above. Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was performed at least three times and data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by paired Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. PGE2 Induces NR4A2 mRNA and Protein Expression in Colorectal Carcinoma Cells—To identify potential target genes for PGE2 in colorectal cancer, we performed microarray analysis on LS-174T cells treated with PGE2 (1 μm) at different time points. PGE2 appears to regulate several transcription factors, including an immediate early gene, NR4A2. In confirmation of the microarray results, Northern blot analysis revealed that PGE2 rapidly induces NR4A2 expression (Fig. 1A). Upon further investigation, PGE2 induces NR4A2 in other colon carcinoma cell lines as well, with the greatest response observed in LS-174T and LoVo cells (Fig. 1B). Because NR4A2 induction is most dramatic in LS-174T cells, subsequent experiments focused on this model system. LS-174T cells were originally isolated from a mucinous adenocarcinoma derived from a well differentiated goblet cell lineage. Quantitative real-time PCR assays and immunoblotting was utilized to determine the kinetics of NR4A2 induction. NR4A2 mRNA induction is strong but transient, with its levels peaking at 1 h (Fig. 1C). At the protein level, NR4A2 expression peaks at 2 h (Fig. 1D) as expected from the temporal pattern seen with changes in RNA expression. PGE2 induction of NR4A2 is dose-dependent, and the effect is observed at very low levels of PGE2, indicating that a receptor mediated process is likely involved (Fig. 1, E and F). PGE2-induced NR4A2 Activates NBRE—Like other nuclear receptors, NR4A family members activate target genes through direct interaction with specific promoter-derived cis-response elements. NR4A2 binds the consensus NBRE site (AAAGGTCA) as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer, which is found in the promoter region of genes that are regulated by this nuclear receptor. Thus, we determined whether PGE2-induced NR4A2 can bind and activate a 3xNBRE reporter gene construct using transient transfection assays. PGE2 induction of NR4A2 increased luciferase expression by 5-fold via binding the NBRE sites (Fig. 2A). This experiment evaluated different concentrations of PGE2 and found that activation of NBRE mirrors the increases we observe in NR4A2 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2B). PGE2 Regulates NR4A2 Expression and Activity in a cAMP/Protein Kinase A (PKA)-dependent Manner—Four G protein-coupled receptors mediate PGE2 action on target cells via distinct second messenger pathways (EP1–EP4). Upon ligand binding these receptors activate several downstream signaling cascades including the epidermal growth factor receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt, Src, and PKA. To elucidate the specific mechanism by which PGE2 induces NR4A2 expression, we employed several inhibitors to identify which signaling pathways mediate PGE2 regulation of NR4A2. Induction of NR4A2 RNA and protein by PGE2 is completely blocked by H-89, a selective inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, PKA (Fig. 3, A and B). These results were further corroborated at a functional level: inhibition of NR4A2 expression by treatment with H-89 also blocks NBRE activation (Fig. 3C). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PGE2 induces NR4A2 expression and activity in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner. PGE2 Can Block Apoptosis Through NR4A2—Cancer cells must evolve to survive in a hostile environment. These hardy clones can modulate gene expression by blocking pathways that promote programmed cell death. We have shown previously that 24-h serum starvation (24 h) of LS-174T cells consistently induces apoptosis by 4–5-fold (assessed by FACS analysis). Significantly, treatment with PGE2 can rescue cells from undergoing programmed cell death (43Wang D. Wang H. Shi Q. Katkuri S. Walhi W. Desvergne B. Das S.K. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for this observation has not been well elucidated. Here we provide the first data that NR4A2 is an important mediator of this “anti-apoptotic” effect. We transfected cells with the dominant-negative NR4A2 construct and then added increasing amounts of PGE2 following serum starvation. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, cells transfected with dominant-negative NR4A2 were not protected from undergoing apoptosis following PGE2 treatment. These experiments were also replicated with multiple stable clones expressing empty vector or dominant-negative NR4A2 (data not shown). To further examine the molecular mechanism by which PGE2-induced NR4A2 protects cells from apoptosis, we analyzed whole cell lysates for caspase-3. Whereas PGE2 blocks caspase-3 cleavage upon serum starvation, introduction of dominant-negative NR4A2 abrogates this effect (Fig. 4C). A recent report (44Ke N. Claassen G. Yu D.H. Albers A. Fan W. Tan P. Grifman M. Hu X. Defife K. Nguy V. Meyhack B. Brachat A. Wong-Staal F. Li Q.X. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8208-8212Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) also indicated that NR4A2 is involved in cell transformation and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells (HeLa), where the authors employed the use of NR4A2 small interfering RNA to inhibit its expression. NR4A2 Expression Is Increased in Colorectal Cancer—Increased expression of COX-2 has been associated with poor prognosis in several different types of malignancies, including colorectal cancer (45Ladetto M. Vallet S. Trojan A. Dell'Aquila M. Monitillo L. Rosato R. Santo L. Drandi D. Bertola A. Falco P. Cavallo F. Ricca I. De Marco F. Mantoan B. Bode-Lesniewska B. Pagliano G. Francese R. Rocci A.

Cancer. 2005; 15: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PGE2 is the most abundant bioactive lipid in this setting (19Rigas B. Goldman I.S. Levine L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 518-523PubMed Google Scholar). Because PGE2 was found to induce NR4A2 expression in cultured cells, we sought to determine whether COX-2 expression and NR4A2 expression correlate in vivo. Analysis of 15 week-old Apc-/+ mouse adenomas revealed elevated levels of NR4A2 mRNA and protein, whereas intestinal mucosa with a microscopically normal appearance exhibited little expression (Fig. 6A). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that NR4A2 is expressed in intestinal epithelia. Consistent with a role in tumorigenesis, NR4A2 is strongly expressed in the proliferative crypt compartment, where expression is localized to the same region as that of Ki67 (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5NR4A2 expression in vivo. Examination of NR4A2 immunoreactivity in small intestinal tissues of Apc-/+ mice. Tissue sections were stained with goat anti-NR4A2 primary antibody and counterstained with hematoxylin.

NC, negative control (no primary antibody).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further analyze the role of PGE2-induced NR4A2 in vivo, mice were treated with PGE2 of vehicle for 7 weeks and then intestinal tissues were evaluated for NR4A2 expression levels by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemistry of tissue sections revealed increased NR4A2 expression in the intestine following PGE2 treatment (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, quantitative PCR analysis indicates that PGE2 treatment leads to increased NR4A2 transcript levels in colonic mucosa (Fig. 6C). These data support the hypothesis that NR4A2 is induced by PGE2 in vivo. Finally, to extend our in vivo studies and assess the clinical relevance of these observations, we examined NR4A2 levels in human colorectal carcinomas. Comparison of 16 paired human colon cancers and matched normal tissue demonstrates increased expression of NR4A2 in malignant tissue relative to normal colonic mucosa (Fig. 6B). These data support the hypothesis that NR4A2 is induced in colorectal cancer, a setting known to involve elevated levels of PGE2. The inducible cyclooxygenase isoenzyme, COX-2, is overexpressed in many cancers, with concomitant overproduction of PGE2. Some cancers, such as ovarian cancer (48Gupta R.A. Tejada L.V. Tong B.J. Das S.K. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar), seem to have increased levels of the COX-1 enzyme but the common denominator in these situations is an overall increase in PGE2 production. A large body of evidence indicates a 40–50% reduction in colorectal cancer in individuals taking non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs regularly. These effects are due, at least in part, to inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes and decreased production of PGE2. Whereas it is known that elevated levels of PGE2 contribute to carcinogenesis, the downstream effector genes in this pathway are not well characterized. We sought to increase our understanding of the role of PGE2 in epithelial biology and carcinogenesis by identifying PGE2-regulated genes in colorectal cancer. COX-2-derived PGE2 regulates critical pro-survival and anti-apoptotic factors that allow for tumor growth. Our group originally identified Bcl-2 as a downstream effector of increased COX-2 expression in rat intestinal epithelial cells (49Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). In this article, we identify NR4A2, a nuclear hormone receptor belonging to the NGIF family, as a PGE2-regulated gene in colorectal cancer. Originally identified as a critical neurotrophic receptor in the mesencephalon, NR4A2 is implicated in Parkinson disease and other central nervous system pathologic processes. Because of the high expression levels in specific regions of the brain, the majority of NR4A studies examine its role in the central nervous system. Only recently have studies on the function of these receptors in other situations been undertaken. Data presented here provide the first evidence that PGE2 can drive expression of this neurotrophic nuclear receptor in intestinal epithelial cells. Using a variety of methods, in this study, we provide the first evidence that PGE2 can induce NR4A2 in colorectal carcinoma cells via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway. Moreover, evidence from functional studies indicates that NR4A2 is important for PGE2-mediated regulation of apoptosis by blocking cleavage of caspase-3. Intestinal epithelium from Apc-/+ mouse adenomas and sporadic colorectal carcinomas exhibit increased NR4A2 expression relative to matched normal mucosa. Finally, treatment of Apc-/+ mice with PGE2 resulted in increased levels of NR4A2 mRNA and protein. A wide range of growth factors and cytokines are known to induce NR4A2 gene expression. These include vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, parathyroid hormone, corticotrophin releasing hormone, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β (50McEvoy A.N.

In this report we demonstrate that PGE2 induces NR4A2 in colon cancer cells and plays a significant role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of PGE2. Future studies will continue to yield greater insight into the effector genes that mediate tumorigenesis downstream of COX-2-derived PGE2. A better understanding of this process may reveal new strategies for the treatment and/or prevention of colorectal cancer. Evasion of apoptosis is a critical requirement for tumor progression. Building on previous reports from our group on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family of nuclear receptors, these most recent data suggest a novel mechanism by which COX-2-derived PGE2 protects carcinoma cells from apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2161682325,"Protein kinase C (PKC) family members are allosterically activated following membrane recruitment by specific membrane-targeting modules. Conventional PKC isozymes are recruited to membranes by two such modules: a C1 domain, which binds diacylglycerol (DAG), and a C2 domain, which is a Ca2+-triggered phospholipid-binding module. In contrast, novel PKC isozymes respond only to DAG, despite the presence of a C2 domain. Here, we address the molecular mechanism of membrane recruitment of the novel isozyme PKCδ. We show that PKCδ and a conventional isozyme, PKCβII, bind membranes with comparable affinities. However, dissection of the contribution of individual domains to this binding revealed that, although the C2 domain is a major determinant in driving the interaction of PKCβII with membranes, the C2 domain of PKCδ does not bind membranes. Instead, the C1B domain is the determinant that drives the interaction of PKCδ with membranes. The C2 domain also does not play any detectable role in the activity or subcellular location of PKCδ in cells; in vivo imaging studies revealed that deletion of the C2 domain does not affect the stimulus-dependent translocation or activity of PKCδ. Thus, the increased affinity of the C1 domain of PKCδ allows this isozyme to respond to DAG alone, whereas conventional PKC isozymes require the coordinated action of Ca2+ binding to the C2 domain and DAG binding to the C1 domain for activation."

At high temperature ( T &gt; 500 kelvin), some silicon was reduced, and the pressure stability of quartz was expanded, attesting to the substitution of some xenon for silicon.

https://openalex.org/W2162495487,"Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Studies in patient cells, mouse knockout animals, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae models have suggested several hypotheses on the frataxin function, but the full physiology of frataxin in mitochondria has not been well established yet. We have characterized the genomic structure of frh-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans frataxin gene, and we have developed a transient knockdown model of C. elegans frataxin deficiency by RNA interference. frh-1(RNAi) worms show a consistent pleiotropic phenotype that includes slow growth, lethargic behavior, egg laying defects, reduced brood size, abnormal pharyngeal pumping, and altered defecation. Lifespan is significantly reduced, and worms have increased sensitivity to oxidative stress that, in turn, might explain the reduction of longevity of the worms. We also demonstrate synthetic genetic interaction between frh-1 and mev-1, the gene encoding the succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b subunit of complex II in mitochondria, suggesting a possible role of the C. elegans frataxin in the electron transport chain; thus, the respiratory chain might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. We propose that this C. elegans model may be a useful biological tool for drug screening in Friedreich ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2023382624,"The HMGA1a protein belongs to the high mobility group A (HMGA) family of architectural nuclear factors, a group of proteins that plays an important role in chromatin dynamics. HMGA proteins are multifunctional factors that associate both with DNA and nuclear proteins that have been involved in several nuclear processes, such as transcriptional regulation, viral integration, DNA repair, RNA processing, and chromatin remodeling. The activity of HMGA proteins is finely modulated by a variety of post-translational modifications. Arginine methylation was recently demonstrated to occur on HMGA1a protein, and it correlates with the apoptotic process and neoplastic progression. Methyltransferases responsible for these modifications are unknown. Here we show that the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 specifically methylates HMGA1a protein both in vitro and in vivo. By mass spectrometry, the sites of methylation were unambiguously mapped to Arg57 and Arg59, two residues which are embedded in the second AT-hook, a region critical for both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions and whose modification may cause profound alterations in the HMGA network.

HMGA1a and HMGA1b are constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 at the two or three serine residues of the C-terminal end (16.Ferranti P. Malorni A. Marino G. Pucci P. Goodwin G.H.

Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation by p34/cdc2 kinase has been detected on Thr52 and Thr77 (numbers refer to human HMGA1a) residues, flanking the second AT-hook and shown to cause a strong decrease in the DNA-binding affinity (17.Nissen M.S.

Likewise p34/cdc2, phosphorylation by protein kinase C on Thr20, Ser43, and Ser63 caused a significant reduction of DNA-binding affinity (13.Banks G.C. Li Y. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Acetylation of Lys64 and Lys70 are critical for the stability of the enhanceosome assembled on the IFN-β gene (19.Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D.

In particular, acetylation of Lys70 by p300 CBP-associated factor (PCAF)/GCN5 results in the stabilization, whereas that of Lys64 by p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) causes destabilization of the enhanceosome.

Arg25 within the first AT-hook of HMGA1a has been found methylated (monomethylated) in tumor cell lines, reaching in some samples up to 50% of total HMGA1a protein content. Methylation on this residue is modulated during the apoptotic process reaching highest levels at later stages, with the formation of apoptotic bodies (14.Diana F. Sgarra R. Manfioletti G. Rustighi A.

More recently, dimethylation on the same Arg25 residue has been reported by another group (21.Zou Y. Wang Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6293-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An extensive study on both HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins reported a high level of PTMs, and in particular, dimethylation of arginine and lysine residues was increased in breast cancer cells with higher metastatic potential (9.Edberg D.D.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11500-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data lead authors to suggest the existence of a PTM “code” for HMGA proteins similar to that reported for histones (10.Edberg D.D. Bruce J.E. Siems W.F. Reeves R.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3575-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the kinases and acetyltransferases that are able to modify HMGA proteins have been identified, enzymes responsible for arginine and lysine methylation are just starting to be discovered (22.Miranda T.B. Webb K.J. Edberg D.D. Reeves R. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Protein (lysine and arginine) methylation is an emerging type of PTM that has added a new dimension to the signal transduction field (23.Lee D.Y.

Kouzarides T. Nature. 2005; 436: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), in HMGA proteins, arginine methylation seems particularly relevant (9.Edberg D.D. Adkins J.N. Springer D.L.

Arginine methylation has been implicated in signal transduction, RNA metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair (23.Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr.

Arginine residues are methylated by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). To date, two distinct PRMT activities have been found in mammalian cells; both types catalyze the formation of ω-NG-monomethyl arginine as an intermediate. Type I PRMT activity is defined by the formation of asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine residues, whereas type II activity is defined by the formation of symmetric ω-NG,N′G-dimethylarginine residues. Currently, known type I enzymes include PRMT1, PRMT3, coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1)/PRMT4, PRMT6, and PRMT8 (24.Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). No activity has been demonstrated for PRMT2 (26.Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C.

PRMT6 has been recently identified as a type I PRMT enzyme with an exclusive nuclear localization (31.Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). PRMT6 in vivo cellular substrates are unknown. In fact, if we exclude its automethylation activity, the only substrate identified so far is the viral Tat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protein (32.Boulanger M.C. Liang C. Russell R.S. Lin R. Bedford M.T. Wainberg M.A. Richard S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Tat-modified Arg residues have not been identified; thus its substrate specificity remains unknown. We report that PRMT6 methylates HMGA1a at the level of Arg57 and Arg59 within the second AT-hook domain. This is a critical region for HMGA1a function, which has been shown to have the highest affinity for DNA binding and also to be involved in protein-protein interaction, thus implying an important role for arginine methylation in modulating HMGA functions. In addition, this study, identifying the residues modified by PRMT6, lays down the basis for future studies aimed at establishing a consensus for its substrate specificity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Plasmids pARHMGA1a, pARHMGA1a-(1–80), pARHMGA1a-(1–52), pARHMGA1a-(35–107), pARHMGA1a-(46–107) expressing the wild-type and deletion mutants of human HMGA1a proteins were generated by PCR using the human HMGA1a cDNA as the template. The primers used for expression vector construction were as follows: A5–1, 5′-AGG AGA TAT ACA TAT GAG TGA GTC GAG CT-3′; A5–35, 5′-GCA AGC AGC ATA TGG TGA GTC CCG GGA CA; A5–46, 5′-TGG TAG GGC ATA TGA AGG AGC CCA GCG A-3′; A3–107, 5′-GCA GCC CGG ATC CTT ATC ACT GCT CCT CCT C-3′; A3–80, 5′-GGG TCT GCC GGA TCC TTA TCA TCC TGG AGT TGT-3′; and A3–52, 5′-GCC CCG AGG GGA TCC TTA TCA TGG CAC TTC GCT-3′. The PCR products for deletion constructs at the C terminus were obtained using primer A5–1 in combination with the different A3 primers, whereas products for deletion constructs at the N terminus were obtained using A5–35 and A5–46 in combination with A3–107. The PCR products were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the bacterial expression vector pAR3038 under the bacteriophage T7 promoter. The resulting clones were verified by sequencing. Plasmids pARHMGA1aR25A, pARHMGA1aR57A, pARHMGA1aR59A, pARHMGA1aR57A,R59A were obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene. The mutagenesis was performed via standard Stratagene protocol using as template the pARHMGA1a plasmid, except for pARHMGA1aR57A,R59A in which the template used was pARHMGA1aR59A, and using the following primers: R5759A (forward), 5′-CAC CTA AGA GAC CTG CGG GCG CAC CAA AGG-3′; R5759A (reverse), 5′-CCT TTG GTG CGC CCG CAG GTC TCT TAG GTG-3′; R57A (forward), 5′-CAC CTA AGA GAC CTG CGG GCC GAC CAA AGG-3′; R57A (reverse), 5′-CCT TTG GTC GGC CCG CAG GTC TCT TAG GTG-3′; R59A (forward), 5′-GAG ACC TCG GGG CGC ACC AAA GGG AAG C-3′; R59A (reverse), 5′-GCT TCC CTT TGG TGC GCC CCG AGG TCT C-3′; R25A (forward), 5′-AGA AGC GGG GCG CGG GCA GGC CGC-3′; R25A (reverse), 5′-GCG GCC TGC CCG CGC CCC GCT TCT-3′. Plasmids pcDNA3HA-PRMT6 and pcDNA3HA-PRMT1, expressing proteins in-frame with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, were obtained by cloning the open reading frames of PRMT6-GFP and PRMT1-GFP (31.Frankel A.

Plasmid pcDNA3HA-HMGA1a was obtained via subcloning using BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites from pcDNAI-HMGA1a (a gift of Dr. Thanos, Alexander Fleming Biomedical Sciences Research Cener, Vari, Greece), whereas the vector pcDNA3HA-nucleophosmin (NPM) was obtained via PCR from the PINCO-HA-NPM retroviral vector (a gift of Dr. Pelicci European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) using the following primers including the BamHI/NotI sites: NPM (forward), 5′-GGC AGG GAT CCA TGG AAG ATT CGA T-3′ and NPM (reverse), 5′-TTA AAG CGG CCG CTT AAA GAG ACT TCC-3′ in the corresponding sites of pcDNA3HA. The plasmids pGEX6P1-PABP1 and pGEX2T-GAR, expressing the poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) and a protein arginine methyltransferase substrate composed of the first 148 amino acids (glycine arginine-rich domain) of the human fibrillarin protein (both in fusion with the glutathione S-transferase (GST)) have been described previously (33.Lee J.

HMGA1a-(45–75) was a degradation product obtained during the preparation of HMGA1a-(45–106). GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as already described (31.Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J.

Mass values are reported as Da ± 1. To identify the methylation sites, 10 μg of PRMT6-methylated HMGA1a were digested with 0.5 μg of Endoproteinase Lys-C sequencing grade (Roche Applied Science) for 18 h at 37 °C. HMGA1a fragments were analyzed by LC-MS as previously described (14.Diana F. Sgarra R. Manfioletti G. Rustighi A. Poletto D. Sciortino M.T. Mastino A. Giancotti V. J. Biol.

All the LC-MS analyses performed with the API 1 mass spectrometer were carried out splitting the flow outside the chromatographic column allowing in this way to both record mass spectra and collect protein/peptide fractions for subsequent analyses. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) measurements were performed on a Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) equipped with a Z-spray nanoflow electrospray ionization interface. Mass spectra of the peptide digests of HMGA1a were acquired using the nano-electrospray source operating at capillary, cone, and extractor voltages of 1400, 30, and 1 V, respectively (positive ion mode). For the MS analyses, samples were dissolved in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile:water containing 1% formic acid. Nanoelectrospray ionization capillaries were prepared in-house from borosilicate glass tubes of 1 mm outer diameter and 0.78 mm inner diameter (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) using a Flaming/Brown P-80 PC micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Hercules, CA) and gold coated using an Edwards S-150B sputter coater (Edwards High Vacuum, West Sussex, UK). MS/MS analyses of the peptide-(55–61) and its methylated forms were performed utilizing the same parameters of the MS instrument as above, using argon as the collision gas and a collision energy setting of 18 V. Instrument control and data acquisition and processing were achieved using the MassLynx software (Micromass, UK). The relative ratio of the monomethylated peptides was calculated as the ratio between the relative peak intensity of the monomethylated peptide (1-Me) and the relative peak intensity of the unmethylated (0-Me) plus the monomethylated peptide (0-Me + 1-Me). Peptide relative intensity ratio = 1-Me/(0-Me + 1-Me).Blot Overlay—Blot overlay experiments were performed essentially as previously described (8.Sgarra R. Tessari M.A. Di Bernardo J. Rustighi A.

Subconfluent HEK293 cells seeded on 100 mm-diameter Petri dishes were transfected with pcDNA3HA, pcDNA3HA-PRMT6, or pcDNA3HA-NPM by the conventional calcium phosphate procedure. Thirty-six hours later, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysis was performed at 4 °C for 20 min. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation and utilized as probes in the blot overlay experiments. Blot overlay membranes were incubated with an α-HA primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and bound primary antibodies visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Co-immunoprecipitation—Subconfluent HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated vector as described above and immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (36.Tessari M.A. Gostissa M.

Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cell lysates were quantified using a standard Bradford method and 1 mg incubated with 8 mg of α-HA primary antibody (Sigma) prebound to 50 ml of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were then washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were solubilized by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were performed by standard procedures with an anti-HA primary antibody (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence visualization. Radioactivity ([35S]methionine and methyl-3H) was visualized by fluorography; membranes were soaked in NAMP100 Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), air dried, and exposed to films at –80 °C for two months.RESULTSHMGA1a Is a Substrate of PRMT6—HMGA1a protein is methylated at the level of several arginine residues (9.Edberg D.D.

Because methyltransferases responsible for this post-translational modification were completely unknown, we decided to screen arginine methyltransferases for their ability to methylate HMGA1a. To this aim, pure recombinant HMGA1a protein, together with its isoform HMGA1b and the highly related HMGA2, were incubated with the different recombinant PRMTs in the presence of 3H-labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine ([3H]AdoMet) as a methyl donor. Methylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. All of the PRMTs (PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT4, PRMT6, and PRMT7) that maintain their enzymatic activity as recombinant proteins were tested. Fig. 1 clearly shows that PRMT6 is the only arginine methyltransferase that is able to efficiently methylate HMGA1a and also the other HMGA proteins. Interestingly, PRMT6 has an exclusive nuclear localization. Among the other methyltransferases tested, only PRMT1 and PRMT3 were able to weakly methylate HMGA2 (but not HMGA1a and HMGA1b). Recombinant GST-GAR was included as a positive control for PRMT1, PRMT3, and PRMT6, whereas GST-PABP1 is the positive control for PRMT4 (31.Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S.

https://openalex.org/W2102565765,"As an essential protease in the generation of amyloid beta, gamma-secretase is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Although a great deal of progress has been made in identifying the components of gamma-secretase complex, the endogenous regulatory mechanism of gamma-secretase is unknown. Here we show that gamma-secretase is endogenously regulated via extracellular signal regulated MAP kinase (ERK) 1/2-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The inhibition of ERK1/2 activity, either by a treatment with a MEK inhibitor or an ERK knockdown transfection, dramatically increased gamma-secretase activity in several different cell types. JNK or p38 kinase inhibitors had little effect, indicating that the effect is specific to ERK1/2-dependent MAPK pathway. Conversely, increased ERK1/2 activity, by adding purified active ERK1/2 or EGF-induced activation of ERK1/2, significantly reduced gamma-secretase activity, demonstrating down-regulation of gamma-secretase activity by ERK1/2. Whereas gamma-secretase expression was not affected by ERK1/2, its activity was enhanced by phosphatase treatment, indicating that ERK1/2 regulates gamma-secretase activity by altering the pattern of phophorylation. Among the components of isolated gamma-secretase complex, only nicastrin was phosphorylated by ERK1/2, and it precipitated with ERK1/2 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, which suggests binding between ERK1/2 and nicastrin. Our results show that ERK1/2 is an endogenous regulator of gamma-secretase, which raises the possibility that ERK1/2 down-regulates gamma-secretase activity by directly phosphorylating nicastrin."

The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and its homolog neuronal WASP (N-WASP) are effectors of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and provide a direct link between activated membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton. WASP and N-WASP are also regulated by a large number of other activators, including protein-tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositides, and Src homology 3-containing adaptor proteins, and can therefore serve as signal integrators inside cells. Here we show that Cdc42 and the Src family kinase Lck cooperate at two levels to enhance WASP activation. First, autoinhibition in N-WASP decreases the efficiency (kcat/Km) of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the GTPase binding domain by 30- and 40-fold, respectively, and this effect is largely reversed by Cdc42. Second, Cdc42 and the Src homology 3-Src homology 2 module of Lck cooperatively stimulate the activity of phosphorylated WASP, with coupling energy of ∼2.4 kcal/mol between the two activators. These combined effects provide mechanisms for high specificity in WASP activation by coincident GTPase and kinase signals.

Cells respond to the environment through the expression of transmembrane receptors that sense extracellular stimuli and activate an elaborate network of intracellular signaling molecules. Given the large number of different signaling molecules and the complex relationships between them, a major challenge is to understand how specific signals generate unique responses. The architecture of signaling networks plays an important role in achieving signaling specificity (1Wuchty S. Oltvai Z.N. Barabasi A.L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The logical AND gate is a motif frequently found in such architectures. In a simple form, an AND gate is a molecule that requires two signaling inputs in order to generate an output (i.e. a molecule that responds in highly cooperative fashion to two binding partners). Although there are many examples of signaling molecules that are thought to behave in this fashion, quantitative input-output relationships have been measured in relatively few cases.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) 3The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; N-WASP, neuronal WASP; GBD, GTPase binding domain; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3, respectively; GMP-PCP, guanylyl β,γ-methylenediphosphonate. 3The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; N-WASP, neuronal WASP; GBD, GTPase binding domain; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; SH2 and SH3, Src homology 2 and 3, respectively; GMP-PCP, guanylyl β,γ-methylenediphosphonate. is an important actin regulatory molecule that responds to multiple stimuli. In the absence of activators, WASP exists in an autoinhibited conformation, where its GTPase binding domain (GBD) interacts with its C-terminal VCA (verprolin homology, central hydrophobic region, and acidic region) domain, sequestering residues in the latter required for activation of the actin nucleating machine, Arp2/3 complex (2Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 3Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In its GTP-bound form, the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 activates WASP by binding to the GBD and disrupting its interactions with VCA, leading to exposure of the C region and activation of Arp2/3 complex (4Panchal S.C. Kaiser D.A. Torres E. Pollard T.D. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A basic region N-terminal to the GBD also contributes to autoinhibition, either by stabilizing GBD-VCA interactions directly in WASP or by cooperatively stabilizing an inactive assembly with Arp2/3 complex in the case of N-WASP (5Leung D.W. Rosen M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5685-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). PIP2 is thought to activate N-WASP by binding the basic region and disrupting the inhibitory basic region-Arp2/3 complex interactions, destabilizing the inactive assembly (7Papayannopoulos V. Co C.

The Cdc42-binding, PIP2-binding and autoinhibitory equilibria in N-WASP are strongly coupled, such that the GTPase and lipid can activate with substantial cooperativity (6Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A.

Of these, Nck can act cooperatively with PIP2, and Grb2 can act cooperatively with Cdc42 to stimulate N-WASP activity (6Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A.

Although many activators have been identified, the molecular mechanisms by which most of these function are not well understood; nor are the mechanisms of cooperativity between them.WASP/N-WASP can be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases at a single position, Tyr291/Tyr256, respectively, in a variety of cell types in response to different stimuli. These include responses to collagen stimulation of platelets, IgE activation of mast cells, stimulation of B cells by receptor cross-linking, NGF treatment of PC12 cells, and stimulation of T cells using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (13Guinamard R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45115-45121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Where examined, phosphorylation has been suggested to have functional relevance. In PC12 cells, blocking phosphorylation with a selective Src family kinase inhibitor prevents N-WASP-mediated neurite outgrowth (15Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In T cells, overexpression of a Y291F mutant of WASP severely impairs activation in response to T cell receptor stimulation, a process in which WASP is believed to play an important role (18Badour K. Zhang J. Shi F. Leng Y. Collins M. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).WASP phosphorylation by Btk or Lyn in mast cells is greatly enhanced when an activated mutant of Cdc42 is coexpressed, indicating that cooperativity between kinases and GTPase takes place in cells (13Guinamard R. Aspenstrom P. Fougereau M. Chavrier P. Guillemot J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that WASP phosphorylation in vitro is contingent on its activation by either Cdc42 or PIP2 (15Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Cory G.O. Garg R. Cramer R. Ridley A.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1215-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Contingency with Cdc42 can be rationalized by a need to destabilize the GBD-VCA interactions, which largely bury the Tyr291 side chain in the autoinhibited structure, blocking access to kinase. Similarly, since phosphorylated WASP can still adopt the autoinhibited conformation, it is resistant to dephosphorylation by phosphatases (19Torres E. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1215-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of WASP can provide a biochemical record of coincident kinase and GTPases signals. The functional consequences of phosphorylation are 2-fold. First, phosphorylation slightly destabilizes GBD-VCA interactions, leading to modest activation. Secondly, phosphorylated WASP (p-WASP) can be greatly activated by the Src SH3-SH2 module, which has no effect on the nonphosphorylated protein. These effects provide a novel mechanism by which WASP can respond differently, depending on its activation history.Here we have extended these findings by quantifying the effects of Cdc42 on the kinetics of N-WASP phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and also by examining potential cooperativity between Cdc42 and SH3-SH2 proteins in activation of p-WASP. We show that N-WASP is a poor kinase substrate when autoinhibited, with kcat/Km decreased ∼40-fold relative to the isolated GBD, and that Cdc42 substantially eliminates this repression. Similarly, the T cell phosphatase has a 30-fold lower kcat/Km toward autoinhibited p-N-WASP than toward the isolated p-GBD, and again this effect is largely reversed by that Cdc42. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lck SH3-SH2 module and Cdc42 are highly cooperative in activating p-WASP toward Arp2/3 complex, with a linking constant of ∼50 between the two activator equilibria (corresponding to ∼2.4 kcal mol-1 linking free energy) (20Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 1-83PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provide a better understanding of the mechanisms by which kinase and GTPase signals can cooperate to regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the phosphorylation and activation of WASP/N-WASP.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Preparation—Human N-WASP GBD (residues 192-275), human Cdc42 (residues 1-179), and Lck SH3-SH2 (residues 53-226) were cloned into pET11a. N-WASP VCA (residues 393-505) was cloned into pGEX-2T. Truncated WASP (ΔWASP, residues 153-502), and truncated N-WASP (GBD-P-VCA, residues 192-505 were cloned into pET16b. N-WASP GBD-VCA (GBD linked to the VCA region by a GGSGGS sequence) was cloned into pET11a. All constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6-1 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside for 4 or 16 h at either 37 or 20 °C, respectively. Lck tyrosine kinase was overexpressed from a baculovirus vector in Spodoptera frugiperda (sf9) cells, which were harvested after 3 days of infection. All proteins were purified by a series of anion exchange, cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatographies. Details of protein expression and purification are available in the supplemental material. Cdc42 was loaded with GMP-PCP as previously described (21Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Bovine Arp2/3 complex was purified from calf thymus as described by Higgs et al. (22Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit muscle and labeled with pyrene as previously described (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).The WASP protein ΔWASP and the N-WASP proteins GBD, GBD-VCA, GBD-P-VCA were phosphorylated on preparative scale by 1-3 μm Lck in the presence of a 5-fold excess of Cdc42-GMP-PCP. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 24-48 h in 50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP. Substrate concentrations varied from 0.5 to 1 mm. Phosphorylation was monitored by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Cell Signaling). Phosphoproteins were separated from reaction mixtures by extraction onto a glutathione S-transferase-Src SH2 domain affinity column. Following column wash, phosphorylated proteins were eluted with 10 mm phosphotyrosine in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography (SD75; details in supplemental material). Single site phosphorylation of p-GBD, p-GBD-VCA, p-GBD-P-VCA, and p-ΔWASP was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Each construct contains only a single tyrosine, Tyr291/Tyr256 for WASP/N-WASP, respectively.Kinase Assays—Substrates were phosphorylated with 20-50 nm Lck in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (100-200 cpm/pmol), and 0.01% Brij 35. After incubation for 3, 6, and 10 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and analyzed by auto-radiography. Initial rates were determined from a linear fit of the raw data and then fit as a function of substrate concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression (GraphPad PRISM software) to yield kcat and Km. In cases where saturation kinetics could not be achieved, kcat/Km was obtained from the slope of a linear fit of initial rates versus substrate concentration.Phosphatase Assays—Phosphorylated substrates were mixed with 2 nm T Cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and reactions were carried out at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Kinetics of phosphate release were measured by the colorimetric kit BIOMOL QuantiZyme assay system (BIOMOL catalog no. AK-815). Initial rate data were analyzed as for the kinase reactions above to yield either kcat and Km or kcat/Km.Actin Polymerization Assays—Detailed procedures have been described by Higgs et al. (22Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 2 or 4 μm Mg-ATP actin (5% pyrene-labeled), 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 in G buffer-Mg (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm MgCl2). Pyrene fluorescence (λex = 365 nm, λem = 407 nm) was monitored with a Fluorolog-3 spectrafluorimeter (JY Horiba). Fluorescence was normalized to the maximum change in signal within each experiment, F = (Fobs - Fmin)/(Fmax - Fmin) where Fmax, Fmin, and Fobs are the maximum, minimum, and observed fluorescence, respectively. Relative activity was calculated as described in Ref. 25Dueber J.E. Yeh B.J. Chak K. Lim W.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1904-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar. In short, relative activity = Δt½/Δt½max, where Δt½ is the difference between a given activator and ΔWASP in the time required to reach 50% maximal actin polymerization, and Δt½max is the analogous difference between VCA and ΔWASP. Relative activities were plotted as a function of activator (Cdc42 (Fig. 4D); SH3-SH2 (Fig. 4E)) and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression to obtain kact. The cooperativity factor (c) was calculated as described in Ref. 6Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar. In short, fractional activity (θ) = (KSH3-SH2 × [Cdc42] + KCdc42 * [SH3-SH2] + c[SH3-SH2] [Cdc42])/(KSH3-SH2 * KCdc42 + KSH3-SH2 * [Cdc42] + KCdc42 * [SH3-SH2] + c[SH3-SH2]-[Cdc42]) was fitted using nonlinear regression. Values of KCdc42 = 0.25 μm and KSH3-SH2 = 2.5 μm were obtained from Fig. 4, D and E, respectively.RESULTSN-WASP Phosphorylation Is Enhanced 40-fold upon Binding to Activated Cdc42—Autoinhibited WASP consists of three layers of structure encompassing the GBD and the C region of the VCA (Fig. 1B). Although the structure of autoinhibited N-WASP has not been determined directly, the 67% identity to WASP in the GBD and C regions indicates that the two structures should be highly similar. In the autoinhibited conformation, the site of phosphorylation is located in an α-helix within the second layer and is largely protected from solvent (∼90% of Tyr291 surface buried). We have previously shown qualitatively that autoinhibited WASP is a poor substrate for kinases and that the addition of Cdc42 disrupts the autoinhibited structure, leading to the exposure of Tyr291, making it a better substrate. Here we quantified the degree by which activated Cdc42 affects the kinetic parameters of phosphorylation in N-WASP.FIGURE 1WASP and N-WASP domain structure. A, domain structure of WASP and N-WASP. The thick and thin black lines represent homologous regions and sequence gaps, respectively. Autoinhibited structure of WASP consists of three layers represented by the yellow, blue, and red boxes (see Ref. 3Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar for structural details). Constructs used in these studies consist of the N-WASP fragments GBD (residues 192-275), VCA (residues 393-505), GBD-VCA (GBD linked to VCA through the linker sequence GGSGGS), GBD-P-VCA (residues 192-505), and the WASP fragment ΔWASP (residues 153-502). B, schematic representation of the WASP/N-WASP autoinhibitory equilibrium between an inactive closed conformation where Tyr291/Tyr256 is largely buried in the structure and an active open conformation (19Torres E.

In the absence of an activator molecule, WASP/N-WASP equilibria are biased toward an inactive conformation where Tyr291/Tyr256 is buried within the structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We measured the rate of phosphate incorporation from ATP by the Lck kinase domain into a series of N-WASP constructs. First, we measured kcat and Km of Lck toward a construct consisting of the GBD alone, which has no persistent tertiary structure (3Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K.

This yielded kcat/Km = 1.2 × 105 m-1 s-1 (kcat = 51 s-1, Km = 425 μm), a value similar to those obtained for Src and Lck kinases with several of its peptide substrates (Fig. 2A and Table 1) (27Edison A.M.

Using an autoinhibited construct that consists of the GBD linked to the VCA domain through a short flexible linker (GGS)2 (GBD-VCA), we measured kcat/Km = 2.8 × 103 m-1 s-1, indicating ∼44-fold lower efficiency than on GBD alone (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Also, using a construct where the GBD is linked to the VCA through its natural proline-rich domain of ∼150 residues (GBD-P-VCA), we measured kcat/Km = 3.2 × 103 m-1 s-1, ∼38-fold lower efficiency than on GBD alone (Fig. 2B, Table 1). We and others have been unable to express full-length WASP or N-WASP in bacteria. However, the GBD-P-VCA construct here and the ΔWASP construct of WASP below can be expressed in bacteria at modest levels. We use these proteins, which lack only the EVH1 domain, as reasonable mimics of the full-length proteins in terms of the thermodynamics of GBD-VCA interactions. The decreasing catalytic efficiency from GBD to GBD-P-VCA to GBD-VCA parallels the increase in stability of the autoinhibited fold in these proteins, consistent with the notion that the autoinhibitory contacts block access to kinase. Although we were not able to separate kcat and Km for the two autoinhibited constructs due to their limited solubility (which prevented us from achieving saturation kinetics), the decreased kcat/Km relative to the GBD is probably due to a change in Km.FIGURE 2Active Cdc42 increases the phosphorylation of autoinhibited N-WASP constructs.

In all cases, mass spectrometric analyses demonstrated that the N-WASP proteins are singly phosphorylated. Since Tyr256 is the only tyrosine residue in each construct, we assume that this is the site of modification. We previously showed that Cdc42 does not affect the catalytic activity of Lck toward the WASP and N-WASP GBDs (19Torres E. Rosen M.K. Mol.

Thus, the increase in kcat/Km is probably due to a decrease in Km upon Cdc42 binding, which derives from destabilization of the autoinhibited fold.Consistent with previous results, these data indicate that in N-WASP, the autoinhibited fold protects Tyr256 against covalent modification by kinases. Destabilization of the fold by active Cdc42 leads to the disruption of the autoinhibited conformation and increases the efficiency of phosphorylation 40-fold, probably by lowering the Km by which Lck can act on N-WASP. These results provide a mechanism by which kinase signaling is prevented when N-WASP is in an autoinhibited conformation with a high Km and ensured to occur properly only when both kinase and GTPase have been activated, resulting in a lower Km and efficient phosphorylation.N-WASP Dephosphorylation Is Enhanced 30-fold upon Binding to Activated Cdc42—We previously showed that phosphorylated WASP can still adopt an autoinhibited conformation with p-GBD bound to VCA. Moreover, using NMR spectroscopy we showed that the back-bone 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts of p-GBD in complex with VCA are almost identical to those in the nonphosphorylated complex, indicating that the autoinhibited conformation is the same regardless of phosphorylation state (19Torres E. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1215-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we examined the effects of the autoinhibited fold on the ability of the T cell phosphatase to dephosphorylate p-Tyr256-N-WASP proteins. N-WASP GBD and GBD-VCA proteins were first phosphorylated in vitro with Lck and then purified using a glutathione S-transferase-SH2 column eluted with phosphotyrosine. Purity of the phosphoproteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting, and mass spectrometry, showing single species phosphorylated at a single residue (not shown).Quantitative analyses show that T cell phosphatase acts on the N-WASP p-GBD with kcat/Km = 3.2 × 105 m-1 s-1 (kcat = 22 s-1, Km = 68 ± 10 μm for p-GBD), indicating catalytic efficiency similar to that of other substrates (kcat/Km = 0.8-10 × 105 m-1 s-1) (Fig. 3A, Table 1) (30Asante-Appiah E. Ball K. Bateman K. Skorey K. Friesen R. Desponts C. Payette P. Bayly C. Zamboni R. Scapin G. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol.

Biophys. 2003; 414: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, autoinhibited N-WASP p-GBD-VCA was dephosphorylated with kcat/Km = 0.11 × 105 m-1 s-1, an ∼30-fold reduction in efficiency, consistent with decreased accessibility of p-Y256 when N-WASP is autoinhibited (Fig. 3B, Table 1). The addition of saturating amounts of activated Cdc42 enhances kcat/Km of T cell phosphatase dephosphorylation of p-GBD-VCA to 1.3 × 105 m-1 s-1 (∼2.5-fold less than p-GBD alone, with kcat = 22 s-1 and Km = 170 ± 25 μm) (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Although we were not able to separate kcat and Km for p-GBD-VCA alone, the similarity in kcat values for p-GBD and GBD-VCA/Cdc42 suggests that the reduced kcat/Km for the free autoinhibited protein is due to an increase in Km. If this were the case, the 30-fold reduction of kcat/Km would correspond to an increase in Km to ∼2 mm, consistent with our inability to achieve saturation kinetics at practically obtainable substrate concentrations.FIGURE 3Active Cdc42 increases the rate of dephosphorylation of autoinhibited N-WASP.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate inflammatory stimuli from pathogens and endogenous danger signals and link the innate and adaptive immune system. We investigated innate immune responses in human muscle. Analyzing TLR1-9 mRNA in cultured myoblasts and rhabdomyosarcoma cells, we found constitutive expression of TLR3. The TLR3 ligand Poly (I:C), a synthetic analog of dsRNA, and IFN-gamma increased TLR3 levels. TLR3 was mainly localized intracellularly and regulated at the protein level. Poly (I:C) challenge 1) activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), 2) increased IL-8 release, and 3) up-regulated NKG2D ligands and NK-cell-mediated lysis of muscle cells. We examined muscle biopsy specimens of 6 HIV patients with inclusion body myositis/polymyositis (IBM/PM), 7 cases of sporadic IBM and 9 nonmyopathic controls for TLR3 expression. TLR3 mRNA levels were elevated in biopsy specimens from patients with IBM and HIV-myopathies. Muscle fibers in inflammatory myopathies expressed TLR3 in close proximity of infiltrating mononuclear cells. Taken together, our study suggests an important role of TLR3 in the immunobiology of muscle, and has substantial implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies or therapeutic interventions like vaccinations or gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2125571798,"The capsular polypeptide of Bacillus anthracis is composed of a unique polyglutamic acid polymer in which D-glutamate monomers are joined by gamma-peptidyl bonds. The capsule is poorly immunogenic, and efforts at exploiting the polymer for vaccine development have focused on increasing its inherent immunogenicity through chemical coupling to immune-stimulating protein carriers. The usual strategy has employed carbodiimide-based condensing reagents for activation of free alpha-carboxyl groups, despite reports that this chemistry may lead to chain scission. We have purified the high molecular mass capsule to >95% homogeneity and have demonstrated that the polymer contains >99% poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid. The predominant structure of the polymer as assessed by circular dichroism and multiangle laser light scattering was unordered at near-neutral pH. We investigated the effects of various activation chemistries, and we demonstrated that carbodiimide treatment under aqueous conditions results in significant cleavage of the gamma-peptidyl bond, whereas scission is significantly reduced in nonaqueous polar solvents, although undesired side chain modification was still observed. An activation chemistry was developed using the triazine-based reagent 4-(4,6-dimethoxy (1,3,5)triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride, which allowed for controlled and reproducible derivatization of alpha-carbonyls. In a two-pot reaction scheme, activated capsule was derivatized with a sulfhydryl-reactive heterobifunctional moiety and was subsequently coupled to thiolated carrier protein. This conjugate elicited very high capsule-specific immune titers in mice. More importantly, mice immunized with conjugated capsule exhibited good protection against lethal challenge from a virulent B. anthracis strain in two models of infection. We also showed, for the first time, that treatment of capsule with carbodiimide significantly reduced recognition by capsule-specific antisera concurrent with the reagent-induced reduction of polymer mass. The data suggested that for vaccine development, maintenance of the high mass of the polymer may be important."

We have recently found that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is recruited on NF-Y-dependent repressed promoters. In this report, we describe the relationship between p53 and HDAC4 recruitment following DNA damage using immunofluorescence, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection experiments. HDAC4 shuttles from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, following DNA damage, independently of the activation of p53 and becomes associated with promoters through a p53-dependent mechanism. The C-terminal lysines of p53, which are acetylated and methylated, are required for HDAC4 recruitment and transcriptional repression. Trichostatin treatment, but not HDAC4 functional inactivation, relieves the adriamycin-mediated repression of G2/M promoters.

Our results indicate that HDAC4 is a component of the DNA damage response and that post-translational modifications of p53 are important for repression of G2/M genes. The transcriptional response to DNA damage is regulated by specific genes under the control of the tumor suppressor p53. The p53 protein is normally present in low amounts in growing cells and is activated in response to external insults via a plethora of post-translational modifications (1Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). This activation results in binding to specific DNA sequences located within the promoter region or the first intron of the activated genes (2El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, p53 can also function as a negative regulator of a variety of genes whose products are critical for the cell cycle progression; most of the promoters of these genes do not contain a typical consensus binding site for p53 (3Innocente S.A.

In addition to DNA-binding proteins, other complexes are essential for repression. Among the co-repressors, the histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; ADR, adriamycin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; wt, wild type; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NF, nuclear transcription factor; TSA, trichostatin; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor 2. play an important role in controlling transcription. In particular, repression of cell cycle promoters results in histone deacetylation mediated by the recruitment of HDACs to the promoters (13Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D.

Many of the Class II HDACs are regulated by nuclear trafficking; the process involves post-translational modifications as well as proteolytic cleavage of specific domains. Many pathways activated by cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis lead to nuclear localization of Class II HDACs (28Lemercier C. Brocard M.P. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Kao H.Y. Albagli O.

An additional level of regulation results from an interplay between the N-terminal nuclear localization signal and the C-terminal leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (38Kao H.Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.C.

The vast majority of the data available on the regulation of the cellular localization of HDAC has been gathered from experiments on overexpressed proteins. In C2C12 myocytes, transfected HDAC4 was found to localize in the nucleus, whereas few cells displayed staining onto the cytoplasmic inclusions (28Lemercier C. Brocard M.P. Puvion-Dutilleul F.

HDAC4/5 overexpressed in U2OS cells can be localized exclusively to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus, often aggregating in foci (41Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling during apoptosis is also regulated by caspases, which provide HDAC4 cleavage (48Paroni G. Mizzau M. Henderson C. del Sal G. Scheider C. Brancolini C. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2044422843,"We present a simple theory of the thermodynamics of an incommensurate quantum solid. The ground state of the solid is assumed to be an incommensurate crystal, with quantum zero-point vacancies and interstitials and thus a non-integer number of atoms per unit cell. We show that the low temperature variation of the net vacancy concentration should be as $T^4$, and that the first correction to the specific heat due to this varies as $T^7$; these are quite consistent with experiments on solid $^4$He. We also make some observations about the recent experimental reports of ``supersolidity'' in solid $^4$He that motivate a renewed interest in quantum crystals."

NHE3 is known to be regulated by a large variety of hormones, such as α- and β-adrenergic agonists, dopamine, parathyroid hormone, and angiotensin II via multiple signaling systems (6Hu M.C. Fan L.

Nevertheless, it has been known for many years that acute regulation of NHE3 activity is linked to protein phosphorylation, as in the case of inhibition by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (7Weinman E.J.

For example, EBP50 (also known as NHERF1) and E3KARP (also known as NHERF2, SIP-1, or TKA-1) were found to be necessary modular proteins that participated in the cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylation of NHE3 by forming a multiprotein signaling complex (11Weinman E.J.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in PDZ domains and modular proteins having PDZ domains. Best studied in the post-synaptic density (PSD) region of neurons, PDZ domain proteins have emerged as a large and important group of proteins that sequester functionally related groups of receptor, regulatory, and effector proteins into integrated molecular complexes (13Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lim S. Naisbitt S. Yoon J. Hwang J.I. Suh P.G. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol.

Epithelial cells also utilize specific PDZ proteins to direct the polarized activities in their apical and basolateral membranes. Recently, the PDZ-based scaffold protein Shank2 has been shown to be distributed to the apical pole of pancreatic, colonic, hepatic, and renal epithelia and modulate the activity of specific transport proteins, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the type IIa sodium phosphate cotransporter (16Kim J.Y.

Shank proteins are a family of newly identified scaffold proteins known to serve as a central coordinator of membrane protein complexes in PSD (13Sheng M. Kim E. J.

Among them, we found that the PDZ domain of Shank2 binds to the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 in an exploratory yeast two-hybrid assay. The present study aimed to identify and characterize the biochemical nature and physiological significance of the association between Shank2 and NHE3 using integrative molecular physiological approaches. Upon Shank2 expression, the membrane expression and basal activity of NHE3 were increased but the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity was attenuated in the PS120/NHE3 cells. Furthermore, knock-down of native Shank2 expression by RNA interference evoked a remarkable decrease in endogenous NHE3 activity in Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells. Thus, Shank2 appears to be a critical regulatory protein that affects NHE3 expression and activity. Cell Culture and Transfection—NHE-deficient hamster fibroblast cells (PS120) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-HG (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (50 IU/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml).

Caco-2 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma cells) were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-95% air environment. The culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-HG, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells reached confluence after 5–7 days in culture. They were used for experiments at least 7 days after confluence, and the incubation medium was freshly changed on alternate days.

The L40 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ, under control of the upstream LexA DNA-binding domain was used in the assay. To semi-quantify the interaction, HIS3 activity was determined by the percentage of yeast colonies growing on histidine-lacking medium. cDNA sequences containing the carboxyl-terminal 32 aa of rNHE3 (aa 800–831: PFRLSNKSVDSFLQADGPEEQLQPASPESTHM) were amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into pBHA construct (a bait vector containing the LexA DNA-binding domain).

Amino-terminal 32-aa residues of rNHE3 (NM_012654) were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to create glutathione S-transferase fusion constructs. All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. All fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), as appropriate. The purified proteins were quantified with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and their purity was assessed as >90% by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. A surface plasmon resonance system equipped with nitrilotriacetic acid chip (BIAcore 3000, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for the capturing of His-tagged PDZ fusion proteins. Analytes (glutathione S-transferase-tagged C-terminal 32 aa of rNHE3) at various concentrations in HEPES-buffered saline-EP (0.01 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) were perfused at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sensor chip was regenerated between each analysis using successive injections of solutions containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.35 m EDTA. At least two replicate experiments were performed for each fusion protein. Response curves were generated by subtraction of the background signal generated simultaneously by the control flow cell. The background-subtracted curves were prepared for fitting by subtracting the signal generated by buffer alone on experimental flow cells. Sensorgram curves were evaluated by the BIAEVALUATION 3.0 software (Biacore AB), which uses numerical integration algorithms. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—PS120 or Caco-2 cell lysates (∼2 mg of protein) were mixed with the appropriate antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein G/A-Sepharose and washed four times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitates or lysates (50 μg of protein) were suspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, and protein bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence solutions.

Mouse monoclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of human β-actin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NHE1 and NHE2 were from Dr. S. Grinstein, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada and Dr. E. Chang, University of Chicago, IL, respectively, and the specificity of each antibody was verified in previous reports (24Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M.

The cells were then placed at 4 °C and then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and once in borate buffer (in mm: 154 NaCl, 10 boric acid, 7.2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, pH 9.0). The plasma membrane proteins were then biotinylated by gently shaking the cells in a borate buffer containing sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min. After biotinylation, the cells were washed extensively with quenching buffer to remove excess biotin and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed, and NeutrAvidin solution (UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin Beads 10%, Pierce) was added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Avidin-bound complexes were pelleted (13,000 rpm) and washed three times. Biotinylated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and immunoblotted with NHE3 antibody. Genome Screening, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and cDNA Sequencing—To identify the epithelial splice variant of human Shank2 (hShank2E), the 400,000 bp upstream of the start codon of hShank2 (a homologous protein of rCortBP1, accession number NM_012309) on human chromosome 11 was analyzed using the rat Shank2E sequence as a reference sequence (rShank2E, accession number AY298755). Putative exons were determined by the New GENSCAN web server at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A list of candidate exons were chosen with > 5 scoring, translated into protein sequence, and aligned with that of rShank2E. During this process, non-homologous exons were excluded. A human EST AK096045 was also used for the analysis of the hShank2E sequence. To confirm the hShank2E sequence, PCR primers specific to hShank2E, especially to the ankyrin repeats domain were designed and cDNA products were sequenced using an ABI-Prism sequencer. Reverse transcription-PCR using a primer set from exons 1 and 17 produced a 2,122-bp band, and the whole DNA sequence of this product was submitted to the GenBank™ data base with accession number DQ152234 (see Fig. 5). hShank2E cDNA sequence from exons 1–8 was identical to that of a partial EST clone isolated from human kidney (AK096045) except exon 2, where an internal alternative splicing is evident in the EST clone. We could not find sequences corresponding to exon 8 on the human genome contig of chromosome 11 (NT_033927), although our sequence perfectly matched with that of the EST (AK096045) clone. It could be either from short repeated exons in the region or erroneous information in the genome contig. In addition, a PCR primer set that can specifically detect hShank2/CortBP1 was designed to confirm the presence of this splicing variant in Caco-2 epithelial cells. The primer sequences were as follows: 1) hShank2E, sense (exon 1, 5′-ATGCCGCGCAGCCCAACATC-3′); 2) hShank2/CortBP1, sense (exon 15a, 5′-CGCTGTCCCCGGAATTCTCTCT-3′); and 3) hShank2 common, antisense (exon 17, 5′-CCTGCCGGATCATGTTCACCAC-3′). The sizes of the hShank2E and hShank2/CortBP1 PCR products were 2,122 and 295 bp, respectively (see Fig. 5C). The control β-actin primer sequences were as follows: hβ-actin, sense (5′-TGTGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAG-3′) and antisense (5′-TTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′); size of PCR product, 510 bp. RNA Interference—To knock down Shank2 expression in Caco-2 epithelial cells, 25-bp double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, specific for Shank2, were synthesized (Invitrogen) and transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The target small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence was as follows: 5′-GGAATTCTCTCTACAGTGACTGCAT-3′. Four days after transfection, cells were used for NHE measurements or harvested in lysis buffer for immunoblotting. Measurement of Na+/H+ Exchange Activity—Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured using a standard protocol with some modifications (9Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester and intracellular pH (pHi) changes were measured. When Shank2 constructs were transiently expressed (Figs. 2 and 3), a green fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid (Invitrogen) was co-transfected and pHi measurements were performed with cells expressing high levels of green fluorescent protein as previously reported (27Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cells were acidified by an NH4+ (20 mm) pulse and subsequent perfusion with an Na+-free solution. The maximal Na+-dependent pHi recovery was measured in cells acidified to a pH of 6.4–6.5, with or without 5 μm forskolin/100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine treatment. The standard perfusion solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Na+-free solutions were prepared by replacing Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine+. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mm with the major salt. Buffer capacity was calculated by measuring pHi in response to 5–20 mm NH4Cl pulses. In each experiment, the intrinsic buffer capacity (βi) showed a negative linear relationship with pHi between 6.4 and 7.3. The βi of PS120/NHE3 cells (34.1 ± 3.9 mm NH4+/pH unit at pHi = 7.0) was lower than that of Caco-2 cells (44.4 ± 3.5). However, neither forskolin treatment nor any gene modulation significantly changed βi. Therefore, all of the results of NHE activity are expressed as ΔpH/min, and this value was directly analyzed without compensating for βi. The results are presented as means ± S.E., and, when appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.FIGURE 3Effects of Shank2 on cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3. Basal and cAMP-stimulated NHE activities were measured in PS120/NHE3 cells transfected with mock plasmids, pcDNA3.1-rShank2/CortBP1, or pcDNA3.1-rShank2E. To observe a strong basal activity and a large cAMP-induced inhibition, PS120/NHE3 cells were deprived of serum for 18 h and co-transfected with EBP50/NHERF1-expressing plasmids. Representative traces from cells transfected with mock plasmids and pcDNA3.1-rShank2E are shown in C and D, respectively. Summaries of NHE activity and percentile inhibition of NHE activity by cAMP treatment (Control n = 7, rShank2 n = 8, rShank2E n = 9) are shown in A and B, respectively. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specific Binding between Shank2 PDZ and the Carboxyl Terminus of NHE3—It has been repeatedly reported that the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 plays an important role in both surface expression and regulation of the activity of NHE3 through interactions with the PDZ-domain of NHERF family proteins (7Weinman E.J. Cunningham R. Shenolikar S. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 450: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In a previous study (16Kim J.Y. Han W. Namkung W. Lee J.H. Kim K.H. Shin H. Kim E. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10389-10396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in preliminary experiments for the present study, we observed that pancreatic and colonic epithelia express several PDZ-based adaptor proteins in addition to NHERF family proteins using reverse transcription-PCR. These include SAP97, PSD-95, S-SCAM, and Shank2 proteins. Therefore, we hypothesized that the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 may associate with other PDZ-based adaptors in epithelia. To explore the possible protein-protein interactions between the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 and the PDZ domains of these adaptor proteins, we performed a semi-quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay. As presented in supplementary Table S1, the PDZ domain of Shank2 showed a potent induction of both HIS3 and β-galactosidase reporter genes in yeast, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction between the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 and the PDZ-domain of Shank2. To verify the interaction between NHE3 and Shank2 in mammalian cells, PS120 cells stably expressing NHE3 (PS120/NHE3) were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-rShank2/CortBP1 or with mock plasmids, and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, transfection of pcDNA3.1-rShank2 induced the expression of Shank2 protein with a molecular mass of about 165 kDa (arrowhead). Notably, a prominent NHE3 signal was always detected in the Shank2 immunocomplexes precipitated from rShank2-transfected cells in a total of three experiments. The binding kinetics between the Shank2 PDZ domain and the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance experiments. As depicted in Fig. 1B, Shank2 PDZ domain captured in nitrilotriacetic acid chips specifically binds to the carboxyl terminal 32 aa of NHE3, and its overall dissociation constant at equilibrium status (KD) was calculated as 1.2 × 10–7 m, which was within a range similar to that of interaction between the carboxyl terminus of NHE3 and EBP50/NHERF1 (1.5 × 10–7 m, figure not shown). Functional Interaction between Shank2 and NHE3 in PS120 Cells—To investigate the functional significance of Shank2 binding on NHE3 activity, the impact of Shank2 on the surface distribution and activity of NHE3 was measured. In PS120 cells that stably express NHE3, the total amount of NHE3 protein and surface-expressed proteins were compared by using immunoblotting of total cell lysates and surface biotinylated proteins, respectively, in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-rShank2 or with mock plasmids (Fig. 2A). The total amount of NHE3 protein was not different in the two groups. In contrast, cell-surface expression of NHE3 was increased 2.2 ± 0.4 times in cells transiently expressing Shank2. NHE3 activity is primarily regulated by the surface expression of NHE3 molecules. The above results imply that by modulating the surface distribution of NHE3, Shank2 might regulate the activity of NHE3 (2Zachos N.C. Tse M. Donowitz M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 411-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Bacic D. Kaissling B. McLeroy P. Zou L. Baum M. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 2133-2141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test this directly, NHE activity in PS120/NHE3 cells was measured in cells concurrently expressing Shank2. NHE activity was measured as the Na+-dependent increase in pHi after intracellular acidification induced by an NH4+ pulse as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Most studies measuring NHE3 kinetics in PS120 cells have been done under serum-deprived conditions, because serum deprivation for 18 h increases NHE3 activity and expression (9Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the initial set of NHE3 measurements in the present study was done under serum-supplemented conditions, because the induction of NHE3 expression by serum deprivation would deter the innate regulation of NHE3 in PS120 cells and also because immunoblotting and surface biotinylation results shown in Fig. 2A were performed under serum-supplemented conditions. In fact, we observed that serum deprivation blunted the Shank2-induced increase in NHE3 surface expression (data not shown). Traces of NHE activity measurements are shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), and a summary of results is illustrated in Fig. 2B. Notably, the basal NHE activity was increased 1.8 ± 0.3-fold upon Shank2 expression, which correlates with the results of NHE3 surface biotinylation. In a previous study, we found that cAMP-dependent inhibitory regulation of NHE3 was partially retained in PS120 cells, in particular, when the cells were kept in serum-supplemented conditions due to a minimal endogenous expression of EBP50/NHERF1 (9Ahn W. Kim K.H. Lee J.A. Kim J.Y. Choi J.Y. Moe O.W. Milgram S.L. Muallem S. Lee M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17236-17243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, NHE activity was measured under basal and cAMP-stimulated conditions. When the cells were treated with the cAMP mixture (forskolin 5 μm plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 100 μm), NHE activity was decreased by 21 ± 5% in control PS120/NHE3 cells and showed a statistically significant difference from the basal activity (p = 0.011).

To understand the role of p53 in BER, we analyzed the repair activity of hOgg1 in isogenic cell lines HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53-/-. We found that hOgg1 activity was significantly decreased in HCT116p53-/- cells as compared with HCT116p53+/+ cells, indicating a functional role for p53 in the regulation of hOGG1. Using gel-shift assays, we showed that p53 binds to its putative cis-elements within the hOGG1 promoter. In addition we demonstrated that supplementing p53 in HCT116p53-/- cells enhanced the transcription of hOGG1. To further strengthen our findings, we used p53-RNAi to study the effects of decreased p53 levels on hOgg1 activity. We observed that p53-RNAi resulted in decreased hOGG1 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels. This decrease in hOGG1 expression was associated with reduced cell viability upon oxidative damage and reduced hOgg1 activity as evidenced by the 8-oxoG incision assay. Taken together, our results indicate that loss of p53 function can lead to decreased hOgg1 repair activity."

Pathogen survival is dependent upon the ability to overwhelm, evade or inhibit the immune system.

The S. aureus genome contains three clusters of superantigen and superantigen-like genes, designated SaPIn1, -2, and -3 (2Kuroda M. Ohta T. Uchiyama I. Baba T. Yuzawa H. Kobayashi I. Cui L. Oguchi A.

Thus the SSL7 and FcαRI binding sites are likely to be the same or at least closely overlapping. Furthermore the interaction of SSL7 was independent of the IgA Asn-263 linked carbohydrate, which extends close to the Cα2/Cα3 interface (16Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J.

The sequence of this IgA1 Fc cDNA fragment differs from reference sequences (accession: NG_001019, six single nucleotide polymorphisms, BC092449, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms) resulting in two amino acid differences, L271M and R392H (standard IgA1 Bur numbering), consistent with the Dakiki IgA1 being a putative allelic variant. The EcoRI/ApaI TfR fragment and the ApaI/NotI IgA Fc fragment were simultaneously ligated into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of the gateway vector pENTR1A (Invitrogen) yielding pBAR355. The LR clonase reaction was used with gateway reading frame-A cassette adapted pCR3 (Invitrogen) to create the construct pBAR357 expressing the N-terminal transmembrane region of the transferrin receptor fused, at the hinge region, to the IgA Fc. The IgA1-Fc mutants were constructed by PCR of pBAR355 using Turbo Pfu (Stratagene) followed by phosphorylation and ligation of the linear PCR product as previously described (19Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The LL257,258MI mutation reaction used the primer pair oBW308 GGTTCAGAAGCGAACCTCACG and oBW269 GATCATCAGGTCCTCGAGGGCCG, the A442R mutation used the primer pair oBW266 ACACAGAAGACCATCGACCG and oBW202 GAAGCGCAGCGGCAGGGCCTCG, the PLAF(440–443)HNHY mutation used oBW270 GCCCTGCACAACCACTACACACAGAAGACCATCGACCG and oBW271 CTCGTGGCCCACCATGCAG, and the N263T mutation used the primer pair oBW268 GGTTCAGAAGCGACCCTCAC and oBW309 TAAGAGCAGGTCCTCGAGTGCCG.FcαRI-Fcγ2b Construct—The Fc region of mouse IgG2b was amplified from cDNA prepared from Balb/c splenocytes using the primers oBW137 GGGATCCGAGCCCAGCGGGCCCATTTC and oBW172 GCCCGGGCTATTTACCCGGAGACCGGGA as described above. Splice overlap PCR was used to add the sequence GGGCCCCCTGCAGAACTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCC onto the 3′-end of the cDNA encoding the FcαRI ectodomains (pBAR152) (20Wines B.D. Hulett M.D. Jamieson G.P.

These two DNAs were ligated at their BamHI sites, and the chimeric DNA was subcloned into the StuI site of pFastBac (Life Tech) making pBAR213. The chimeric DNA was then further subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with this construct, pBAR225, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and resistant colonies selected with 1 mg/ml G418. The cell line 225CHO expressing FcαRI-Fcγ2b was cloned by two rounds of single cell limiting dilution.Biosensor Analysis of rSSL7 Binding to Chimeric IgA2—A BIAcore CM5 chip was derivatized with 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylacetate (NP-OSu, Genosys, Cambridgeshire, UK) as described in Ref. 21Wines B.D. Gavin A. Powell M.S. Steinitz M. Buchanan R.R. Mark Hogarth P. Immunology. 2003; 109: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, and an equilibrium binding analysis was performed as described previously (19Wines B.D. Sardjono C.T. Trist H.H. Lay C.S. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using a BIAcore2000™ (BIAcore, Melbourne, Australia). Briefly, 1 μg/ml recombinant chimeric IgA2 anti-NIP (gift of Drs. Margaret Goodall and Roy Jefferies) was reacted (30 μl, flow rate of 10 μl/min) with the derivatized chip. The immobilized IgA2 layer was then reacted with rSSL7 in the concentration range 0.6–80 nm (100 μl, flow rate of 2 μl/min), and the response end point of each injection, above that of the injection of buffer alone, was taken as approaching the equilibrium binding response for the SSL7:IgA2 interaction. The data were fitted to the single binding site model, Req = B · A/(KD + A), where A is the free analyte concentration, and B is the binding capacity.Expression and Binding to TfR-IgA Fc Fusion Proteins—Transient expression in CHOP cells (22Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in 10 cm2 wells was performed by transfection with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 or 72 h the expression of TfR-IgA Fc was measured by incubating cells (50 μl, 105cells) 1 h on ice with FITC-conjugated sheep Fab′2 anti-human IgA (Silenus/Chemicon, Melbourne, Australia) diluted 1/200 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation the cells were resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min), and the collected cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). SSL7 binding activity of the mutants of IgA Fc was measured by incubating cells (105) 1 h on ice with 0.2 μg (10 pmol) of biotinylated SSL7. Unbound SSL7 was removed, and the cells were incubated in 1/400 dilution of 0.5 mg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) for 1 h on ice. FcαRI binding activity of the mutants of IgA Fc was measured by incubating cells (105) 1 h on ice with 0.5 ml of 225CHO cell supernatant containing FcαRI-Fcγ2b fusion protein (∼0.5 μg, 5 pmol). Unbound receptor was removed, and the cells were incubated in a 1/200 dilution of FITC-conjugated sheep Fab′2 anti-mouse Ig (Silenus/Chemicon) for 1 h on ice.RESULTSRecombinant SSL7 Binding to IgA—S. aureus colonizes mucosal sites and this prompted us to characterize the interaction of SSL7 with IgA2, the major subclass of IgA at the mucosa. Here we report rSSL7 binding to a human chimeric IgA2 anti-NP antibody. The antibody was reacted with a NP-derivatized biosensor surface with ∼700 response units of antibody binding and a variation between cycles of ≤10 response units (Fig. 1A). The binding to this immobilized IgA2 of SSL7 at different concentrations was recorded (Fig. 1B) after 3000 s when equilibrium was being approached. Plotting the equilibrium binding responses fitted best to a single binding site with an apparent affinity of 5.0 ± 1.5 nm (n = 5, Fig. 1C, one representative experiment KD = 6.8 ± 0.8 nm).SSL7 Inhibits FcαRI-Ig Binding to IgA Fc—The Fc region of human IgA1 derived from Dakiki cells was fused to the N-terminal region of the transferrin receptor, a type II integral membrane protein. FACS analyses of transfections of CHOP cells with the WT and with the A422R IgA Fc transferrin receptor fusion constructs is shown in Fig. 2. The surface expression of the WT and mutant IgA fusion proteins was determined by staining with anti-IgA FITC (Fig. 2A) and the rSSL7 (Fig. 2B), and FcαRI-Ig (Fig. 2C) binding to the same transfectants was also determined. In agreement with our previous data the binding of FcαRI-Ig to WT IgA Fc fusion protein expressing cells (mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) = 38.6 ± 2) was inhibited 90% in the presence of 2 μm (40 μg/ml) rSSL7 (MFI = 8 ± 2, background staining MFI = 5 ± 1, Fig. 2D). Hence in this experimental system FcαRI-Ig binding to the TfR-IgA Fc fusion protein is inhibited by rSSL7 just as rSSL7 inhibits serum IgA binding to isolated leukocytes (8Langley R. Wines B. Willoughby N. Basu I. Proft T. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2926-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2FACS of anti-IgA, rSSL7, and FcαRI-Ig binding to WT and A442R mutant TfR-IgA Fc fusion proteins. The expression of WT and A442R mutant TfR-IgA Fc fusion proteins and their functional activities were determined by FACS analysis of transiently transfected CHOP cells. The nonspecific staining of mock-transfected cells is shown in the solid gray histograms. A, surface expression of WT (bold solid line) and A442R (thin solid line) proteins was determined using FITC-labeled anti-human IgA polyclonal antiserum. B, the SSL7 binding activities of the WT (bold solid line) and A442R (thin solid line) TfR-IgA Fc proteins was determined using biotin-labeled rSSL7 and streptavidin-labeled PE. C, the FcαRI binding activities of the WT (bold solid line) and A442R (thin solid line) IgA proteins was determined using FcαRI-Ig fusion protein and FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ig. D, FcαRI binding to TfR-IgA Fc is inhibited by rSSL7. WT TfR-IgA Fc fusion protein was expressed in CHOP cells and incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of 2 μm (40 μg/ml) rSSL7. Cells were then incubated with FcαRI-Ig and FcαRI-Ig binding was detected with sheep FITC-labeled polyclonal IgG anti-mouse IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of Fusion Proteins of Transferrin Receptor with Mutant IgA Fc Regions—Because SSL7 binds to both IgA1 and IgA2 with nanomolar affinity and SSL7 inhibits FcαRI binding to IgA, SSL7 may bind directly to the FcαRI binding site, which is conserved in IgA1 and IgA2.Molecular analysis of the SSL7 binding site was performed by mutating residues at the Cα2/Cα3 interface of IgA Fc comprising the FcαRI binding site. The MFIs from FACS profiles showed the level of expression of the WT IgA fusion protein varied between experiments from a MFI = ∼150 (Figs. 2A and 3) in one set of transfections to ∼60 in another (Fig. 4). In each experiment the A442R mutant IgA Fc was always apparently expressed ∼2–3-fold lower than the WT. This may indicate that a proportion of this mutant IgA Fc may not fold correctly and not progress through the secretory pathway. Another possibility is that the mutation could cause a significant local alteration of the protein such that a major epitope(s) among those recognized by the anti-IgA polyclonal antiserum is disrupted leading to loss of polyclonal reactivity, rather than a lower surface expression. To go some way to address this, WT IgA Fc fusion protein-expressing cells were incubated with 5 μm (100 μg/ml) SSL7 prior to staining with the anti-IgA polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 3). Although the WT cells stained with a MFI = 146 (±5, n = 4) the staining of the cells preincubated with SSL7 (MFI = 53 ± 2) was reduced to that of the A442R mutant-expressing cells (MFI = 57 ± 2). Thus SSL7 binding to IgA Fc inhibits binding of the anti-human IgA antiserum indicating some of the recognized epitopes lie close to the SSL7 binding site, and these epitopes may be affected by mutation of this site. Thus it is possible that the A442R mutation may likewise affect the reactivity with the antiserum. Although the A442R mutation has been used to elucidate the IgA binding site of FcαRI (23Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), to avoid any ambiguity another mutation of this region, PLAF440-443HNHY was made where the FG loop of Cα3, PLAF, was altered to the equivalent sequence of human IgG1. The PLAF440-443HNHY mutant (MFI = 140 ± 7) was expressed at levels equivalent to the WT protein (MFI = 146 ± 5) and hence was unlikely to be misfolded (Fig. 3). Other residues of IgA, Leu-257 and Leu-258 important in FcαRI binding (16Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J.

Trans. 1997; 25: 328SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) were also mutated in the TfR-IgA Fc fusion protein to the equivalent residues in IgG1. This mutant LL257,258MI was also expressed at levels equivalent to that of the WT fusion protein (MFI = 54 ± 2, c.f. 61 ± 10; Fig. 4A). Finally a mutation of the IgA Fc fusion protein N263T abolished the IgA Cα2 N-glycosylation site. The expression of this protein (MFI = 54 ± 6, n = 4) was also not significantly different from that of the WT protein (MFI = 61 ± 10, n = 4) (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 3The A442R mutant IgA Fc has lower apparent binding to anti-IgA, whereas the PLAF440-443HNHY mutant is equivalent to WT. CHOP cells were transfected for transient expression of WT and mutant fusion proteins as indicated. WT expressing cells were first reacted (1 h, on ice) either in the presence or absence of 5 μm (100 μg/ml) rSSL7 and then stained with FITC-labeled anti-IgA. The MFIs for the WT and A442R proteins alone were derived from the FACS profiles shown in Fig. 2; the other FACS profiles are not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4The SSL7 and FcαRI binding activities of the WT and Cα2/Cα3 mutant IgA proteins. WT, A442R, PLAF440-443HNHY, LL257,258MI, and N263T mutant IgA fusion proteins were expressed transiently and analyzed for apparent surface expression with FITC label anti-IgA (A), biotinylated rSSL7 binding (B), and FcαRI-Ig binding (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of the SSL7 Binding Site in the IgA Fc Region—The SSL7 and FcαRI binding activities of the various TfR-IgA Fc proteins expressed on the surface of CHOP transfectants were evaluated. The binding of biotinylated rSSL7 to WT IgA fusion protein was readily detectable (Fig. 4B, MFI = 350 ± 40, n = 4). In contrast, the level of binding of SSL7 to the A442R mutant IgA Fc fusion protein (MFI = 4.5 ± 0.2) was indistinguishable from the binding to the mock-transfected cells (MFI = 4.3 ± 0.2). It is notable that an experiment with higher surface expression of IgA Fc fusion protein (Fig. 2), with correspondingly higher SSL7 binding to the WT (Fig. 2B, MFI = 980 ± 21), did reveal some low level binding of SSL7 to the A442R mutant protein (MFI = 8.4 ± 0.4, 0.15% relative to WT 100%, mock MFI = 6.9 ± 0.3). The greatly reduced SSL7 binding paralleled the reduced binding of the FcαRI-Ig fusion protein, which bound surface-expressed WT IgA Fc (MFI = 29.2 ± 0.2) but not the A442R mutant (MFI = 6.5 ± 0.5, mock MFI = 6.5 ± 0.1 (Fig. 4C)). The other mutations predicted to affect FcαRI binding also ablated SSL7 binding. The alternative mutation in the FG loop of domain 3 PLAF440-443HNHY abolished both SSL7 binding (MFI = 4.7 ± 0.2, mock = 4.3 ± 0.2) and FcαRI-Ig binding to levels equivalent to that of the mock transfections (Fig. 4C). Mutation of residues Leu-257 and Leu-258 in the Cα2 AB helix/loop of IgA Fc also affected both SSL7 (MFI = 35 ± 3, 9% of WT) and FcαRI-Ig binding (MFI = 8.1 ± 0.8, 7% of WT). Mutation of the N-linked glycosylation site (N263T) did not affect SSL7 binding (MFI = 330 ± 19, 94 ± 6% of WT) and only modestly reduced FcαRI-Ig binding (MFI = 24 ± 2, 80 ± 6% of WT).DISCUSSIONSSL7, a putative staphylococcal virulence factor, binds serum and secretory IgA from multiple species and prevents human IgA interaction with the leukocyte IgA receptor, FcαRI (8Langley R. Wines B. Willoughby N. Basu I. Proft T. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2926-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). S. aureus infection of the bloodstream can lead to septicemia, and asymptomatic carriage of S. aureus can occur in the nose while life-threatening infections of the respiratory tract also occur (12Gomez M.I. Lee A. Reddy B. Muir A. Soong G. Pitt A. Cheung A. Prince A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We previously had characterized SSL7 binding to serum IgA, of which the major form is IgA1 (8Langley R. Wines B. Willoughby N. Basu I. Proft T. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2926-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The importance of S. aureus adaptation to mucosal environments prompted us to characterize the interaction of SSL7 with IgA2, the major mucosal subclass of IgA. Here we report that IgA2 also bound SSL7 with nanomolar affinity. This high affinity interaction marks SSL7 as a potential factor in the survival of S. aureus not only in the blood, but also at mucosal sites. This study has further shown that the SSL7 binding site and that of FcαRI utilize common residues in the Fc region of human IgA. Residues Leu-257 and Leu-258 in the AB loop/helix of domain Cα2 of IgA and residues 440–443 PLAF in the FG loop of domain Cα3 of IgA have been found in domain swap, mutagenesis (23Carayannopoulos L. Hexham J.M. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Pleass R.J. Dunlop J.I. Anderson C.M. Woof J.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) to make major contributions to the binding of the leukocyte receptor FcαRI (Fig. 5). Mutation of these residues resulted in an expected decrease in soluble FcαRI-Ig binding consistent with the structural data (16Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and, in addition, completely abrogated SSL7 binding indicating the binding sites of SSL7 and FcαRI comprise many of the same residues. In the crystal structure of IgA bound to FcαRI, the N-linked carbohydrate of IgA extends down the external face of the Cα2 domain to the Cα2/Cα3 interface (16Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5) and thus may potentially be involved in interaction with molecules binding to this region. The role of the carbohydrate in SSL7 binding was examined using the N-linked glycosylation site point mutant N263T. The N263T IgA Fc mutant was expressed at levels equivalent to WT and bound similar levels of SSL7 indicating that the carbohydrate did not contribute to SSL7 binding. Thus despite the fact that other bacterial proteins containing an OB-fold domain have been shown to bind oligosaccharides (26Arcus V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we conclude that this is not the case for the SSL7/IgA interaction. Interestingly the IgA Asn-263-linked glycan is close to (8 Å), but not contacting, FcαRI in the crystal complex (16Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and in this study only a modest effect on the binding of FcαRI-Ig to the glycan deficient N263T mutant was observed.FIGURE 5The Fc region of IgA depicting the FcαRI and SSL7 binding sites at the Cα2/Cα3 interface. The IgA Fc structure (Herr et al. (16Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J.

We used enhanced peptide amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and directed mutagenesis to define the surface on LFN that interacts with PA. A continuous surface encompassing one face of LFN became protected from deuterium exchange when LFN was bound to a PA dimer. Directed mutational analysis demonstrated that residues within this surface on LFN interact with Lys-197 on two PA subunits simultaneously, thereby showing that LFN spans the PA subunit:subunit interface and explaining why heptameric PA binds a maximum of three LFN molecules.

Describing how the three components of anthrax toxin recognize each other at the molecular level can elucidate the self-assembly process at the cell surface and how they dissociate prior to, or during, translocation in the endosome. Such information could also aid in designing inhibitors that block toxin action. Previously, conservation-guided mutagenesis was used to screen for residues on LF/EF and PA that mediate complex assembly (14Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol.

However, later mutagenesis studies revealed a larger footprint on PA than could be accounted for by the surface patch (15Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein surfaces that are buried at an interface are protected from solvent, causing a decrease in the rate of H/D exchange (27Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). From H/D exchange profile analysis of LFN-derived peptide fragments, we identified four regions of primary structure that displayed protection from solvent in the presence of PA. These regions form a single continuous surface on LFN that contacts PA. Further, by mutagenesis we identified two acidic residues, Glu-135 and Asp-182, at diametrically opposite points on this surface that interact with the same residue, Lys-197, on adjacent subunits of oligomeric PA. These findings show how LF and EF bind to oligomeric forms of PA and explain the observation that the heptameric PA prepore can bind only three molecules of EF or LF simultaneously. Preparation of PA, LFN, and Mutants—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Mutations in PA and LFN were made in the pET22b-PA and pET15b-LFN constructs using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) of site-directed mutagenesis. PA83 and LFN were purified from Escherichia coli as described (28Miller C.J. Elliott J.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10432-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Wesche J.

LFN used in H/D experiments was further purified over an S-200 Sephacryl column that was pre-equilibrated with Tris buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7). Activation of PA and Oligomer Formation—PA was activated by incubation with trypsin at a final trypsin:PA ratio of 1:1000 (wt:wt) for 30 min at room temperature. Adding a 10-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor stopped the reaction. The ternary complex was formed by mixing the two pre-activated complementary oligomerization-deficient mutants (D512K and K199E/R468A/R470D) in equal quantities with a 3-fold molar excess of LFN (31Mogridge J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were placed on ice for 30 min to inhibit endocytosis. The cells were washed once with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 2.4 × 10-8 m of trypsin-nicked PA on ice for 2 h. The cells were washed again with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 35S-labeled LFN for 2 h. The 35S-LFN was produced by in vitro transcription/translation using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate expression system (Promega). The cells were washed three times with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with lysis buffer for 20 min. Radioactive content was determined by scintillation counting. Before measuring the H/D exchange characteristics of LFN, we varied the conditions of protease digestion, including GuHCl concentration and duration, in order to maximize the number of peptides generated and the sequence coverage (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under optimal conditions we obtained 155 peptides, which completely covered the sequence between residues 63 and 263 (Fig. 1A). We were unable to obtain peptides within the first ∼60 residues of LFN, due probably to the preponderance of basic residues in this region, which produce highly positively charged species that are difficult to identify in the mass spectrometer. H/D Exchange of LFN in the Absence of PA—To characterize the kinetics of deuterium incorporation by LFN alone, we measured the deuterium content of LFN-derived peptides under native conditions at 10-, 30-, 100-, 300-, 1000-, and 3000-s time points (Fig. 2A). The deuterium content of each peptide was determined by calculating the centroid of mass and comparing this value with that of the non-deuterated sample (see “Experimental Procedures”). The number of deuterons incorporated was plotted against time and used to derive kinetic profiles. At neutral pH (pH ∼7) on melting ice, the majority of surface amides exchanged with solvent completely but at a rate that was measurable over the chosen period; core regions, in contrast, exchanged slowly and only partially. Fig. 1B shows the degree of deuterium exchange mapped onto the crystal structure of LFN according to the following color scheme (Fig. 1B, blue (<33% deuterated), yellow (33-67% deuterated), red (>67% deuterated), white (no data)). After 10 s of exchange, most of the peptides derived from the surface of LFN showed low to moderate levels of exchange, but for three peptides (161-170, 201-212, and 248-256) exchange was almost complete before the first time point (Fig. 1B, left). In contrast, after 50 min, virtually all surface-exposed amides showed high levels of exchange, whereas the core regions (i.e. 148-161 and 213-222) showed little (Fig. 1B, right). The lack of deuterium incorporation within the central core helices indicates that LFN has a rigidly folded nucleus under native conditions. Having established this dynamic range of time and degree of deuterium incorporation, we were in a position to address H/D exchange in the presence of PA. H/D Exchange of LFN in the Presence of Oligomeric PA—We first examined the H/D exchange characteristics of LFN bound to the heptameric pre-pore, but because of the inherent tendency of these complexes to aggregate at high concentrations, we turned to a dimeric form of PA as an alternative binding partner for LFN. When two mutated, oligomerization-deficient forms of PA are combined in the presence of LFN (31Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7045-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a ternary complex is formed containing one molecule of each species. The binding of the single LFN molecule stabilizes the PA dimer and is believed to occur via the same interactions that mediate binding to the heptameric pre-pore. The ternary complex was used earlier to identify some residues on each subunit of PA that were involved in binding to LFN (15Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Digestion of the complex yielded 140 peptides from the LFN moiety. For several peptides, there was little change in deuterium uptake when LFN was bound to the PA dimer, but for certain others there was a marked decrease (Fig. 2A). Each peptide fragment contains multiple amide sites, which may exchange with different rates, but the data empirically fitted well with a two-component (fast and slow) exponential model. For each peptide the percentage of deuterons incorporated in the absence or presence of PA was determined over time, and values were plotted against the protein sequence to illustrate regions that became protected from H/D exchange in the presence of PA2 (Fig. 2A). Four discrete sites in LFN (i.e. residues 95-120, DX site 1; 137-147, DX site 2; 177-189, DX site 3; and 223-235, DX site 4) became significantly more protected from solvent exchange in the presence of PA (Fig. 2B). When mapped onto the surface of LFN (Fig. 2C), these four sites converged to form a continuous surface that was larger than that implied by previous mutagenesis studies (14Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3006-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All of the residues previously implicated in binding (i.e. Asp-182, Asp-187, Leu-188, Tyr-223, His-229, Leu-235, and Tyr-236) fell exclusively within DX sites 3 and 4, which comprise approximately half of the binding surface identified here. To address the role of the two additional sites identified here (i.e. DX sites 1 and 2), we constructed a series of mutants within and near these regions and tested their effects on PA binding. Exploring the Roles of DX Sites 1 and 2—Twenty-seven mutants were generated at surface-exposed residues within and near DX sites 1 and 2. Mutated proteins were 35S-labeled using in vitro incorporation of [35S]Met at the five methionine sites in LFN, and the proteins were then tested for ability to bind cells in the presence and absence of PA. The extent of binding for each mutant is shown in Fig. 3A as the fraction of wild-type binding. Within DX site 1, only two residues, D106A and Y108K, displayed binding defects. In contrast, within and near DX site 2 (i.e. LFN residues 136-147), we found a number of residues where mutation affected the interaction with PA. Residues Glu-135, Asp-136, Asn-140, Lys-143, and Asn-146 all showed binding defects, reflecting the relative importance of site 2 in the interaction. In keeping with previous studies (14Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Fouassier A. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3006-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), a number of the residues identified here are charged at neutral pH, reinforcing the notion that the PA-LFN interface is mediated largely by charge-charge interactions. Mapping all of the binding-defective mutants onto the four sites on the structure of LFN (Fig. 3B) revealed the breadth of the binding surface defined by residues in DX sites 2 and 3. The distance between the most distal binding-defective mutants, Asp-182 on DX site 3 to Glu-135 on DX site 2, was seen to be ∼40 Å (Fig. 3B). LFN Binds to the Same Residue on Adjacent PA Subunits—We next used the ternary complex to probe for pairs of basic residues on the PA dimer that were spaced such that they might interact with Glu-135 and Asp-182 on LFN. For simplicity, we only considered those pairs that were (i) positively charged, (ii) known to be involved in binding to LFN, and (iii) separated by ∼40 Å. Only two pairs met these criteria, and both pairs consisted of the same residue from adjacent subunits, Lys-197 on subunit A with Lys-197 on subunit B and Arg-200 on subunit A with Arg-200 on subunit B. We excluded the latter pair based on their proximity to the dimer interface and instead focused on Lys-197. Mutating Lys-197 to Ala on either PA subunit caused a dramatic loss of binding to LFN, but with the K197A mutation on subunit A the loss was greater (Fig. 4A). Anthrax toxin entry into mammalian cells depends on the ability of the individual toxin components to undergo self-assembly at the cell surface. After PA is proteolytically activated, the PA63·receptor complexes are assumed to diffuse in the plane of the membrane, allowing subunit:subunit collisions that result ultimately in the formation of the pre-pore. LF and EF can bind via their homologous N-terminal domains to oligomeric intermediates of PA63 or to the fully assembled heptamer. Complexes of either LF or EF with oligomeric PA have thus far been refractory to crystallization, necessitating other approaches to characterize the interaction. On the basis of H/D exchange experiments, we have identified four distinct regions in LFN that become more protected from solvent H/D amide exchange in the presence of PA2. These four DX sites converged to form a large (∼1200 Å2) surface on LFN, (Fig. 2C), and by site-directed mutagenesis we were able to identify additional putative contact residues, beyond those found earlier (Fig. 3C). The majority of the binding defective mutants identified here and elsewhere (15Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) localized to DX sites 2-4. Our mutagenic analysis revealed evidence that two residues on the PA binding surface of LFN (Glu-135 and Asp-182), which are ∼40Å apart, interact with the same basic residue (Lys-197) on adjacent subunits of the pre-pore. This result supports earlier findings that oligomerization of PA63 is required for LF or EF binding, that the footprint of LFN and EFN is large enough to block the binding sites on two PA subunits, and that the heptameric pre-pore binds only three molecules of EF and/or LF at saturation. The Glu-135-Lys-197 interaction and Asp-182-Lys-197 interaction limit to two the possible orientations of LFN docked onto the pre-pore. The fact that mutations of Asp-182 and Lys-197 from subunit A have a greater effect on binding than mutations of Glu-135 and Lys-197 from subunit B favors the orientation shown in Fig. 4C. Other evidence favoring this orientation has come recently from Rosetta protein-protein docking simulations and identification of other contact pairs by directed mutagenesis (44Lacy D.B. Lin H.C. Melnyk R.A. Schueler-Furman O. Reither L. Cunningham K. Baker D. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16409-16414Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this model, DX sites 1-4 make extensive contacts with subunit A from PA, with minimal contact observed between DX site 2 and subunit B from PA. This model places the N terminus over the pore lumen, whereas the other orientation would position the N terminus away from the lumen (Fig. 4D). Previous work has established that the amino terminus of LFN is the first to enter the pore lumen during translocation (45Zhang S. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16756-16761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate how the four sites within LFN identified by DX participate in the binding interaction surface and also provide an explanation for how a single LFN bridges two PA subunits. In keeping with previous mutagenesis results, most of the residues implicated in binding are expected to be charged at neutral pH values. The affinity of such an interface is expected to decrease with decreasing pH where the acidic groups are more likely to exist in the protonated state. Thus, the LF-PA interface appears to have been designed to have an inherent pH release trigger, which provides an elegant solution to the problem of how to dissociate this nanomolar-affinity complex in the endosome. Our study demonstrates the power of H/D exchange mass spectrometry approaches for mapping complex protein-protein interaction surfaces. We thank Melissa A. Brock and Stephen J.

In this report, we employed the cyclic AMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein to provide evidence for substrate discrimination by ATM and ATR in cellulo.

UV light-induced CREB phosphorylation temporally correlated with ATM autophosphorylation on Ser-1981, and an ATM-specific small interfering RNA suppressed CREB phosphorylation in response to this stimulus. UV light-induced CREB phosphorylation was absent in ATM-deficient cells, confirming that ATM is required for CREB phosphorylation in UV irradiation-damaged cells. Interestingly, RNA interference-mediated suppression of ATR partially inhibited CREB phosphorylation in response to UV light, which correlated with reduced phosphorylation of ATM on Ser-1981.

ATM-deficient cells are characteristically defective in the IR-induced G1/S and G2/M checkpoints and display a hallmark abnormality termed radioresistant DNA synthesis, which reflects the failure to down-regulate DNA replicon initiation in response to DNA damage (3Shiloh Y.

This has led to the generally accepted view that ATM and ATR phosphorylate a common pool of substrates but in response to distinct types of genetic lesions. However, there appear to be exceptions to this rule, as ATM has been implicated in the UV light-induced phosphorylation of replication protein A (RPA) and CHK2 (33Helt C.E. Cliby W.A. Keng P.C.

The basis for differential substrate phosphorylation by ATM and ATR in UV irradiation-damaged cells is unclear but may reflect differences in substrate accessibility in cellulo. The differential induction of ATM and ATR signaling in response to IR and DNA replication stress reflects an apparently fundamental difference in their mechanisms of activation. Activation of ATM involves the trans-autophosphorylation of inactive ATM dimers on Ser-1981 and dissociation into catalytically active monomers (35Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). ATM substrate phosphorylation and autophosphorylation in response to DSBs require trimeric MRE11·RAD50·NBS1 complexes, which recruit ATM to DNA breaks through the carboxyl terminus of NBS1 (36Uziel T.

Recent studies suggest that NBS1 is not required for ATM autophosphorylation in response to non-DSB-inducing stimuli, such as UV light, indicating that multiple upstream pathways control the ATM activation state in mammalian cells (42Difilippantonio S. Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Reina San Martin B. Laethem F.V. Yang Y.P. Petukhova G.V. Eckhaus M. Feigenbaum L. Manova K. Kruhlak M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Sharan S. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The regulation of ATR is comparatively less well understood, and it is unclear whether autophosphorylation modulates ATR signaling potential. However, one established mode of ATR regulation appears to be through its targeting to stalled replication forks. ATR becomes enriched in nuclear foci following exposure of mammalian cells to DNA-damaging agents or DNA replication inhibitors (24Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar).

Hierarchical recruitment of RPA and ATRIP-ATR to regions of single-stranded DNA appears to be important for the activation of ATR toward its substrates in mammalian cells (44Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Here, we explore the mechanism of CREB phosphorylation by ATM and ATR in response to different forms of DNA damage. Although both kinases phosphorylate CREB in vitro, we provide evidence that ATM is the major CREB kinase in UV irradiation-damaged cells and that ATR functions upstream of ATM in a pathway leading to CREB phosphorylation. Our findings support the idea that, despite possessing nearly identical substrate specificities in vitro, ATM and ATR may exhibit distinct substrate preferences in vivo.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For the CREB and γH2AX immunostaining, JM fibroblasts were treated with 10 gray IR or mock-irradiated. 1 hr post-treatment, soluble nucleoplasmic protein was extracted from the cells as described previously (52Andegeko Y.

The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 10 min, washed once with PBS, and blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 2% goat serum. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with α-γH2AX and α-CREB antibodies diluted in blocking solution, washed three times in PBS-T, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG (Caltag) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice in PBS-T, once in PBS, and then mounted onto slides using ProLong (Molecular Probes). A Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope was used to visualize the samples. Differential Phosphorylation of CREB, p53, and CHK1 in Response to DNA Replication Stress—We previously showed that HU and UV light induce the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-121 and that this response is partially dependent on ATR (47Dodson G.E. Shi Y. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34010-34014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with a potentially direct role for ATR as a CREB kinase, wild-type ATR (but not kinase-inactive ATR) phosphorylated recombinant His-tagged CREB in vitro (Fig. 1A). A dose-response curve revealed that CREB was phosphorylated on Ser-121 in intact cells at moderate to high fluxes of UV light; phosphorylation was weakly detected at 10 J/m2 and increased steadily up to a UV irradiation flux of 400 J/m2 (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of the ATR substrate p53 on Ser-15 following UV irradiation damage was qualitatively different. Phosphorylation of p53 was observed using a UV irradiation flux of 5 J/m2, and further increases in UV irradiation dose only modestly enhanced p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). The distinct dose dependences of CREB and p53 phosphorylation following UV light exposure provided an initial indication that the phosphorylation of these substrates might occur through distinct mechanisms. To further explore the mechanism of CREB phosphorylation, we compared the time course of its phosphorylation to that of the canonical ATR substrate CHK1 in response to HU and UV light. HU-induced maximal phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser-317 within 15–30 min (Fig. 2A). In contrast, HU-induced phosphorylation of CREB was weakly detected at 60 min and reached its maximum at 4 h, the last time point examined (Fig. 2B). The UV light-induced phosphorylation of CREB was also temporally delayed in comparison to CHK1. Although UV light-induced CHK1 phosphorylation was maximal within 15–30 min, the phosphorylation of CREB was barely detectable at 30 min but increased steadily up to 4 h post-UV irradiation, at which time phospho-CREB levels were comparable with those observed in IR-treated cells (Fig. 2). In comparison to HU and UV light, IR-induced CREB phosphorylation was much more rapid, with maximal phosphorylation observed within 15–30 min (Fig. 2B). Because CHK1 phosphorylation in response to UV light is tightly linked to ATR activation (17Guo Z.J. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 26Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 27Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), these results imply that the ATR activation status at early time points following UV irradiation exposure does not directly correlate with the level of CREB phosphorylation. ATM Is Required for CREB Phosphorylation in Response to UV Light—The delayed kinetics of CREB phosphorylation in UV irradiation-damaged cells and the apparent lack of correlation between CREB phosphorylation and ATR activation at short time points after UV light exposure caused us to consider the potential role of ATM in this process. The kinetics of ATM autophosphorylation on Ser-1981 were similar to the kinetics of CREB phosphorylation in UV irradiation-damaged HEK293T cells, suggesting the two processes are linked (Fig. 3A). To directly test the contributions of ATM and ATR to UV light-induced CREB phosphorylation, we transfected HEK293T cells with ATM- or ATR-specific siRNAs and measured CREB phosphorylation 2 h after exposure to UV light. An ATM siRNA strongly suppressed CREB phosphorylation in response to UV light, whereas an ATR siRNA partially suppressed CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). The converse result was obtained when measuring the UV light-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser-317 and p53 on Ser-15. In both cases, UV light-induced phosphorylation was strongly suppressed by ATR siRNA, but only weakly inhibited by transfection with ATM siRNA (Fig. 3, B and C). These findings suggest that the UV light-induced phosphorylation of CREB proceeds by an ATM-dependent mechanism that is distinct from that of the canonical ATR substrates p53 and CHK1. The above results suggested that ATM is the major CREB kinase in UV irradiation-damaged cells. To further test this idea, we measured UV light-induced CREB Ser-121 phosphorylation in control (ATM+/+) and ATM-deficient (ATM-/-) MEFs. Whereas CREB Ser-121 phosphorylation was induced within 2 h after exposure of ATM+/+ MEFs to UV irradiation, no detectable phosphorylation of this residue was observed in UV-irradiated ATM-/- MEFs (Fig. 3D). This finding is consistent with the RNAi data and strongly suggests that ATM is the predominant CREB Ser-121 kinase activated by UV light in mammalian cells. UV Light-induced ATM Autophosphorylation Is Partially ATR-dependent—Because the UV light-induced phosphorylation of CREB appeared to be partially ATR-dependent but was completely dependent upon ATM, we hypothesized that ATR may lie upstream of ATM activation in response to UV irradiation damage. To explore this possibility, we transfected HEK293T cells with control or ATR siRNAs and then examined ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981 after exposure to 25 or 50 J/m2 of UV light. We found that lowered levels of ATR correlated with a partial inhibition of ATM Ser-1981 autophosphorylation in response to either dose of UV light (Fig. 4A). The basal autophosphorylation of ATM was also partially suppressed by the ATR siRNA, and similar results were obtained using a vector-based ATR RNAi strategy (data not shown). The partial ATR dependence of ATM autophosphorylation suggested that ATR might directly phosphorylate ATM on Ser-1981 in cellulo. If so, ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1981 should be observed in the absence of ATM catalytic activity. To test this hypothesis, we measured UV light- and IR-induced ATM autophosphorylation in AT1ABR lymphoblasts, which produces a catalytically inactive mutant ATM protein lacking amino acids 2546–2548 (ATM ΔSRI). Despite being catalytically inactive, ATM ΔSRI is targeted to the nucleus and associates with ATM effectors, such as p53, suggesting that this mutant retains a biologically active conformation (53Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Zhang N. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the mutant ATM was expressed at a lower level than wild-type ATM, no detectable phosphorylation of ATM ΔSRI was observed following exposure to either IR or UV light, suggesting that ATM kinase activity is absolutely required for phosphorylation of Ser-1981 (Fig. 4B). This finding argues against a direct role for ATR as an ATM Ser-1981 kinase in mammalian cells and suggests that the effects of ATR on ATM activation following UV irradiation damage are indirect. In this report, we have explored the mechanism of CREB phosphorylation by ATM/ATR kinases in response to genotoxic stress. Using a combination of RNAi and ATM-deficient cell lines, we showed that the phosphorylation of CREB in response to UV light is mediated by a non-canonical, ATM-dependent pathway. This finding challenges the widely held view that ATM and ATR phosphorylate the same substrates in response to DSBs and DNA replication stress, respectively. Although numerous ATM/ATR substrates, including p53, BRCA1, and RAD17, seem to obey these rules (19Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13102-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the delayed phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-121 in response to UV light and HU provided an initial clue that its phosphorylation mechanism might be different. Although ATR phosphorylates CREB in vitro (Fig. 1A), the finding that CREB is not substantially phosphorylated at short time points after HU or UV irradiation exposure, when ATR is fully activated toward CHK1, casts doubt on whether ATR is a relevant CREB kinase in cellulo. ATR RNAi partially suppressed CREB phosphorylation on Ser-121 in response to UV light and HU (Fig. 3B); however, this may reflect an indirect effect of ATR on ATM activation (see below). Thus, although we cannot entirely rule out that ATR contributes to the direct phosphorylation of CREB in DNA-damaged cells, our results implicate ATM as the major CREB Ser-121 kinase. CREB may therefore represent an example of substrate discrimination by ATM and ATR in cellulo. The failure of ATR to phosphorylate CREB at short time points following UV irradiation or HU exposure may reflect different compartmentalization of these two proteins within the nucleus. ATR colocalizes with RPA to DNA damage-induced nuclear foci, which contain DNA repair factors, checkpoint regulators, and ATR substrates, such as BRCA1 (24Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of cellular CREB may be constitutively associated with cognate promoter elements. Immunofluorescence experiments with α-CREB antibodies showed that CREB does not detectably target to γH2AX-positive foci in response to IR treatment (Fig. 5). The phospho-CREB antibodies used in this study are not suitable for immunofluorescence experiments, and we cannot rule out that CREB transiently associates with DNA damage foci prior to its phosphorylation by ATM and/or ATR. 3R. Tibbetts, unpublished data. However, because its activation mechanism involves the release of catalytically active monomers into the nucleoplasm (43Kitagawa R. Bakkenist C.J. McKinnon P.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1423-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), it seems more plausible that ATM phosphorylates CREB distal to sites of DNA damage. On the other hand, ATR activity toward substrates, such as p53, BRCA1, and CHK1, might be spatially restricted to sites of stalled DNA replication as has been proposed previously (24Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This speculative model will require further testing. The results presented here suggest that autophosphorylation of ATM in UV irradiation-damaged cells is partially dependent on ATR, and this likely explains the partial ATR dependence of CREB phosphorylation on Ser-121 (Fig. 3B). The mechanistic basis for the observed ATR dependence is unknown. In principle, ATR could directly phosphorylate ATM on Ser-1981 in vivo. However, the finding that the catalytically inactive ATM ΔSRI mutant was devoid of Ser-1981 phosphorylation in UV irradiation-damaged cells argues against this possibility. Attempts to validate this finding using a catalytically inactive ATM point mutant were hampered by the low transfection efficiency of ATM-/- cells. 4G. Dodson and R. Tibbetts, unpublished data. Nevertheless, the results using the ATM ΔSRI mutant suggest that ATM mediates Ser-1981 phosphorylation in response to UV light and that the effects of ATR on the ATM activation process are indirect. Although the mechanism of ATM activation by UV light is unclear, the relatively delayed kinetics of CREB phosphorylation in UV irradiation-damaged cells suggests that one or more intermediate steps are involved. A recent study demonstrated that the MRE11·RAD50·NBS1 complex is not required for ATM activation in response to UV irradiation (42Difilippantonio S. Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Reina San Martin B. Laethem F.V. Yang Y.P. Petukhova G.V. Eckhaus M. Feigenbaum L. Manova K. Kruhlak M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Sharan S. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which implies that other DNA damage sensors may activate ATM in response to this stimulus. It is possible that ATR participates in the upstream pathways leading to DNA damage processing and ATM activation in mammalian cells."

Recently, in addition to their role in enamel formation, the biological activity of enamel proteins in the process of cell differentiation has recently become widely appreciated. In this study, we examined the biological activity of amelogenin on ameloblast differentiation. Recombinant mouse amelogenin (rm-amelogenin) enhanced the expression of endogenous amelogenin mRNA in a cultured dental epithelial cell line (HAT-7), despite a lack of increased amelogenin promoter activity. To solve this discrepancy, we analyzed the effects of rm-amelogenin on the stability of amelogenin mRNA. The half-life of amelogenin mRNA is extremely short, but in the presence of rm-amelogenin its half-life was extended three times longer than the control. Furthermore, we showed the entry of exogenous fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rm-amelogenin into the cytoplasm of HAT-7 cells. It follows from our results that exogenous amelogenin increases amelogenin mRNA levels through stabilization of mRNA in the cytoplasm of HAT-7 cells. Here we speculated that during differentiation, dental epithelial cells utilize a unique mechanism for increasing the production of amelogenin, the reuptake of secreted amelogenin.

Amelogenin is a major protein of enamel matrix comprising more than 90% of the organic fraction (1Termine J.D. Belcourt A.B. Christner P.J. Conn K.M. Nylen M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9760-9768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed in a tissue-specific manner by ameloblasts, which are of ectodermal origin. Immature enamel contains a complex mixture of amelogenin polypeptides, primarily due to the combined effects of alternative RNA splicing (2Lau E.C. Simmer J.P. Bringas Jr., P. Hsu D.D. Hu C.C.

It has been suggested that amelogenins are essential for the organization of the crystal pattern and the regulation of enamel thickness (10Gibson C.W. Yuan Z.A. Hall B. Longenecker G. Chen E.

Amelogenin-null mice exhibit a phenotype similar to human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta, in which ameloblast differentiation is normal but an abnormally thin layer of enamel is formed. Recently, the biological activity of the extracellular matrix in the process of cell differentiation has become widely appreciated. A previous study reported that specific amelogenin gene splice products induced expression of bone matrix proteins, bone sialoprotein (BSP), 3The abbreviations used are: BSP, bone sialoprotein; rm, recombinant mouse; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UTR, untranslated region; IEE, inner enamel epithelial; Act D, actinomycin D. 3The abbreviations used are: BSP, bone sialoprotein; rm, recombinant mouse; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UTR, untranslated region; IEE, inner enamel epithelial; Act D, actinomycin D. and BAG-75 in culture and in an implant in vivo (17Veis A. Tompkins K. Alvares K. Wei K. Wang L. Wang X.S. Brownell A.G. Jengh S.-M. Healy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41263-41272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Another study demonstrated that recombinant murine amelogenin slightly enhanced BSP expression in cementoblasts at the lowest dose tested and dramatically decreased BSP expression at the highest dose, indicating that amelogenin is a potential regulator of cementum-associated genes (18Viswanathan H.L. Berry J.E. Forster B.L. Gibson C.W. J. Periodontol. 2003; 74: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A leucine-rich amelogenin peptide was reported to down-regulate osteocalcin and up-regulate osteopontin expression, as well as inhibit the capacity of cementoblasts to form mineral nodules (19Boabaid F. Gibson C.W. Kuehl M.A. Berry J.E. Sneed M.L. Nociti Jr., F.H. Katchburian E. Somerman M.J. J. Periodontol. 2004; 75: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The above studies suggest that in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, amelogenin exhibits specific biological effects on the mesenchyme. Whether amelogenin also has biological activities on dental epithelial cells during differentiation has still not been investigated. Amelogenin is unique in its localization to the X and Y chromosomes in bovine and human and the X-chromosome in mice, rather than in chromosome 4q like many enamel proteins and mineralized associated protein. Amelogenin is produced by ameloblasts and is developmentally regulated both temporally and spatially. Bone morphogenetic proteins are known factors that regulate terminal differentiation of ameloblasts and induce secretion of amelogenin (20Goldberg M. Six N. Decup F. Lasfargues J.J. Salih E. Tompkins K. Veis A. Am. J. Dent. 2003; 16: 66-76PubMed Google Scholar, 21Coin R. Haikel Y. Ruch J.V. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1999; 107: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ameloblastin-null mice exhibit reduced expression of amelogenin, despite normal expression of other enamel proteins (22Fukumoto S. Kiba T. Hall B. Iehara N. Nakamura T. Longenecker G. Krebsbach P.H. Nanci A. Kulkarni A.B. Yamada Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Hence, it is speculated that the expression of amelogenin is regulated by specific molecular mechanisms. In the mouse amelogenin promoter analysis, investigators have identified a minimal promoter (-70/+52) containing a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding site upstream of the TATA box. They demonstrated that the C/EBP-binding site in the proximal region of the mouse amelogenin promoter is necessary not only for C/EBPα-mediated transactivation but also for basal promoter activity in ameloblast-like cells. Furthermore, overexpression of C/EBPα is sufficient to increase the protein level of the endogenous amelogenin gene. These data strongly suggested that C/EBPα plays a key role in the developmentally regulated expression of the amelogenin gene (23Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The same investigator indicated that Msx2 interfered with binding of C/EBPα to its cognate site on the mouse amelogenin minimal promoter by protein-protein interaction (24Zhou Y.L. Lei Y. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29066-29075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms for inducing the expression of amelogenin through cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interaction in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tooth development have not been elucidated. In this study we focused on the effects of amelogenin on the differentiation of dental epithelial cells. We produced recombinant mouse amelogenin (rm-amelogenin) in baculovirus insect cell expression system and administered rm-amelogenin to the dental epithelial cell line HAT-7. Our results indicated that amelogenin protein induces increases in the quantity of amelogenin mRNA through enhancing mRNA stability. Here we described a unique role for amelogenin protein regulating amelogenin mRNA quantity at the post-transcriptional level.

This donor plasmid was transformed into DH10B-T1 (Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, Invitrogen) to generate recombinant baculovirus bacmid DNA. Bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 insect cells using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) to produce recombinant baculovirus. After 60-72-h culture, P1 virus was isolated from transfected cells. Sf9 cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 27 °C. The culture medium consisted of Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen), supplemented by combining with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Sf9 insect cells cultured in serum-free medium, Sf-900 II SFM (Invitrogen), were infected with recombinant baculovirus to produce recombinant amelogenin. The recombinant amelogenin was purified under denaturing conditions by the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification system according to the supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). Purified rm-amelogenin was dialyzed overnight against 0.5% formic acid containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Recombinant protein was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver stain. For Western blotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated with primary antibody, a commercial rabbit anti-amelogenin polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (Kamyia Biomedical Company). After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:2000 (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Recombinant mouse amelogenin dissolved in 0.5% formic acid was neutralized by addition of alkali, incubated for 30 min at 23 °C, and centrifuged (2000 × g) for 20 min at room temperature to pellet precipitated products. After lyophilization the product was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Cell Culture—HAT-7 cells are from a dental epithelial cell line originating from the apical bud of a rat incisor (26Kawano S. Morotomi T. Toyono T. Nakamura N. Uchida T. Ohishi M. Toyoshima K. Harada H. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 409-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR Analysis—The mRNA levels of differentiation-related marker genes were determined by quantitative real time PCR as described previously (27Taguchi T. Xu L.M. Kobayashi H. Taniguchi A. Kataoka K. Tanaka J. Biomaterials. 2004; 26: 1247-1252Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted at various points with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Japan). 4 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. Normalization was performed using the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression as an endogenous control in the same reaction as the gene of interest. The primers for real time PCR were designed with PrimerExpress software (AB Applied Biosystems) based on the sequence of the target gene. The details are as follows: for amelogenin, forward 5′-TGGGAGCCCTGGTTATATCAA-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTGCCTTATCATGCTCTGGT-A-3′; for ameloblastin, forward 5′-TTCACCCAAGGGAGGAGACTT-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCTCCTTTCTCAGGGCCTTTAGT-3′; for keratin 14, forward 5′-GGACCTGAGCCGCATCCT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCACATCTTTGCGGTTCTTC-3′; for Notch 2, forward 5′-GGGATGACTGCAGCGAGAA-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGAGGCCACACGGTCAATA-3′; for FGFR 2b, forward 5′-TTATATAGGGCAGGCCAACCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCTCTCACAGGTGCTTGCTGTT-3′; for alkaline phosphatase, forward 5′-GCAGGATCGGAACGTCAATTA-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCGCTGGAGCCCAGATG-3′; for osteopontin, forward 5′-GTTTTGGGCCCTGAGCTTAGTT-3′ and reverse 5′-AGAAGCGAAATGCTGAAACTTCTAG-3′; for BSP, forward 5′-AACTCAGAGGATCCGGAAACAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GATGATTCTGCCCTCCGTAGTC-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward 5′-GCCCCCAACACTGAGCAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCAGGCCCCTCCTGTTGT-3′; and for BMP-2, forward 5′-CCGTGCTCAGCTTCCATCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGAAGTTTTCCCACTCATT TCT-3′. Amelogenin is a mixture of heteropolypeptides that have been identified in many species. Six alternative splicing variants of amelogenin mRNA have been identified in rat incisor ameloblasts (7Li R. Li W. DenBesten P.K. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 1880-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In HAT-7 cells, we identified by reverse transcription-PCR two types of amelogenin that are in agreement with two of the six described splicing variants (data not shown). All these splicing variants of amelogenin mRNA contain exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, and exon 5, so we designed amelogenin primers within exon 3 and exon 5 to ensure that all amelogenin mRNA splice variants would be detected in HAT-7 cells. Construction of Plasmid and Luciferase Assay—A rat amelogenin promoter driving luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed as described in a previous study (23Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) according to the genomic data base information of rat (GenBank™ accession number NW_048039); the amelogenin promoter sequence was designated P-1730 and the deletion mutants as P-1124, P-464, P-74, and P-48, driving partial exon 1 sequences. The primers used this protocol were designed as follows: for p-2694, forward 5′-CAGACTTGCTAGCGTCATTTGGAATGAATGTATAAC-3′; for pGL3-1124, forward 5′-CAGACTTGCTAGCGAACTGACTTGGTTAATGTTGCT-3′; for pGL3-464, forward 5′-CAGACTTGCTAGCGTGATTGTACAATTCTGAATTCT-3′; for pGL3-74, forward 5′-CAGACTTGCTAGCTTCATTCTGAAACCTGATTGGCT-3′; and for pGL3-48, forward 5′-CAGACTTGCTAGCCTAAGTGCCCTGCATGGTATAAA-3′. The underlined nucleotides represent NheI sites that were incorporated into the primers. The common reverse primer was designed as 5′-ATCGACTCGAGACATACCTTGAGTGTATGCTCAGTG-3′. The underlined nucleotides represent the XhoI site. Rat genomic DNA was extracted from HAT-7 cells with the Blood and Cell Culture DNA mini kit (Qiagen). The full-length p-2694 was cloned from genomic DNA. Deletion mutants were amplified by PCR using p-2694 as template and cloned into the pGL3-Basic Vector (Promega) with NheI and XhoI sites. Because p-2694 sequences contain NheI site at the p-1730 point, the p-1730 fragment was digested from p-2694/NheI, XhoI. The mouse amelogenin expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning a TA cloned pPCR-2.1/amelogenin into the pPCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) using BamHI and NotI sites designed as pCMV-amelogenin. Transient transfection luciferase assays were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Xu L.M. Kurusu Y. Takizawa K. Tanaka J. Matsumoto K. Taniguchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All transfections contained an internal control vector pRL-CMV, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Promoter activity of pGL3-control (Invitrogen) was taken as 100% activity. Analysis of Amelogenin mRNA Stability—The effect of actinomycin D (Act D) on rm-amelogenin-mediated gene expression was examined following Act D treatment using modifications of methods described previously (29Nowak W. Parameswaran N. Hall C.S. Aiyar N. Sparks H.V. Spielman W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1322-C1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, HAT-7 cells were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 24 h to 80% confluency and were subsequently rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 24 h. Next, the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of Act D in the presence or absence of 3 μg/ml of rm-amelogenin. Total RNA was extracted 1 h after Act D treatment, and decreases in mRNA expression were determined by real time PCR as described above. We constructed a rat amelogenin expression plasmid, pCMV-amelogenin (3′-UTR), by cloning rat amelogenin (containing 3′-UTR) and subcloning into the pPCR3.1 expression vector. 200 ng of the pCMV-amelogenin (3′-UTR) plasmid was transfected into HAT-7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 to produce higher expression of amelogenin. The cells were serum-starved and treated with 3 μg of rm-amelogenin for 24 h after overnight transfection. Changes in amelogenin mRNA were determined at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after Act D treatment as described above. RNA degradation curves were obtained by setting at 100% the maximum of mRNA expression at T0 before Act D treatment. mRNA levels remaining at indicated times following T0 are expressed as a percentage of the maximum value. The half-life of amelogenin mRNA was obtained from the logarithmically transformed best fit line by linear regression analysis (30Atasoy U. Curry S.L. Silanes I.L.D. Shyu A.B. Casolaro V. Gorospe M. Stellato C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4369-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Localization of FITC Labeling rm-Amelogenin by HAT-7 Cells—200 μg of rm-amelogenin was precipitated and redissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 m bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5). 20 μl of 1 m bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) was then added. Next, 20 μl of FITC solution (10 mg/ml) was added and incubated with stirring for 1 h on ice. The reaction mixture was passed through a G-50 column to remove excessive FITC. Bovine serum albumin was labeled in the same manner and was used as negative control. The FITC protein labeling kit was purchased from Molecular Probes. For the study of uptake and localization of exogenous amelogenin, FITC-rm-amelogenin was added exogenously to cells at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and followed by a 4-h culture period. The cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Coverslips were mounted, and cells were observed under a laser confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining was performed using ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX (Invitrogen). Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as means ± S.D. Single group comparisons were evaluated by Student's t test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.01 and p < 0.001. Characterization of Recombinant Mouse Amelogenin—To understand the effects of amelogenin on gene expression in dental epithelial cells, we produced rm-amelogenin in a baculovirus-insect cell expression system as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purity of rm-amelogenin was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE visualized with silver stain (Fig. 1 A, left panel) and immunoblotting by using rabbit amelogenin antibody (Fig. 1A, right panel). Multiple protein bands with a molecular mass of 23-33 kDa were visible in the purified amelogenin fraction. In this paper, the recombinant rM180 protein, which was the product of exons 2-3 and 5-7, was produced. Moradian-Oldak et al. (9Moradian-Oldak J. Leung W. Simmer J.P. Zeichner-David M. Fincham A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the C-terminal region of the rM180 was cleaved by a calcium-dependent metalloproteinase. The presence of multiple immunoreactive bands suggested that the rM180 protein is subject to degradative processes in insect cells. However, there was no immunoreactive band in the range of 6-10 kDa (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the leucine-rich amelogenin polypeptide, which has the signaling potential (17Veis A. Tompkins K. Alvares K. Wei K. Wang L. Wang X.S. Brownell A.G. Jengh S.-M. Healy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41263-41272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), does not contain our produced amelogenin proteins. To verify further that rm-amelogenin possesses a self-assembly feature, we precipitated rm-amelogenin and observed the protein by scanning electron microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” Aggregates precipitated from aqueous solution appeared as short rods (Fig. 1B). Effects of rm-Amelogenin on Gene Expression in HAT-7 Cells—To investigate the effects of rm-amelogenin on dental epithelial cells, we analyzed the mRNA expression levels of various genes in HAT-7 cells in the presence or absence of rm-amelogenin. 3 μg/ml of rm-amelogenin induced up-regulation of endogenous amelogenin mRNA expression in HAT-7 cells (Fig. 2). No significant change in the expression of other genes, such as ameloblastin, was observed; thus amelogenin protein might specifically regulate only amelogenin mRNA expression in HAT-7 cells. Effects of rm-Amelogenin on Amelogenin Gene Promoter Activity—To investigate the effect of rm-amelogenin on the transcriptional activity of the amelogenin gene, we analyzed amelogenin promoter activity by luciferase assay. Deletion mutant analysis of the rat amelogenin promoter as shown in Fig. 3 demonstrated that the -74/-48 region containing a C/EBP element was essential to amelogenin promoter activity, in agreement with a previous report (23Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3, B and C, revealed that there is no significant increase in amelogenin promoter activity under rm-amelogenin treatment or pCMV-amelogenin co-transfection. Effect of rm-Amelogenin on Amelogenin mRNA Stability—Exogenous rm-amelogenin did not induce expression of amelogenin mRNA by regulating transcription; thus the increase in amelogenin mRNA could be caused by decreased degradation of the mRNA. To determine whether this was the case, we investigated the effect of rm-amelogenin on the stability of amelogenin mRNA in HAT-7. Act D, a DNA intercalating agent, is a global inhibitor of new transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I-III (31Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The quantity of amelogenin mRNA as assessed by real time PCR was decreased below detectable levels after 1 h of treatment with Act D (Fig. 4, left panel). However, Act D treatment did not alter amelogenin mRNA level in the presence of rm-amelogenin protein (Fig. 4, right panel). These results suggest that rm-amelogenin protein inhibited degradation of amelogenin mRNA in HAT-7. Next, we tried to estimate the half-life of amelogenin mRNA in HAT-7 cells. However, because the degradation of amelogenin mRNA was very fast, it became undetectable within 1 h. Therefore, we estimated the half-life under conditions where rat amelogenin mRNA was overexpressed by transfection of cells with pCMV-rat amelogenin (3′-UTR) constructs. We determined the half-life of amelogenin mRNA to be about 5 h; however, in the presence of rm-amelogenin, the half-life was extended to about 16 h (Fig. 5). These results indicate that exogenous rm-amelogenin could inhibit degradation of amelogenin mRNA. In other words, amelogenin protein improved the stability of amelogenin mRNA.FIGURE 5Effect of rm-amelogenin on amelogenin mRNA stability. 24 h after transfection with pCMV-amelogenin (3′-UTR) plasmid (200 ng), HAT-7 cells were serum-starved and treated with rm-amelogenin (3 μg/ml) overnight. The amount of amelogenin mRNA remaining was determined at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after Act D treatment. Closed circles represent no treatment. Open circles represent rm-amelogenin treatment. The horizontal dotted line indicates the value of the mRNA half-life in each group. The results are representative of three separate experiments. Error bars indicate the mean ± S.D. *, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Localization of rm-Amelogenin in HAT-7 Cells—Exogenous rm-amelogenin would only be able to stabilize amelogenin mRNA in the cytoplasm, so we investigated localization of rm-amelogenin in HAT-7 cells. FITC-labeled recombinant mouse amelogenin was added to the culture medium of HAT-7 cells for 4 h. Confocal microscopy showed readily detectable levels of FITC-rm-amelogenin in the cytoplasm of HAT-7 cells. The strongest intensity of FITC-rm-amelogenin was localized around the nuclei specially adjacent to ER (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that amelogenin acts intracellularly on amelogenin mRNA directly or on some kind of target to regulate amelogenin mRNA. Amelogenin, a major protein of the enamel matrix produced by ameloblasts, is known to play role in the regulation of mineralization of enamel. In recent years, it has been reported that amelogenin regulates gene expression in the differentiation of some mesenchymal cells, e.g. cementoblasts (18Viswanathan H.L. Berry J.E. Forster B.L. Gibson C.W. J. Periodontol. 2003; 74: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Boabaid F. Gibson C.W. Kuehl M.A. Berry J.E. Sneed M.L. Nociti Jr., F.H. Katchburian E. Somerman M.J. J. Periodontol. 2004; 75: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that extracellular amelogenin protein enhanced the expression of amelogenin mRNA in dental epithelial cells (HAT-7 cells). Several laboratories showed that the amelogenin was detected in the cytoplasm lysosome and stippled material-like substance adjacent to the coated pits of plasma membrane in presecretory ameloblasts and odontoblasts, suggesting that it is likely that amelogenin might be taken up by an endocytic pathway (32Inai T. Kukita T. Ohsaki Y. Nagata K. Kukita A. Kurisu K. Anat. Rec. 1991; 229: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura M. Bringas Jr., P. Nanci A. Zeichner-David M. Ashdown B. Slavkin H.C. Anat. Rec. 1994; 238: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Zeichner-David M. Diekwisch T. Fincham A.G. Lau E.C. MacDougall M. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 69-92PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, some integral membrane proteins binding amelogenin have been identified by using the yeast two-hybrid assay (35Wang H. Tannukit S. Zhu D. Snead M.L. Paine M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1032-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the amelogenin proteins are taken up by the endocytic pathway of amelogenin into the HAT-7 cells via these binding molecules. The means by which amelogenin exerts its biological function could be viewed as either an extracellular signaling event or as an intracellular event. Furthermore, our findings showing the localization of rm-amelogenin adjacent to the ER suggest that amelogenin acts intracellularly on amelogenin mRNA or on some kind of targets to regulate amelogenin mRNA. In studies on the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of amelogenin, some specific activators and/or repressors regulating the transcription of the amelogenin gene have been discovered. C/EBPs have been identified as transactivators of the mouse amelogenin gene (23Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and Msx2 has been associated with C/EBPs as a transcriptional repressor (24Zhou Y.L. Lei Y. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29066-29075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A recent study had indicated that DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1) secreted by osteoblasts up-regulates osteocalcin mRNA during early differentiation of osteoblasts (36Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism is different from that of amelogenin, because in the reporter gene assay studied, using the osteocalcin promoter showed that DMP1 served as a transcription factor. We have found that amelogenin must not interact with transcription factors or promoter region of amelogenin directly or indirectly, because amelogenin had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the mRNA. In our study, the estimation of the half-life of amelogenin mRNA suggested that rm-amelogenin interacted with amelogenin mRNA directly and/or indirectly and had an effect on its stability. Post-transcriptional regulation utilizing changes in mRNA stability is conserved in virtually all organisms from bacteria to mammals. The quantities of particular mRNA can fluctuate many fold based on mRNA stability without any change in transcription. The processes regulating mRNA stability can thus affect cell growth and differentiation and respond to its environment (37Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that dental epithelial cells take extracellular amelogenin into the cytoplasm and increase the stability of amelogenin mRNA. It could be speculated that in vivo, in an autocrine fashion ameloblasts are able to dramatically increase production of amelogenin. Indeed, ameloblasts must secrete a large amount of amelogenin for enamel formation, considerably more than the other enamel matrix protein, during the short periods of tooth development. Amelogenin production in IEE cells was much less than that in differentiated ameloblasts during mouse incisor development. When dentin matrix is formed between the inner enamel epithelium and the mesenchymal cells, amelogenin accumulates at the proximal side of the inner enamel epithelium. The deposition of amelogenin helps IEE cells reuptake amelogenin into the cytoplasm. Consequently, IEE cells rapidly accelerate production of amelogenin. The analysis of ameloblastin-null mice showed that ameloblastin plays the role of cell adhesion molecule after degradation of the basement membrane during dental epithelial differentiation. In ameloblastin-null mice, only expression of amelogenin mRNA exhibits significant reductions but that of the other enamel proteins, such as tuftelin, enamelin, and enamelysin, remains unchanged (22Fukumoto S. Kiba T. Hall B. Iehara N. Nakamura T. Longenecker G. Krebsbach P.H. Nanci A. Kulkarni A.B. Yamada Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We speculate that because ameloblasts lack contact with the enamel matrix, they cannot reuptake extracellular amelogenin. Taken together, we propose a unique biological function of amelogenin in enhancing the expression of amelogenin through stabilizing amelogenin mRNA. However, the molecular mechanisms for the induction and/or regulation of amelogenin have not been elucidated yet. It has been reported that some transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, including bone morphogenetic proteins, induce the expression of amelogenin, but its expression is much less sensitive to transforming growth factor-β superfamily members than other enamel proteins and proteins associated with bone calcification (21Coin R. Haikel Y. Ruch J.V. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1999; 107: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, the localization of the amelogenin gene on the X chromosome is significantly different from that of other proteins. Therefore, we speculate that dental epithelial cells with regulatory mechanisms governing amelogenin expression are different from other enamel proteins, which is a matter to be elucidated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2017969722,"The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor is a heterodimer of a family B G-protein-coupled receptor, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), and the accessory protein receptor activity modifying protein 1. It couples to G(s), but it is not known which intracellular loops mediate this. We have identified the boundaries of this loop based on the relative position and length of the juxtamembrane transmembrane regions 3 and 4. The loop has been analyzed by systematic mutagenesis of all residues to alanine, measuring cAMP accumulation, CGRP affinity, and receptor expression. Unlike rhodopsin, ICL2 of the CGRP receptor plays a part in the conformational switch after agonist interaction. His-216 and Lys-227 were essential for a functional CGRP-induced cAMP response. The effect of (H216A)CLR is due to a disruption to the cell surface transport or surface stability of the mutant receptor. In contrast, (K227A)CLR had wild-type expression and agonist affinity, suggesting a direct disruption to the downstream signal transduction mechanism of the CGRP receptor. Modeling suggests that the loop undergoes a significant shift in position during receptor activation, exposing a potential G-protein binding pocket. Lys-227 changes position to point into the pocket, potentially allowing it to interact with bound G-proteins. His-216 occupies a position similar to that of Tyr-136 in bovine rhodopsin, part of the DRY motif of the latter receptor. This is the first comprehensive analysis of an entire intracellular loop within the calcitonin family of G-protein-coupled receptor. These data help to define the structural and functional characteristics of the CGRP-receptor and of family B G-protein-coupled receptors in general."
https://openalex.org/W1979779413,"Two enzymes, protein phosphatase 2A and atypical protein kinase C, are associated with the tight junction and regulate its function. For example, phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin is required for its incorporation into the junction. The association of a kinase and phosphatase with the tight junction suggests that a balance between their activities exists and is required for normal tight junction function. This hypothesis predicts that loss of epithelial integrity may disrupt this balance in such a way as to facilitate restoration of epithelial integrity. Our previous data have shown that apically localized growth factors segregate from their basolaterally localized erbB receptors. Loss of epithelial integrity allows ligand access to the basolateral membrane where it immediately binds to and activates erbB receptors. We found that activation of erbB1 leads to phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 2A, inhibiting its activity. Importantly, this phosphorylation event was dependent on factors in the overlying airway surface liquid; washing away this liquid prevented phosphorylation. erbB1-mediated inhibition of phosphatase activity would shift the balance in favor of the kinase such that tight junction proteins would regain their phosphorylation, allowing for their incorporation into the junction complex.

This mechanism provides a rapid means of sensing the loss of epithelial integrity and subsequently restoring barrier function. Polarized epithelia line the cavities of the body, forming a physical barrier between the external environment and the body compartments. Essential to the function of an epithelium is its polarity. Cellular polarity is established and maintained by cell-cell adhesion junctions, including the tight junction and the adherens junction. We have previously demonstrated that maintenance of barrier function is required for silencing signaling cascades in differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Among these is heregulin-α, a ligand for the family of erbB tyrosine kinase receptors that localize to the basolateral membrane in airway epithelia. This arrangement allows for receptor activation the instant epithelial integrity is compromised. In the presence of intact tight junctions, erbB receptors are silent (not phosphorylated). Disruption of cell-cell junctions allows ASL factors immediate access to the basolateral membrane, resulting in erbB receptor activation. Receptor activation triggers signaling cascades involved in injury repair. Following restoration of epithelial integrity, heregulin-α regains its restriction to the ASL, and erbB receptors are once again silenced. These data emphasize the importance of epithelial polarity and the cell-cell adhesion junctions that maintain it. In the absence of tight junctions, polarity ceases to exist and erbB signaling cascades become activated. Such aberrant signaling can lead to many downstream effects, including cellular proliferation, migration, and even apoptosis.

The presence of a kinase and phosphatase, two enzymes with opposing activities, suggests they may regulate the tight junction complex. Moreover, their localization at the tight junction leaves them poised to immediately sense and signal the loss of epithelial integrity. In fact, Suzuki et al. (4Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T.

In fact, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, the major cause of diarrhea worldwide, dephosphorylates occludin causing its dissociation from intestinal epithelial tight junctions and increasing transepithelial conductance (7Simonovic I.

Importantly, this effect was inhibited by calyculin A, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, suggesting that as a consequence of infection a serine/threonine phosphatase had been activated. Similarly, Nunbhakdi-Craig et al. (2Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Machleidt T. Ogris E. Bellotto D. White III, C.L. Sontag E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of PP2A promotes tight junction protein phosphorylation and assembly. Conversely, increasing PP2A activity decreases phosphorylation of tight junction proteins while increasing transepithelial conductance and paracellular permeability (2Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Machleidt T. Ogris E. Bellotto D. White III, C.L. Sontag E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that both aPKC and PP2A activities regulate the state and function of the tight junction. Therefore, we hypothesized that a balance exists between aPKC and PP2A activity such that at equilibrium the tight junction complex is intact and functional. This hypothesis predicts that any shifts in this balance would alter epithelial integrity. Given the essential roles of cell-cell adhesion junctions in the establishment and maintenance of polarity as well as their function as barriers against infection, we wondered whether the junction itself is able to sense the loss of integrity and respond in such a way as to restore it. Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cell Culture Model—Airway epithelial cells were isolated from trachea and bronchi of donor lungs. Cells were seeded onto collagen-coated, semipermeable membranes (0.6 cm2 Millicell-HA; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and grown at an air-liquid interface as previously described (8Zabner J. Wadsworth S.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 458-465PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Chun S.Y. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J.

Epithelial Cell Culture Protocols. 188. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 115-137Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium that was supplemented with a serum substitute, 2% Ultroser G, (BioSepra; Villeneuve, La Garenne, France) and 100 milliunits/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 10 mg/ml of gentamicin. Basolateral culture medium was changed every 2-4 days. Samples were collected with approval from the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Lysate was made by incubation in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3V04, 10 mm NaPPi, 100 mm NaF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin) with 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C. Prior to lysis, some cultures were first treated with 10 mm EGTA to decrease transepithelial resistance. Lysate and cells were collected, homogenized for 30 s, and following a 1500-rpm spin, the soluble fraction was incubated with antibody for immunoprecipitation for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation, protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) was added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Complexed proteins were washed several times, eluted with sample buffer (4% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 0.065 m Tris, pH 6.8), and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h followed by three washes in 1× TTBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Tris, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated with antibody for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washes in 1× TTBS. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and used at 1:10,000 for 1 h. Bound antibody was detected with SuperSignal solution (Pierce) and exposed to film (Kodak Scientific Imaging Film, X-OMAT AR; Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Antibodies—For immunoprecipitation, mouse anti-PP2A catalytic α (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) and rabbit anti-claudin-1 (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) were each used at 1:500. For Western blotting the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-occludin (1:500; Zymed Laboratories), mouse anti-PCKλ (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-PP2A catalytic α (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-claudin-1 (1:500; Zymed Laboratories), and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (1:500; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). For immunocytochemistry, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-claudin-1 (1:100; Zymed Laboratories), rabbit anti-occludin (1:100; Zymed Laboratories), and mouse anti-erbB1 (1:100; Transduction Laboratories). Immunocytochemistry—Epithelia were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Following washes, nonspecific binding was blocked with Superblock blocking buffer in PBS (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody (1:100) for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed in PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to fluorophore (1:200; Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Following a rinse, cells were mounted on glass slides, a coverslip was placed with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and samples were studied using confocal microscopy (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Ca2+ Chelation and Cytokine Treatment to Disrupt Tight Junctions—Epithelial tight junctions were disrupted by treatment with either 10 mm EGTA at room temperature or a combination of 10 ng/ml of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (Sigma) and 100 ng/ml of interferon-γ (IFNγ) (Sigma) with or without 1 nm okadaic acid (Sigma) for several days at 37 °C. Transepithelial electrical resistance (Rt) was measured with an ohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT) and monitored until it increased to background levels. Phosphatase Assay—Lysate was generated by incubation in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 0.4% deoxycholate) for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysate was sonicated and spun at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the catalytic subunit of PP2A (mouse anti-PP2A catalytic α, 1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (Pierce) was added and the immunoprecipitation returned to 4 °C for 30 min. Pelleted beads were washed several times with ice-cold wash buffer (250 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin) and a final wash with ice-cold phosphatase-free dH2O. Beads were pelleted and the supernatant discarded. Fifty microliters of assay buffer (165 μm imidazole, pH 7.2, 660 μm EDTA, 0.066% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.066% bovine serum albumin) containing 330 μm RRA(pT)VA synthetic phospho-peptide (Promega, Madison, WI) were added to the beads and incubated with rocking for 2 h at room temperature. Following incubation, beads were again pelleted and the supernatant transferred to a 96-well plate. An equal volume of molybdate/malachite green dye solution was added (Promega) to each well and incubated for 15-30 min at room temperature. Optical densities were measured at 600 nm. A standard curve using free phosphate was generated for every run. Controls included the addition of 1 nm okadaic acid (negative control), a phosphatase inhibitor, to all conditions and addition of increasing concentrations of purified PP2A (positive control) to 200 μm phospho-peptide. Reverse Transcriptase PCR—RNA isolation was performed using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, epithelia were lysed, precipitated with ethanol, RNA-bound to a filter, and washed several times followed by elution. RNA was reverse transcribed with Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen). Controls included the omission of RT. The generated cDNA was then used as the template in PCR reactions using erbB ligand-specific primers. The erbB ligand-specific forward and reverse primers for betacellulin, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, epiregulin, heregulin-α, and amphiregulin were used. Following heat denaturation, DNA was amplified in an Eppendorf Mastercycler thermocycler (Westbury, NY) as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s for 40 cycles followed by a 72 °C postdwell for 2 min. Amplified DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and imaged (Polaroid, Cambridge, MA) under UV light. Unphosphorylated PP2A Is Associated with Tight Junction Proteins in Differentiated Human Airway Epithelia—To study the cellular mechanisms regulating the integrity of tight junctions in epithelia, we characterized the tight junction in our model system of primary cultures of differentiated human airway epithelia as well as in Calu-3 cells, a pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line that forms epithelia. In both these systems, cells are grown at the air-liquid interface. Though the tight junction is composed of a large complex of proteins (12Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), our studies focused on occludin, claudin-1, PP2A, and aPKCλ. Following immunoprecipitation of PP2A, Western blot analysis showed that occludin, claudin-1, and aPKC co-immunoprecipitated with PP2A, suggesting all four proteins form a complex in airway epithelia (Fig. 1A). Similarly, occludin and claudin-1 co-immunoprecipitate from intact epithelia (Fig. 1B). Studies by Guo et al. (13Guo H. Damuni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Chen et al. (14Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Chen et al. (15Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) suggested that the catalytic subunit of PP2A can be tyrosine phosphorylated. Based on these data, we asked what is the phosphorylation status of PP2A in intact epithelia. Fig. 2A shows that when tight junctions are undisturbed, the catalytic subunit of PP2A is not tyrosine phosphorylated. Compromised Epithelial Integrity Dissociates the Tight Junction Complex—Diseases of the airway are generally associated with loss of epithelial barrier function, suggesting that the maintenance of barrier function is critical for normal respiratory physiology. Maintenance of epithelial barrier function is directly related to the state of the tight junction. Therefore, we asked what is the state of the tight junction complex when epithelial integrity is compromised. Calcium chelation with EGTA leads to a decrease in transepithelial resistance (16Tobey N.A. Argote C.M. Hosseini S.S. Orlando R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G1042-G1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a hallmark of compromised barrier function. Fig. 1 shows that following EGTA treatment, PP2A no longer associates with occludin, claudin-1, or aPKC, suggesting that disrupting epithelial integrity is associated with dissociation of the tight junction complex. The co-immunoprecipitation of occludin and claudin-1 is similarly lost following EGTA (Fig. 1B). Compromised Epithelial Integrity Leads to Phosphorylation of PPSA—As mentioned above, PP2A activity can be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, EGF stimulation of cells overexpressing erbB1 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A and inhibition of its phosphatase activity (14Chen J. Parsons S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). erbB receptors localize to the basolateral membrane in intact airway epithelia where they are inactive. However, loss of epithelial integrity leads to erbB receptor activation (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, loss of epithelial integrity correlates with disruption of the tight junction complex. Because this also activates erbB1, we asked whether an additional consequence is the tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A. To specifically activate erbB1, epithelia were first treated with EGTA and then stimulated with EGF. Fig. 2A shows that under this condition, PP2A was tyrosine phosphorylated. Interestingly, basolateral EGF treatment alone was not sufficient to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A (data not shown), suggesting that PP2A remains complexed at the tight junction and inaccessible to phosphorylation by activated erbB1. These data also suggest a geographical relationship exists between erbB1 and PP2A. To study this more closely, intact or EGTA-treated epithelia were immunostained and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2D shows that in intact epithelia erbB1 predominantly localizes basal to the tight junction as previously demonstrated (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Though PKC immunolocalizes to areas within the cytoplasm, as well as at the apical surface, some also localizes to cell-cell junctions. This is most clearly visualized en face (Fig. 2E). Likewise, though PP2A immunolocalizes to several cellular sites, some also localizes to the tight junction (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, following EGTA treatment, though PKC remains at cell-cell junctions, the level of immunostaining of PP2A in this region seems to significantly diminish. Similarly, EGTA treatment leads to a change in erbB1 localization. These immunolocalization data suggest that a breakdown of the junction mediated by EGTA changes the geographical relationships between aPKC, PP2A, and erbB1. Thus, the inability of basolateral EGF stimulation of intact cultures to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A suggests that the EGTA-mediated rearrangement is required for erbB1 to access and phosphorylate PP2A. In airway epithelia, tight junctions restrict erbB-activating ligands to the apical surface, within the ASL, a thin layer of fluid overlying the epithelia. Disruption of tight junctions allows these factors access to their basolaterally localized erbB receptors, leading to receptor activation (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These data predict that EGTA treatment alone should be sufficient to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A. To test this hypothesis, the ASL of primary cultures was removed by several washes of the apical surface. In control cultures, the ASL remained undisturbed. Both sets of epithelia were then basolaterally treated with EGTA. Basolateral treatment allowed for disruption of tight junctions without dilution of the endogenous apical ASL. Under these conditions we found that PP2A was tyrosine phosphorylated in those epithelia where the ASL was present (Fig. 2B). Washing away of the ASL resulted in a weakened signal. These data suggest that disruptions of epithelial integrity activate a system (or systems) that result in tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A. Based on our data and that of others (15Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), this system likely includes erbB receptors. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PP2A Decreases Its Activity—Phosphorylation of PP2A has been associated with inhibition of its activity (13Guo H. Damuni Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). To determine the functional consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A in airway epithelia, phosphatase assays were performed. In this assay, a synthetic peptide containing serine- and threonine-phosphorylated residues is incubated with immunoprecipitated PP2A. PP2A activity leads to phosphate release that, when combined with a molybdate/malachite green solution, results in a color change easily quantified by optical density. Fig. 2F shows that when epithelia were basolaterally treated with EGTA, PP2A activity decreased to ∼50% of control untreated epithelia. It is important to note that immunoprecipitation of PP2A would pull down total cellular PP2A, only a small fraction of which associates with the tight junction. Therefore, complete loss of PP2A activity was not expected (or generated). We hypothesize that the PP2A activity remaining in treated cultures comes from non-tight junction-associated PP2A. However, the assay does not allow for experimental distinction of these different PP2A populations. These data suggest that loss of epithelial integrity results in inhibition of PP2A activity. Inflammation Activates erbB Receptors—Diseases of the airway characterized by compromised barrier function are generally associated with inflammation. In fact, Coyne et al. (17Coyne C.B. Vanhook M.K. Gambling T.M. Carson J.L. Boucher R.C. Johnson L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3218-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of airway epithelia with the inflammatory cytokines TNFα/IFNγ leads to decrease in transepithelial resistance in vitro. Similarly, we found that 48 h of TNFα/IFNγ treatment significantly reduced transepithelial resistance (Fig. 3A). In addition, our data demonstrating disruption of the tight junction complex following EGTA treatment (Fig. 1) predict that the localization of tight junction proteins would also be altered under conditions that compromise integrity, including TNFα/IFNγ treatment. Fig. 3B shows that the localization of both occludin and claudin-1 is altered following TNFα/IFNγ treatment. An additional consequence of compromised epithelial integrity is the activation of erbB receptors. We have previously demonstrated that EGTA treatment, as well as mechanical injury, leads to erbB receptor activation (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As expected, treatment with TNFα/IFNγ also leads to erbB receptor activation. Fig. 3C shows the presence of phosphorylated (activated) erbB1 following TNFα/IFNγ, EGTA, and mechanical injury. In the presence of intact junctions, erbB1 was not phosphorylated. These data suggest that any interventions that compromise epithelial integrity (and thus the tight junction), including inflammation, lead to activation of erbB1. Activation of PKC-λ with 20 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for up to 5 days resulted in a time-dependent increase in Rt from 858 ± 41 Ω.cm2 at baseline to 1771 ± 64 Ω.cm2 by day 5 (p <0.01). After 5 days, untreated epithelia showed a resistance of 1276 ± 46 Ω.cm2 (p <0.01 compared with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). However, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate has been shown to decrease amiloride-sensitive sodium currents, and thus we cannot conclude that the increase in Rt is solely due to an effect on the paracellular pathway (18Yamagata T. Yamagata Y. Nishimoto T. Nakanishi M. Nakanishi H. Minakata Y. Mune M. Yukawa S. Exp. Lung Res. 2002; 28: 543-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We wondered whether, like EGTA, TNFα/IFNγ treatment would lead to inhibition of PP2A activity. Fig. 3D shows that these inflammatory cytokines decrease PP2A activity to the same level as EGTA treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that inflammatory-mediated loss of epithelial integrity also functionally compromises PP2A activity. As a further test, we asked whether inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid could reverse the effect of TNFα/IFNγ on transepithelial resistance. Fig. 3E shows that inclusion of 1 nm okadaic acid to TNFα/IFNγ in the medium successfully inhibited the inflammatory-mediated alteration in epithelial resistance. erbB1-activating Ligands Are Expressed Apically in Airway Epithelia—The intimate association between tight junction integrity and silencing/activation of the erbB receptors (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) prompted us to hypothesize that signaling between these two systems is essential for sensing and regulating epithelial integrity. Based on the demonstrated ability of erbB1 to tyrosine phosphorylate PP2A (15Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), we focused on erbB1. It should be stressed, however, that in airway epithelia all four erbB receptors are expressed and redundant functions are likely, including the regulation of PP2A activity. In fact, phosphatase assays were performed following EGTA treatment in the presence of PD153035, an inhibitor of erbB1 tyrosine kinase activity. However, despite this inhibition, PP2A activity was still decreased to the same degree as in untreated controls (data not shown). These data suggest that other erbB receptors or other systems are able to inhibit PP2A activity following the loss of epithelial integrity. Our previous work demonstrated that airway epithelia lack EGF, a ligand for erbB1. Therefore, we wondered what, if any, erbB1-activating ligands were expressed by airway epithelia. RT-PCR demonstrated that transcripts for TGF-α, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, epiregulin, and amphiregulin are present (Fig. 4A). Transcript for betacellulin was absent. Heregulin-α, the ligand for erbB3 and -4, was included as a positive control (1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Given that erbB1 is not phosphorylated (activated) in intact epithelia (Fig. 3C), erbB1-activating ligands must be apically localized. Immunolocalization of amphiregulin (Fig. 4B) confirmed this prediction. These data suggest that several erbB1-activating ligands are expressed by the airway and sorted apically. erbB1 Signaling Maintained until Epithelial Integrity Restored—Taken together, the above data suggest a mechanism that instantly signals the loss of epithelial integrity, possibly via erbB receptor activation. This system relies on the availability of ligands in the ASL. Therefore, we wondered whether chronic inflammatory conditions (such as are present in cystic fibrosis and asthma) might, in time, deplete ASL ligands and short-circuit this regulatory mechanism. Given the importance of sensing loss of integrity, we hypothesized that erbB1 activation triggers either ligand synthesis, release of intracellular ligand stores, or cleavage of transmembrane ligand precursors to ensure the continued presence of ligand. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the levels of one erbB1 ligand at steady state. Fig. 5 shows enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data from human airway epithelial cell lysate demonstrating low levels of TGF-α (∼10 pg/ml). Analysis of several other donors suggested variability in TGF-α levels ranging from low to undetectable (data not shown). Interestingly, when the erbB1 was activated by basolaterally administered ligand for 24 h prior to assay, TGF-α levels increased significantly (to ∼25-30 pg/ml). These data suggest that activation of the erbB1 initiates a signaling cascade(s) that increases the availability of at least one of its own ligands, TGF-α. Such a cyclic system could serve to ensure continued erbB1 activation until restoration of tight junction integrity is completed. Restoration of integrity silences erbB signaling by restricting ligand access to receptor. Here we have described a mechanism utilized by polarized airway epithelia able to immediately detect the loss of epithelial integrity while simultaneously activating signaling cascades to quickly restore tight junction competency. Such a system serves a protective function for epithelia where even a transient loss of tight junction function leaves the epithelium vulnerable to environmental insults (e.g. bacterial, viral, allergen). Therefore, the ability to sense and restore barrier function is essential for normal respiratory function. The presence of aPKC and PP2A at the tight junction positions these signaling molecules at a pivotal location where they not only function to maintain tight junction proteins at the membrane and as components of the complex but also work in reassembly of the tight junction following an insult. We have shown that in primary cultures of differentiated human airway epithelia, occludin, claudin-1, PP2A, and aPKC form a complex localized at cell-cell junctions. When epithelia are intact, tight junction proteins co-immunoprecipitate, demonstrating the presence of a complex (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that some expressed aPKC and PP2A localize to cell-cell junctions (Fig. 2C). The loss of epithelial integrity correlates with the loss of co-immunoprecipitation of these junctional proteins, demonstrating a breakdown of the complex (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, though EGTA treatment decreased the amount of PP2A localized at cell-cell junctions, aPKC junctional localization remained unchanged (Fig. 2C). We speculate that its retention may be required to direct newly phosphorylated junctional proteins to the appropriate contact site. EGTA treatment, though effective, remains an in vitro tool with little physiologic relevance. Therefore, we tested whether two inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IFNγ, were able to alter transepithelial resistance as previously demonstrated by Coyne et al. (17Coyne C.B. Vanhook M.K. Gambling T.M. Carson J.L. Boucher R.C. Johnson L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3218-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cytokine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in Rt (Fig. 3A). In addition when immunolocalized, occludin and claudin-1 staining was absent in the majority of TNFα/IFNγ-treated cells. This was in stark contrast to control cells where occludin and claudin-1 expression was evident at all cell-cell contacts in a characteristic chicken wire pattern (Fig. 3B). These changes could account for the decrease in Rt. Importantly, inclusion of okadaic acid to the cytokine mixture reversed their effect on Rt, again (Fig. 3E) supporting a role of phosphatase activity in the regulation of epithelial integrity. Loss of epithelial integrity allows ASL growth factors access to their basolaterally localized receptors. Here, we have shown phosphorylation of erbB1 following mechanical injury and EGTA and TNFα/IFNγ treatment, all of which decrease transepithelial resistance (Fig. 2 and Ref. 1Vermeer P.D. Einwalter L.A. Moninger T. Rokhlina T. Kern J.A. Zabner J. Welsh M. Nature. 2003; 422: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Importantly, in controls where the tight junctions are intact, erbB1 is silenced (not phosphorylated). Based on the report of Chen et al. (15Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) demonstrating tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A by erbB1, we wondered whether a consequence of erbB1 activation in epithelia was the phosphorylation of PP2A. We have shown that PP2A was tyrosine phosphorylated only following the loss of epithelial integrity (Fig. 2A) and was dependent on the presence of ASL factors (Fig. 2B). Moreover, phosphorylation of PP2A also correlated with a decrease in its activity (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data suggest that ASL-dependent activation of the erbB receptors leads to phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of PP2A. Our initial hypothesis was that a balance exists between PP2A and aPKC activities when epithelial integrity is intact. Thus, the inhibition of PP2A activity would disrupt this balance and increase the rate of tight junction reassembly by shifting the balance in favor of aPKC activity. In this way, restoration of epithelial integrity is ensured. Our data support this hypothesis. The literature suggests that erbB1 activation is required for the regulation of PP2A activity. However, when erbB1 tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited with PD153035, basolateral EGTA treatment still resulted in decreased PP2A activity (data not shown), suggesting that other erbB receptors also regulate PP2A activity. Given the importance of maintaining airway epithelial barrier function intact, it may not be surprising that redundancy exists in this regulatory mechanism. Though ASL factors are present at equilibrium and able to activate erbB receptors following loss of integrity, we wondered whether in the context of chronic injury or infection/inflammation, ASL components become depleted and thus ineffective in stimulating receptor activation. Interestingly, we found that though basal TGF-α levels are low in intact epithelia, chronic activation of erbB1 resulted in an increase of TGF-α protein (Fig. 5). This mechanism would ensure the continued supply of ligand, and thus erbB1 activation, until tight junctions are resealed. Once resealed, ASL factors become apically restricted and unable to activate erbB receptors. The receptor is thus silenced. This auto-shutoff mechanism elegantly maintains epithelial polarity regulation. Meyer et al. (19Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Ye J. Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22048-22055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) highlight the roles of tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C in the reassembly of tight junctions. In their reversible model of H2O2-induced disassembly of tight junctions in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, they found that only inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (PP-2 and genistein) and protein kinase C (calphostin C, bisindolymadleimide I, and chelerythrine) were able to inhibit tight junction reassembly. These data support our findings that aPKC and erbB1 activities play a role in tight junction reassembly. The regulatory mechanism described here is similar to that described for the adherens junction. The adherens junction is another specialized cell-cell complex of proteins that lies just below the tight junction. Cadherin proteins form homotypic associations between adjacent cells and are intracellularly linked to the cytoskeleton via association with a complex of proteins, including β-catenin. Xu et al. (20Xu G. Arregui C. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49989-49997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PTP1B, a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase, associates with N-cadherin and regulates the function of the adherens junction via its dephosphorylation of β-catenin. Dephosphorylation of β-catenin stabilizes and maintains the integrity of the adherens junction. In addition to interacting with a phosphatase, the adherens junction complex also associates with a kinase, Fer (21Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Chen Y.M. Lee N.P. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 656-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, phosphorylation of β-catenin by Fer has the opposite effect on the adherens junction as its dephosphorylation by PTP1B, that is dissociation of the adherens junction (23Piedra J. Miravet S. Castano J. Palmer H.G. Heisterkamp N. Garcia de Herreros A. Dunach M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24Arregui C. Pathre P. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1263-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, a balance between kinase and phosphatase activity at the adherens junction also appears to regulate the integrity of this cell-cell adhesion complex. Taken together with the data presented here, the above studies suggest that the regulation of cell-cell adhesion complexes by kinases and phosphatases may be a general mechanism of regulating epithelial integrity. Given the importance of maintaining polarity and barrier function of epithelia, there are likely redundant systems that could compensate for the loss of any one of the components in the mechanism we describe (e.g. erbB1 activity may be compensated for by erbB2-4, also basolaterally localized in the airway epithelium). This study serves to highlight the importance of preserving polarity and the tight junction. Understanding the mechanisms regulating epithelial integrity will identify new therapeutic targets for diseases that compromise epithelial integrity.
