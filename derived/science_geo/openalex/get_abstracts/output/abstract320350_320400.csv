https://openalex.org/W2095051466,"The fate of fossil fuel carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere depends on the exchange rates of carbon between the atmosphere and three major carbon reservoirs, namely, the oceans, shallow-water sediments, and the terrestrial biosphere. Various assumptions and models used to estimate the global carbon budget for the last 20 years are reviewed and evaluated. Several versions of recent atmosphere-ocean models appear to give reliable and mutually consistent estimates for carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans. On the other hand, there is no compelling evidence which establishes that the terrestrial biomass has decreased at a rate comparable to that of fossil fuel combustion over the last two decades, as has been recently claimed."

https://openalex.org/W1982008466,"By utilizing the vapor pressure difference between high-salinity and lowsalinity wvater, one can obtain power from the gradients of salinity. This scheme eliminates the major problems associated with conversion methods in which membranes are used. The method we tested gave higher conversion efficiencies than membrane methods. Furthermore, hardware and techniques being developed for ocean thermal energy conversion may be applied to this approach to salinity gradient energy conversion."

https://openalex.org/W2003546631,"Uranium-lead isotopic data indicate that the granulite-facies Napier complex of Enderby Land, Antarctica, was cut by charnockitic pegmatites 2.5 billion years ago and by pegmatites lacking hypersthene 0.52 billion years ago. The 4-bil-lion-years lead-lead ages (whole rock) reported for the Napier complex are rejected since these leads developed in three stages. Reconstructions of Gondwanaland suggest that the Napier complex may be a continuation of the Archean granulitic terrain of southern India."
https://openalex.org/W2061349368,Seasonal variations in the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 ratio of calcite shells of living planktonic foraminifera in the Sargasso Sea off Bermuda are a direct function of surface water temperature. Seasonal occurrence as well as depth habitat are determining factors in the oxygen isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera. These relationships may be used to determine the seasonal temperature contrast of oceans in the past.
https://openalex.org/W2023872218,"Virtually all plants of economic importance form mycorrhizae. These absorbing organs of higher plants result from a symbiotic union of beneficial soil fungi and feeder roots. In forestry, the manipulation of fungal symbionts ecologically adapted to the planting site can increase survival and growth of forest trees, particularly on adverse sites. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, which occur not only on many trees but also on most cultivated crops, are undoubtedly more important to world food crops. Imperatives for mycorrhizal research in forestry and agriculture are (i) the development of mass inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi, (ii) the interdisciplinary coordination with soil management, plant breeding, cultivation practices, and pest control to ensure maximum survival and development of fungal symbionts in the soil, and (iii) the institution of nursery and field tests to determine the circumstances in which mycorrhizae benefit plant growth in forestry and agri-ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2047941642,"Maps of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Indian Ocean in modern and ice-age times reveal striking changes in its surface circulation. During the last glacial maximum (18,000 years before the present), the Indian Ocean had colder average zonal surface temperatures, a cooler and less extensive Agulhas Current, a distinct eastern boundary current, and decreased upwelling and a weaker southwest monsoon in its northwestern region."

Thermodynamic calculations show that this is a natural consequence of condensation of alloys from the solar nebular gas at a total pressure l0(-5) less, similar P(tot) < l0(-3) atmosphere, provided they failed to equilibrate with it after cooling to < 1200 kelvins."
https://openalex.org/W2001986735,"A profile of measurements of shear stress perpendicular to the San Andreas fault near Palmdale, California, shows a marked increase in stress with distance from the fault. The pattern suggests that shear stress on the fault increases slowly with depth and reaches a value on the order of the average stress released during earthquakes. This result has important implications for both long- and shortterm prediction of large earthquakes."
