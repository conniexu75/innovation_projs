https://openalex.org/W1542243713,"Abstract Methods are described for the extraction, separation, and electrophoretic analysis of a class of acidic nuclear proteins from various tissues of the rat. Such proteins occur in the chromatin and their distribution in diverse nuclear types is tissue specific. Many of the chromosomal acidic proteins are phosphoproteins which incorporate 32P-orthophosphate in vivo with the formation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The patterns of phosphorylation of individual nuclear proteins vary from one tissue to another. Many of the acidic proteins prepared from liver and kidney nuclei of the rat form complexes with rat liver DNA. Binding to the DNA of a closely related species (mouse) also occurs, but to a lesser extent. Little or no binding is observed when rat liver phosphoproteins are added under the same conditions to DNA's from calf thymus, human placenta, dog liver, or bacterial cells (Pneumococcus). Nuclear phosphoproteins stimulate transcription in a cell-free RNA-synthesizing system. Correlations are observed between DNA binding and enhancement of RNA synthesis. DNA-protein complexes have been separated by density gradient centrifugation after annealing has occurred. The nature of the proteins present in the complex depends on the tissue from which the nuclear proteins were isolated."

Apart from polypeptide and protein toxins, it is the most highly toxic substance known, with a lethal dose (LD59) in mice of 0.15 microgram per kilogram by intravenous injection. Unlike the potent toxins batrachotoxin, saxitoxin, and tetrodotoxin which have molecular weights of 500 or less, palytoxin has an estimated molecular weight of 3300 and contains no repetitive amino acid or sugar units."
https://openalex.org/W1577373772,"Abstract The cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase of pea seedlings is a microsomal mixed function oxidase which requires molecular oxygen, NADPH, and 2-mercaptoethanol for activity. Optimal activity occurs at pH 7.5. NADH will not substitute for NADPH. Glutathione, ascorbic acid, cysteine, and dithiothreitol will not replace mercaptoethanol. The latter compound is required in millimolar concentrations for optimal activity but does not serve as an external reductant for the hydroxylation reaction. The Km for cinnamic acid is about 0.02 mm. The enzyme does not catalyze the hydroxylation of either phenylalanine or 4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The product exerts a strong regulatory effect on activity; inhibition commences at about 0.03 mm and increases sharply to a maximum at 0.10 mm, at which more than 90% inhibition may occur. Inhibition is noncompetitive and shows cooperativity with increasing product concentration. The reaction is inhibited by carbon monoxide, and the inhibition is reversed by light. Azide is inhibitory, but cyanide has little effect. The activity of the hydroxylase in etiolated seedlings is increased 5-fold by a brief irradiation about 12 hours before harvest and assay. The enzyme in green seedlings is restricted to young, developing tissues. Activity is highest in the apical bud, declines sharply with the onset of maturity, and is not detected in mature leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1522062387,"Abstract The 5α-reductase enzyme that converts testosterone to 17β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-3-one has been investigated in the rat ventral prostate by utilizing a thin layer chromatographic assay system and 3H-labeled substrates. First, it was demonstrated that approximately half of the enzyme is located in the nuclei, the remainder being found in a cytoplasmic fraction presumed to be endoplasmic reticulum. As is the case for previously described Δ4-3-ketosteroid 5α-oxidoreductases, it was not possible to solubilize the nuclear 5α-reductase, and as a result the subsequent studies were performed either on the nuclei themselves or on NaCl extracts of these nuclei. The enzyme was shown to have a pH optimum of around 6.6, to exhibit an apparent absolute requirement for NADPH as the source of the reducing hydrogen, and to be stable to freezing for long periods but unstable at 37°. The enzyme is potently inhibited by some divalent cations, particularly Hg++, Cu++, and Zn++. The substrate specificity of the enzyme for a variety of Δ4-3-ketosteroids and the ability of these steroids to inhibit the reduction of testosterone-1,2-3H were also investigated, and it was shown that the ability of these steroids to serve as substrates was paralleled by their ability to inhibit the reduction of testosterone-1,2-3H. It was concluded that in contrast to the situation in liver the nucleus of the rat prostate probably contains a single 5α-reductase enzyme and that this enzyme has a rather broad specificity for Δ4-3-ketosteroids that do not contain substitutions on the 11-carbon of the steroid molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1603870937,"Abstract Enzymic synthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogens from 1-14C-hexadecanol in cell-free systems from Ehrlich ascites and preputial gland tumors of mice is documented. Identification of the ethanolamine plasmalogens is based on the preparation and chromatographic behavior of a number of chemical derivatives that take into account all three positions on the glycerol moiety. 14C-Derivatives isolated from intact ethanolamine plasmalogens included (a) hexadecanal liberated by aqueous HCl, (b) dimethylacetals of hexadecanal formed by HCl-methanol treatment, (c) O-alk-1-enylglycerols liberated by reduction with LiAlH4 or NaAlH2(OCH2CH2·OCH3)2, (d) O-alkylglycerols obtained by hydrogenation of O-alk-1-enylglycerols, (e) isopropylidene derivatives of the hydrogenated O-alk-1-enylglycerols, (f) lysoethanolamine plasmalogens after phospholipase A treatment, and (g) dinitrobenzene derivatives of the intact ethanolamine plasmalogens. NaAlH2(OCH2CH2OCH3)2, a new reagent that we used for the reduction of ether-linked glycerolipids, gives better yields of O-alk-1-enylglycerols than LiAlH4. The system used for plasmalogen biosynthesis contained fatty alcohol, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, ATP, coenzyme A, Mg++, NADP+ or NAD+, microsomes, and the soluble fraction from tumors. Soluble fraction from rat liver can replace the soluble fraction from tumors. Data obtained with U-14C-labeled dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 9,10-3H-hexadecanol demonstrated that the 3H:14C ratios in O-alkylglycerols and O-alk-1-enylglycerols (isolated after LiAlH4 reduction) were essentially identical. 1-14C-Palmitic acid was not incorporated into the O-alk-1-enyl moiety and added unlabeled hexadecanal had little effect on plasmalogen biosynthesis. These data, along with the substrate and cofactor requirements, suggest that an O-alkyl glycerolipid was converted to an ethanolamine plasmalogen."
https://openalex.org/W1607349938,"Abstract With slices derived from two areas of guinea pig brain, cerebellum, and cerebrum plus brain stem, we have shown that specific, and different, receptors exist in these two brain areas for the control of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. The cerebellum contains a single type of receptor, shown to be a classical β-adrenergic receptor. The remainder of the brain was shown to have at least two types of receptors mediating increases in cyclic AMP. One, specific for catecholamines, was shown to be a classical α-adrenergic receptor. The other, specific for histamine, could be blocked by a number of antihistaminic agents. This report is the first to show that both α- and β-adrenergic stimulation can increase cyclic AMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1525499807,"Abstract The hydroxylation of γ-butyrobetaine (4-trimethylaminobutyrate) to carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-trimethylaminobutyrate) is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme from rat liver which has been partially purified. The enzyme which previously has been shown to require molecular oxygen and ferrous ion has a specific requirement for 2-ketoglutarate. Several reductants stimulate the formation of hydroxylated product; the most active ones are ascorbate and isoascorbate, whereas reduced 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and 2-amino-5,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine are less active. The previously observed stimulation both by NADPH, isocitrate, isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), and by microsomes has been found to be related to the formation of 2-ketoglutarate. One mole of 2-ketoglutarate is degraded per mole of carnitine formed. Carbon dioxide and succinate are products of 2-ketoglutarate degradation; no free succinic semialdehyde can be detected. Several compounds which are chemically or biologically related to γ-butyrobetaine and to 2-ketoglutarate have been tested as inhibitors in the reaction. Only succinic semialdehyde and 3-trimethylaminopropyl-1-sulfonate are effective inhibitors. The sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoate and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate in 0.1 mm concentration completely inhibit the formation of carnitine after preliminary incubation with the enzyme for 20 min at 37°. N-Ethylmaleimide, iodosobenzoate, and iodoacetate are less effective inhibitors under these conditions, whereas sodium arsenite, carbarsone, and acetarsone cause appreciable inhibition only in 10 mm concentration. Preliminary incubation of the enzyme with ferrous ion and ascorbate results in significantly lower yield of carnitine than when catalase has also been included in the preliminary incubation medium. It is suggested that γ-butyrobetaine is hydroxylated to carnitine simultaneously with the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-ketoglutarate in a reaction sequence which involves the intermediate formation of a peroxide of the two substrates. Ferrous ion might act as oxygen-activating agent. Free sulfhydryl groups are apparently necessary for enzymic activity and ascorbate and catalase probably act by maintaining these groups as well as ferrous ion in the reduced state."

https://openalex.org/W1977076271,"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides catalyzes the oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate by either NADP+ or NAD+. Steady state initial velocity studies and product inhibition studies using NADPH were conducted for the NADP-linked reaction catalyzed by this enzyme. The data were consistent with a simple, ordered, sequential mechanism for this reaction in which NADP+ is bound first to the enzyme and NADPH released last. Kinetic studies of the NAD-linked reaction indicated a more complex mechanism. Initial velocity studies, product, and alternate product inhibitions using NADH and NADPH, respectively, and alternate substrate studies using either NAD+ and NADP+ with glucose 6-phosphate, or glucose 6-phosphate and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate with NAD+, suggested an ordered, sequential mechanism with isomerization of free enzyme. The enzyme form which binds NADH is proposed to be the same form binding NADP+ and NADPH; NAD+ is assumed to bind to an isomeric form. A detailed study of the effect of varying pH from 5.74 to 9.90 was carried out for the NAD-linked reaction. From the changes in kinetic constants with pH some tentative suggestions emerged concerning enzyme groups which may participate in the binding of NAD+ and glucose 6-phosphate. Among these, the most clear-cut was the participation of a group on the enzyme with pK' = 8.9 in binding of glucose 6-phosphate. Evidence was obtained that this group is not a cysteine. Further evidence, using pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, suggested that the group may be the e-NH2 group of a lysine."

https://openalex.org/W1517976100,"Abstract Mitochondrial tyrosine aminotransferase (l-tyrosine + 2-oxoglutarate = p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + l-glutamate, EC 2.6.1.5) has been purified about 900-fold to homogeneity from rat liver and was crystallized. The enzyme is cationic and has a molecular weight of approximately 90,000, determined by amino acid composition and molecular sieve chromatography and of 114,000 by sedimentation analysis. It catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and the reverse reaction. From the reverse direction with p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, the reaction has a 3-fold greater rate with l-glutamate as cosubstrate than with aspartate. In the forward direction with l-tyrosine and α-ketoglutarate or oxaloacetate as cosubstrate, l-aspartate, α-methyl-l-aspartate, and β-methyl-l-aspartate are potent inhibitors. With α-ketoglutarate, amino acids were effective as cosubstrates in the following order of activity: l-aspartate g l-phenylalanine g l-cysteine g l-tyrosine g monoiodo-l-tyrosine = dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine g l-tryptophan g l-methionine = l-asparagine = p-chloro-l-phenylalanine. Evidence based on substrate specificity, inhibition by common substrates, inhibition by specific antibodies upon enzyme activity, and physical chemical properties indicate that the mitochondrial tyrosine aminotransferase is identical with mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (laspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.1). This activity relationship would then distinguish this enzyme from the tyrosine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase found in cytosol on the basis of properties and function."

https://openalex.org/W1485079646,"Abstract Fructose diphosphate and the triose phosphates are known to accumulate in red blood cells when they metabolize glucose at high rates due to the presence of orthophosphate. This has led to the suggestion that either glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase or glycerate phosphate kinase is rate-limiting under these conditions. However, the present work shows, by a study of isotope mixing rates and mass action ratios, that under conditions of triose phosphate accumulation both steps proceed much more rapidly than the limiting rate of lactate production. It is observed that the conditions of triose phosphate accumulation also result in net synthesis of glycerate 2,3-diphosphate and in the occurrence of extremely high ratios of lactate to pyruvate, i.e. DPNH to DPN+, thus explaining how the triose phosphates can be so elevated and yet be at equilibrium. The net synthesis of glycerate 2,3-diphosphate, which requires an unknown endogenous oxidative system, is presumed to occur because the glycerate 1,3-diphosphate level exceeds that of the cell in vivo. This results at high glycolytic rates because the glycerate 1,3-diphosphate steady state concentration is determined by equilibria with the steady state concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, and ATP, which increase, decrease, and increase, respectively, under high glycolytic rate conditions (Rose, I. A., and Warms, J. V. B., J. Biol. Chem., 241, 4848 (1966)). Thus, these effects are not evidence of rate-limiting processes in the utilization of triose phosphates as previously supposed, but rather are consequences of the control of the rates of pyruvate kinase and glycerate diphosphate mutase by the concentration of their substrates and of the inability of the red cell, in vitro, to maintain the DPNH to DPN+ ratio at its in vivo level in the face of net synthesis of glycerate 2,3-diphosphate."

The response is in the right direction to insure that this enzyme, which catalyzes the first step unique to glycogen storage in E. coli, will have appreciable activity only under conditions of energy excess (high energy charge). The positive response to high energy charge is strongly enhanced by reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, and phosphoenolpyruvate. High concentrations of these metabolites seem appropriate as signals for energy storage."

https://openalex.org/W1591742048,"Liver of the rainbow trout and other salmonid fish contains a highly active glucose dehydrogenase which is also active toward glucose-6-P, galactose-6-P, 2-deoxyglucose-6-P, xylose, and galactose. It resembles one of the rat liver hexose-6-P dehydrogenase isozymes in its broad substrate specificity and its electrophoretic migration on starch gel; but differs in some kinetic properties. The enzyme, purified approximately 200-fold, is more active toward glucose than toward glucose-6-P at pH 7.4, but is less active toward glucose than glucose-6-P at pH 10. Km for glucose is 20 to 80 mm, depending on the pH; and for glucose-6-P it ranges from 0.01 to 0.1 mm. Over the pH range of 6.5 to 10.5 the glucose dehydrogenase activity is about the same for NAD+ or NADP+ as coenzyme, but Mg2+ ions are required with NADP+. The enzyme is much more active with NADP+ than NAD+ with glucose 6-phosphate as substrate, but activity with NADP+ is inhibited by Mg2+, whereas activity with NAD+ is unaffected. The enzyme appears to be equally divided between the particulate and soluble fractions. Trout liver also contains two other electrophoretically distinguishable glucose-6-P dehydrogenases, but which differ from this enzyme in their inactivity toward NAD+ and glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2161892616,"Abstract 1. A highly purified transhydrogenase factor (TH1) has been isolated from Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores by washing the membranes first with buffer containing 10 µm NADP+ under conditions in which TH1 remains bound, then with buffer lacking NADP+ resulting in the dissociation of TH1 from the membrane. 2. Purified TH1 stimulated the energy-linked reduction of NADP+ by NADH, the nonenergy-linked reduction of AcPyAD+ by NADPH, and the reduction of AcPyAD+ by NADH in the presence of chromatophores resolved with respect to these activities. TH1 did not catalyze these reactions independently of these resolved chromatophores. 3. The energy-linked reduction of NADP+ by NADH has been demonstrated to occur by the transfer of hydrogen without prior exchange to the medium from the 4A (nicotinamide) locus of NADH to the 4B (nicotinamide) locus of NADPH. This stereospecificity is identical with that found for the analogous mitochondrial reaction. 4. It is concluded that TH1 functions in the transfer of hydrogen between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in both the energy- and nonenergy-linked transhydrogenase reactions."

In the presence of both nucleotides, the Km values for TPNH and for DPNH for all three synthetase complexes are less than 5 µm. By measuring the formation of triacetic acid lactone in the presence of either DPNH or TPNH, it has been possible to show that in M. phlei TPNH is the specific coenzyme for the β-ketoacyl reductase step while DPNH is preferentially utilized in α,β-enoyl reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1496353118,"Abstract 1. The energy-linked transhydrogenase system of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores has been resolved into a water-soluble protein component, the transhydrogenase factor (TH1) and an insoluble membrane component. TH1 was removed from the chromatophore membrane by washing with large volumes of buffer and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. 2. Addition of TH1 to chromatophores depleted of TH1 (Ct-particles) reconstituted energy-linked transhydrogenation to rates observed with unresolved chromatophores. However, TH1 did not stimulate transhydrogenation appreciably in unresolved chromatophores. 3. The formation of a stable complex between TH1 and Ct-particles required the presence of low concentrations of NADP+ or NADPH; half-maximal binding occurred at 0.4 µm and 0.2 µm, respectively. 4. NADPH at concentrations in excess of 10 µm inhibited TH1 binding to Ct-particles, whereas excess NADP+ did not inhibit binding of TH1. NADH did not stimulate TH1 binding, but totally inhibited that supported by NADP+ or NADPH. High concentrations of NADP+ were unable to reverse the inhibition of TH1 binding observed in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides. Dissociation of TH1 from chromatophores was stimulated, whereas the binding of TH1 to Ct-particles was inhibited in the presence of a complete mixture of the components of the transhydrogenase assay medium. NADP+ stabilized the TH1-membrane complex during washing of the chromatophores. These findings suggest that dissociation of TH1 from chromatophores during washing is a result of the removal of membrane-bound pyridine nucleotides. Further indicated is that the TH1-membrane complex is reversibly dissociated during the process of active transhydrogenation."

The results show that the reaction is random with respect to order of substrate addition and that binary complex formation involving either cosubstrate or steroid may occur. Substitution of NADP:NADPH for NAD:NADH produces a marked increase in steroid exchange rates suggesting a decrease in steroid Michaelis constants. Inequality of cosubstrate and steroid exchange rates indicates that chemical transformation is not a rate-limiting step in the over-all reaction. No abortive complex formation was detected."

Acidification of the extract (pH 5.0) resulted in precipitation of approximately 60% of the inert protein. Further treatment with protamine sulfate, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and negative absorption to calcium phosphate gel produced a 24-fold purification over the crude extract. Electrofocusing (pH 4 to 6 range) gave greater than a 1000-fold purification and subsequent column chromatography on Sephadex G-100 removed the Ampholine and remaining proteins from the reductase enzyme. Recovery of aldose reductase units averaged about 57% of those present in the initial extract. Homogeneity of the purified enzyme was indicated by both disc gel electrophoretical and immunological criteria.

https://openalex.org/W1588599483,"Abstract 4-Hydroxysphinganine is the major long chain sphingolipid base of plants and some species of yeast, and it occurs in substantial amounts in mammalian glycosphingolipids. Several studies have provided evidence that sphinganine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 4-hydroxysphinganine, and two mechanisms, which involve the hydration of sphing-4-enine or the direct hydroxylation of sphinganine, have been postulated to account for the hydroxyl group at carbon 4 of the 4-hydroxysphinganine. It has not been possible to obtain active cell-free systems for more detailed investigation of the pathway. Experiments in vivo with yeast (Hansenula ciferri) show that perdeuterated palmitic acid is incorporated into 4-hydroxysphinganine with the loss of only one deuterium atom (an obligatory loss due to replacement by the hydroxyl group at carbon 4), a finding which strongly supports a hydroxylation mechanism and excludes hydration of sphing-4-enine. The yeast incorporates (S)-[2-2H1]palmitic acid into 4-hydroxysphinganine with retention of the deuterium atom, whereas deuterium is completely lost from (R)-[2-2H1]palmitic acid in the conversion. The hydroxylation step therefore proceeds with retention of configuration at carbon 4 of the precursor base. Studies of the incorporation of (R)-[2-2H1]-, (S)-[2-2H1]-, (R)-[3-2H1]-, and (S)-[3-2H1]palmitic acids into sphing-4-enine with a cell-free preparation from H. ciferri show that the pro-R hydrogens of palmitate are removed in the formation of the trans double bond of sphing-4-enine; these data are consistent with a mechanism involving an antiperiplanar elimination process."
https://openalex.org/W1518238285,"Abstract Purified NAD-specified glutamic dehydrogenases from two fungi, Pythium debaryanum and Achlya sp. (1969), have been studied kinetically, and some of their physical properties elucidated. The enzymes are regulated by a multitude of allosteric effectors: NADP+, GTP, short chain acyl-CoA derivatives, P-enolpyruvate, and ATP as activators; citrate, AMP, and long chain CoA derivatives as inhibitors. The kinetic mechanism was determined for activated and non-activated enzymes. In both cases, an ordered binary-ternary mechanism prevailed. The order of substrate addition and product release is identical with the order found for all NADP-specific glutamic dehydrogenases although NADP+ is not a substrate of the enzyme. It is proposed that the enzyme may have evolved as a catalyst that was initially non-specific for both coenzymes and later became modified to accommodate NADP+ (or NADPH) as an allosteric activator. The enzymes are extremely heat labile. They denature rapidly above 37°. The activators and inhibitors fail to stabilize the proteins against heat denaturation. A novel effect of pH influence on the degree of activation and inhibition was observed. The enzymes are activated and inhibited best at the pH minima and least of all at the optimum pH. The relevance of these pH effects to the mitochondrial location of the enzymes is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2150417300,"Abstract 1. The forward and reverse reactions of the enzyme commonly known as dihydrouracil dehydrogenase were found to occur in different compartments of the liver cell. 2. The hydrogenation of uracil was catalyzed by NADH- and NADPH-dependent enzymes. Most of the former was present in the heavy mitochondrial fraction; its distribution resembled that of the mitochondrial marker enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase. The NADPH-dependent uracil hydrogenase activity was distributed mainly between mitochondria and plasma and endoplasmic reticulum membranes; the latter were located by the marker enzymes, 5'-nucleotidase and glucose 6-phosphatase. No uracil hydrogenase activity was measurable either in purified lysosomal or nuclear fractions. The distribution of NADPH-dependent thymine hydrogenase activity followed that of NADPH-uracil hydrogenase. 3. Treatment of particulate fractions with 5.4 m glycerol resulted in 3- to 4-fold increases in both uracil hydrogenase activities. Both activities were inhibited 50% in the presence of ATP plus Mg2+ (10 mm each). The pH optimum for NADPH-uracil hydrogenase was 7.5 to 7.7 whereas that of the NADH enzyme was 6.5 to 6.7. 4. In contrast, the dehydrogenation of dihydrouracil, although also NAD+- or NADP+-dependent, was confined almost entirely to the 160,000 x g supernatant fraction. Activity was increased 2.5-fold by ATP plus Mg2+ (5 to 10 mm each). The pH optimum for the NAD+-dependent activity was 8.8 and that for the NADP+-dependent reaction was 7.5. The distribution of dihydrothymine dehydrogenase activity was similar to that of dihydrouracil dehydrogenase. 5. The rate of hydrogenation of uracil by mitochondrial fractions was from 40 to 65 times as great as that of the reverse reaction with NADP+ as coenzyme and about 30 times as great with NAD+ as coenzyme. 6. Only in the 160,000 x g supernatant fraction was activity for the reverse reaction greater. In this fraction the dehydrogenation of dihydrouracil proceeded at 4 and 7 times the rate of the hydrogenation of uracil in the presence of NADP+ and NAD+, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1581657569,"Abstract l-Ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3._.) from Aerobacter aerogenes was purified to homogeneity as determined by a constant specific activity with recrystallization, a single protein band and coincident activity peak in a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a constant molecular weight across the cell in high speed equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The latter method gave an approximate molecular weight of 1.14 x 105. No bound NAD+ was detected when (a) the purified enzyme was tested for NAD+ by microbiological assay, (b) the epimerase was purified from a nicotinic acid auxotroph grown on 14C-nicotinic acid, or (c) fluorescence and absorption spectra were measured. Activity measurements indicated that the enzyme does not require NAD+ for activity nor is the rate of epimerization enhanced by the presence of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, or NADPH. These results show that the mechanism of 4-epimerization for l-ribulose-5-phosphate and d-xylulose-5-phosphate differs from that for UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. It is evident that the possibilities now include oxidation-reduction utilizing an as yet unrecognized acceptor or an entirely different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1581853015,"Abstract Four structural analogues of l-glutamate (glutaric acid, thiodiglycolic acid, oxydiglycolic acid, and iminodiacetic acid) were tested for inhibition as a function of pH, of coenzyme NADP+ or NAD+, and of their electronic properties as determined from molecular orbital theory considerations. Plots of pVmax and p(Km/Vmax) versus pH for the uninhibited and inhibited reaction of the oxidative deamination of l-glutamate with NADP+ indicated an ionizable group or groups in the enzyme complex with a pK of 7.7 to 7.8. Double reciprocal plots of velocity versus glutamate concentrations in the presence of NADP+ or NAD+ showed that each structural analogue of glutamate was a competitive inhibitor with respect to glutamate. NAD+ increased the affinity of inhibitor for enzyme in comparison with NADP+. The relative effectiveness of each inhibitor as determined by apparent Ki values, calculated from Dixon plots, was correlated inversely with the absolute sigma charge density of the meso atom of the inhibitor. This suggested that desolvation of this atom may be important for the combination of inhibitor with enzyme. A high degree of solvation as indicated by the magnitude of absolute charge density could have decreased the interaction of inhibitor with enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1507214090,"Abstract A soluble enzyme that catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 1-indanol to indanone has been partially purified from bovine liver. The enzyme has a narrow substrate specificity, and only very closely related carbinols such as 1-tetralol, fluorenol, acenaphthenol, and acenaphthene-1,8-diol are oxidized. trans-Acenaphthene-1,8-diol is converted to a mixture of acenaphthenequinone and 1,8-naphthalic acid. Indanol dehydrogenase, which has a molecular weight of 30,000, is clearly distinct from liver alcohol dehydrogenase. NADP+ is the preferred cofactor, but NAD+ is also utilized. The role of indanol dehydrogenase in the intact organism is presently unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1486136989,"Abstract The specificity of phosphoglucomutase for various α-d-sugar diphosphates was studied by examining the relative ability of these compounds to activate the dephosphorylated form of the enzyme prepared from rabbit muscle. The rate of the reaction measured spectrophotometrically at 340 mµ with a coupled assay system containing TPN+ and excess d-glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was linear with time only when the incubation was carried out in the presence of α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate. When other sugar diphosphates were used, the rate of disappearance of α-d-glucose 1-phosphate increased with time until a maximum linear rate was attained. The final rate, in each case, was dependent on the concentration of α-d-sugar diphosphate added to the incubation mixture, but it was independent of the order of addition of reactants and the concentration of components of the coupled assay system. The apparent Km values were as follows: α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate, 0.1 µm; α-d-mannose 1,6-diphosphate, 3.7 µm; α-d-ribose 1,5-diphosphate, 3.2 µm; α-d-glucosamine 1,6-diphosphate, 11 µm; N-acetyl-α-d-glucosamine 1,6-diphosphate, 1.6 µm; α-d-galactose 1,6-diphosphate, 13 µm. The most effective activator of phosphoglucomutase was α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate. The Km values of α-d-galactose 1,6-diphosphate and α-d-glucosamine 1,6-diphosphate, the poorest activators, were about 120-fold greater than that of α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate. The maximum velocity varied only 2- to 3-fold when different sugar diphosphates were used to activate the reaction. The following maximum velocities, expressed as micromoles min-1 mg-1, were obtained: α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate, 500; α-d-mannose, 1,6-diphosphate, 360; α-d-ribose 1,5-diphosphate, 210; α-d-glucosamine 1,6-diphosphate, 370; N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 1,6-diphosphate, 220; α-d-galactose 1,6-diphosphate, 240. Addition of the appropriate α-d-sugar 1-phosphate or d-sugar 6-phosphate decreased the velocity of the reaction being maintained by either α-d-sugar 1,6-diphosphate or α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate. The findings reported are consistent with and support a mechanism in which each of the sugar diphosphates combines with dephosphoenzyme to form a sugar diphosphate-enzyme complex which then further reacts to yield a phosphoenzyme intermediate and free sugar monophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1534237979,"Abstract Although highly purified preparations of β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase are obtained from extracts of Escherichia coli, purification is hampered by the enzyme's instability in dilute solution. An investigation of this phenomenon revealed that concentrations of TPNH and TPN+ below 1 mm and those of multivalent anions between 0.2 m and 1 m could protect the active form of the enzyme by binding to the protein and thereby stabilizing its active form. Enzyme inactivation occurred in two stages, the first being reversible by TPNH, TPN+, and multivalent anions, and the second being irreversible by these agents. In these studies potassium phosphate acted as an inhibitor of TPNH oxidation, while potassium chloride failed to alter the reaction rate, indicating that TPNH, TPN+, and phosphate may be bound to the same site (possibly the catalytic site) of the enzyme. From a comparative kinetic study with a number of model substrates, it was concluded that the substrate, acetoacetyl-ACP was bound to β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase through its protein moiety, the pantoyl residue of the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, and the β-ketoester group. ACP was a competitive inhibitor of the reduction of acetoacetyl-ACP, acetoacetyl pantetheine and acetoacetyl-N-acetyl-cysteamine, emphasizing the importance of the ACP-protein-enzyme interaction for substrate binding and demonstrating the inaccessibility of the catalytic site for model substrates once the ACP-protein is bound to the enzyme. Since the enzyme reduced ethyl thiolacetoacetate and ethyl acetoacetate, we concluded that the cysteaminyl residue and the thioester linkage of the acetoacetyl substrate were not absolutely necessary for the substrate-enzyme binding. However, the absence of the cysteaminyl residue in the substrate significantly decreased the Vmax values. The fact that acetoacetyl-ACP in its enolate form would apparently not bind to the enzyme suggests that the keto form of the substrate is directly reduced in this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1585180153,"Abstract This paper reports a study of the oxidation-reduction equilibrium of d-amino acid oxidase, a flavoprotein containing FAD. The oxidation-reduction potential at 50% oxidation (E½) is -0.004 volt at pH 7.0 and 20°, and therefore about 180 mv higher than that of the free coenzyme (FAD). This difference in oxidation-reduction potential may be described in terms of relative affinity of the apoenzyme for the reduced and oxidized forms of the coenzyme. On this basis the affinity constant for the binding of reduced FAD to the apoenzyme is about 106 higher than that of oxidized FAD. The curve relating E½ to pH is in the alkaline range consistent with a slope of about -0.058 volt per pH unit which corresponds to the difference of 1 proton between the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme. The apparent pK of the oxidation-linke group, which belongs to the oxidized form, is ∼7.1. The shape of the oxidation-reduction equilibrium curve of d-amino acid oxidase is pH dependent, the value of n increasing from about 1 at pH 8.6 to about 3, or more, at pH 6.6. Under these conditions, therefore, one must consider the existence of functional homotropic interactions between at least 2 FAD molecules. The pH dependence of the cooperative oxidation-reduction equilibrium is discussed in the framework of the theory of linked functions."

The reaction required reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), but was not affected by the presence or absence of oxygen. Further degradation of aminoparathion into water-soluble compounds occurred in NADPH-fortified incubation mixtures over prolonged incubation periods. The effect of sesamex or SKF 525-A on these reactions is described."

https://openalex.org/W1654479786,"Abstract The configurations of the amino acids in pneumococcal C-polysaccharide have been determined chromatographically after acid hydrolysis. The amino acids were coupled with an l-amino acid N-carboxyanhydride for formation of the corresponding l-d- and l-l-dipeptides; these derivatives were separated by ion exchange chromatography on an amino acid analyzer. The amount of racemization of alanine which occurred during the hydrolysis was determined by measurement of the amount of tritium incorporated into the amino acid after hydrolysis of the C-polysaccharide in tritiated HCl. After correction for the amount of d or l isomer formed by racemization, it was concluded that the content of d-alanine was variable (25 to 33%) in the three preparations of pneumococcal C-polysaccharide studied. Each of the preparations contained glutamic acid (100% d isomer) and lysine (100% l isomer)."

https://openalex.org/W961412181,"The coupling system of hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was used for the initial velocity studies of rat liver citrate cleavage enzyme (EC 4.1.3.8) in the reverse direction. Since the equilibrium constant is concentration-dependent, only portions of the entire initial velocity array could be examined. The initial velocity studies showed that the reaction mechanism appears sequential. These data are consistent with the following four mechanisms: A, B, C, D ordered; D, C, B, Aordered; A and B ordered, C and D rapid equilibrium random; and D and C ordered, B and A rapid equilibrium random, in which A,B,C, and D are acetyl-CoA, MgADP, oxaloacetate, and phosphate, respectively. Apparent Michaelis constants are presented for the four substrates under various conditions."
