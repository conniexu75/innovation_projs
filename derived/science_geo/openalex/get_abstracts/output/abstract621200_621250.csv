https://openalex.org/W2898731968,"To investigate the influences of smartphone use on ocular symptoms, status of the tear film, and oxidative stress indices in the tears and at the ocular surface.Eighty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Subjective symptoms and asthenopia were evaluated using the ocular surface disease index (OSDI), visual analogue scale (VAS), and computer vision syndrome (CVS) score before and after smartphone or computer display (control) use. The status of the tear film was evaluated using fluorescein film break-up time (FBUT), non-invasive keratograph break up time (NIKBUT), Schirmer score, keratoepitheliopathy (KEP), and tear meniscus height (TMH). Oxidative stress markers in the tear film including hexanoyl lysine (HEL), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the tear film were measured using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the ocular surface were measured through 2',7'-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate. All measurements were conducted at baseline, and after use for 1 and 4 h.All parameters showed no significant group-wise differences at baseline. Scores of OSDI, VAS, fatigue, burning sensation, and dryness showed significant increases after 1 and 4 h of smartphone use compared with those at baseline (all P < 0.05). The smartphone group showed higher OSDI, fatigue, burning, and dryness scores than the control group at 4 h. Smartphone use showed significantly decreased FBUT and NIBUT at 4 h than those at baseline (P < 0.01). In the smartphone group, the concentration of HEL significantly increased at 4 h compared with that at baseline and 1 h (P < 0.01). Both groups showed increased ROS with higher value in the smartphone group versus the control group at 4 h (P < 0.01).Smartphone use could not only aggravate subjective symptom indices such as the OSDI, VAS, and CVS but also induce tear film instability and oxidative stress indices in the tears and at the ocular surface."

Eyes were classified as adequate or insufficient treatment responders based on logMAR visual acuity improvement and central retinal thickness (CRT) decrease after three consecutive injections. Associations between number of HF at baseline and treatment response, the change in HF over the course of treatment, and the distribution of HF within the retinal layers were evaluated.In 54 eyes of 41 patients, mean number of HF and CRT decreased after intravitreal treatment with bevacizumab (p = 0.002 and p<0.001 respectively). Decrease in CRT after 3 months was independently associated with a higher number of HF at baseline (estimated effect -2.61, 95% CI [-4.42--0.31], p = 0.006). Eyes with adequate treatment response presented with more HF at baseline (OR 1.106, 95% CI [1.012-1.210], p = 0.030) than eyes with insufficient treatment response. Most HF were located within the inner retinal layers, and decrease of HF was mostly due to a decrease of inner retinal HF.In patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF, higher baseline numbers of HF have predictive value for treatment response in terms of visual acuity improvement and CRT decrease after 3 months. In addition, HF were responsive to anti-VEGF therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2899214070,"A traditional childrearing practice—“gahvora” cradling—in Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia purportedly restricts movement of infants’ body and limbs. However, the practice has been documented only informally in anecdotal reports. Thus, this study had two research questions: (1) To what extent are infants’ movements restricted in the gahvora? (2) How is time in the gahvora distributed over a 24-hour day in infants from 1–24 months of age? To answer these questions, we video-recorded 146 mothers cradling their infants and interviewed them using 24-hour time diaries to determine the distribution of time infants spent in the gahvora within a day and across age. Infants’ movements were indeed severely restricted. Although mothers showed striking uniformity in how they restricted infants’ movements, they showed large individual differences in amount and distribution of daily use. Machine learning algorithms yielded three patterns of use: day and nighttime cradling, mostly nighttime cradling, and mostly daytime cradling, suggesting multiple functions of the cradling practice. Across age, time in the gahvora decreased, yet 20% of 12- to 24-month-olds spent more than 15 hours bound in the gahvora. We discuss the challenges and benefits of cultural research, and how the discovery of new phenomena may defy Western assumptions about childrearing and development. Future work will determine whether the extent and timing of restriction impacts infants’ physical and psychological development."
https://openalex.org/W2898950233,"Honey bees are considered large-scale monitoring tools due to their environmental exploration and foraging activities. Traces of these activities can be recovered in the honey that also may reflect the hive ecological micro-conditions in which it has been produced. This study applied a next generation sequencing platform (Ion Torrent) for shotgun metagenomic analysis of honey environmental DNA (eDNA). The study tested a methodological framework to interpret DNA sequence information useful to describe the complex ecosystems of the honey bee colony superorganism, its pathosphere and the heterogeneity of the agroecological environments and environmental sources that left DNA marks in the honey. Analysis of two honeys reported sequence reads from five main organism groups (kingdoms or phyla): arthropods (that mainly included reads from Apis mellifera, several other members of the Hymenotpera, in addition to members of the Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, as well as aphids and mites), plants (that clearly confirmed the botanical origin of the two honeys, i.e. orange tree blossom and eucalyptus tree blossom honeys), fungi and bacteria (including common hive and honey bee gut microorganisms, honey bee pathogens and plant pathogens), and viruses (which accounted for the largest number of reads in both honeys, mainly assigned to Apis mellifera filamentous virus). The shotgun metagenomic approach that was used in this study can be applied in large scale experiments that might have multiple objectives according to the multi-kingdom derived eDNA that is contained in the honey."
https://openalex.org/W2810718388,"The concept of observability of linear systems initiated with Kalman in the mid 1950s. Roughly a decade later, the observability of nonlinear systems appeared. By such definitions a system is either observable or not. Continuous measures of observability for linear systems were proposed in the 1970s and two decades ago were adapted to deal with nonlinear dynamical systems. Related topics developed either independently or as a consequence of these. Observability has been recognized as an important feature to study complex networks, but as for dynamical systems in the beginning the focus has been on determining conditions for a network to be observable. In this relatively new field previous and new results on observability merge either producing new terminology or using terms, with well established meaning in other fields, to refer to new concepts. Motivated by the fact that twenty years have passed since some of these concepts were introduced in the field of nonlinear dynamics, in this paper (i)~various aspects of observability will be reviewed, and (ii)~it will be discussed in which ways networks could be ranked in terms of observability. The aim is to make a clear distinction between concepts and to understand what does each one contribute to the analysis and monitoring of networks. Some of the main ideas are illustrated with simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2899163464,"Mice lacking the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin, designated mdx, have been widely used as a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Dystrophic mdx mice as they mature develop notable morphological abnormalities to their neuromuscular junctions, the peripheral cholinergic synapses responsible for activating muscle fibers. Most obviously the acetylcholine receptor aggregates are fragmented into small non-continuous, islands. This contrasts with wild type mice whose acetylcholine receptor aggregates are continuous and pretzel-shaped in appearance. We show here that these abnormalities in mdx mice are also present in a canine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that NMJ remodeling occurs due to myofiber degeneration and regeneration. Using a method to investigate synaptic AChR replacement, we show that neuromuscular junction remodeling in mdx animals is caused by muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration at the synaptic site and is mimicked by deliberate myofiber injury in wild type mice. Importantly, the innervating motor axon plays a crucial role in directing the remodeling of the neuromuscular junction in dystrophy, as has been recorded in aging and deliberate muscle fiber injury in wild type mice. The remodeling occurs repetitively through the life of the animal and the changes in junctions become greater with age."
https://openalex.org/W2899099233,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is influenced by environmental factors and is associated with changes to gene expression and phenotypes. It may link environmental exposures to disease etiology or indicate important gene pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. We identified genomic regions that are differentially methylated in T cells of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to healthy controls. DNA methylation was assessed at 450,000 genomic sites in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells purified from peripheral blood of 94 women with MS and 94 healthy women, and differentially methylated regions were identified using bumphunter. Differential DNA methylation was observed near four loci: MOG/ZFP57, HLA-DRB1, NINJ2/LOC100049716, and SLFN12. Increased methylation of the first exon of the SLFN12 gene was observed in both T cell subtypes and remained present after restricting analyses to samples from patients who had never been on treatment or had been off treatment for more than 2.5 years. Genes near the regions of differential methylation in T cells were assessed for differential expression in whole blood samples from a separate population of 1,329 women with MS and 97 healthy women. Gene expression of HLA-DRB1, NINJ2, and SLFN12 was observed to be decreased in whole blood in MS patients compared to controls. We conclude that T cells from MS patients display regions of differential DNA methylation compared to controls, and corresponding gene expression differences are observed in whole blood. Two of the genes that showed both methylation and expression differences, NINJ2 and SLFN12, have not previously been implicated in MS. SLFN12 is a particularly compelling target of further research, as this gene is known to be down-regulated during T cell activation and up-regulated by type I interferons (IFNs), which are used to treat MS."
https://openalex.org/W2898836643,"Objectives To analyse subdural haemorrhage (SDH) during infancy in Sweden by incidence, SDH category, diagnostic distribution, age, co-morbidity, mortality, and maternal and perinatal risk factors; and its association with accidents and diagnosis of abuse. Methods A Swedish population-based register study comprising infants born between 1997 and 2014, 0–1 years of age, diagnosed with SDH-diagnoses according to the (International Classification of Diseases, 10th version (ICD10), retrieved from the National Patient Register and linked to the Medical Birth Register and the Death Cause Register. Outcome measures were: 1) Incidence and distribution, 2) co-morbidity, 3) fall accidents by SDH category, 4) risk factors for all SDHs in the two age groups, 0–6 and 7–365 days, and for ICD10 SDH subgroups: S06.5 (traumatic SDH), I62.0 (acute nontraumatic), SDH and abuse diagnosis. Results Incidence of SDH was 16·5 per 100 000 infants (n = 306). Median age was 2·5 months. For infants older than one week, the median age was 3·5 months. Case fatality was 6·5%. Male sex was overrepresented for all SDH subgroups. Accidental falls were reported in 1/3 of the cases. One-fourth occurred within 0–6 days, having a perinatal risk profile. For infants aged 7–365 days, acute nontraumatic SDH was associated with multiple birth, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational age. Fourteen percent also had an abuse diagnosis, having increased odds of being born preterm, and being small-for-gestational age. Conclusions The incidence was in the range previously reported. SDH among newborns was associated with difficult birth and neonatal morbidity. Acute nontraumatic SDH and SDH with abuse diagnosis had similar perinatal risk profiles. The increased odds for acute nontraumatic SDH in twins, preterm births, neonatal convulsions or small-for-gestational age indicate a perinatal vulnerability for SDH beyond 1st week of life. The association between prematurity/small-for-gestational age and abuse diagnosis is intriguing and not easily understood."
https://openalex.org/W2953212509,"In recent years, the explosion of genomic data and bioinformatic tools has been accompanied by a growing conversation around reproducibility of results and usability of software. However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication. In addition to providing the first large-scale analysis of bioinformatics code to our knowledge, our work will enable future analysis through publicly available data, code, and methods. Code to generate the dataset and reproduce the analysis is provided under the MIT license at https://github.com/pamelarussell/github-bioinformatics.

https://openalex.org/W2898970737,"Spatio-temporal Bayesian modeling, a method based on regional statistics, is widely used in epidemiological studies. Using Bayesian theory, this study builds a spatio-temporal Bayesian model specific to urban crime to analyze its spatio-temporal patterns and determine any developing trends. The associated covariates and their changes are also analyzed. The model is then used to analyze data regarding burglaries that occurred in Wuhan City in China from January to August 2013. Of the diverse socio-economic variables associated with crime rate, including population, the number of local internet bars, hotels, shopping centers, unemployment rate, and residential zones, this study finds that the burglary crime rate is significantly correlated with the average resident population per community and number of local internet bars. This finding provides a scientific reference for urban safety protection."
https://openalex.org/W2898927772,"The calcium carbonate skeletons of corals provide the underlying structure of coral reefs; however, the cellular mechanisms responsible for coral calcification remain poorly understood. In osteoblasts from vertebrate animals, a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) present in the plasma membrane transports Ca2+ to the site of bone formation. The aims of this study were to establish whether NCX exists in corals and its localization within coral cells, which are essential first steps to investigate its potential involvement in calcification. Data mining identified genes encoding for NCX proteins in multiple coral species, a subset of which were more closely related to NCXs from vertebrates (NCXA). We cloned NCXA from Acropora yongei (AyNCXA), which, unexpectedly, contained a peptide signal that targets proteins to vesicles from the secretory pathway. AyNCXA subcellular localization was confirmed by heterologous expression of fluorescently tagged AyNCXA protein in sea urchin embryos, which localized together with known markers of intracellular vesicles. Finally, immunolabeling of coral tissues with specific antibodies revealed AyNCXA was present throughout coral tissue. AyNCXA was especially abundant in calcifying cells, where it exhibited a subcellular localization pattern consistent with intracellular vesicles. Altogether, our results demonstrate AyNCXA is present in vesicles in coral calcifying cells, where potential functions include intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+ transport to the growing skeleton as part of an intracellular calcification mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2899290179,"Background The latest data on major attacks against civilian aid operations have identified South Sudan as the most dangerous country for aid workers globally. Exposure to other traumatic events and chronic stress is also common in this population. No research exists on the mental health of humanitarian workers in South Sudan. Objectives This study examined symptom burden and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol consumption, and burnout among humanitarian workers in South Sudan. Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with humanitarian workers (national and international staff, consultants, United Nations volunteers). We applied validated measures useful for this setting. We applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to fit models with high prediction accuracy for each outcome and used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to obtain final coefficients and perform inference. Results A total of 277 humanitarian workers employed by 45 organizations completed the survey (a response rate in the order of 10%). We estimated prevalence of PTSD (24%), depression (39%), anxiety disorder (38%), hazardous alcohol consumption in men (35%) and women (36%), and the burnout components emotional exhaustion (24%) and depersonalization (19%). Chronic stress exposure was positively associated with PTSD (p < .001), depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), emotional exhaustion (p < .01), and depersonalization (p < .001). We found no significant association between emotion focused and problem focused coping and mental health outcomes. Associations between dysfunctional coping and depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .01) were positive. Higher levels of spirituality were associated with lower risk of hazardous alcohol consumption (p < .001). Contrary to expectations, working directly with humanitarian aid beneficiaries was significantly associated with lower risk for emotional exhaustion (p < .01). Conclusion Our results suggest that humanitarian workers in South Sudan experience substantial levels of mental ill-health. This study points to the need for staff support strategies that effectively mitigate humanitarian workers’ chronic stress exposure. The dynamics between coping and mental health among humanitarian workers require further study."
https://openalex.org/W2898983122,"Calcium phosphate (CaP) coating is an effective method for surface-functionalization of bioinert materials and for production of osteoconductive implants. Recently, we developed a laser-assisted biomimetic process (LAB process) for facile and area-specific CaP coating. In this study, the LAB process was applied to chemically stable and mechanically durable poly(etheretherketone) (PEEK), which has become widely used as an orthopedic and dental implant material. The LAB process was carried out by irradiating pulsed Nd:YAG laser light (355 nm) onto a PEEK substrate that was immersed in supersaturated CaP solution. The CaP coating applicability depended on laser fluence, i.e., CaP successfully formed on PEEK surface after the LAB process at 2 W/cm2. Further increase in laser fluence did not result in the successful formation. At the optimal fluence of 2 W/cm2, the laser-irradiated PEEK surface was modified and heated to induce heterogeneous CaP precipitation within 10 min in CaP solution, followed by further CaP growth over the irradiation time (tested up to 30 min). The LAB process improved the cytocompatibility of PEEK surface with osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, the LAB-processed CaP-coated PEEK substrate formed a dense hydroxyapatite layer on its surface in the simulated body fluid, suggesting the osteoconductivity of this material. The present LAB process can be a useful new tool to produce osteoconductive PEEK-based implants."
https://openalex.org/W2899433957,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), epidemiological data for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are scarce. We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study including 952 patients in an outpatient clinic in Tanzania to explore CKD prevalence estimates and the association with cardiovascular and infectious disorders. According to KDIGO, we measured albumin-to-creatinine ratio and calculated eGFR using CKD-EPI formula. Factors associated with CKD were calculated by logistic regression. Venn diagrams were modelled to visualize interaction between associated factors and CKD. Overall, the estimated CKD prevalence was 13.6% (95% CI 11–16%). Ninety-eight patients (11.2%) (95% CI 9–14%) were categorized as moderate, 12 (1.4%) (95% CI 0–4%) as high, and 9 (1%) (95% CI 0–3%) as very high risk according to KDIGO. History of tuberculosis (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.66–8.18; p = 0.001) and schistosomiasis (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.13–5.18; p = 0.02) were associated with CKD. A trend was seen for increasing systolic blood pressure (OR 1.02 per 1 mmHg, 95% CI 1.00–1.03; p = 0.01). Increasing BMI (OR 0.92 per 1kg/m2, 95% CI 0.88–0.96; p = <0.001) and haemoglobin (OR 0.82 per 1g/dL, 95% CI 0.72–0.94; p = 0.004) were associated with risk reduction. Diabetes was associated with albuminuria (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.26–6.00; p = 0.009). In 85% of all CKD cases at least one of the four most common factors (hypertension, diabetes, anaemia, and history of tuberculosis or schistosomiasis) was associated with CKD. A singular associated factor was found in 61%, two in 14%, and ≥3 in 10% of all CKD cases. We observed a high prevalence estimate for CKD and found that both classical cardiovascular and neglected infectious diseases might be associated with CKD in a semi-rural population of SSA. Our finding provides further evidence for the hypothesis that the “double burden” of non-communicable and endemic infectious diseases might affect kidney health in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W2899118933,"Cold-active acetyl xylan esterases allow for reduced bioreactor heating costs in bioenergy production. Here, we isolated and characterized a cold-active acetyl xylan esterase (PbAcE) from the psychrophilic soil microbe Paenibacillus sp. R4. The enzyme hydrolyzes glucose penta-acetate and xylan acetate, reversibly producing acetyl xylan from xylan, and it shows higher activity at 4°C than at 25°C. We solved the crystal structure of PbAcE at 2.1-Å resolution to investigate its active site and the reason for its low-temperature activity. Structural analysis showed that PbAcE forms a hexamer with a central substrate binding tunnel, and the inter-subunit interactions are relatively weak compared with those of its mesophilic and thermophilic homologs. PbAcE also has a shorter loop and different residue composition in the β4–α3 and β5–α4 regions near the substrate binding site. Flexible subunit movements and different active site loop conformations may enable the strong low-temperature activity and broad substrate specificity of PbAcE. In addition, PbAcE was found to have strong activity against antibiotic compound substrates, such as cefotaxime and 7-amino cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA). In conclusion, the PbAcE structure and our biochemical results provide the first example of a cold-active acetyl xylan esterase and a starting template for structure-based protein engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2899460749,"Cell-culture methods that simplify the inherent complexities of the kidney have not sufficiently reproduced its true characteristics. Although reports indicate that organoid methodology surpasses traditional cell culture in terms of reproducing the nature of organs, the study of human kidney organoids have been confined to pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, it has not yet progressed beyond the developmental state of embryonic kidney even after complicate additional differentiation processes. We here describe the kidney organotypic culture method that uses adult whole kidney tissues but mainly differentiates into tubular cells. This model was validated based on the retention of key kidney organotypic-specific features: 1) expression of Tamm-Horsfall protein; 2) dome-like organoid configurations, implying directed transport of solutes and water influx; and 3) organoid expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in response to nephrotoxic injury (i.e., gentamicin and cisplatin exposure). This 3D-structured organoid prototype of the human renal tubule may have applications in developing patient-specific treatments for kidney diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2899489182,"Due to its ability to induce DNA damage in a space and time controlled manner, ionising radiation is a unique tool for studying the mechanisms of DNA repair. The biological effectiveness of ionising radiation is related to the ionisation density which is defined by the linear energy transfer (LET). Alpha particles are characterised by high LET, while X-rays by low LET values. An interesting question is how cells react when exposed to a mixed beam of high and low LET radiation. In an earlier study carried out with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) we could demonstrate that alpha radiation X-rays interact in producing more chromosomal aberrations than expected based on additivity. The aim of the present investigation was to look at the mechanism of the interaction, especially with respect to the question if it is due to an augmented level of initial damage or impaired DNA repair. PBL were exposed to various doses of alpha particles, X-rays and mixed beams. DNA damage and the kinetics of damage repair was quantified by the alkaline comet assay. The levels of phosphorylated, key DNA damage response (DDR) proteins ATM, p53 and DNA-PK were measured by Western blotting and mRNA levels of 6 damage-responsive genes were measured by qPCR. Alpha particles and X-rays interact in inducing DNA damage above the level predicted by assuming additivity and that the repair of damage occurs with a delay. The activation levels of DDR proteins and mRNA levels of the studied genes were highest in cells exposed to mixed beams. The results substantiate the idea that exposure to mixed beams presents a challenge for the cellular DDR system."
https://openalex.org/W2898687015,"Habitat loss has the potential to alter vertebrate host populations and their interactions with parasites. Theory predicts a decrease in parasite diversity due to the loss of hosts in such contexts. However, habitat loss could also increase parasite infections as a result of the arrival of new parasites or by decreasing host immune defenses. We investigated the effect of habitat loss and other habitat characteristics on avian haemosporidian infections in a community of birds within a fragmented landscape in northwest Ecuador. We estimated Plasmodium and Haemoproteus parasite infections in 504 individual birds belonging to 8 families and 18 species. We found differences in infection status among bird species, but no relationship between forest fragment characteristics and infection status was observed. We also found a temporal effect, with birds at the end of the five-month study (which ran from the end of the rainy season thru the dry season), being less infected by Plasmodium parasites than individuals sampled at the beginning. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between forest area and Culicoides abundance. Taken as a whole, these findings indicate little effect of fragment characteristics per se on infection, although additional sampling or higher infection rates would have offered more power to detect potential relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2899008495,"The lower Maastrichtian site of Basturs Poble (southern Pyrenees, Spain) is the first hadrosaur bonebed reported from Europe. It is an accumulation of disarticulated lambeosaurine skeletal elements, possibly belonging to Pararhabdodon isonensis. The sample shows high intraspecific morphological variability among many skeletal elements, suggesting the need for caution in choosing characters for phylogenetic analyses. Juvenile to adult individuals are represented in the sample, while hatchling remains are absent. Bone histology reveals that juveniles are over-represented and that the youngest individuals represented by tibia specimens were two years old. Adult individuals, with tibiae 550–600 mm long, were 14–15 years old when they died. However, individual variation in tibia length at skeletal maturity occurs within the sample, so individual maturity cannot be assumed on the basis of bone size alone. The Basturs Poble bonebed occurs within the upper part of the C31r magnetochron. Thus, lambeosaurine hadrosaurids were already present and abundant in the Ibero-Armorica Island at the end of the early Maastrichtian and P. isonensis spans the upper part of the lower Maastrichtian to the upper part of the upper Maastrichtian (upper part of C31r-lower part of C29r)."
https://openalex.org/W2898996063,"The relationship between perceived neighbourhood safety from traffic and crime with overweight/obesity can provide intervention modalities for obesity, yet no relevant study has been conducted in sub-Saharan African contexts. We investigated the association between perceived neighbourhood safety from traffic and crime with overweight/obesity among urban South African adults.This cross-sectional study included 354 adults aged ≥35 years drawn from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) cohort study. The Neighborhood Walkability Scale-Africa (NEWS-A) was used to evaluate the perceived neighbourhood safety. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the associations between perceived neighborhood safety and overweight/obesity defined ""normal weight"" and ""overweight/obese"" using the 25 Kg/m2 cutoff criterion.In the overall sample, adults who agreed that ""the speed of traffic on most nearby roads in their neighborhood was usually slow"" were less likely to be overweight/obese (adjusted OR = 0.42; 95%CI 0.23-0.76). Those who agreed that ""there was too much crime in their neighborhood to go outside for walks or play during the day"" were more likely to be overweight/obese (OR = 2.41; 1.09-5.29). These associations were driven by significant associations in women, and no association in men, with significant statistical interactions.Perceived neighborhood safety from traffic and crime was associated with overweight/obesity among South African adults. Our findings provide preliminary evidence on the need to secure safer environments for walkability. Future work should also consider perceptions of the neighbourhood related to food choice."
https://openalex.org/W2899186366,"Background High levels of serum leptin and low levels of serum adiponectin are strongly correlated with obesity, a well-established risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Growing evidence suggests that dysregulation of leptin and adiponectin levels may play an etiological role in colorectal carcinogenesis. We evaluated 20 candidate variants in 4 genes previously shown to alter serum leptin and adiponectin levels for associations with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) and CRC risk. Methods We analyzed 6,246 CRC cases and 7,714 population-based controls from 11 studies within the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Associations of each variant with obesity or CRC were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models stratified by sex and adjusted for age, a study variable, and the first three principal components of genetic ancestry. Gene-specific False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values <0.05 denoted statistical significance. Results Two variants in the leptin gene showed statistically significant associations with CRC among women: LEP rs2167270 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06–1.21) and LEP rs4731426 (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.17). These associations remained significant after adjustment for obesity, suggesting that leptin SNPs may influence CRC risk independent of obesity. We observed statistically significant interactions of the leptin variants with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for CRC risk; these variant associations were strengthened when analyses were restricted to post-menopausal women with low estrogen exposure, as estimated by ‘never use’ of HRT and/or non-obese BMI. No variants were associated with CRC among men. Conclusions Leptin gene variants may exhibit sex-specific associations with CRC risk. Endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposure may modify the association between these variants, leptin levels, and CRC risk."
https://openalex.org/W2898743389,"Current laboratory testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) does not consistently discriminate between different central nervous system (CNS) disease states. Rapidly distinguishing CNS infections from other brain and spinal cord disorders that share a similar clinical presentation is critical. New approaches focusing on aspects of disease biology, such as immune response profiles that can have stimulus-specific attributes, may be helpful. We undertook this preliminary proof-of-concept study using multiplex ELISA to measure CSF cytokine levels in various CNS disorders (infections, autoimmune/demyelinating diseases, lymphomas, and gliomas) to determine the potential utility of cytokine patterns in differentiating CNS infections from other CNS diseases. Both agglomerative hierarchical clustering and mixture discriminant analyses revealed grouping of CNS disease types based on cytokine expression. To further investigate the ability of CSF cytokine levels to distinguish various CNS disease states, non-parametric statistical analysis was performed. Mann-Whitney test analysis demonstrated that CNS infections are characterized by significantly higher CSF lP-10/CXCL10 levels than the pooled non-infectious CNS disorders (p = 0.0001). Within the infection group, elevated levels of MDC/CCL22 distinguished non-viral from viral infections (p = 0.0048). Each disease group of the non-infectious CNS disorders independently showed IP-10/CXCL10 levels that are significantly lower than the infection group [(autoimmune /demyelinating disorders (p = 0.0005), lymphomas (p = 0.0487), gliomas (p = 0.0294), and controls (p = 0.0001)]. Additionally, of the non-infectious diseases, gliomas can be distinguished from lymphomas by higher levels of GRO/CXCL1 (p = 0.0476), IL-7 (p = 0.0119), and IL-8 (p = 0.0460). Gliomas can also be distinguished from autoimmune/demyelinating disorders by higher levels of GRO/CXCL1 (p = 0.0044), IL-7 (p = 0.0035) and IL-8 (p = 0.0176). Elevated CSF levels of PDGF-AA distinguish lymphomas from autoimmune/demyelinating cases (p = 0.0130). Interrogation of the above comparisons using receiver operator characteristic analysis demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) values (ranging from 0.8636–1.0) that signify good to excellent utility as potential diagnostic discriminators. In conclusion, our work indicates that upon formal validation, measurement of CSF cytokine levels may have clinical utility in both identifying a CNS disorder as infectious in etiology and, furthermore, in distinguishing viral from non-viral CNS infections."
https://openalex.org/W2898954325,"The ToxA effector is a major virulence gene of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), a necrotrophic fungus and the causal agent of tan spot disease of wheat. ToxA and co-located genes are believed to be the result of a recent horizontally transferred highly conserved 14kb region a major pathogenic event for Ptr. Since this event, monitoring isolates for pathogenic changes has become important to help understand the underlying mechanisms in play. Here we examined ToxA in 100 Ptr isolates from Australia, Europe, North and South America and the Middle East, and uncovered in isolates from Denmark, Germany and New Zealand a new variation, a novel 166 bp insertion element (PtrHp1) which can form a perfectly matched 59 bp inverted repeat hairpin structure located downstream of the ToxA coding sequence in the 3’ UTR exon. A wider examination revealed PtrHp1 elements to be distributed throughout the genome. Analysis of genomes from Australia and North America had 50–112 perfect copies that often overlap other genes. The hairpin element appears to be unique to Ptr and the lack of ancient origins in other species suggests that PtrHp1 emerged after Ptr speciation. Furthermore, the ToxA UTR insertion site is identical for different isolates, which suggests a single insertion event occurred after the ToxA horizontal transfer. In vitro and in planta-detached leaf assays found that the PtrHp1 element insertion had no effect on ToxA expression. However, variation in the expression of ToxA was detected between the Ptr isolates from different demographic locations, which appears to be unrelated to the presence of the element. We envision that this discovery may contribute towards future understanding of the possible role of hairpin elements in Ptr."
https://openalex.org/W2899292016,"Objectives To examine the factors associated with the routine immunization status of children aged 2–3 years in China for gaining a better understanding of the Expanded Program on Immunization and to provide evidence for formulating specific strategies to guide the allocation of health resources. Methods We analyzed data from 45095 children aged 2–3 years in the 2013 National Immunization Coverage Survey to identify the sociodemographic and provider-associated factors affecting the full immunization status of children. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results The immunization rate for children aged 2–3 years ranged from 95.9% (diphtheria and tetanus toxoid with pertussis vaccine, 4th dose) to 99.5% (Japanese encephalitis vaccine, 1st dose) and was 93.1% for full immunization. In terms of sociodemographic factors, male children [adjusted OR (AOR): 1.115; 95% confidence interval(CI):1.016–1.222], minority children (AOR: 1.632; 95% CI: 1.457–1.828), children of fathers with less than high school education (AOR: 1.577; 95% CI: 1.195–2.081), those born at home (AOR: 4.655; 95% CI: 3.771–5.746), those who immigrated from an adjacent county (AOR: 2.006; 95% CI: 1.581–2.546), and those living in urban-rural fringe areas (AOR: 1.807; 95% CI: 1.475–2.214) or mountainous areas (AOR: 1.615; 95% CI: 1.437–1.814) had significantly increased odds of not being fully immunized. In terms of provider-associated factors, administration of vaccines at home (AOR: 2.311; 95% CI: 1.316–4.059), household reminders (AOR: 2.292; 95% CI: 1.884–2.789), and travel time to vaccination providers of >40 minutes (AOR: 1.622; 95% CI: 1.309–2.010) were negatively associated with immunization rates. In addition, compared to 3-year-old years, 2-year-old children (AOR: 1.201; 95% CI: 1.094–1.318) were less likely to be fully immunized. Conclusions All included factors except maternal education level and distance from home to vaccination providers significantly affected immunization rates. Appropriate reminders and accessibility of immunization services played key roles in improving the immunization status. More attention to high-risk groups identified in this study may reduce the disparities in routine childhood immunization in China."
https://openalex.org/W2898792469,"Coastal sharks with small body sizes may be among the most productive species of chondrichthyans. The Australian sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori) is one of the most productive members of this group based on work in northern and eastern Australia. However, life history information throughout the remainder of its range is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, the age, growth and maturity of R. taylori caught in the Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery in Papua New Guinea, were studied. One hundred and eighty six individuals, comprising 131 females (31–66 cm TL) and 55 males (31–53 cm TL) were aged using vertebral analysis and growth was modelled using a multi-model approach. The lack of small individuals close to the size at birth made fitting of growth curves more difficult, two methods (fixed length at birth and additional zero aged individuals) accounting for this were trialled. The von Bertalanffy growth model provided the best fit to the data when used with a fixed length-at-birth (L0 = 26 cm TL). Males (L∞ = 46 cm TL, k = 3.69 yr-1, L50 = 41.7 cm TL and A50 = 0.5 years) grew at a faster rate and matured at smaller sizes and younger ages than females (L∞ = 58 cm TL, k = 1.98 yr-1, L5o = 47.0 cm TL and A50 = 0.93 years). However, none of the methods to account for the lack of small individuals fully accounted for this phenomenon, and hence the results remain uncertain. Despite this, the results reaffirm the rapid growth of this species and suggest that the Gulf of Papua population may grow at a faster rate than Australian populations. Rhizoprionodon taylori is possibly well placed to withstand current fishing pressure despite being a common bycatch species in the Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery. However, further research needs to be undertaken to estimate other key life history parameters to fully assess the population status of this exploited shark species and its vulnerability to fishing in the Gulf of Papua."

However, the health impact of long-term exposure to cosmic radiation and microgravity is not fully understood. In order to identify the molecular mechanisms underpinning the effects of space travel on human health, we must develop the capacity to monitor changes in gene expression and DNA integrity in space. Here, we report successful implementation of three molecular biology procedures on board the International Space Station (ISS) using a miniaturized thermal cycler system and C. elegans as a model organism: first, DNA extraction-the initial step for any type of DNA analysis; second, reverse transcription of RNA to generate complementary DNA (cDNA); and third, the subsequent semi-quantitative PCR amplification of cDNA to analyze gene expression changes in space. These molecular procedures represent a significant expansion of the budding molecular biology capabilities of the ISS and will permit more complex analyses of space-induced genetic changes during spaceflight missions aboard the ISS and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2898894037,"Large amount of phthalate esters (PAEs) used as plasticizers in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products has caused ubiquitous contamination to the environment and potential ecology security risk all around the world, especially in places plastic films were indispensably utilized due to the widely proposing of facility agriculture in China. A case of PAEs contamination in four suburb areas of Nanjing was analyzed and discussed in this study. A new frame work has been put forward based on multi-criteria evaluation model and mathematical method of catastrophe theory, using farming work, laboratory determination and relevant environmental standards to measure the ecology security risk of PAEs in study areas. The factors were selected based on the availability of the data and the local conditions. The assessment model involves the contamination status of PAEs in soil and vegetables, the contamination effects of PAEs to human and soil organisms and the contamination source of PAEs from plastic films and other products in the four study facility agriculture areas. An evaluation system of the model was composed of thirteen mesosphere indicators and twenty-five underlying indicators including total PAEs concentration in soils, single PAE concentration in soils, total PAEs concentrations in roots, leafy, solanaceous and stem vegetables, PAE human risks, soil microbial counts, microorganism diversity indices, atmospheric deposition of PAEs, whether sewage wastewater irrigation, planting mode of the facility agriculture areas and climate condition of study areas. The modified evaluation system was used in the assessment of ecology security of the same place based on the data of 2012, and the results suggested that the ecology security indicators were reliable and were agree well with the practical situation of the study areas. The results could provide guidance for the application of health risk assessment of soil environment for the strong objectivity of catastrophe theory compared with other evaluation methods."
https://openalex.org/W2899454064,"Modification of the host lipidome via secreted enzymes is an integral, but often overlooked aspect of bacterial pathogenesis. In the current era of prevalent antibiotic resistance, knowledge regarding critical host pathogen lipid interactions has the potential for use in developing novel antibacterial agents. While most studies to date on this matter have focused on specific lipids, or select lipid classes, this provides an incomplete picture. Modern methods of untargeted lipidomics have the capacity to overcome these gaps in knowledge and provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of infections. In an attempt to determine the role of lipid modifying enzymes produced by staphylococci, we exposed bovine heart lipids, a standardized model for the mammalian lipidome, to spent medium from staphylococcal cultures, and analyzed lipid molecular changes by MS/MSALL shotgun lipidomics. We elucidate distinct effects of different staphylococcal isolates, including 4 clinical isolates of the pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, a clinical isolate of the normally commensal species S. epidermidis, and the non-pathogenic species S. carnosus. Two highly virulent strains of S. aureus had a more profound effect on mammalian lipids and modified more lipid classes than the other staphylococcal strains. Our studies demonstrate the utility of the applied untargeted lipidomics methodology to profile lipid changes induced by different bacterial secretomes. Finally, we demonstrate the promise of this lipidomics approach in assessing the specificity of bacterial enzymes for mammalian lipid classes. Our data suggests that there may be a correlation between the bacterial expression of lipid-modifying enzymes and virulence, and could facilitate the guided discovery of lipid pathways required for bacterial infections caused by S. aureus and thereby provide insights into the generation of novel antibacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W2898638038,"Chili peppers are an important constituent of many foods and contain medicinally valuable compounds, such as capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. As various dietary botanicals have anticancer properties, this study was aimed to examine the effect of Ghost pepper (Bhut Jolokia), one of the hottest chili peppers in the world, on cell proliferation, apoptosis, senescence and the global proteomic profile in human renal cell adenocarcinoma in vitro. 769-P human renal adenocarcinoma cells were cultured on RPMI-1640 media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (1%). Treatment stock solutions were prepared in ethanol. Cell proliferation was tested with phenol red-free media with capsaicin (0-400 μM), dihydrocapsaicin (0-400 μM), capsaicin + dihydrocapsaicin (5:1), and dry Ghost peppers (0-3 g L-1) for 24, 48 and 72 h. Polycaspase and senescence associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activities were tested with capsaicin (400 μM), dihydrocapsaicin (400 μM), capsaicin (400 μM) + dihydrocapsaicin (80 μM), and ghost pepper (3 g L-1) treatments. Global proteomic profile of cells in control and ghost pepper treatment (3 g L-1) was analyzed after 6 h by a shotgun proteomic approach using tandem mass spectrometry. At 24 h after treatment (24 HAT), relative to control, cell proportion with capsaicin (400 μM), dihydrocapsaicin (400 μM), capsaicin (400 μM) + dihydrocapsaicin (80 μM), and ghost pepper (3 g L-1) treatments was reduced to 36%, 18%, 33% and 20%, respectively, and further reduced at 48 and 72 HAT. All treatments triggered an early polycaspase response. SA-beta-gal activity was normal or suppressed with all treatments. About 68,220 protein isoforms were identified by shotgun proteomic approach. Among these, about 8.2% were significantly affected by ghost pepper. Ghost pepper regulated various proteins involved in intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, Ras, Rb/E2F, p53, TGF-beta, WNT-beta catenin, and calcium induced cell death pathways. Ghost pepper also induced changes in proteins related to methylation, acetylation, genome stability, cell cycle check points, carbohydrate, protein and other metabolism and cellular mechanisms. Ghost pepper exhibited antiproliferation activity by inducing apoptosis through a complex network of proteins in human renal cell adenocarcinoma in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2899158625,"Recent findings point to a role of Checkpoint Inhibitor (CPI) receptors at the tissue level in immune homeostasis. Here we investigated the role of CPI molecules on immune cells in relation to cardiac function. Participants recruited in Chennai, India consisted of HIV+ ART naive viremic (Gp1 n = 102), HIV+ on ART, virologically suppressed (Gp2, n = 172) and HIV negative healthy controls (Gp3, n = 64). A cross-sectional analysis of cardiac function, arterial resistance and immunologic assessment of CPI expressing T cells was performed. Data indicate that ART naive exhibited cardiac function impairment and greater arterial stiffness than the other groups. Frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing LAG-3 and PD1 were higher in ART naïve while TIGIT and TIM3 were similar among the patient groups. LAG-3+, PD1+ and dual LAG-3+PD1+ CD4 T cells were inversely correlated with cardiac function and arterial elasticity and directly with arterial stiffness in ART naïve participants and with arterial elasticity in virally suppressed group on ART. We conclude that HIV induced upregulation of LAG-3 singly or in combination with PD1 in immune cells may regulate cardiac health and warrant mechanistic investigations. The implications of these findings have bearing for the potential utility of anti-LAG-3 immunotherapy for cardiac dysfunction in chronic HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2899238117,"Evaluating nanoparticle (NP) toxicity in human cell systems is a fundamental requirement for future NP biomedical applications. In this study, we have designed a screening assay for assessing different types of cell death induced by NPs in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) culture. This assay consists of WST-8, LDH and Hoechst 33342 staining, all performed in one well, which enables an evaluation of cell viability, necrosis and apoptosis, respectively, in the same cell sample. The 96-well format and automated processing of fluorescent images enhances the assay rapidity and reproducibility. After testing the assay functionality with agents that induced different types of cell death, we investigated the endothelial toxicity of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs, 8 nm), silica nanoparticles (SiNPs, 7-14 nm) and carboxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTCOOHs, 60 nm). Our results indicated that all the tested NP types induced decreases in cell viability after 24 hours at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. SPIONs caused the lowest toxicity in HUVECs. By contrast, SiNPs induced pronounced necrosis and apoptosis. A time course experiment showed the gradual toxic effect of all the tested NPs. CNTCOOHs inhibited tetrazolium derivatives at 100 μg/ml, causing false negative results from the WST-8 and LDH assay. In summary, our data demonstrate that the presented ""three-in-one"" screening assay is capable of evaluating NP toxicity effectively and reliably. Due to its simultaneous utilization of two different methods to assess cell viability, this assay is also capable of revealing, if NPs interfere with tetrazolium salts."
https://openalex.org/W2898923332,"The unique macroevolutionary dataset of Aze & others has been transferred onto the TimeScale Creator visualisation platform while, as much as practicable, preserving the original unrevised content of its morphospecies and lineage evolutionary trees. This is a “Corrected Version” (not a revision), which can serve as an on-going historical case example because it is now updatable with future time scales. Both macroevolutionary and biostratigraphic communities are now equipped with an enduring phylogenetic database of Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminiferal morphospecies and lineages for which both graphics and content can be visualised together. Key to maintaining the currency of the trees has been specification of time scales for sources of stratigraphic ranges; these scales then locate the range dates within the calibration series. Some ranges or their sources have undergone mostly minor corrections or amendments. Links between lineage and morphospecies trees have been introduced to improve consistency and transparency in timing within the trees. Also, Aze & others’ dual employment of morphospecies and lineage concepts is further elaborated here, given misunderstandings that have ensued. Features displayed on the trees include options for line styles for additional categories for range extensions or degrees of support for ancestor–descendant proposals; these have been applied to a small number of instances as an encouragement to capture more nuanced data in the future. In addition to labeling of eco- and morpho-groups on both trees, genus labels can be attached to the morphospecies tree to warn of polyphyletic morphogenera, and the lineage codes have been decoded to ease their recognition. However, it is the mouse-over pop-ups that provide the greatest opportunity to embed supporting information in the trees. They include details for stratigraphic ranges and their recalibration steps, positions relative to the standard planktonic-foraminiferal zonation, and applications as datums, as well as mutual listings between morphospecies and lineages which ease the tracing of their interrelated contents. The elaboration of the original dataset has been captured in a relational database, which can be considered a resource in itself, and, through queries and programming, serves to generate the TimeScale Creator datapacks."
https://openalex.org/W2898942765,"Currently, healthcare management fosters a maximization of performance despite a relative shortage of specialists. We evaluated anaesthesiologists’ workload, physical health, emotional well-being, job satisfaction and working conditions under increased pressure from consolidated working hours. A nationwide cross-sectional survey was performed in Austrian anaesthesiologists (overall response rate 41.0%). Three hundred and ninety four anaesthesiologists (280 specialists, 114 anaesthesiology trainees) participated. Anaesthesiologists reported frequently working under time pressure (95%CI: 65.6–74.6), at high working speed (95%CI: 57.6–67.1), with delayed or cancelled breaks (95%CI: 54.5–64.1), and with frequent overtime (95%CI: 42.6–52.4). Perceived work climate correlated with task conduct (manner of work accomplishment, the way in which tasks were completed), participation (decision-making power in joint consultation and teamwork), psychosocial resources, uncertainty, task variability and time tolerance (authority in time management and control over operating speed) (all P <0.001). Having not enough time for oneself (95%CI: 47.6–57.4), for sleep (95%CI: 45.6–55.4) or for one’s partner and children (95%CI: 21.8–30.4) was common. One-third of the participants reported frequent feelings of being unsettled (95%CI: 33.4–43.0) and difficulty talking about their emotions (95%CI: 27.3–36.5). Frequent dissatisfaction with life was reported by 11.4% (95%CI: 8.7–14.9) of the respondents. Strong time pressure and little decision-making authority during work along with long working hours and frequent work interruptions constitute the basis for occupational stress in anaesthesiologists. We conclude that increased pressure to perform during work hours contributes to emotional exhaustion and poor work-life balance. Changes in the work schedule of anaesthesiologists are required to avoid negative effects on health and emotional well-being."

https://openalex.org/W2899200484,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the United States. The heterogeneity of the disease coupled with the lack of comprehensive, standardized scales to adequately characterize multiple types of TBI remain to be major challenges facing effective therapeutic development. A systems level approach to TBI diagnosis through the use of metabolomics could lead to a better understanding of cellular changes post-TBI and potential therapeutic targets. In the current study, we utilize a GC-MS untargeted metabolomics approach to demonstrate altered metabolism in response to TBI in a translational pig model, which possesses many neuroanatomical and pathophysiologic similarities to humans. TBI was produced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) in Landrace piglets with impact velocity and depth of depression set to 2m/s;6mm, 4m/s;6mm, 4m/s;12mm, or 4m/s;15mm resulting in graded neural injury. Serum samples were collected pre-TBI, 24 hours post-TBI, and 7 days post-TBI. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that each impact parameter uniquely influenced the metabolomic profile after TBI, and gray and white matter responds differently to TBI on the biochemical level with evidence of white matter displaying greater metabolic change. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed unique metabolic signatures that were dependent on injury severity and brain tissue type. Metabolomic signatures were also detected in serum samples which potentially captures both time after injury and injury severity. These findings provide a platform for the development of a more accurate TBI classification scale based unique metabolomic signatures."

School-based health education is an appropriate approach for improving students’ knowledge regarding substance use in an attempt to prevent or reduce such problem The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of an educational intervention for high school students to improve their knowledge for substance use and its negative consequences, which will, in turn, motivate students to take protective measures against substance use. Methods This quasi-experimental (one group; pre, and post-test) design was carried out in Erbil city from January 2017 to June 2017. A random sampling technique was employed to collect a sample of 280 students amongst four high schools in Erbil city which is the capital of Kurdistan Region-Iraq. A self- administered questionnaire on knowledge assessment regarding substance use was developed and validated by the experts regarding the relevance of the items. A structured teaching program for imparting knowledge on various aspects of substance use was developed based on extensive review of literature and experts’ opinion. The intervention program consisted of a series of 4 education modules. These modules were mainly taught by “Rabers” over a period of four weeks (one session per week). SPSS version 21 was used for data entry and analysis. Data was analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics (McNemar tests, paired t-test, and Chi-square test). Results Out of 280 students, a total of 270 students completed a pre and post-intervention survey. Of the 270 students, 124 (45.9%) were males and 146 (54.1%) were females. The mean age ± SD of the participants was 16.59 ± 0.784 years, ranging from 15–18 years. The study reveals a statistically significant improvement in the mean score of knowledge of students following the implementation of a health education program from 15.959 ± 3.25 to 20.633 ± 3.26 (p < 0.001). Moreover, no one of the students remained with poor knowledge, and relatively more than half (50.2%) of the students have upgraded to good knowledge level. Conclusion Implementing a health education program about substance use on high school students in Erbil city had improved the knowledge of students about this topic."
https://openalex.org/W2899309092,"Numerous studies have shown that the phylogeography of many species, including European brown hare, has been affected by the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene. During this period the Balkans acted as a major refugium offering habitable conditions for many species. However, few studies have focused on the specific role of the Greek peninsula in the phylogeographic history of species in this southernmost margin of Balkans. We, therefore analyzed a 528 bp fragment of the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA in 154 wild brown hare individuals from unsampled areas from both mainland and island Greece and compared it to 310 available brown hare sequences (including 110 Greek samples). Newly identified haplotypes show characteristic distribution in specific Greek areas reinforcing the theory that Greece can be considered as a subrefuge within Balkans for a number of species, with several “refugia within refugia” spots, holding significant genetic diversity. No haplotypes from wild Greek individuals clustered with the Central and Western Europe group revealing a minimal contribution of this area to the colonization of central Europe. One hundred and ten reared brown hares were also analyzed to elucidate the impact of introductions on local populations. Most of these samples presented close genetic affinity with haplotypes from Central and Western Europe indicating that farms in Greece use breeders from those areas. Therefore, despite human translocation of individuals, the genetic structure of brown hare has mostly been influenced by paleoclimatic conditions and minimally by human actions."
https://openalex.org/W2898636672,"We investigate the effectiveness of using the Rosenbrock method for numerical solution of 1D nonlinear Schrödinger equation (or the set of equations) with artificial boundary conditions (ABCs). We compare the computer simulation results obtained during long time interval at using the finite-difference scheme based on the Rosenbrock method and at using the conservative finite-difference scheme. We show, that the finite-difference scheme based on the Rosenbrock method is conditionally conservative one. To combine the advantages of both numerical methods, we propose new implicit and conditionally conservative combined method based on using both the conservative finite-difference scheme and conditionally conservative Rosenbrock method and investigate its effectiveness. The combined method allows decreasing the computer simulation time in comparison with the corresponding computer simulation time at using the Rosenbrock method. In practice, the combined method is effective at computation during short time interval, which does not require an asymptotic stability property for the finite-difference scheme. We generalize also the combined method with ABCs for 2D case."

Results show that gender stereotypical bias resulting in greater facial prominence in depictions of men is present in selfies. The control of image creation and selection for publication by the persons presented in the images do not diminish this gender based bias. Also, when gender is controlled, significant differences exist in facial prominence among different cultures. Comparisons with various socio-cultural indicators indicate possible correlations of gender stereotypical bias to self-expression values, freedom of choice, people's influence on government's decisions, protection of freedom of speech and people's influence on issues in the professional and communal environment. This research does not find a correlation of gender based bias in selfies with gender equality or inequality measures among cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2899288768,"We compared expenditure trends for reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health (RMNCH) with trends in RMNCH service coverage in Peru. We used National Health Accounts data to report on total health expenditure by source; the Countdown database for trends in external funding to RMNCH, and Ministry of Finance data for trends in domestic funding to RMNCH. We undertook over 170 interviews and group discussions to explore factors explaining expenditure trends. We describe trends in total health expenditure and RMNCH expenditure in constant 2012 US$ between 1995 and 2012. We estimated expenditure to coverage ratios. There was a substantial increase in domestic health expenditure over the period. However, domestic health expenditure as share of total government spending and GDP remained stable. Out-of-pocket health spending (OOPS) as a share of total health expenditure remained above 35%, and increased in real terms. Expenditure on reproductive health per woman of reproductive age varied from US$ 1.0 in 2002 to US$ 6.3 in 2012. Expenditure on maternal and neonatal health per pregnant woman increased from US$ 34 in 2000 to US$ 512 in 2012, and per capita expenditure on under-five children increased from US$ 5.6 in 2000 to US$ 148.6 in 2012. Increased expenditure on RMNCH reflects a greater political support for RMNCH, along with greater emphasis on social assistance, family planning, and health reforms targeting poor areas, and a recent emphasis on antipoverty and crosscutting equitable policies and programmes focused on nutrition and maternal and neonatal mortality. Increasing domestic RMNCH expenditure likely enabled Peru to achieve substantial health gains. Peru can provide useful lessons to other countries struggling to achieve sustained gains in RMNCH by relying on their own health financing."
https://openalex.org/W2898792147,"Dysregulation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been described in a variety of cancers, including cervical cancer, a disease which shares a common aetiology with vulval squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). Here, we investigate a large number of primary VSCC cases for evidence of Hedgehog pathway activation and examine the implications of pathway activity on clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with primary VSCC.Archival histology blocks containing VSCC and histologically normal adjacent epithelium were retrieved from a cohort of 91 patients who underwent treatment for primary VSCC. Immunohistochemistry staining was undertaken to assess for the expression of key Hh pathway components (SHH, PTCH1, GLI1). A competing risks statistical model was used to evaluate the implications of the levels of key Hh pathway components on clinical outcomes.We show that 92% of primary VSCC cases over-expressed one or more components of the Hh signalling pathway when compared to the adjacent normal epithelium. While expression of SHH and GLI1 did not correlate with any clinicopathological criteria, over- or under-expression of PTCH1 was associated with a reduced or increased risk of developing a local disease recurrence, respectively. In VSCC arising on a background of Lichen Sclerosus, the risk of local recurrence was potentiated in cases where PTCH1 was under-expressed.Our findings reveal, for the first time, that the Hh pathway is activated in VSCC and that PTCH1 expression can be used as a biomarker to stratify patients and inform clinicians of the risk of their local recurrence, particularly in cases of VSCC associated with LS."

Employing autocorrelation based motion score test and staged hypotheses merging approach, we build our homologous hypothesis generation and management method. A new one-to-many constraint is proposed and applied to tackle the track exclusions during complex occlusions. Besides, to achieve better results, we develop a multi-appearance segmentation for detection, which exploits tree-like topological information and realizes one threshold for one object. Experimental results verify the strength of our methods, indicating speed and performance advantages of our tracker."
https://openalex.org/W2898967439,"The body composition model is closely related to the physiological characteristics of the human body. At the same time there can be a large number of physiological characteristics, many of which may be redundant or irrelevant. In existing human physiological feature selection algorithms, it is difficult to overcome the impact that redundancy and irrelevancy may have on human body composition modeling. This suggests a role for selection algorithms, where human physiological characteristics are identified using a combination of filtering and improved clustering. To do this, a feature filtering method based on Hilbert-Schmidt dependency criteria is first of all used to eliminate irrelevant features. After this, it is possible to use improved Chameleon clustering to increase the combination of sub-clusters amongst the characteristics, thereby removing any redundant features to obtain a candidate feature set for human body composition modeling. Method We report here on the use of an algorithm to filter the characteristic parameters in INBODY770 (this paper used INBODY 770 as body composition analyzer.) measurement data, which has three commonly-used impedance bands (1 kHZ, 250 kHZ, 500 kHZ). This algorithm is able to filter out parameters that have a low correlation with body composition BFM. The algorithm is also able to draw upon improved clustering techniques to reduce the initial feature set from 29 parameters to 10 parameters for any parameters of the 250 kHZ band that remain after filtering. In addition, we also examined the impact of different sample sizes on feature selection.The proposed algorithm is able to remove irrelevant and redundant features and the resulting correlation between the model and the body composition (BFM which is a whole body fat evaluation can better assess the body's overall fat and muscle composition.) is 0.978, thereby providing an improved model for prediction with a relative error of less than 0.12."
https://openalex.org/W2899248291,"The goal of this study was to select a representative cucurbit vegetable crop that contained the highest residue levels of the pesticide azoxystrobinon. To do this, we used open field application of azoxystrobinon in four cucurbit crops (cucumber, zucchini, bitter gourd, and loofah) in Beijing, Shandong, and Anhui. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with selected reaction monitoring was used to determine azoxystrobinon levels in each of the selected cucurbit vegetables. The azoxystrobinon limit of detection was 0.005 mg kg-1 for all samples. Recoveries of azoxystrobinon ranged from 94.2% to 107.1% at spiked levels of 0.005–0.5 mg kg-1. In field trials, the half-life of azoxystrobinon in each of the four cucurbit crops was within the range of 1.4–3.1 d. Based on these results, we recommend that bitter gourd is selected as a representative cucurbit vegetable for future studies of azoxystrobinon. The obtained residual data were also assessed for their dietary risk and results indicated that there is no chronic dietary risk in any of the four, selected cucurbit vegetables. The recommended maximum residue limit (MRL) of azoxystrobinon in this subgroup was 0.2 mg/kg."
https://openalex.org/W2899376093,"The effective management of fish populations requires understanding of both the biology of the species being managed and the behavior of the humans who harvest those species. For many marine fisheries, recreational harvests represent a significant portion of the total fishing mortality. For such fisheries, therefore, a model that captures the dynamics of angler choices and the fish population would be a valuable tool for fisheries management. In this study, we provide such a model, focusing on red drum and spotted seatrout, which are the two of the main recreational fishing targets in the Gulf of Mexico. The biological models are in the form of vector autoregressive models. The anglers' decision model takes the discrete choice approach, in which anglers first decide whether to go fishing and then determine the location to fish based on the distance and expected catch of two species of fish if they decide to go fishing. The coupled model predicts that, under the level of fluctuation in the abundance of the two species experienced in the past 35 years, the number of trips that might be taken by anglers fluctuates moderately. This fluctuation is magnified as the cost of travel decreases because the anglers can travel long distance to seek better fishing conditions. On the other hand, as the cost of travel increases, their preference to fish in nearby areas increases regardless of the expected catch in other locations and variation in the trips taken declines. The model demonstrates the importance of incorporating anglers' decision processes in understanding the changes in a fishing effort level. Although the model in this study still has a room for further improvement, it can be used for more effective management of fish and potentially other populations."
https://openalex.org/W2898695975,"The influence of geographic origin on the risk of severe illness and death on cART has not been explored in European countries.We studied antiretroviral-naïve heterosexual HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the FHDH-ANRS CO4 cohort in France who started cART between 2006 and 2011. Individuals originating from France (French natives), sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and non-French West-Indies (NFW) were studied until 2012. Crude and adjusted rate ratios (aRR) of severe morbid events/deaths (AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related) were calculated using Poisson regression models stratified by sex, comparing each group of migrants to French natives.Among 2334 eligible men, 1379 (59.1%) originated from France, 838 (35.9%) from SSA and 117 (5.0%) from NFW. SSA male migrants had a higher aRR for non-AIDS infections, particularly bacterial infections (aRR 1.56 (95% CI 1.07-2.29), p = 0.0477), than French natives. Among 2596 eligible women, 1347 (51.9%) originated from France, 1131 (43.6%) from SSA, and 118 (4.5%) from NFW. SSA and NFW female migrants had a higher aRR for non-AIDS infections, particularly non-bacterial infections (respectively, 2.04 (1.18-3.53) and 7.87 (2.54-24.4), p = 0.0010), than French natives. We observed no other significant differences related to geographic origin as concerns the aRRs for AIDS-related infections or malignancies, or for other non-AIDS events/deaths such as cardiovascular disease, neurological/psychiatric disorders, non-AIDS malignancies and iatrogenic disorders, in either gender.Heterosexual migrants from SSA or NFW living in France have a higher risk of non-AIDS-defining infections than their French native counterparts. Special efforts are needed to prevent infectious diseases among HIV-infected migrants."
https://openalex.org/W2898755470,"Effective video monitoring systems require optimization of camera and road network coverage, to exploit fully the hardware and software solutions in smart city traffic applications. Monitoring requirements have grown increasingly diverse as scenes are becoming increasingly complex, thereby transforming the camera and road network coverage optimization issue into a nonlinear, high-dimension, and multi-objective problem. Previous research on this topic however, has focused on a single, specific optimization objective, which may result in invalid optimization results in actual applications. To extend this research, we propose a multi-objective scheduling optimization algorithm for a camera network that addresses the problem of directional road network coverage. In this solution, we incorporate an expanding parameter of main optical axes into particle swarm optimization algorithm. Our new strategy divides the range of main optical axes of all the cameras to control the scheduling number, achieving collaborative optimization of multiple objectives. In a simulated camera and road network, an experiment was designed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing the distribution of optimization results with the global and local optimal solutions of the true value. A second experiment compared the distribution, performance and running time of the optimization results with different values of expanding parameter of main optical axes. A third experiment compared the performance of the optimization solutions with different values of camera parameters. The results showed that the proposed method can adapt to user application preference, and is effective and robust to schedule and allocate monitoring resources in different scenarios."
