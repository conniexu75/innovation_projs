https://openalex.org/W1978270439,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease, characterized by distorted lung architecture and loss of respiratory function. Alveolar epithelial cell injury and hyperplasia, enhanced extracellular matrix deposition, and (myo)fibroblast activation are features of IPF. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been shown to determine epithelial cell fate during development. As aberrant reactivation of developmental signaling pathways has been suggested to contribute to IPF pathogenesis, we hypothesized that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is activated in epithelial cells in IPF. Thus, we quantified and localized the expression and activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in IPF.The expression of Wnt1, 3a, 7b, and 10b, the Wnt receptors Fzd1-4, Lrp5-6, as well as the intracellular signal transducers Gsk-3beta, beta-catenin, Tcf1, 3, 4, and Lef1 was analyzed in IPF and transplant donor lungs by quantitative real-time (q)RT-PCR. Wnt1, 7b and 10b, Fzd2 and 3, beta-catenin, and Lef1 expression was significantly increased in IPF. Immunohistochemical analysis localized Wnt1, Wnt3a, beta-catenin, and Gsk-3beta expression largely to alveolar and bronchial epithelium. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR of primary alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, demonstrating a significant increase of Wnt signaling in ATII cells derived from IPF patients. In addition, Western blot analysis of phospho-Gsk-3beta, phospho-Lrp6, and beta-catenin, and qRT-PCR of the Wnt target genes cyclin D1, Mmp 7, or Fibronectin 1 demonstrated increased functional Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in IPF compared with controls. Functional in vitro studies further revealed that Wnt ligands induced lung epithelial cell proliferation and (myo)fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis.Our study demonstrates that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is expressed and operative in adult lung epithelium. Increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may be involved in epithelial cell injury and hyperplasia, as well as impaired epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk in IPF. Thus, modification of Wnt signaling may represent a therapeutic option in IPF."

Although FMRP is phosphorylated in a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activity-dependent manner following brief protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation, the kinase regulating FMRP function in neuronal protein synthesis is unclear. Here we identify ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) as a major FMRP kinase in the mouse hippocampus, finding that activity-dependent phosphorylation of FMRP by S6K1 requires signaling inputs from mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ERK1/2, and PP2A. Further, the loss of hippocampal S6K1 and the subsequent absence of phospho-FMRP mimic FMRP loss in the increased expression of SAPAP3, a synapse-associated FMRP target mRNA. Together these data reveal a S6K1-PP2A signaling module regulating FMRP function and place FMRP phosphorylation in the mGluR-triggered signaling cascade required for protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity.

The protein, FMRP, is known to associate with ∼3% of the mammalian brain mRNAs, repressing their translation; many of these target mRNAs indeed appear overtranslated in the absence of FMRP (1O'Donnell W.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 315-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology of the fragile X mouse model has revealed a synaptic deficit in the hippocampus with elevated group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated long term depression. Accordingly, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor internalization is enhanced in the absence of FMRP, all thought due to constitutive overtranslation of an long-term depression (LTD)-required FMRP target mRNA(s) (2Bear M.F.

Post-translational modifications are known regulators of activity-dependent protein synthesis (7Routtenberg A. Rekart J.L. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 12-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and FMRP is known to be phosphorylated at a highly conserved serine at position 499. The effects of FMRP phosphorylation on translation by ribosomal run-off assays suggested that non-phosphorylated FMRP associates with actively translating ribosomes, whereas phosphorylated FMRP is found in the context of potentially stalled ribosomes (8Ceman S. O'Donnell W.T. Reed M. Patton S. Pohl J. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We recently determined that FMRP is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and, immediately following mGluR stimulation, PP2A dephosphorylates FMRP, corresponding with the translation of SAPAP3, an FMRP target mRNA (9Narayanan U.

SAPAP3 is a post-synaptic scaffolding protein associated with PSD95, whose message was previously identified as an FMRP target mRNA in the mouse brain following FMRP immunoprecipitation and microchip analyses (10Brown V.

Brain Res. 2004; 126: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Less than 2 min following mGluR activation, FMRP is rephosphorylated in a PP2A- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent fashion, correlating with SAPAP3 translational repression and suggesting phosphorylation as a regulator of group I mGluR-mediated FMRP translational suppression. Here we identify ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) as a major FMRP kinase in the mouse hippocampus. Time course studies following group I mGluR stimulation find that mGluR-triggered ERK1/2 and mTOR signaling mediate FMRP phosphorylation by S6K1. The temporal dynamic of S6K1-mediated FMRP phosphorylation is also regulated by PP2A enzymatic activity, suggestive of an S6K1-PP2A signaling module in the presence mGluR stimulation. Finally, S6K1 K/O mouse hippocampal lysates revealed the absence phospho-FMRP along with an increased expression of SAPAP3, similar to Fmr1 K/O mouse lysates.

The cytoplasmic lysates were generated and processed for FMRP IP as described (10Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J.D.

Transient transfection was conducted using standard techniques (supplemental methods). GST-S6K1 and GST-S6K2 (kind gift of J. W.

Since kinases and phosphatases are known to form stable complexes regulating substrate phosphorylation in the context of synaptic activity (17Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D.

Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Initially, we used known dominant-negative, catalytically inactive mutants of mTOR and S6K1 to study FMRP phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Either WT or KD mTOR and S6K1 mutants were transiently transfected into L-cells stably expressing FLAG-FMRP, and FMRP phosphorylation was monitored by metabolic labeling and FLAG-IPs. We used S6K2, a highly homologous S6 kinase (21Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G.

J. 2003; 373: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as a control, and the assays were conducted in the presence of 0.5 nm okadaic acid to suppress PP2A (24Namboodiripad A.N. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C449-C456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maximize detection of kinase activity. We found that both KD-mTOR and KD-S6K1 eliminated FMRP phosphorylation, whereas S6K2 did not (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Likewise, only WT-mTOR and WT-S6K1 enhanced FMRP phosphorylation. The transfections were found to be efficient and relatively equivalent by Western blotting (Fig. S1B). Since S6K1 is known to function downstream of mTOR (25Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16091-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), these data suggested S6K1 as a candidate FMRP kinase. Further, FMRP-IPs from both non-neuronal cells and primary hippocampal cultures revealed S6K1 complexed with WT FMRP (Fig. 1B, left and middle panels, and Fig. S1C), whereas non-phosphorylated FMRP (S499A FMRP) failed to associate with S6K1 (Fig. 1B, right panel, and Fig. S1D), confirming that serine 499 was required for the S6K1 interaction. However, since FMRP does not contain the canonical RXRXXS S6K1 phosphorylation consensus site (27Flotow H. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3074-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested FMRP as a S6K1 substrate using in vitro kinase assays detecting phospho-FMRP only in the presence of purified, active GST-S6K1 but not GST-S6K2, indicating that FMRP is a S6K1 substrate in vitro (Fig. 1C, left panel). Importantly, serine 499 was required for FMRP phosphorylation in vitro as S499A FMRP was not phosphorylated by S6K1 (Fig. 1C, right panel, and Fig. S1E). These data confirm FMRP as an S6K1 catalytic substrate in vitro, albeit less efficient than the well known S6K1 substrate, ribosomal protein S6 (Fig. S2). To further validate FMRP as an in vivo S6K1 substrate, we used the S6K1 K/O mouse (28Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pende M. Kozma S.C. Jaquet M. Oorschot V. Burcelin R. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Klumperman J. Thorens B. Thomas G.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Using a previously described phospho-specific antibody recognizing phospho-serine499 (22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we found that hippocampal lysates from the S6K1 K/O mouse lacked phospho-FMRP (Fig. 1D). Wild type mice revealed the presence of phospho-FMRP, and equivalent amounts of total FMRP were found between the two genotypes. Together, these data strongly support S6K1 as an FMRP kinase in the mouse hippocampus. To understand the implications of S6K1 phosphorylation of FMRP in the context of neuronal activity, we first confirmed previous reports of S6K1 activation by group I mGluR-mediated ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways (15Hou L. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6352-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 20Page G. Khidir F.A. Pain S. Barrier L. Fauconneau B. Guillard O. Piriou A. Hugon J. Neurochem.

Indeed S6K1 phosphorylation on serine 421/424 (23Phin S. Kupferwasser D. Lam J. Lee-Fruman K.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was observed in primary neurons treated with DHPG, a group I mGluR agonist using untreated neurons as control (Fig. 1E, upper and lower panels). To compare the temporal pattern of mGluR-dependent S6K1 activation with the FMRP phosphorylation pattern identified previously (22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we treated primary neurons with DHPG for 1, 2, 5, 10, and 30 min; an untreated sample was used as control (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). Under these conditions, S6K1 was modestly active at 2 min, becoming highly active at 10 and 30 min (as measured by serine 421/424 phosphorylation) with total S6K1 levels unchanged. Although S6K1 activation at 10 min of DHPG treatment was previously observed (13Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D. Mayeur G.L. Polakiewicz R.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the early activation at 2 and 5 min was not previously reported (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). Further, FMRP-IPs found an increased S6K1-FMRP association upon 5 min of DHPG stimulation correlating with the increased FMRP phosphorylation seen at this time point (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3D), indicating that S6K1 mediates FMRPphosphorylationinanactivity-dependent manner. To examine the signaling that leads to FMRP phosphorylation by S6K1 in the presence of group I mGluR activity, we examined mTOR and ERK1/2, the two major mGluR-triggered pathways. Accordingly, we preincubated primary neurons with 20 μm rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, either alone or in combination with 20 μm U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, followed by DHPG-mediated group I mGluR stimulation (Fig. 2B, C and Fig. S3, B and C). Strikingly, we found that S6K1 phosphorylation was delayed but not abolished in the presence of rapamycin at 10 min following DHPG stimulation, correlating with the delay in activity-dependent FMRP phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Given that rapamycin effectively inhibits S6K1 (21Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 25Ferrari S. Pearson R.B. Siegmann M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16091-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggested that rapamycin-mediated S6K1 suppression by mGluR signaling might be delayed. This was confirmed by measuring S6K1 activity through phospho-S6 immunoreactivity and S6K1 kinase activity assays following DHPG stimulation alone or in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. S4, A, B, D, and E). ERK1/2, the other major mGluR-triggered signaling pathway, is also known to activate S6K1 (13Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D. Mayeur G.L. Polakiewicz R.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 23Phin S. Kupferwasser D. Lam J. Lee-Fruman K.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the presence of U0126 and rapamycin, S6K1 was completely inactivated, and FMRP phosphorylation was entirely abolished (Fig. 2C and Figs. S3C and S4, C and F). Rapamycin and U0126 treatment efficacy was confirmed by Western blotting for phospho-mTOR (P-mTOR) and P-ERK1/2 (Fig. S5). Since mGluR-triggered mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways are known to converge on S6K1 (20Page G. Khidir F.A. Pain S. Barrier L. Fauconneau B. Guillard O. Piriou A. Hugon J. Neurochem. Int. 2006; 49: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), these data suggest that mGluR-dependent S6K1 phosphorylation of FMRP occurs following the convergence of ERK1/2 and mTOR signals on S6K1. To further position S6K1 phosphorylation of FMRP within the known mGluR-triggered pathway (13Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A.C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D. Mayeur G.L. Polakiewicz R.D. Sonenberg N.

We found that FMRP-IPs, at 1 or 5 min following DHPG stimulation, revealed an inverse correlation between the association of PP2A and S6K1 with FMRP in agreement with the pattern of FMRP phosphorylation (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3D). We next assessed the role of PP2A activity in S6K1-mediated FMRP phosphorylation by monitoring S6K1 (serine 421/424) and FMRP phosphorylation in primary neurons preincubated with an excess of okadaic acid (100 nm) followed by DHPG treatment (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3E) with a DHPG-untreated sample as a control (Fig. S6). We included a 30-s time point as we had previously discovered an immediate-early burst in PP2A activity following DHPG exposure (22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As anticipated, an excess of okadaic acid revealed elevated and persistent S6K1 activation detected as phospho-S6K1 (serine 421/424), even at steady state (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3E), whereas DHPG alone yielded the previous pattern of S6K1 and FMRP phosphorylation (Fig. S6 and Fig. 2A). The increase in S6K1 phosphorylation at steady state that is potentiated in the presence of DHPG makes it likely that mGluR activity acts synergistically on PP2A inhibition of S6K1. Importantly, FMRP phosphorylation correlated tightly with the sustained increase in S6K1 activation mediated by PP2A inhibition (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3E), consistent with a possible mGluR-mediated PP2A-S6K1 signaling module regulating FMRP phosphorylation and perhaps downstream translation of FMRP target mRNAs. To determine whether the lack of S6K1 and the consequential absence of phospho-FMRP influence FMRP-modulated translation, we studied SAPAP3 protein levels in the S6K1 K/O mouse. SAPAP3 mRNA is an FMRP target (35Welch J.M. Wang D. Feng G. The J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 472: 24-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Kindler S. Rehbein M. Classen B. Richter D. Bockers T.M.

Nature. 2007; 448: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and SAPAP3 protein levels have been previously correlated inversely with FMRP phosphorylation (22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K.

Hippocampal lysates from the S6K1 K/O showed constitutively increased SAPAP3 expression in the absence of S6K1-mediated FMRP phosphorylation (Fig. 2F, upper panel) despite similar SAPAP3 mRNA levels in WT and S6K1 K/O mice (Fig. S7A). This SAPAP3 difference in expression also remained unaffected in the presence of well known transcriptional and translational inhibitors, which were added to whole brain extracts to eliminate de novo protein synthesis that may occur during processing of samples (Fig. S7B). The efficacy of anisomycin was tested and quantitated using group I mGluR-mediated FMRP expression (Fig. S7C) since it is known that the increase in FMRP protein levels following mGluR stimulation is dependent on translation (2Bear M.F. Huber K.M. Warren S.T. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 15Hou L. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6352-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the observed increase in SAPAP3 in S6K1 K/O mouse hippocampal lysates was similar to that seen in Fmr1 K/O mouse (Fig. 2F, lower panel) and is consistent with the notion that phospho-FMRP negatively influences translation of target messages (6Weiler I.J. Irwin S.A. Klintsova A.Y. Spencer C.M. Brazelton A.D. Miyashiro K. Comery T.A. Patel B. Eberwine J. Greenough W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that S6K1 activity mediates changes in FMRP phosphorylation and function. FMRP is phosphorylated on a highly conserved serine residue, and it has been previously shown in Drosophila that Drosophila FMRP (dFMRP) is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (38Siomi M.C. Higashijima K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8438-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, we failed to detect any effect of casein kinase II on FMRP phosphorylation in primary mammalian neurons in the presence of mGluR activity (Fig. S8A). Although it remains unclear whether the different kinases were found due to species differences, the data reported here find S6K1 as a major FMRP kinase using multiple approaches. Moreover, we tested PAK3 and eEF2K, kinases known to be downstream of S6K1 (39Kimball S.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and found no effect on FMRP phosphorylation, confirming S6K1 specificity for FMRP (Fig. S8, B and C). Furthermore, despite 80% sequence homology to S6K1 (22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Saitoh M. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), S6K2 did not affect FMRP phosphorylation, confirming that S6K1 was an FMRP kinase. Most significant, we failed to detect any phospho-FMRP in the hippocampus of S6K1 K/O mice, validating S6K1 as the FMRP kinase. The precise consequence of FMRP phosphorylation remains to be elucidated. However, data reported here and elsewhere (4Nakamoto M. Nalavadi V. Epstein M.P. Narayanan U. Bassell G.J. Warren S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15537-15542Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30061-30064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) suggest that changes in FMRP target mRNA expression concurred with FMRP phosphorylation suppressing target mRNA expression and FMRP dephosphorylation releasing/potentially activating target mRNA translation. One such message is SAPAP3, whose protein showed increased steady-state levels in the absence of FMRP (4Nakamoto M. Nalavadi V. Epstein M.P. Narayanan U. Bassell G.J. Warren S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15537-15542Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We show here that in the absence of phospho-FMRP, as in the S6K1 K/O mouse, SAPAP3 protein levels were elevated, as seen in the Fmr1 K/O mouse. This closely agrees with earlier suggestions that FMRP phosphorylation is coupled to translational suppression, whereas FMRP dephosphorylation releases target messages for translation (6Weiler I.J. Irwin S.A. Klintsova A.Y. Spencer C.M. Brazelton A.D. Miyashiro K. Comery T.A. Patel B. Eberwine J. Greenough W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This overlap in the consequence of FMRP loss and S6K1 loss may also extend to similarities Fmr1 and S6K1 K/O mice in electrophysiological deficits and behavioral consequences (41Spencer C.M. Alekseyenko O. Serysheva E. Yuva-Paylor L.A. Paylor R. Genes Brain Behav. 2005; 4: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 42Antion M.D. Merhav M. Hoeffer C.A. Reis G. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Schuman E.M. Rosenblum K. Klann E. Learn. Mem. (Cold Spring Harb.). 2008; 15: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As described above, we observed that PP2A inhibition promotes S6K1 activation leading to FMRP phosphorylation at steady state, which is further enhanced in the presence of mGluR activity. These data are consistent with previous studies of mitogenic signaling where PP2A was found to inhibit S6K1 and mTOR was found to regulate both PP2A and S6K1 (33Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Van Kanegan M.J. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36029-36036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our data extend this interplay to neurons, further indicating that mGluR acts synergistically on a pre-existing inhibition of S6K1 by PP2A. Together with prior reports of phosphorylation mediating protein folding (43Kosik K.S. Shimura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), these data suggest a mechanistic model where changes in mGluR-mediated mTOR activity cause S6K1 and PP2A to compete for FMRP, perhaps modulated by FMRP phosphorylation. However, FMRP-IPs following mGluR stimulation revealed both S6K1-FMRP and PP2A-FMRP associations, suggesting that the binding between S6K1 and PP2A with FMRP may occur outside the FMRP phosphorylation pocket, thereby stabilizing the complexes and allowing detection, unlike other kinase-substrate interactions (44Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), which are transient and disrupted following substrate phosphorylation. These data would refine the model with a scaffold adapter protein(s) anchoring and coordinating the assembly/localization of an activity-dependent S6K1-PP2A-FMRP signaling complex. Such an arrangement would provide efficiency and specificity in signal transduction, as is seen with scaffold protein AKAP79 localized to excitatory neuronal synapses, securing a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-protein kinase C (PKC)-PP2B (PKA-PKC-PP2B) complex recruited to glutamate receptors by interactions with membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffold proteins (45Dell'Acqua M.L.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2391-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Further investigation is required to validate such a scaffolding model, but it is an attractive hypothesis given the rapid dynamics of activity-dependent FMRP phosphorylation. This study places FMRP phosphorylation directly within the mGluR-triggered signaling cascade required for protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, a pathway central to the emerging function of FMRP and the consequence of its absence in fragile X syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2060802299,"The association between dietary obesity and mesolimbic systems that regulate hedonic aspects of feeding is currently unresolved. In the present study, we examined differences in baseline and stimulated central dopamine levels in obesity-prone (OP) and obesity-resistant (OR) rats. OP rats were hyperphagic and showed a 20% weight gain over OR rats at wk 15 of age, when fed a standard chow diet. This phenotype was associated with a 50% reduction in basal extracellular dopamine, as measured by a microdialysis probe in the nucleus accumbens, a projection site of the mesolimbic dopamine system that has been implicated in food reward. Similar defects were also observed in younger animals (4 wk old). In electrophysiology studies, electrically evoked dopamine release in slice preparations was significantly attenuated in OP rats, not only in the nucleus accumbens but also in additional terminal sites of dopamine neurons such as the accumbens shell, dorsal striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that there may be a widespread dysfunction in mechanisms regulating dopamine release in this obesity model. Moreover, dopamine impairment in OP rats was apparent at birth and associated with changes in expression of several factors regulating dopamine synthesis and release: vesicular monoamine transporter-2, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, and dopamine receptor-2 short-form. Taken together, these results suggest that an attenuated central dopamine system would reduce the hedonic response associated with feeding and induce compensatory hyperphagia, leading to obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1965665664,"In the absence of sensory stimulation, neocortical circuits display complex patterns of neural activity. These patterns are thought to reflect relevant properties of the network, including anatomical features like its modularity. It is also assumed that the synaptic connections of the network constrain the repertoire of emergent, spontaneous patterns. Although the link between network architecture and network activity has been extensively investigated in the last few years from different perspectives, our understanding of the relationship between the network connectivity and the structure of its spontaneous activity is still incomplete. Using a general mathematical model of neural dynamics we have studied the link between spontaneous activity and the underlying network architecture. In particular, here we show mathematically how the synaptic connections between neurons determine the repertoire of spatial patterns displayed in the spontaneous activity. To test our theoretical result, we have also used the model to simulate spontaneous activity of a neural network, whose architecture is inspired by the patchy organization of horizontal connections between cortical columns in the neocortex of primates and other mammals. The dominant spatial patterns of the spontaneous activity, calculated as its principal components, coincide remarkably well with those patterns predicted from the network connectivity using our theory. The equivalence between the concept of dominant pattern and the concept of attractor of the network dynamics is also demonstrated. This in turn suggests new ways of investigating encoding and storage capabilities of neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W2076647535,"Migratory bird, bat and insect species tend to have more pointed wings than non-migrants. Pointed wings and low wingloading, or body mass divided by wing area, are thought to reduce energy consumption during long-distance flight, but these hypotheses have never been directly tested. Furthermore, it is not clear how the atmospheric conditions migrants encounter while aloft affect their energy use; without such information, we cannot accurately predict migratory species' response(s) to climate change. Here, we measured the heart rates of 15 free-flying Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) during migratory flight. Heart rate, and therefore rate of energy expenditure, was positively associated with individual variation in wingtip roundedness and wingloading throughout the flights. During the cruise phase of the flights, heart rate was also positively associated with wind speed but not wind direction, and negatively but not significantly associated with large-scale atmospheric stability. High winds and low atmospheric stability are both indicative of the presence of turbulent eddies, suggesting that birds may be using more energy when atmospheric turbulence is high. We therefore suggest that pointed wingtips, low wingloading and avoidance of high winds and turbulence reduce flight costs for small birds during migration, and that climate change may have the strongest effects on migrants' in-flight energy use if it affects the frequency and/or severity of high winds and atmospheric instability."
https://openalex.org/W2095204610,"One major intracellular signaling pathway involved in heart failure employs the phosphatase calcineurin and its downstream transcriptional effector nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). In vivo evidence for the involvement of NFAT factors in heart failure development is still ill defined. Here we reveal that nfatc2 transcripts outnumber those from other nfat genes in the unstimulated heart by severalfold. Transgenic mice with activated calcineurin in the postnatal myocardium crossbred with nfatc2-null mice revealed a significant abrogation of calcineurin-provoked cardiac growth, indicating that NFATc2 plays an important role downstream of calcineurin and validates the original hypothesis that calcineurin mediates myocyte hypertrophy through activation of NFAT transcription factors. In the absence of NFATc2, a clear protection against the geometrical, functional, and molecular deterioration of the myocardium following biomechanical stress was also evident. In contrast, physiological cardiac enlargement in response to voluntary exercise training was not affected in nfatc2-null mice. Combined, these results reveal a major role for the NFATc2 transcription factor in pathological cardiac remodeling and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1993782327,"The role of inter-specific hybridisation is of particular importance in mosquito disease vectors for predicting the evolution of insecticide resistance. Two molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s., currently recognized as S and M taxa, are considered to be incipient sibling species. Hybrid scarcity in the field was suggested that differentiation of M and S taxa is maintained by limited or absent gene flow. However, recent studies have revealed shared polymorphisms within the M and S forms, and a better understanding of the occurrence of gene flow is needed. One such shared polymorphism is the G119S mutation in the ace-1 gene (which is responsible for insecticide resistance); this mutation has been described in both the M and S forms of A. gambiae s.s.To establish whether the G119S mutation has arisen independently in each form or by genetic introgression, we analysed coding and non-coding sequences of ace-1 alleles in M and S mosquitoes from representative field populations. Our data revealed many polymorphic sites shared by S and M forms, but no diversity was associated with the G119S mutation. These results indicate that the G119S mutation was a unique event and that genetic introgression explains the observed distribution of the G119S mutation within the two forms. However, it was impossible to determine from our data whether the mutation occurred first in the S form or in the M form. Unexpectedly, sequence analysis of some resistant individuals revealed a duplication of the ace-1 gene that was observed in both A. gambiae s.s. M and S forms. Again, the distribution of this duplication in the two forms most likely occurred through introgression.These results highlight the need for more research to understand the forces driving the evolution of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and to regularly monitor resistance in mosquito populations of Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2001610592,"The aquaporins (AQP) are water channel proteins playing a major role in transcellular and transepithelial water movement. Recently, the role of AQPs in human carcinogenesis has become an area of great interest. Here, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), we have found an expression of AQP5 protein in 35.3% (IHC-score: ≥1, 144/408) of the resected NSCLC tissue samples. Cases with AQP5-positive status (IHC-score: ≥2) displayed a higher rate of tumor recurrence than negative ones in NSCLC (54.7% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.005) and worse disease-free survival (p = 0.033; OR = 1.52; 95%CI:1.04−2.23). Further in vitro invasion assay using BEAS-2B and NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with overexpression constructs for full length wild-type AQP5 (AQP5) and its two mutants, N185D which blocks membrane trafficking and S156A which blocks phosphorylation on Ser156, showed that AQP5 induced cell invasions while both mutants did not. In BEAS-2B cells, the expression of AQP5 caused a spindle-like and fibroblastic morphologic change and losses of cell-cell contacts and cell polarity. Only cells with AQP5, not either of two mutants, exhibited a loss of epithelial cell markers and a gain of mesenchymal cell markers. In a human SH3-domains protein array, cellular extracts from BEAS-2B with AQP5 showed a robust binding activity to SH3-domains of the c-Src, Lyn, and Grap2 C-terminal. Furthermore, in immunoprecipitation assay, activated c-Src, phosphorylated on Tyr416, showed a stronger binding activity to cellular extracts from BEAS-2B with AQP5 compared with N185D or S156A mutant. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis failed to show evidence of genomic amplification, suggesting AQP5 expression as a secondary event. Based on these clinical and molecular observations, we conclude that AQP5, through its phosphorylation on Ser156 and subsequent interaction with c-Src, plays an important role in NSCLC invasion and, therefore, may provide a unique opportunity for developing a novel therapeutic target as well as a prognostic marker in NSCLC."

Tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of phospholipase C-γ2, one of many intracellular signaling events that follow BCR ligation, leads to rapid release of calcium from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. Depletion of the intracellular calcium stores triggers a second phase of calcium mobilization, characterized by sustained calcium entry into the cell via plasma membrane-associated “store-operated” calcium entry (SOCE) channels (1Engelke M.

A point mutation in Orai1 causes a form of hereditary severe combined immune deficiency syndrome, emphasizing the importance of intracellular calcium in lymphocyte physiology. However, although SOCE is absent in T lymphocytes from these patients, SOCE in B lymphocytes is reduced but not abolished, indicating additional SOCE pathways in the B cell lineage (1Engelke M.

Increasing evidence has indicated that CD20, a B cell-restricted member of the MS4A (multispanning 4A) family of tetraspanins, functions in calcium entry. Intracellular calcium levels were increased in non-B cells ectopically expressing CD20 by transfection, and a calcium-mediated current, similar to that observed in B cells, was detected by whole cell patch clamp analysis (8Bubien J.K.

BCR-activated calcium entry was reduced after siRNA-mediated down-regulation of CD20 in a human B cell line (10Li H. Ayer L.M. Lytton J. Deans J.P. J. Biol.

A large increase in calcium influx was observed in thapsigargin-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CD20, demonstrating that CD20 is involved in SOCE (10Li H. Ayer L.M. Lytton J. Deans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42427-42434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The accumulated evidence thus firmly points to a role for CD20 in BCR-activated SOCE, although it is not yet clear whether CD20 is a channel, a component of a channel, or if it regulates SOCE in some other way. Although there is no direct evidence that CD20 forms an ion channel, it does assemble into multimeric molecular complexes. After chemical cross-linking of proximal cell surface proteins, CD20 immunoprecipitates in 70-kDa and 140-kDa complexes, in addition to 33–35-kDa forms of monomeric CD20, suggestive of homo-oligomerization (8Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that large CD20 complexes (>200 kDa) were preserved in digitonin lysates (12Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), allowing analysis without the need for exogenous cross-linkers. Here, by coprecipitation of native CD20 with tagged or truncated forms of the protein, we provide direct evidence that CD20 monomers are indeed assembled into homo-tetrameric complexes. We showed previously by immunofluorescence that CD20 and the BCR colocalize in the plasma membrane of resting B cells (13Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this report, CD20 is shown to be expressed in constitutive physical association with cell surface immunoglobulin (sIgM), the antigen-binding component of the BCR. After BCR ligation, the CD20 oligomer dissociates from sIgM and becomes transiently associated with phosphoproteins and calmodulin-binding proteins. These data provide new evidence of the involvement of CD20 in signaling downstream of the BCR and, together with the previously described involvement of CD20 in SOCE, the first evidence of physical coupling of the BCR to a calcium entry pathway. Cells—BJAB and Ramos lymphoma B cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium and 7.5% fetal bovine serum. BJAB cells expressing CD20-GFP and Molt4 T cells expressing either wild-type CD20 (CD20WT) or CD20 truncated at residue 278 (CD20TR) were previously described and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum with 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) (14Li H.

L26 (anti-CD20) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-GFP was from Eusera (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). For immunoprecipitation of MHCII and CD45, we used HB10 and 9.4, respectively, from Dr. J. Ledbetter (Seattle, WA). For detection of CD45 by immunoblotting, we used anti-CD45 from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Goat anti-human Igμ, F(ab′)2, and Fab, unlabeled and conjugated to biotin, Cy3, or horseradish peroxidase, were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cy3-conjugated streptavidin, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), and Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) were also from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and anti-phosphoserine/threonine were from Millipore (Billerica, MA) and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugated to IR dye 700 DX was from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Streptavidin conjugated to IR dye 800 CW was from Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). Cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to biotin was purchased from Sigma, and biotinylated calmodulin was from Calbiochem. Protein A-horseradish peroxidase, neutralite avidin-horseradish peroxidase, and goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L)-horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Bio-Rad, Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL), and Chemicon International, Inc (Temecula, CA), respectively. For cell surface biotinylation, EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was purchased from Pierce and used according to the manufacturer's directions. Immunoprecipitation—Ramos or BJAB B cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% digitonin (Calbiochem) and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaMoO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA). Microcystin-LR (Sigma) (1 mm) was included in the lysis buffer for experiments examining serine/threonine-phosphorylated proteins. For cholesterol depletion, Ramos cells (107 cells/ml) were treated before lysis with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. After lysis, the detergent-insoluble material was pelleted at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Residual detergent-insoluble material was cleared at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in some experiments. The soluble lysates were transferred to clean chilled tubes and incubated with antibodies for 2 h on ice followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen, Cambridge, MA), protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or avidin-agarose (Pierce) depending upon the immunoprecipitating antibody. Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, pelleted, washed with lysis buffer, alternating between high salt-containing (500 mm NaCl) and low salt-containing (150 mm NaCl) buffers, and finally washed once with PBS; all wash buffers contained the inhibitors listed above. In experiments where CD20 dephosphorylation was required, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 6.8) and treated with 4 units of alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer. Cell Stimulation—Cells were incubated with F(ab′)2 anti-human Igμ (50 μg of antibody/108 cells) at the temperatures and times indicated. Cell stimulation was halted with the addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer. After at least 15 min on ice, detergent-insoluble matter was pelleted, and the soluble lysate was transferred to clean microfuge tubes. Western Blotting and Calmodulin Overlay Assays—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and blotted using the reagents indicated in the figure legends. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and recorded using a Fluor-S MAX imager (Bio-Rad). Samples for calmodulin overlay were prepared essentially as for Western blot analysis except that 1 mm CaCl2, Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl) buffer was used in all steps. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE reducing gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) at 50 V for 1.5 h and then at 100 V for 30 min. Membranes were washed in PBS, blocked for 1.5 h in 1 mm CaCl2/Odyssey infrared imaging system blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences), and incubated for 1.5 h with 4 mg of biotinylated calmodulin/ml of blocking buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% Tween. The membrane was then washed four times in 0.1% Tween 20 and PBS; incubated with streptavidin-800 CW, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm CaCl2/blocking buffer for 1 h; washed with 0.1% Tween 20 and PBS; rinsed with PBS; and scanned using the Odyssey system. Isolation of Detergent-resistant Membranes—Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) were isolated from 108 Ramos cells or 5 × 107 BJAB cells as described previously (13Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using 1% Brij58. After sucrose gradient centrifugation, eight fractions (1.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots of each fraction were mixed with SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. For microscopy, fractions containing DRMs were diluted and pelleted as described (17Mutch C.M. Sanyal R. Unruh T.L. Grigoriou L. Zhu M. Zhang W. Deans J.P. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The DRMs were resuspended in 200 μl of Tris buffer (10 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl), fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and stained as described (13Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Mutch C.M. Sanyal R. Unruh T.L. Grigoriou L. Zhu M. Zhang W. Deans J.P. Int.

Isolation of Detergent-free Raft Membranes—Detergent-free raft membranes were isolated as described (17Mutch C.M. Sanyal R. Unruh T.L. Grigoriou L. Zhu M. Zhang W. Deans J.P. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8) with the inhibitors listed above and then sheared by repeated passage through a 22G 3-inch needle. Samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the shearing/centrifugation steps were repeated on the cell pellets. Supernatants from each round were combined, mixed with an equal volume of 50% iodixanol (Optiprep, Axis-Shield PoCAs, Oslo, Norway), 250 mm sucrose, and 120 mm Tris (pH 7.8), and overlayered with a step gradient consisting of 20 and 5% iodixanol in the same buffer. Following centrifugation, the membranes at the 5–20% interface were collected and treated as described above for DRMs. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Preparation of samples for immunofluorescence microscopy and analysis of colocalization were described in detail previously (13Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Mutch C.M. Sanyal R. Unruh T.L. Grigoriou L. Zhu M. Zhang W. Deans J.P. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CD20 Homo-oligomerization—To examine homo-oligomerization of CD20 without using chemical cross-linking, we tested its ability to coprecipitate with tagged or truncated forms of CD20 that could be distinguished by size from native CD20. We first used BJAB cells expressing GFP-conjugated CD20 (CD20-GFP) to ask whether CD20-GFP formed mixed oligomers with endogenous CD20. In these cells, CD20-GFP is localized to the plasma membrane with no detectable intracellular pool and colocalizes and co-caps with endogenous CD20, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Anti-GFP or anti-CD20 antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate CD20-GFP from digitonin lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were probed by anti-CD20 immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous CD20 was readily detected in association with CD20-GFP. To assess the number of CD20 monomers in each oligomeric complex, we used a truncated form of CD20 (CD20TR) that lacked 20 amino acids at the C terminus. An antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide (anti-CD20C) was used to specifically immunoprecipitate CD20WT, whereas both CD20WT and CD20TR could be detected on immunoblots using an antibody raised against a peptide near the N terminus (anti-CD20N) (Fig. 1B). When CD20WT and CD20TR were co-expressed with one construct at a limiting concentration, the ratio of their association was expected to predict the number of CD20 molecules in each complex. Titrated amounts of CD20WT cDNA were cotransfected into HEK293 cells with a fixed amount of CD20TR cDNA to determine concentrations that would result in high expression of CD20TR and low expression of CD20WT. Under these conditions (Fig. 1C, fourth lane), we found that the ratio of coprecipitation of CD20TR with CD20WT was 1:3 (Fig. 1C, duplicate samples shown in second and third lanes), consistent with homo-tetramers. Similar experiments were performed using CD20WT cotransfected with a limiting concentration of HA-tagged CD20. Fig. 1D demonstrates the efficiency and specificity of immunoprecipitation of CD20-HA using anti-HA. CD20 typically migrates as a doublet after SDS-PAGE, because of differential phosphorylation (19Tedder T.F. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10009-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the position of CD20-HA on the gels is close to the upper band of CD20WT. Therefore, immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to alkaline phosphatase treatment to eliminate the slower migrating form of CD20WT that would otherwise interfere with the detection of CD20-HA (Fig. 1D, lower panel). For the experiments represented in Fig. 1E, cells were transfected with CD20WT, CD20-HA, or both with CD20-HA at limiting concentration. Immunoprecipitated samples were treated with alkaline phosphatase before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The results showed that precipitation of CD20-HA with anti-HA coprecipitated CD20WT at an ∼1:3 ratio, similar to results from the CD20WT/TR experiments represented in Fig. 1C, again consistent with tetrameric homo-oligomers. CD20 Specifically Associates with Cell Surface Immunoglobulin—The size of the CD20 complex solubilized in digitonin (>200 kDa) exceeds the size of a tetramer (∼140 kDa), indicating the inclusion of additional molecules (12Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To examine whether the CD20 complex included other membrane proteins, BJAB cells were cell surface biotinylated, and then CD20 was immunoprecipitated for analysis by avidin blotting. Cell surface proteins of ∼80, ∼68, ∼45, ∼35, and ∼29 kDa were detected in these experiments (Fig. 2A). The ∼35-kDa protein comigrated with CD20, as shown by stripping and reblotting. The ∼68-kDa protein was not always detected and was also sometimes observed in the control lane. The ∼45-kDa protein was not identified (discussed below). The remaining two bands at 80 and 29 kDa comigrated with the heavy chains (sIgμ) and light chains (sIgL) of sIgM immunoprecipitated from BJAB lysates with anti-Igμ (Fig. 2B, left panel). Similar results were obtained using Ramos cells, except that sIgL from these cells migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2B, right panel). To confirm the association of CD20 with sIgM, anti-Igμ Western blot analysis was performed on CD20 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Total cellular IgM was immunoprecipitated for comparison; Igμ was detected as a doublet, with the upper band representing the mature glycoform at the plasma membrane and the lower band representing an intracellular, immature form (20Bergman Y. Haimovich J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Melchers F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2204-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CD20 coprecipitated only the upper band of Igμ, indicating its specific association with sIgM. In the reverse experiment, CD20 was detected in anti-Igμ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Densitometry analysis estimated that 10.2% of total sIgM (measuring the upper band of Igμ only) coprecipitated with anti-CD20 and that the same proportion of total CD20 (10.2%) coprecipitated with anti-Igμ. To further test the specificity of the association between CD20 and sIgM, we immunoprecipitated CD45 or MHCII from biotin-labeled cells. Avidin blot analysis did not reveal the presence of a band corresponding to sIgμ in these samples as it did in the immunoprecipitated CD20 sample from the same experiment (Fig. 2D). CD20 Association with sIgM Is Cholesterol-independent—Previous studies have demonstrated that CD20 and a fraction of BCRs constitutively reside in lipid rafts (14Li H. Ayer L.M. Polyak M.J. Mutch C.M. Petrie R.J. Gauthier L. Shariat N. Hendzel M.J. Shaw A.R. Patel K.D. Deans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19893-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Pierce S.K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, only the upper band of Igμ (i.e. sIgM) was detected in the lipid raft fraction of lysates from unstimulated Ramos cells, and this was estimated by densitometry to represent 10.2% of total sIgM. A large proportion of CD20 also localized to the raft fraction, suggesting that the association of CD20 with sIgM may occur within lipid rafts; therefore, we examined whether the association was dependent upon cholesterol, an essential component of lipid rafts. Biotin-labeled Ramos B cells were untreated or treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin using previously established conditions (23Petrie R.J. Schnetkamp P.P. Patel K.D. Awasthi-Kalia M. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The efficiency of cholesterol depletion was confirmed as described (23Petrie R.J. Schnetkamp P.P. Patel K.D. Awasthi-Kalia M. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Additionally, because digitonin binds to cholesterol, efficient lysis of methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated cells in digitonin was tested and confirmed (data not shown). When CD20 was immunoprecipitated from untreated or cholesterol-depleted cells, there was no difference in the amount of coprecipitated sIgM (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the association between CD20 and sIgM was unlikely to be mediated by cholesterol or to be dependent on the integrity of rafts. BCR Dissociates from CD20 upon Receptor Cross-linking—We had previously shown by immunofluorescence microscopy that sIgM and CD20, while colocalized in resting cells, laterally separate from one another on the cell surface within minutes of BCR ligation at 37 °C (13Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that dissociation of BCR-CD20 complexes had occurred; however, because these complexes involve 10% of total sIgM, it was possible that the intact complex was retained as a minor subset of otherwise segregated receptors at the cell surface. Therefore, we next examined the effect of receptor cross-linking on the integrity of the isolated sIgM-CD20 complex. Biotin-labeled Ramos cells were incubated with or without F(ab′)2 anti-Igμ before lysis and CD20 immunoprecipitation. After incubation with F(ab′)2 anti-Igμ, the bands corresponding to sIgM were significantly reduced in intensity, even when BCR ligation was performed on ice (Fig. 4A). In cells that were stimulated over time at 37 °C, the dissociation was evident after 1 min and was complete by 5 min post-stimulation (data not shown). The dissociation of CD20 and sIgM was not a result of steric hindrance by the ligating antibody, as F(ab′)2 anti-Igμ did not induce dissociation when it was added to the lysates (Fig. 4B), although it binds well to soluble sIgM, as evidenced by its use in immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, B and C). Additionally, dissociation did not occur when the BCR was ligated using Fab anti-Igμ (Fig. 4C), indicating a requirement for cross-linking. After cross-linking, the BCR becomes largely insoluble in most detergents because of its translocation into lipid rafts and/or firm attachment to cytoskeletal elements. The solubility of CD20 in digitonin is not altered, as seen in Fig. 4, A–C. A trivial explanation for the results shown in Fig. 4, A–C, is that the dissociation occurred after lysis as a result of differential solubility of CD20 and sIgM. To examine this question using an assay where differential solubility is not an issue, we used a detergent-free lipid raft isolation procedure (18Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) that we had previously adapted and optimized for immunofluorescence microscopy (17Mutch C.M. Sanyal R. Unruh T.L. Grigoriou L. Zhu M. Zhang W. Deans J.P. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells expressing CD20-GFP were incubated on ice either with Fab anti-Igμ (Cy3) to label the BCR or with F(ab′)2 anti-Igμ (Cy3) to both label and cross-link the BCR. The cells were then lysed without detergent and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The buoyant, or light, membrane fragments were then imaged and analyzed using colocalization software. As shown in Fig. 4D, without BCR cross-linking there is a high frequency of CD20 colocalized with sIgM, similar to data obtained from detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), whereas after BCR cross-linking the proportion of CD20 colocalized with sIgM drops significantly. These data demonstrate that rapid dissociation of sIgM-CD20 complexes occurs upon receptor engagement. CD20 Associates with Phosphorylated and Calmodulin-binding Proteins after BCR Ligation—Phosphorylation of CD20 is enhanced at specific sites after BCR ligation (24Valentine M.A. Meier K.E. Rossie S. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11282-11287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that associated signaling proteins could regulate its function. Rapid dissociation of sIgM-CD20 complexes made it possible to look for recruitment of signaling proteins specifically to CD20 after receptor engagement. To search for CD20-associated phosphoproteins, Western blot analysis of CD20 immunoprecipitates was performed using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphoserine/threonine antibodies. An ∼60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was reproducibly detected in the CD20 complex after 5 min of receptor stimulation at 37 °C (Fig. 5, A and B) but not at earlier or later time points (Fig. 5B). Serine- or threonine-phosphorylated proteins of ∼100 kDa and >175 kDa were reproducibly detected after stimulation for 30 s and 1 min, respectively (Fig. 5C). Given the involvement of CD20 in BCR-activated calcium influx, we next looked for recruitment of calcium-sensitive signaling molecules, using a calmodulin overlay assay with biotin-conjugated calmodulin (25Billingsley M.L. Pennypacker K.R. Hoover C.G. Brigati D.J. Kincaid R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7585-7589Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The calcium specifici"

Our screening efforts resulted in the discovery of a series of novel small molecule inhibitors of viral entry that are highly active against both Old World and New World hemorrhagic arenaviruses. We observed potent inhibition of infection of human and primate cells with live hemorrhagic arenaviruses (IC50 = 500–800 nm). Investigations of the mechanism of action revealed that the candidate compounds efficiently block pH-dependent fusion by the arenavirus GPs (IC50 of 200–350 nm). Although our lead compounds were potent against phylogenetically distant arenaviruses, they did not show activity against other enveloped viruses with class I viral fusion proteins, indicating specificity for arenavirus GP-mediated membrane fusion.

Jahrling P.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S110-S121Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). LASV is estimated to infect several hundred thousand individuals yearly in endemic regions of West Africa, resulting in significant mortality and high morbidity (2McCormick J.B. Fisher-Hoch S.P. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 262: 75-109PubMed Google Scholar). There is no licensed vaccine available, and therapeutic options are restricted, resulting in 15–30% mortality in hospitalized Lassa fever patients. The New World arenavirus JUNV causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever, a severe illness with hemorrhagic and neurological manifestations and a case fatality rate of 15–35% (3Weissenbacher M.C. Laguens R.P. Coto C.E. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1987; 134: 79-116PubMed Google Scholar). The related MACV and GTOV are the causative agents of severe viral hemorrhagic fevers in Bolivia and Venezuela, respectively (4Peters C.J. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 262: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because of their high mortality and the limited therapeutic repertoire available, hemorrhagic arenaviruses have been classified as Category A pathogens by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (5Borio L. Inglesby T. Peters C.J. Schmaljohn A.L. Hughes J.M. Jahrling P.B. Ksiazek T. Johnson K.M. Meyerhoff A. O'Toole T. Ascher M.S. Bartlett J. Breman J.G. Eitzen Jr., E.M. Hamburg M. Hauer J.

Apart from the severe humanitarian burden in endemic regions, increased international air traffic has also led to the importation of arenaviral viral hemorrhagic fever cases into metropolitan areas around the globe (6Schmitz H. Kohler B. Laue T. Drosten C. Veldkamp P.J. Gunther S. Emmerich P. Geisen H.P. Fleischer K. Beersma M.F. Hoerauf A.

A hallmark of fatal arenavirus viral hemorrhagic fever cases is marked immunosuppression of the host and consequent uncontrolled fatal infection (1Geisbert T.W. Jahrling P.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S110-S121Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Those who survive develop a vigorous anti-viral immune response during the second week of disease, control the infection, and ultimately clear the virus. A highly predictive factor for disease outcome is the extent of viremia, indicating a close competition between viral spread and replication and the immune system of the patient (2McCormick J.B. Fisher-Hoch S.P. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 262: 75-109PubMed Google Scholar). Drugs targeting viral entry will slow viral spread and replication, providing the immune system of the patient a window of opportunity to develop anti-viral immune responses. A notable difference between LASV and the pathogenic New World arenaviruses is their use of distinct primary cellular receptors, with LASV employing α-dystroglycan (α-DG) (8Cao W.

Receptor binding and entry of arenaviruses are mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP). Arenavirus GP is synthesized as a single polypeptide that undergoes post-translational processing to yield the mature virion glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. GP1 is involved in receptor binding (10Borrow P. Oldstone M.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7270-7281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GP2 is similar to the fusion active portions of other enveloped viruses including retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses (11Eschli B. Quirin K. Wepf A. Weber J. Zinkernagel R. Hengartner H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our present study applied a novel cell-based high throughput screening assay of synthetic small molecule libraries to identify inhibitors of arenavirus infection using arenavirus GP as a target. Our screening efforts resulted in the discovery of a series of novel small inhibitors of viral entry that are highly effective against both Old World and New World hemorrhagic arenaviruses. Chemical Libraries—The combinatorial chemical libraries were generated by parallel synthesis utilizing solution phase synthetic techniques as described (12Berg T. Cohen S.B. Desharnais J.

The multistep synthesis of such chemical libraries employing liquid-liquid and liquid-solid extractions to remove unreacted starting materials, reagents, and reagent byproducts provided the purified final products (>95% pure) irrespective of reaction efficiency. Implementation was in formats for the parallel synthesis of individual pure compounds (100–1000 member libraries, individual compounds) and modest sized libraries composed of small mixtures (1,000 membered libraries, 4–10 compounds/mixture), an approach compatible with our screening objective. Cells and Viruses—African green monkey kidney (VeroE6) cells, human lung epithelial (A549) cells, and human cervical epithelial (HeLa) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. All of the infections of cells with live viruses LASV (Josiah), MACV (Carvallo), GTOV (VINH-9551), and JUNV (XJ-13) were performed in the BSL4 laboratory at the Special Pathogens Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). HeLa and VeroE6 cells were grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips. Virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–1.0 was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of drugs or solvent control for 45 min and then added to cell monolayers for 1 h. At 16–24 h after infection, the cells were fixed, and infection was assessed by immunofluorescence staining with mouse hyperimmune sera to Old World or New World arenaviruses as described (9Radoshitzky S.R. Abraham J. Spiropoulou C.F. Kuhn J.H. Nguyen D. Li W. Nagel J. Schmidt P.J. Nunberg J.H. Andrews N.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Nature. 2007; 446: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For infection with influenza A/WSN/33 influenza (WSN; H1N1), 200 plaque-forming units/well of virus were treated with the indicated drug concentrations as described above and added to monolayers of Madrin-Darby canine kidney cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to infect cells. After 12 h, infection was assessed by stained for influenza nucleoprotein using immune mouse serum. The cells were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Cells and cell clusters expressing NP were scored. For infection with the paramyxovirus Measles virus, infection was performed on VeroE6 cells using the measles-GFP virus as performed above for WSN. Infection was assessed by detection of GFP-expressing cells and cell clusters. High Throughput Screening (HTS) of Combinatorial Chemical Libraries—Retroviral pseudotypes of LASV, JUNV, GTOV, and MACV virus as well as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were generated and titers determined as described (20Rojek J.M. Spiropoulou C.F. Campbell K.P. Kunz S. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 5685-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Rojek J.M. Spiropoulou C.F. Kunz S. Virology. 2006; 349: 476-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Pseudotypes (multiplicity of infection of 0.1) were preincubated with the compounds (concentration was 50 μm for individual compounds and 5 μm for individual compounds in mixtures of 4–10) for 45 min and then added to cell monolayers in 96-well plates in presence of drug. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed briefly and then incubated for 48 h. Infection was quantified using the Steady-Glo® high sensitivity luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega) in a Berthold® 96-well plate luminometer. Cell Viability Assay—Cytotoxicity of candidate compounds was assessed using CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega), which determines the number of viable cells in a culture by quantification of ATP. For the assay, 104 A549 cells were plated per well of a 96-well plate and cultured overnight, resulting in monolayers. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of candidate compounds applied as in the pseudotype infection assay. After 48 h, CellTiter-Glo® reagent was added, the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and concentrations causing 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) were calculated. GP-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion—A cell-cell fusion reporter assay (22York J. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7775-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used to characterize the ability of candidate compounds to block pH-dependent cell-cell fusion mediated by the GPs of LASV and JUNV. Briefly, Vero cells infected with vTF7–3 and expressing the envelope glycoprotein were co-cultured with reporter cells infected with vCB21R-lacZ, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing β-galactosidase under the control of the T7 promoter. The reporter cells were obtained by incubating VeroE6 cells with vCB21R-lacZ at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and allowing the infection to proceed overnight in the presence of 100 μg/ml rifampicin. The GP-expressing cells and reporter cells were co-cultured in medium containing both araC and rifampicin for 5 h. Candidate drugs at the indicated concentrations were added for 45 min, and the cells were washed and then subjected to a 30-min pulse of neutral or acidic (pH 5.0) medium. β-Galactosidase expression is induced upon fusion of the effector and reporter cells and was detected in cell lysates after 5 h of continued cultivation at neutral pH using the chemiluminescent substrate GalactoLite Plus (Tropix). Cell-cell fusion was quantified using a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer. Solid Phase Virus Binding Assay—LASV (Josiah), produced and inactivated by γ-irradiation (23Spiropoulou C.F. Kunz S. Rollin P.E. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5140-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was preincubated with the candidate compounds at 50 μm for 1 h and then added to α-DG immobilized in microtiter plates. After 2 h, the wells were washed and bound virus detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (24Kunz S. Rojek J. Perez M. Spiropoulou C. MB O. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5979-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—A549 cells were incubated with the candidate compounds at 50 μm for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were then chilled on ice and detached with enzyme-free cell dissociation, and the cell surface expression of α-DG and TfR1 was assessed by flow cytometry (9Radoshitzky S.R. Abraham J. Spiropoulou C.F. Kuhn J.H. Nguyen D. Li W. Nagel J. Schmidt P.J. Nunberg J.H. Andrews N.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Nature. 2007; 446: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 20Rojek J.M.

High Throughput Screening of Combinatorial Chemical Libraries for Inhibitors of LASV Entry—In our search for arenavirus entry inhibitors, we initially focused on LASV, which is the most prevalent human pathogen among the arenaviruses. Because LASV is a BSL4 pathogen, work with the virus is restricted. To perform HTS under BSL2 conditions, we generated recombinant retroviruses containing the GP of LASV in their envelope by pseudotyping (Fig. 1A). Because the GP of arenaviruses is necessary and sufficient for receptor binding and entry, recombinant retroviruses pseudotyped with arenavirus GPs represent powerful tools to screen for viral entry inhibitors. The chemical libraries were generated by the parallel synthesis of individual compounds or small mixtures in a format compatible with our screening objective. Candidate compounds derived from these libraries were synthesized using established chemical methods, are chemically stable, and generally have potential drug-like qualities (12Berg T. Cohen S.B. Desharnais J. Sonderegger C. Maslyar D.J. Goldberg J. Boger D.L. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3830-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13Boger D.L. Desharnais J.

A. 2001; 98: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). HTS of >80,000 compounds, including iminodiacetic acid- and pyrrolidine-based peptidomimetics as well as heterocyclic compounds, resulted in identification of 157 compounds or mixtures with an IC50 of <50 μm. The hits tended to appear in clusters corresponding to groups of structurally related compounds (Fig. 1B). Compound concentrations causing 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) was determined, and candidates with a selectivity index (CC50/IC50) of >10 were selected. To assess target specificity, the 125 selected candidates were subjected to a counter screen using retroviral pseudotypes containing the GP of the rhabdovirus VSV. VSV GP recognizes distinct cellular receptors (8Cao W. Henry M.D. Borrow P. Yamada H. Elder J.H. Ravkov E.V. Nichol S.T. Compans R.W. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. Science. 1998; 282: 2079-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and differs structurally from arenavirus GPs, belonging to a different class of viral fusion active proteins (25Roche S. Rey F.A. Gaudin Y. Bressanelli S. Science. 2007; 315: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of VSV pseudotype infection indicated unwanted off target effects. Because both arenaviruses and VSV enter cells by endocytosis followed by pH-dependent membrane fusion in endosomes (26Borrow P. Oldstone M.B. Virology. 1994; 198: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27Rose J.K. Whitt M.A. Fields B.N. Knipe D.L. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1221-1244Google Scholar), our counter screen also allowed exclusion of drug effects that resulted in perturbation of membrane trafficking or depletion of endosomal proton gradients. Based on this counter screen, 32 single compounds and 53 compound mixtures were identified that specifically blocked LASV GP-mediated infection and had no effect on infection with VSV pseudotypes. Nine of the 32 specific single compounds were selected by criteria of potency, chemical tractability, and drug-like properties. These candidates showed dose-dependent inhibition of LASV pseudotype infection at low micromolar IC50 values with IC50 < 1 μm for compounds 16G8, 17C8, and 17C9 (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, these candidates showed similar activity and specificity in several human and primate cell lines, indicating independence of the anti-viral activity from the cell type (Fig. 2C). Broad Activity of Candidate Compounds against Human Pathogenic Arenaviruses—The South American hemorrhagic fever (HF) viruses JUNV, GTOV, and MACV are genetically and structurally distinct from the Old World arenavirus LASV and show different receptor usage. Despite these differences, most compounds identified by screening with LASV pseudotypes showed significant activity against pseudotypes of the South American HF viruses (Fig. 3). In particular, compounds 16G8, 17C8, and 17C9 were potent against the South American HF viruses, indicating broad activity against the major human pathogenic arenaviruses. The most potent lead compounds 8C1, 16G8, and 17C8 were then tested against LASV, JUNV, and MACV in BSL4 facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results revealed activity profiles of the compounds similar to those observed with the corresponding retroviral pseudotypes (Fig. 4). Compound 8C1 exhibited greater activity against LASV than the South American HF viruses, and compound 17C8 showed the most potent activity against all viruses. Candidate Compounds Block pH-dependent Membrane Fusion Mediated by Arenavirus GPs—Arenavirus entry involves binding to cell surface receptors, endocytosis, and delivery to the endosome followed by pH-dependent membrane fusion. Our candidate compounds may interfere with any of these steps or a combination thereof. To distinguish between these possibilities, we addressed the impact of the candidate compounds on the virus-receptor interaction. The compounds had no effect on LASV binding to α-DG as assessed in a solid phase receptor binding assay (data not shown). Further, incubation of cells with >20-fold IC50 of the compounds did not significantly affect cell surface expression of the known cellular receptors for LASV and the South American HF viruses, α-DG and TfR1, respectively (data not shown), excluding down-regulation of the cellular receptor as a mechanism of inhibition. Next, we investigated drug effects on endocytotic pathways implicated in arenavirus entry, clathrin-mediated endocytosis proposed for JUNV (28Rojek J.M. Perez M. Kunz S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Martinez M.G. Cordo S.M. Candurra N.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and cholesterol-dependent endocytotic pathways implicated in LASV entry (28Rojek J.M. Perez M. Kunz S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using well established cell biological assays for clathrin-mediated and cholesterol-dependent lipid raft-mediated endocytosis utilizing transferrin and cholera toxin B as markers, we found no inhibitory effect of our compounds at 20-fold IC50 (supplemental Fig. S2). Together, our data suggest that perturbation of virus-receptor binding or subsequent endocytotic uptake by our candidate compounds is unlikely but that they rather target a step beyond attachment and internalization. Upon internalization by endocytosis, arenaviruses are delivered to endosomes, where the viruses enter the cytoplasm by pH-induced GP-mediated fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes (26Borrow P. Oldstone M.B. Virology. 1994; 198: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Castilla V. Mersich S.E. Candurra N.A. Damonte E.B. Arch. Virol. 1994; 136: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the compounds 8C1 and 17C8 on arenavirus GP-mediated membrane fusion, we used a cellular fusion reporter assay (22York J. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7775-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, permissive cells expressing arenavirus GPs and T7 RNA polymerase were co-cultured with cells expressing β-galactosidase under control of the T7 promoter for 5 h. Candidate drugs were added for 45 min, and the cells were washed and then exposed to a 30-min pulse of neutral or low pH (5.0) medium. Cell-cell fusion mediated by the arenavirus GP upon acidification resulted in expression of the β-galactosidase reporter measured by chemiluminescence. As shown in Fig. 5, compound 8C1 efficiently blocked LASV GP-mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner and displayed only weak inhibition of JUNV GP, consistent with its activity with the respective viruses (Fig. 4). In contrast, but similarly consistent with the results obtained with virus infection, 17C8 efficiently blocked cell-cell fusion mediated by both viral GPs. The potent activity of our candidate compounds in the cell-based GP fusion assay (IC50 = 200–350 nm) indicates that inhibition of pH-dependent membrane fusion is a major mechanism of their anti-viral activity. The Lead Compounds 16G8 and 17C8 Show Broad Activity against Arenaviruses but not Other RNA Viruses Containing Class I Fusion Proteins—Although the pathogenic Clade B New World arenaviruses JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and Sabia virus utilize TfR1 as a receptor (9Radoshitzky S.R. Abraham J. Spiropoulou C.F. Kuhn J.H. Nguyen D. Li W. Nagel J. Schmidt P.J. Nunberg J.H. Andrews N.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Nature. 2007; 446: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the nonpathogenic Clade B virus Tacaribe virus (TACV) and the recently emerged North American arenavirus Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV) infect cells independent of TfR1 and α-DG (31Flanagan M.L. Oldenburg J. Reignier T. Holt N. Hamilton G.A. Martin V.K. Cannon P.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Reignier T. Oldenburg J. Flanagan M.L. Hamilton G.A. Martin V.K. Cannon P.M. Virology. 2008; 371: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicating a complex pattern of receptor use within the New World arenaviruses. To test the activity of our lead compounds 16G8 and 17C8 against TACV and WWAV, we generated retroviral pseudotypes using the GPs derived from these viruses as recently described (31Flanagan M.L. Oldenburg J. Reignier T. Holt N. Hamilton G.A. Martin V.K. Cannon P.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Reignier T. Oldenburg J. Flanagan M.L. Hamilton G.A. Martin V.K. Cannon P.M. Virology. 2008; 371: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similar to our findings with pseudotypes of LASV, JUNV, MACV, and GTOV, the compounds 16G8 and 17C8 efficiently blocked infection of cells with WWAV and TACV pseudotypes (Fig. 6), indicating a remarkably broad activity within the arenavirus family independent of receptor use. Because recent molecular modeling and biochemical studies revealed similarities between arenavirus GP2 and class I viral fusion proteins of other enveloped viruses including retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses (11Eschli B. Quirin K. Wepf A. Weber J. Zinkernagel R. Hengartner H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we addressed the activity of our lead compounds 16G8 and 17C8 against recombinant Amphotropic murine retrovirus, retroviral pseudotypes bearing the GP of the filovirus Ebola virus Zaire, a recombinant paramyxovirus measles virus (Edmonston strain) containing a GFP reporter gene, and the orthomyxovirus influenza virus (strain WSN). In contrast to efficient blocking of entry of arenaviruses, our lead compounds had no significant effect on any of the other viruses tested (Fig. 6), indicating specific inhibition of arenavirus GP-mediated membrane fusion. In the present study, we used HTS of combinatorial small molecule libraries to identify inhibitors of arenavirus infection. Our screening efforts resulted in the discovery of a series of novel small inhibitors of viral entry that are remarkably effective against both Old World and New World hemorrhagic arenaviruses. Inhibition of virus infection is potent (IC50 = 500–800 nm), and our initial studies pinpoint blockage of pH-dependent fusion by the arenaviral GPs as a mechanism of antiviral activity (IC50 of 200–350 nm). Our most potent lead compounds show broad anti-viral activity within the arenavirus family and efficiently block entry of the major human pathogenic arenaviruses. In recent years, entry inhibitors have emerged as a new class of anti-viral drugs, with the human immunodeficiency virus fusion-blocking peptide enfuvirtide being the first available fusion inhibitor applied for clinical treatment of a viral infection in humans (33Este J.A. Telenti A. Lancet. 2007; 370: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Several nonpeptidic entry inhibitors against human immunodeficiency virus and paramyxoviruses are currently in development (33Este J.A. Telenti A.

Using a novel approach combining HTS of combinatorial chemical libraries with a pseudotype-based cellular assay of viral entry, we have discovered two classes of small molecule lead compounds that are potent inhibitors of infection with human pathogenic arenaviruses in cell culture. The most potent of these compounds, 16G8 and 17C8, emerged from a sublibrary that has attractive drug-like characteristics. Examination of the entire library that contains 16G8, 17C8, and 17C9 (Fig. 7) reveals a well defined structure-activity relationship profile within the screen as well as clustering of the observed hits. Such consistent trends are representative of a specific interaction between an inhibitor and its protein-based biological target, as demonstrated in earlier studies using combinatorial libraries as sources of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (12Berg T. Cohen S.B. Desharnais J. Sonderegger C. Maslyar D.J. Goldberg J. Boger D.L. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3830-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Goldberg J. Jin Q. Ambroise Y. Satoh S. Desharnais J. Capps K. Boger D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although one of our lead compounds, 8C1, has specificity for LASV entry, our most potent leads, 16G8 and 17C8, showed high activity against both LASV and the more distantly related South American hemorrhagic fever viruses JUNV, MACV, and GTOV, as well as TACV and the recently emerged North American arenavirus WWAV. Considering the genetic distance between the envelope GPs of Old World and New World arenaviruses and their differences in structure, receptor use, and mechanisms of cell entry, this broad inhibition within the arenavirus family is remarkable. Our initial studies on the mechanism of action utilizing a cell-cell fusion assay indicate that the candidate compounds act at the level of GP-mediated membrane fusion with IC50 = 200–350 nm (Fig. 5). Because compounds were washed out prior to the low pH pulse in our assay system, the efficient blocking of GP-mediated membrane fusion suggests that the compounds remain bound to the viral GP. The current structural model of the arenavirus GP is a trimeric complex with the transmembrane subunit GP2 containing N- and C-heptad repeat sequences that are predicted to fold into a six-helix bundle post-fusion conformation (11Eschli B. Quirin K. Wepf A. Weber J. Zinkernagel R. Hengartner H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The presence of these structures in GP2 has recently resulted in the classification of arenavirus GPs among the viral class I fusion proteins (11Eschli B. Quirin K. Wepf A. Weber J. Zinkernagel R. Hengartner H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Considering the overall similarity between the fusion cores of class I fusion proteins (37Weissenhorn W. Hinz A. Gaudin Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we tested the activity of our most potent and broadly active leads against a series of prototypic RNA viruses bearing class I fusion proteins. In contrast to the potent neutralization of all arenaviruses tested, our drugs were inactive against amphotropic murine retrovirus, the filovirus Ebola, the paramyxovirus measles virus, and the orthomyxovirus influenza. The broad activity against arenaviruses concomitant with the lack of inhibition of other viral class I fusion proteins suggests the presence of conserved molecular structures and/or interactions in the fusion active GP complex of arenaviruses absent from other related viral GPs. Indeed, recent studies revealed unique mechanistic features of arenavirus GP-mediated membrane fusion. In contrast to other viral GPs, the arenavirus GP precursor contains a stable signal peptide of unusual length that is retained as an essential component of the mature GP complex (38Eichler R.

Virology. 2007; 359: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The specificity of our compounds for arenavirus GP-mediated membrane fusion may allow the use of these molecules as molecular probes to dissect such unusual features of arenavirus fusion. For drug development, the chemical properties of our initial leads make them amenable to optimization of their potency, solubility, and bioavailability. Small molecule entry inhibitors have a number of properties that allow their application in endemic areas in the developing world. Their chemical stability minimizes logistic problems of transport and storage in the tropical and subtropical climates. The possibility of oral administration is further compatible with a limited public health infrastructure. Based on the broad activity of our lead compounds within the arenavirus family, they are likely active against different genetic variants of a given arenavirus species. This is of great importance because human pathogenic arenaviruses show remarkable genetic variability between isolates from different geographic regions (44Clegg J.C. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 262: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). The establishment of the viral GP as a promising drug target combined with the use of preselected libraries of chemically tractable compounds with potential drug-like properties in HTS allows for rapid and biosafe screening of a number of compounds with a high probability to isolate potent leads. Importantly, our screening approach does not require information about the structure of the viral GPs or cellular receptors involved and is applicable for the development of small molecule inhibitors to other enveloped viruses.

https://openalex.org/W1986771494,"The mammalian K2P2.1 potassium channel (TREK-1, KCNK2) is highly expressed in excitable tissues, where it plays a key role in the cellular mechanisms of neuroprotection, anesthesia, pain perception, and depression. Here, we report that external acidification, within the physiological range, strongly inhibits the human K2P2.1 channel by inducing “C-type” closure. We have identified two histidine residues (i.e. His-87 and His-141), located in the first external loop of the channel, that govern the response of the channel to external pH. We demonstrate that these residues are within physical proximity to glutamate 84, homologous to Shaker Glu-418, KcsA Glu-51, and KCNK0 Glu-28 residues, all previously argued to stabilize the outer pore gate in the open conformation by forming hydrogen bonds with pore-adjacent residues. We thus propose a novel mechanism for pH sensing in which protonation of His-141 and His-87 generates a local positive charge that serves to draw Glu-84 away from its natural interactions, facilitating the collapse of the selectivity filter region. In accordance with this proposed mechanism, low pH modified K2P2.1 selectivity toward potassium. Moreover, the proton-mediated effect was inhibited by external potassium ions and was enhanced by a mutation (S164Y) known to accelerate C-type gating. Furthermore, proton-induced current inhibition was more pronounced at negative potentials.

Potassium leak channels comprise the newest branch of the potassium channel superfamily serving to carry leak or “background” currents that are mostly time- and voltage-independent. They are structurally unique in that each subunit possesses four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains and hence are often referred to as two-pore domain K+ channels or K2P channels. By influencing the cell membrane resting potential, leak currents shape the duration, frequency, and amplitude of action potentials and, therefore, modulate cell responsiveness and excitability (1Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The best studied member of the K2P family is the mammalian mechanosensitive K2P2.1 (KCNK2, TREK-1) channel, expressed at high levels in excitable tissues such as the nervous system (2Fink M.

K2P2.1 channels have attracted increasing interest in recent years as their activity and biophysical properties are strongly regulated by various physical and chemical signals (5Honore E. Nat. Rev.

Epilepsy Res. 2005; 64: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that K2P2.1 is an important target for volatile anesthetics and participates in protection against epilepsy and neuroprotection during brain and spinal chord ischemia (14Heurteaux C. Guy N. Laigle C. Blondeau N. Duprat F. Mazzuca M. Lang-Lazdunski L. Widmann C. Zanzouri M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that K2P2.1 channels expressed in small dorsal root ganglion neurons (6Maingret F. Lauritzen I. Patel A.J. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2483-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) can act as one of the molecular sensors involved in pain perception (15Alloui A. Zimmermann K. Mamet J. Duprat F. Noel J. Chemin J. Guy N. Blondeau N. Voilley N. Rubat-Coudert C. Borsotto M. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Reeh P. Eschalier A. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2368-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although the regulation and contribution of the carboxyl-terminal domain to the modulation of K2P2.1 activity have been studied in detail, the conformational changes and gating events that take place at the ion-conducting pore during channel regulation remained unknown. It had been previously shown that gating of another member of the K2P family, i.e. the Drosophila KCNK0, entails protein rearrangement of the externally oriented portion of the pore and shares many characteristics with the slow inactivation (C-type inactivation) of voltage-gated potassium channels (16Zilberberg N. Ilan N. Goldstein S.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Now, we provide evidence that K2P2.1 channels rely on this mechanism for gating as well. We report that external acidification, within the physiological range, strongly inhibits the human K2P2.1 channel. Mutations in two outer pore surface-exposed histidine residues (i.e. His-87 and His-141), located in the first turret loop of the channel, dramatically decreased channel responsiveness to external acidification. Our results also indicate that external protons inhibit the channel by inducing closure of the outer pore gate, similar to the C-type inactivation of voltage-gated potassium channels. Moreover, we propose a mechanistic model for proton-induced pore destabilization of potassium leak channels. Finally, as the magnitude of the pH effect was voltage-dependent, we present a novel mechanism for K2P2.1 outward rectification. Molecular Biology—The human K2P2.1 channel (NM_ 001017425) was cloned into the pRAT plasmid as described previously (17Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The murine K2P2.1 channel, cloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid, was generously provided by Prof. K. Sanders from the University of Nevada. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis technique (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cRNA was transcribed in vitro using T7 polymerase and the AmpliCap High Yield Message Maker (EPI-CENTRE Biotechnologies) kit. Electrophysiology—Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and injected with 23 nl containing 0.2–8 ng of cRNA. Whole-cell currents were measured 1–3 days after injection by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 0.5 kHz with Clampex 9.0 software (Axon Instruments). For two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, the pipette contained 3 m KCl and the bath solution contained, unless otherwise noted (in mm): 4 KCl, 96 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH (standard solution). HEPES buffer was replaced by Tris in alkali solutions (pH 8.5, 9.0) and MES 2The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pHO, external pH; WT, wild type. in acidic solutions (pH 5.5–6.5). When required, bath solution sodium ions were isotonically replaced by potassium ions. To avoid possible effects of pH on channel regulation (18Cohen A. Zilberberg N. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 153: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the following protocol was applied: The currents were first stabilized at pH 9.0 at -80 mV and then pulsed from -140 to +40 mV in 20-mV voltage steps for 60 ms with 1-s interpulse intervals. Next, the external solution pH was altered to the desired value for a period of 15 s, the same measurement protocol was applied, and the pH was returned to pH 9.0. This procedure was repeated for each pH value. The pH dependence was calculated from steady state currents measured at +40 mV at a specific pH value and compared with the measured current observed at pH 9.0 from the same episode. Data from patch clamp studies were sampled with an Axon 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Bath and pipette solutions contained 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, or 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, or 5 mm MES, pH 6.5. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Data were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz with Clampex 9.0 software. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Calculations—Dose-response curves were fitted to the Hill equation, according to the following parameters: I = Imin + (Imax - Imin)/ (1+[H+]/K1/2)nH)). The fitting was separately performed for each experiment using the Origin 6.1 software (Northampton, MA). Values are presented as mean ± S.E. The voltage dependence of the proton-mediated blockage was modeled by simplification of the approach of Woodhull (19Woodhull A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 687-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), as described previously (20Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16969-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Human K2P2.1 Channels Sense External pH—Recent work has suggested the existence of unspecified, pH-sensitive, leak-like K+-selective conductance in different neuronal tissues, such as dorsal root ganglion neurons and the retrotrapezoid nucleus (21Mulkey D.K. Talley E.M. Stornetta R.L. Siegel A.R. West G.H. Chen X. Sen N. Mistry A.M. Guyenet P.G. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14049-14058Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22La J.H. Kang D. Park J.Y. Hong S.G. Han J. Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 406: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We thus examined the sensitivity of K2P2.1 leak channels to external pH (pHO), given the wide distribution of this channel in the central nervous system. We found human K2P2.1 channels to be highly sensitive to pHO (at values within the physiological range) when expressed and studied in X. laevis oocytes. Under physiological potassium concentrations (4 mm), lowering the external pH from 9.0 to 5.5 decreased current levels by >70% (Fig. 1). For steady state currents recorded at +40 mV, inhibition by acidic pH values was characterized by an apparent pK of 7.47 ± 0.2 (Fig. 1C). A calculated Hill coefficient of 0.51 ± 0.07 implies the existence of multiple proton-binding sites in the K2P2.1 channels, acting with negative cooperative interactions. Single channel analysis shows that at low pHO values, channel open probability, but not single channel conductance, is decreased (Fig. 1D), suggesting an effect on channel gating. Identifying the pH Sensor of K2P2.1 Channel—To date, three mechanisms have been proposed as being responsible for the pHO sensitivity of K2P channels. In members of the K2P3.1 (TASK1) group, current decreases are due to protonation of a histidine residue, located next to the first pore domain selectivity filter signature (i.e. GYGH) (23Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 24Lopes C.M. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24449-24452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In K2P5.1 (TASK2) channels, several extracellular charged residues have been implicated as carrying the channel response to alkalization (25Morton M.J. Abohamed A. Sivaprasadarao A. Hunter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16102-16106Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was later disputed and an alternative mechanism in which a single arginine residue, located near the second pore domain (Arg-224), was proposed as being responsible for the pH-dependent activity of K2P5.1 as well as TALK (K2P16.1 and K2P17.1) channels (26Niemeyer M. González-Nilo F. Zúñiga L. González W. Cid L. Sepúlveda F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). None of these explanations seemingly applies to K2P2.1. K2P2.1 channels neither possess a histidine residue at the selectivity filter, like K2P3.1, nor do they sense pHO by Lys-286 (homologous to Arg-224 in K2P5.1), as mutating Lys-286 to alanine failed to abolish K2P2.1 inhibition by protons (data not shown). In seeking the pH sensor of human K2P2.1, we studied the mouse variant of the channel, not considered to be highly pHO-sensitive (27Patel A.J. Honore E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In our hands, the murine K2P2.1 channel indeed showed low sensitivity to external pH, with only 35% inhibition noted at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2B). A comparison of the two sequences revealed the presence of a histidine residue (His-87) in the human sequence not found in its murine counterpart (Fig. 2A). Indeed, mutating the human His-87 to glutamine, as found at position 87 of the murine K2P2.1 sequence, resulted in a pH sensitivity profile almost identical to that of the murine variant (Fig. 2B). In light of this finding, we evaluated the roles of the three other human K2P2.1 histidine residues predicted to reside in extracellular loops of the channel by individually mutating them to alanine (i.e. Fig. 2A, H106A, H141A, and H247A). The H106A and H247A mutants did not significantly affect the pHO sensitivity of human K2P2.1 (Fig. 2B). By contrast, His-141 was found to participate in the channel response to pHO, as mutating this residue dramatically decreased channel responsiveness to external acidification, shifting the sensitivity curve away from the physiological range (Fig. 2B). The H87Q,H141A double mutant, however, showed a pH sensitivity similar to the single H141A mutant, suggesting that both residues act through a shared mechanism. Voltage-dependent Proton-mediated Inhibition Increases Outward Rectification—We found that the proton-mediated inhibition is voltage-dependent, being more pronounced at negative potentials, with V½ of -79 mV ± 1.7 (Fig. 3, A and B). This differential inhibition causes the K2P2.1 currents to be significantly more outwardly rectifying at acidic than at basic pH values (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, in the absence of proton-mediated inhibition (H141A mutant) or Mg2+ blockade, the channel behaves as an open rectifier channel (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest a new mechanism contributing to the exceptional capability of K2P2.1 to function in a voltage-gated mode. We believe that the voltage dependence of the channel reflects, in part, release from voltage-dependent proton-mediated inhibition. External Acidification Facilitates C-type Closure of K2P2.1—What is the mechanism by which external protons inhibit K2P2.1 currents? Neither His-87 nor His-141 is predicted, according to the known K+ channel structures (28Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5762) Google Scholar), to lie along the ion conduction pathway. This, therefore, rules out the possibility that protons act through pore blockade. Hence, to elucidate the manner by which these residues sense pHO levels, we studied the effect of pH inhibition on K2P2.1 gating. In a homologous channel, i.e. the Drosophila KCNK0 channel, closing of the channel involves conformational changes in the external pore (16Zilberberg N. Ilan N. Goldstein S.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) through a mechanism resembling the C-type inactivation of voltage-gated potassium channels (29Ogielska E.M. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1997; 19: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 31Lopez-Barneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar). Might K2P2.1 pH sensors, i.e. His-87 and His-141, located at the first turret loop, induce closure of the external gate by a mechanism similar to C-type inactivation? C-type inactivation is known to be slowed by permeable external ions (29Ogielska E.M. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As such, high external potassium concentrations might reduce the extent of K2P2.1 inhibition observed at acidic pH values. Indeed, elevating external potassium concentrations from 4 to either 20 or 100 mm dramatically interfered with pH inhibition of channel activity (Fig. 4A). Although lowering the pH from 9.0 to 7.0 produced a 42% inhibition in K2P2.1 currents attained in the presence of 4 mm external potassium, only 18% inhibition was measured in 20 mm potassium solution and a mere 11% inhibition was observed in the presence of 100 mm external potassium (Fig. 4A, right panel). In light of these results, we measured the ionic selectivity of K2P2.1 at different pHO values as conformational modification of the pore area alters the selectivity filter arrangement, thereby increasing sodium permeability (32Yuill K.H. Stansfeld P.J. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 455: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Starkus J.G. Kuschel L. Rayner M.D. Heinemann S.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Starkus J.G. Kuschel L. Rayner M.D. Heinemann S.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lowering the pH of a 100-mm sodium solution from 9.0 to 7.0 caused a significant right shift of 20 mV (-134.4 ± 0.6 to -114.3 ± 0.9, mean ± S.E., n = 17) in the measured reversal potential of oocytes expressing wild type (WT) K2P2.1 channels (Fig. 4B, left panel). To exclude any nonspecific influences of low pH in these studies, the same experiment was repeated using the pH-insensitive mutant K2P2.1-H141A. In cells expressing the mutant, pH changes failed to alter the reversal potential (Fig. 4B, right panel). Accordingly, the K+/Na+ permeability ratio in WT channels was considerably decreased (close to a 3-fold change) as the external pH was reduced (Fig. 4C). By contrast, the H141A mutant presented only a mild decrease (<20%) in the K+/Na+ permeability ratio, with the change only being noted at pH 6.5, when a slight inhibition by protons was noted as well (Fig. 4C). The changes in the K+/Na+ permeability ratio most likely result from an increase in Na+ permeability rather than a decrease in K+ permeability, as the single channel current amplitude, measured in symmetrical K+ concentrations (140 mm K+ and no Na+ in the pipette solution), was not affected by external pH changes (Fig. 1D). Rb+ and Cs+ selectivities were not changed in either the WT or H141A channels under acidic conditions (data not shown). We next considered the effects on K2P2.1 pH sensitivity of two mutations, homologous to those shown previously to accelerate C-type gating in other potassium channels. In Shaker channels, mutation of an external threonine residue (i.e. Thr-449) located next to the selectivity filter alters C-type gating kinetics (31Lopez-Barneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar). Mutating the homologous position in the KCNK0 first pore domain (i.e. S112Y) enhanced C-type gating (16Zilberberg N. Ilan N. Goldstein S.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A similar enhancement resulted from mutation of an extracellular glutamate, present in most potassium channels in the amino-terminal of the pore turret (i.e. Glu-28 in KCNK channels and Glu-418 in Shaker channels) (35Ortega-Saenz P. Pardal R. Castellano A. Lopez-Barneo J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Larsson H.P. Elinder F. Neuron. 2000; 27: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ser-164, the K2P2.1 homolog of Shaker Thr-449 and KCNK0 Ser-112, was mutated to tyrosine (S164Y) and Glu-84, homologous to Shaker Glu-418 and KCNK0 Glu-28, was mutated to alanine (E84A). The K2P2.1-S164Y mutant demonstrated increased pH sensitivity, with a pK of 8.1 and >90% inhibition at low pH values (Fig. 4D). Surprisingly, the K2P2.1 E84A mutation, expected to affect C-type gating in the same manner, presented currents that were significantly less sensitive to external pH, with a maximal inhibition of only 40% (Fig. 4D). The Molecular Mechanism of pH Sensing—The insensitivity of the E84A mutant to changes in pHO implies that Glu-84 takes part in the pH-sensing mechanism itself. It was previously suggested that Shaker Glu-418, which lies adjacent to the pore, stabilizes the open conformation of the slow inactivation gate by forming hydrogen bonds with residues in the P-S6 loop (36Larsson H.P. Elinder F. Neuron. 2000; 27: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Breaking this bond during conformational changes enables the rotation of the P-S6 loop and the subsequent collapse of the slow inactivation gate. Accordingly, we hypothesized that protonation of the external histidines, His-87 and His-141, would add positive charges that could interact with the negative charge of Glu-84 to draw this residue away from its natural interactions, thus causing a collapse of the selectivity filter region. In Fig. 5A, we present one subunit of the bacterial KcsA potassium channel, based on its published structure (28Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5762) Google Scholar). The predicted interactions of K2P2.1 at the homologous sites in KcsA are indicated as follows: at the primary sequence level, KcsA residues Glu-51, Val-84, and Thr-85 align with K2P2.1 residues Glu-84, Arg-166, and Thr-167, respectively. The side chain of KcsA Glu-51 is predicted to form hydrogen bonds (orange lines) with the backbone amides of Arg-166 and Thr-167 and the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-167. KcsA Leu-59 and Ala-54 are replaced in this presentation by histidine residues, as present at the homologous positions in K2P2.1 (i.e. His-141 and His-87, respectively). Potential hydrogen bonds between the Glu-84 hydroxyl groups and the histidine amide groups are drawn as orange lines. For the proposed mechanism of K2P2.1 pHO sensitivity to be valid, the three residues, namely Glu-84, His-87, and His-141, must be close enough to one another to interact. To test whether this is indeed the case, we first produced paired cysteine mutants, i.e. E84C and H87C, and E84C and H141C. Formation of either of the disulfide bonds (i.e. Cys-84-Cys-87 or Cys-84-Cys-141) would be expected to modify K2P2.1 currents whereas reduction would be expected to reverse this effect. Although channels containing a single cysteine mutation (i.e. E84C, H87C, or H141C) were active, channels including double mutations failed to produce any measurable currents (data not shown). Adding the reducing agent dithiothreitol (10 mm) to the bath solution did not affect this situation (data not shown), possibly because the introduced disulfide bonds locking the channel into the closed state were not accessible to the reducing agent. However, we cannot exclude other possibilities at this point, such as improper assembly or massive conformational changes of the channel caused by introducing two mutations in this vital domain of the channel. Seeking an alternative manner to demonstrate the physical proximities of Glu-84 and His-141/His-87, we exploited the ability of three or more histidine and cysteine residues to coordinate the binding of Cd2+ ions. If Glu-84 is indeed sufficiently adjacent to both His-141 and His-87, replacing this glutamate with a cysteine residue (E84C) should create a new Cd2+-binding site. As proposed, K2P2.1-E84C was >10-fold more sensitive to Cd2+ ions than was the WT channel (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, damaging the newly created Cd2+-binding site by mutating either of the histidine residues in the K2P2.1-E84C mutant background (i.e. E84C,H141A; E84C,H87Q; or E84C,H87Q,H141A) reduced Cd2+ binding back to WT levels (Fig. 5B). In the present report, we have shown that extracellular protons within the physiological range strongly inhibit the human K2P2.1 channel by affecting the channel open probability (Fig. 1). Transient pH variations occur in all three compartments of nervous tissue, i.e. in neurons, glial cells, and extracellular spaces, in response to neuronal stimulation to neurotransmitters and hormones as well as in a secondary manner to metabolic activity and ion transport (37Deitmer J.W. Rose C.R. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1996; 48: 73-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Shifts in blood flow, synchronous activation of nerve cells, seizure, or spreading depression have been associated with interstitial alkaline shift or acidosis that could persist for minutes in different segments of the central nervous system (reviewed in Ref. 38Chesler M. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1183-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Such changes are known to dramatically modulate ion channel activity and hence affect neuronal tissue excitability. As decreased tissue pH is a common feature of the ischemic brain that can lead to neuronal injury, Xiong et al. (39Xiong Z.G. Chu X.P. Simon R.P. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 1376-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) had recently suggested acid-sensing ion channels as novel therapeutic targets for ischemic brain injury. Being modulated by intra- and extracellular acidification, the K2P2.1 channel is an important sensor for pH changes in the central nervous system. We have identified two histidine residues located in the first turret loop (i.e. His-87 and His-141), predicted to lie in the outer vestibule of the conduction pathway, as being responsible for the K2P2.1 response to external pH changes (Fig. 2). The location of the two histidine residues implies a new pH-sensing mechanism, different from those previously suggested for K2P channels (23Kim Y. Bang H. Kim D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9340-9347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 24Lopes C.M. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

In this context, the His-87 residue is especially interesting, as it is present in the human K2P2.1 variant (as well as in all other known non-rodent, yet unstudied, mammalian homologs) but is replaced by glutamine in the mouse K2P2.1 channel, which is only mildly affected by pHO (Fig. 2). It is possible that the two variants thus serve distinct physiological roles as their general expression patterns, as well as their central nervous system distribution, diverge (2Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 40Meadows H.J. Benham C.D. Cairns W. Gloger I. Jennings C. Medhurst A.D. Murdock P. Chapman C.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 714-722eCrossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). His-87 is also absent from the human K2P10.1 (TREK-2) channel, closely related to K2P2.1 (78% homology) and presenting significant similarity to K2P2.1 in terms of biophysical properties, as well as with respect to channel regulation traits (41Kang D. Choe C. Kim D. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 42Lesage F. Terrenoire C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28398-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). By placing a phenylalanine residue instead of histidine at position 102 (homologues to K2P2.1 His-87), the K2P10.1 channel was found to modestly react to extracellular pH changes (42Lesage F. Terrenoire C. Romey G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28398-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Hence, the addition of a single histidine residue in the turret loop may offer an efficient means to expand the physiological diversity of K2P channels. This may represent a more general phenomenon to govern functional variance of potassium channels. For example, the pH sensitivity of the rKV1.5 channel is mediated by a histidine residue in the turret loop (His-452), absent in the closely related, pH-insensitive, KV1.2 channel (43Steidl J.V. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the outward rectification of K2P2.1 is more pronounced at low external pH values and almost completely lost in the pH-insensitive mutant H141A at physiological pH values (Fig. 3). Because neither of the two studied histidine residues is predicted to lie within the membrane electrical field (Fig. 5A), we presuppose a non-direct effect of the membrane potential. Thus, the identity of the actual membrane-embedded voltage sensor has yet to be revealed. Two mechanisms were previously suggested to explain the limitation of K2P2.1 currents at negative potentials, namely voltage-dependent external Mg2+ blockade or an intrinsic voltage-sensing mechanism, argued to depend on an essential carboxyl-terminal protein kinase A phosphorylation site in human K2P2.1, Ser-348 (V½ = 10 ± 7 mV) (17Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), or on the carboxyl-terminal domain of the mouse K2P2.1 variant (44Maingret F. Honore E. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that agonist-induced phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis shifts the voltage sensitivity of K2P2.1 channels toward depolarized potentials (45Lopes C.M. Rohacs T. Czirjak G. Balla T. Enyedi P. Logothetis D.E. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here, we present a novel mechanism for outward rectification of K2P2.1, depending on extracellular pH sensors, presenting a V½ of -79 mV, likely to play a significant physiological role in humans. Voltage dependence of K2P2.1 activity could have profound physiological significance by modulating membrane resting potential, action potential duration, firing rate, and other biophysical properties of human excitable systems. We further propose that protonation of the pH sensors promotes the collapse of the external pore gate, similar to the C-type inactivation of voltage-gated potassium channels (Fig. 4). Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. High levels of external potassium, known to slow C-type inactivation, decrease the effect of protons (Fig. 4A). The observation that pHO alters K2P2.1 potassium selectivity suggests that proton-induced conformational modifications occur at the selectivity filter (Fig. 4, B and C). Finally, mutating serine 164 to tyrosine, a mutation that accelerated outer pore gating in Shaker (31Lopez-Barneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar) and KCNK0 (16Zilberberg N. Ilan N. Goldstein S.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) channels, dramatically increased the pHO effect observed here (Fig. 4D). Indeed, our observation represents the first reported indications for outer pore gating in K2P2.1 channels. These results are consistent with previous findings indicating that gating of the KCNK0 leak channel involved a mechanism resembling C-type inactivation (16Zilberberg N. Ilan N. Goldstein S.A. Neuron. 2001; 32: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that external acidification accelerates C-type gating in K2P3.1, Shaker, Kv1.4, and KV1.5 potassium channels (11Claydon T.W. Makary S.Y. Dibb K.M. Boyett M.R. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2407-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Yuill K.H. Stansfeld P.J. Ashmole I. Sutcliffe M.J.

How can protonation of His-87 and His-141 induce destabilization of the K2P2.1 external gate? We attained our first insight into this putative mechanism by analyzing the effect of an E84A mutation on pHO sensitivity. Neutralization of this residue was expected to accelerate C-type gating (as with mutation of KCNK0 Glu-28 and Shaker Glu-418) and hence elicit increased pHO sensitivity, similarly to the K2P2.1-S164Y mutant. Surprisingly, E84A currents were significantly less sensitive to external pH, implying a more direct role for Glu-84 in pH sensing. Is Glu-84 sufficiently close to the pH-sensing histidines to sense their charge variations? The introduction of a cysteine residue at this site created a Cd2+-binding site in the K2P2.1 channel. We speculate that this Cd2+-binding site is formed by the original histidines together with the introduced cysteine, as it was abolished when either histidine residue was eliminated (Fig. 5B). Accordingly, the double cysteine-substituted mutants (i.e. Cys-84-Cys-87 and Cys-84-Cys-141) were inactive, probably due to the formation of dithiothreitol-inaccessible disulfide bonds. These results thus indicate that position Glu-84 is sufficiently proximal to the pH-sensing histidines (positions 87 and 141), in accordance with the predicted positions of homologous residues in the KcsA structure (28Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5762) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that adding positive charges to the external histidines draws the negatively charged Glu-84 residue away from its stabilizing interactions (with Arg-166 and Thr-167), thus causing the outer pore gate to collapse (Fig. 5A). Taken together, our results highlight the physiological importance of human K2P2.1 channels as important sensors of pH changes in the central nervous system, with external pH changes modifying both their currents and membrane potential dependence. Moreover, we offer new insight into the molecular mechanism and structural rearrangements that occur during the K2P2.1 response to pHO, involving an external pH sensor, identified here for the first time.

However, JNKs also regulate physiological and homeostatic processes. An attractive hypothesis from the drug development perspective is that distinct JNK isoforms mediate “physiological” and “pathological” responses. However, this lacks experimental evaluation. Here we investigate the isoforms, subcellular pools, and c-Jun/ATF2 targets of JNK in death of central nervous system neurons following withdrawal of trophic support. We use gene knockouts, gene silencing, subcellularly targeted dominant negative constructs, and pharmacological inhibitors. Combined small interfering RNA knockdown of all JNKs 1, 2, and 3, provides substantial neuroprotection. In contrast, knockdown or knock-out of individual JNKs or two JNKs together does not protect. This explains why the evidence for JNK in neuronal death has to date been largely pharmacological. Complete knockdown of c-Jun and ATF2 using small interfering RNA also fails to protect, casting doubt on c-Jun as a critical effector of JNK in neuronal death. Nonetheless, the death requires nuclear but not cytosolic JNK activity as nuclear dominant negative inhibitors of JNK protect, whereas cytosolic inhibitors only block physiological JNK function. Thus any one of the three JNKs is capable of mediating apoptosis and inhibition of nuclear JNK is protective.

A major constraint in determining JNK isoform roles in cell death has been the absence of JNK1/2/3 triple knock-out mice and consequent lack of studies with neurons depleted of JNKs 1, 2, and 3. As a result, analysis of JNK isoform involvement in neuronal death and, in most cases, even addressing whether JNK is involved at all has depended on the use of the less specific pharmacological and dominant negative approaches. These fail to unequivocally show the contributions of JNK or individual isoforms, leaving this issue unresolved. Similarly, conclusions regarding JNK substrate involvement in central nervous system neuron death responses have largely relied on correlation (19Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). c-Jun is a major target of the JNK pathway; it contributes to the response to cellular stress and is believed to mediate apoptotic neuronal cell death (20Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Knock-in mice expressing c-Jun with mutations to alanine at the JNK phosphorylation sites Ser-63/73 (c-Jun-AA) exhibited the same deficiencies in the excitotoxic stress response as JNK3 knock-out mice (3Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 20Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat.

This suggested that c-Jun and JNK3 were on the same phenotypic pathway and led to the widely held dogma that JNK3 → c-Jun signaling mediates neuronal death (reviewed in Refs. 7Manning A.M. Davis R.J.

In this report, a combination of methods, knock-out mice, small-molecule inhibitors, siRNAs, and compartment-targeted dominant negative inhibitors establish that JNK is required for death of cerebellar granule neurons from which trophic support was withdrawn and is used to investigate the involvement of JNK isoforms and JNK substrates. We observed that nuclear activity of JNK was required for the death, but the JNK substrates c-Jun and ATF2 were not required for the death in this system. JNK2 and JNK3 were together shown to be the main regulators of c-Jun following withdrawal of trophic support (WTS). Unexpectedly, however, they were not required for neuronal death. Only simultaneous knockdown of JNKs 1, 2, and 3 was sufficient to confer neuroprotection. This indicates that the presence of any one of the JNKs is sufficient to produce a dominant apoptotic signal.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). siRNA oligonucleotides set II for JNKs were as follows: JNK1 pool (5′-GGAAAGAACUGAUAUACAA-3′ and 5′-GAAGCAAACGUGACAACAA-3′), JNK2 pool (5′-CCGTGAACTCGTCCTCTTAAA-3′, and 5′-GTGATGGACTGGGAAGAAA-3′), and JNK3 pool (5′-GGAAAGAACUUAUCUACAA-3′ and 5′-CCAGUAACAUUGUAGUCAA-3′). Kinase inhibitors SB203580 and SP600125 were from Calbiochem and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. GFP-NLS-SEK1kd and GFP-NES-SEK1kd were prepared, as were GFP-NLS-JBD and GFP-NES-JBD, as described previously (6Björkblom B. Östman N. Hongisto V. Komarovski V. Filen J.J. Nyman T.A. Kallunki T. Courtney M.J. Coffey E.T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6350-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). δMEKK1-(1174-1493) was previously described (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described previously (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from postnatal day seven JNK2-/-, JNK3-/-, and JNK2-/-JNK3-/- mice where indicated. Genotyping was as described previously (1Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Otherwise, neurons were prepared from FVB/N mice for JNK siRNA experiments or from Sprague-Dawley rats for ATF2/c-Jun siRNA experiments. Briefly, cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 33 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm supplementary KCl (final 25.4 mm KCl). Cells were plated at 250,000/cm2 onto culture surfaces coated with poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml). Culture medium was replaced after 24 h with the inclusion of 10 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside (Sigma) to reduce non-neuronal proliferation. Cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transfections and Survival Analysis of Neurons—Cerebellar granule neurons were plated on glass coverslips (Knittel, Braunschweig, Germany) for survival assays and immunofluorescence staining, which were carried out as described previously with minor modifications (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected at 5 days in vitro (DIV) with 1.0 μg of marker plasmid (pEGFP-F) together with 1.0 μg of pCMV empty vector as described previously (22Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides targeting c-Jun (200 nm), ATF2 (200 nm), JNK1/2 (100 nm), or JNK3 (100 nm) or equal amount of non targeting control siRNA were included in the DNA mixture as indicated. 48 h (c-Jun and ATF2) or 90 h (JNK1/2 and JNK3) later, culture medium was replaced with medium containing low KCl (5 mm) without serum (WTS) for 10-48 h as indicated, prior to cell fixation. Cells were fixed and DNA-stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml) to detect pyknosis. The viability of GFP-F-expressing neurons was analyzed using a Leica DMRE microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera. Cerebellar granule neurons from JNK2-/-, JNK3-/-, and JNK2-/-JNK3-/- mice were prepared as above, and trophic support was withdrawn at 7 DIV in the presence or absence of inhibitors as indicated. A 30-min pretreatment with inhibitors was carried out prior to withdrawal of trophic support. After 24 h in low KCl and without serum, cells were fixed and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Analysis of neuronal survival was carried out blind. For analysis of compartmental JNK inhibitors, neurons were transfected at 6 DIV, and 24 h later, they were transferred to low KCl medium without serum and survival was measured as above. Immunostaining—Immunocytochemical staining was carried out as described previously (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature or with MeOH for 5 min at -20 °C (JNK1/2 staining) followed by permeabilization in phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100 (1%) for 2 min. Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were blocked with 10% serum, 0.2% Tween-20, phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibodies was overnight at 4 °C using anti-c-Jun (2.5 μg/ml), anti-JNK1 (5 μg/ml), anti-JNK1/2 (5μg/ml), anti-JNK2/3 (3.3μg/ml), and anti-ATF2 (1:100) and anti-JNK3 (1:300), respectively. Immunoreactivity was detected using anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 (1:500) or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500). Immunoblot Analysis and Quantification—Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred by semidry transfer to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (22Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of variance was done using SPSS for Windows version 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Test of homogeneous sample variances was performed using Levene's test prior to one-way analysis-of-variance. Fisher least significant difference post hoc test was used in cases with more than two variable groups. Significance levels are indicated as follows, *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001. A number of studies suggest that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun contributes to neuronal cell death (reviewed in Ref. 25Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), particularly in response to WTS. The majority of the evidence comes from observations that dominant negative c-Jun constructs prevent neuronal cell death upon removal of trophic support (23Eilers A. Whitfield J. Babij C. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J.

We have reported that withdrawal of trophic support from rat cerebellar granule neurons leads to selective activation of JNK2/3 isoforms in the presence of constitutive JNK1 activity (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using 10 μm SB203580, which inhibits (at least) JNK2/3 isoforms in these cells, we found that the JNK2/3 pool contributes to c-Jun phosphorylation in neurons upon WTS (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this conflicts with the expectation that JNK3 has a specific role in neuronal c-Jun stress responses alone, largely supported by the finding that both JNK3-/- and c-Jun-AA knock-in mice possess similar resistance to kainate-induced seizure activity and the subsequent death of hippocampal neurons (3Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 15Brecht S. Kirchhof R. Chromik A. Willesen M.

We therefore investigated which JNKs contributed to the trophic withdrawal responses using cultured cerebellar granule neurons from single and compound knock-out mice. The c-Jun Stress Response Is Strongly Suppressed in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- Neurons—Neurons were prepared from wild-type, JNK2-/-, JNK3-/-, and JNK2-/-JNK3-/- mice and treated according to the WTS paradigm. We also included in these experiments the use of small molecule JNK inhibitors that had previously been shown to influence these responses. As reported previously, phosphorylation of the JNK substrate c-Jun increased in response to WTS, and this response was blocked by 10 μm SB203580 (which inhibits JNK2/3 isoforms (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 μm SP600125 (sufficient to inhibit JNK in neurons (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cao J. Semenova M.M. Solovyan V.T. Han J. Coffey E.T. Courtney M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35903-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1A). Importantly, 1 μm SB203580, which is sufficient to inhibit p38α/β but not JNKs (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cao J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35903-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), did not influence c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). When the experiments were repeated with cells from JNK2-/-, JNK3-/-, or JNK2-/-JNK3-/- mice, the size of the response was somewhat diminished in JNK3-/- cultures but most strongly reduced in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- cultures, indicating that JNK2 in addition to JNK3 contributes to c-Jun phosphorylation following WTS. The total level of phospho-Ser-63 c-Jun is a somewhat complex parameter representing the specific phosphorylation of this site multiplied by the total level of c-Jun (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we immunoblotted the lysates with c-Jun antibody in parallel (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the total amount of c-Jun, as well as relative phosphorylation status, visualized by the retarded mobility, is the result of phosphorylation at serines 63 and 73 and threonines 91 and 93 (30Ui M. Sonobe M.H. Ito T. Murakami M. Okazaki S. Takada M. Sato T. Iba H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To more directly compare the c-Jun mobility profiles, we plotted the film density profile against migration distance in the gel, normalizing to the peak intensity for each trace. This analysis clearly showed that following WTS, c-Jun migrates as three distinct peaks. In cells from JNK2-/-JNK3-/- mice, there was a marked reduction in retarded mobility bands when compared with JNK3-/- neurons (Fig. 1C). The c-Jun induction in the JNK2-/-JNK3-/- cultures, reduced when compared with wild type, was blocked by the pan-inhibitor of JNK, SP600125 (Fig. 1G). This indicates that the residual JNK1 is sufficient to elicit some c-Jun stress response. In summary, we have shown using knock-out cells that JNKs 2 and 3 are both required to elicit c-Jun phosphorylation in neurons, consistent with earlier results using inhibitors (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JNK1 Expression Is Up-regulated in the Absence of JNKs 2 and 3—We investigated the levels of JNK and P-JNK under the conditions shown in Fig. 1. Withdrawal of trophic support with or without inhibitors caused no substantial change in total JNK levels, detected with a pan JNK antibody (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, there was no clear change in phospho-JNK level that could not be attributed to variations in total JNK (Fig. 2A). As we noted, up-regulation of c-Jun expression in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- cells (Fig. 1, B and G), we examined whether this gene deletion may have led to an increase in JNK1. Immunoblotting with an antibody that was specific for JNK1 (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a significant increase in JNK1 p46 and p54 isoform expression in JNK2-/- JNK3-/- cells when compared with wild type (Fig. 2, B and C). Neurons from Mice Lacking JNKs 2 and 3 Are Not Protected from WTS—An underlying assumption in the neuronal cell death field has been that c-Jun regulation by JNK can lead to cell death (reviewed in Ref. 25Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This led to the subsequent expectation that inhibition of JNK-regulated c-Jun would be neuroprotective. Withdrawal of trophic support in the JNK2-/-JNK3-/- background led to a marked inhibition of c-Jun mobility relative to the wild-type background (Fig. 1). We therefore investigated the extent to which this regulation of c-Jun correlated with pyknosis induced by WTS. Once again, we included inhibitors of JNK and p38 in experiments carried out on cultures from both wild-type and knock-out backgrounds. Treatment of wild-type cells with 10 μm SB203580 provided significant protection from WTS as described previously (Fig. 3) (Ref. 16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP600125 at 1 μm also provided significant protection. However, the extent of death following WTS did not differ significantly between wild-type cells and JNK2-/-, JNK3-/-, or even JNK2-/-JNK3-/- cells (Fig. 3). This was especially surprising given that the c-Jun phosphorylation shift was severely reduced in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- neurons (Fig. 1). Moreover, 10 μm SB203580, which effectively inhibits JNK2/3 activities (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided a similar degree of protection in wild-type and in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- neurons. One possible explanation is that JNK1 isoforms can also contribute to neuronal death and that SB203580 also inhibits a subset of JNK1 isoforms (as reported in Ref. 31Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P. Blencke S. Gutbrod H. Salassidis K. Stein-Gerlach M. Missio A. Cotton M. Daub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15434-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) that are up-regulated in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- neurons (Fig. 2). Indeed the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (1 μm) is also protective in neurons from JNK2-/-JNK3-/- mice. Knockdown of JNK2 and JNK3 Does Not Protect Neurons, All Three JNKs Must Be Depleted to Confer Significant Neuroprotection—The use of JNK knock-out mice did not demonstrate that JNK is required for WTS-evoked neuronal death, nor did it implicate specific isoforms, as no protection was observed either in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- (Fig. 3), neurons or in JNK1-/- neurons (data not shown). Surprisingly, SB203580 (10 μm), which inhibits JNKs 2 and 3, was neuroprotective (16Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3) even in JNK2-/-JNK3-/- neurons. One explanation would be that a JNK1 isoform is sufficient to induce death and that this isoform is sensitive to SB203580 (31Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P. Blencke S. Gutbrod H. Salassidis K. Stein-Gerlach M. Missio A. Cotton M. Daub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15434-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, SP600125 also protected JNK2-/-JNK3-/- neurons (Fig. 3). Indeed, no genetic evidence for JNK requirement in WTS-induced death of central nervous system neurons has been reported, only pharmacological evidence. Therefore we addressed these issues with gene silencing. First we established the silencing efficiency of JNK siRNA. We tested antibodies for JNK isoform specificity using wild-type and knock-out cells and tissues. Using this"

Two UNC45 genes are found in vertebrates, including a striated muscle specific form, Unc45b. We have investigated the role of Unc45b in myosin folding. Epitope tagged murine Unc45b (Unc45bFlag) was expressed in muscle and non-muscle cells and bacteria, isolated and characterized. The protein is a soluble monomer in solution with a compact folded rod-shaped structure of ∼19 nm length by electron microscopy. When over-expressed in striated muscle cells, Unc45bFlag fractionates as a cytosolic protein and isolates as a stable complex with Hsp90. Purified Unc45bFlag re-binds Hsp90 and forms a stable complex in solution. The endogenous Unc45b in muscle cell lysates is also found associated with Hsp90. The Unc45bFlag/Hsp90 complex binds the partially folded myosin motor domain when incubated with myosin subfragments synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate. This binding is independent of the myosin rod or light chains. Unc45bFlag does not bind native myosin subfragments consistent with a chaperone function. More importantly, Unc45bFlag enhances myosin motor domain folding during de novo motor domain synthesis indicating that it has a direct role in myosin maturation. Thus, mammalian Unc45b is a cytosolic protein that forms a stable complex with Hsp90, selectively binds the unfolded conformation of the myosin motor domain, and promotes motor domain folding."
https://openalex.org/W2087172463,"Visual perception begins with the absorption of a photon by an opsin pigment, inducing isomerization of its 11-cis-retinaldehyde chromophore. After a brief period of activation, the resulting all-trans-retinaldehyde dissociates from the opsin apoprotein rendering it insensitive to light. Restoring light sensitivity to apo-opsin requires thermal re-isomerization of all-trans-retinaldehyde to 11-cis-retinaldehyde via an enzyme pathway called the visual cycle in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Vertebrates can see over a 10(8)-fold range of background illumination. This implies that the visual cycle can regenerate a visual chromophore over a similarly broad range. However, nothing is known about how the visual cycle is regulated. Here we show that RPE cells, functionally or physically separated from photoreceptors, respond to light by mobilizing all-trans-retinyl esters. These retinyl esters are substrates for the retinoid isomerase and hence critical for regenerating visual chromophore. We show in knock-out mice and by RNA interference in human RPE cells that this mobilization is mediated by a protein called ""RPE-retinal G protein receptor"" (RGR) opsin. These data establish that RPE cells are intrinsically sensitive to light. Finally, we show that in the dark, RGR-opsin inhibits lecithin:retinol acyltransferase and all-trans-retinyl ester hydrolase in vitro and that this inhibition is released upon exposure to light. The results of this study suggest that RGR-opsin mediates light-dependent translocation of all-trans-retinyl esters from a storage pool in lipid droplets to an ""isomerase pool"" in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. This translocation permits insoluble all-trans-retinyl esters to be utilized as substrate for the synthesis of a new visual chromophore."

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder with a carrier frequency of 1:25 to 1:10. The gene that encodes 21-hydroxylase enzyme, CYP21A2, is considered to be one of the most polymorphic human genes. Copy number variations, such as deletions, which are severe mutations common in 21OHD patients, or gene duplications, which have been reported as rare events, have also been described. The correct characterization of 21OHD alleles is important for disease carrier detection and genetic counsellingCYP21A2 genotyping by sequencing has been performed in a random sample of the Spanish population, where 144 individuals recruited from university students and employees of the hospital were studied. The frequency of CYP21A2 mutated alleles in our sample was 15.3% (77.3% were mild mutations, 9% were severe mutations and 13.6% were novel variants). Gene dosage assessment was also performed when CYP21A2 gene duplication was suspected. This analysis showed that 7% of individuals bore a chromosome with a duplicated CYP21A2 gene, where one of the copies was mutated.As far as we know, the present study has shown the highest frequency of 21OHD carriers reported by a genotyping analysis. In addition, a high frequency of alleles with CYP21A2 duplications, which could be misinterpreted as 21OHD alleles, was found. Moreover, a high frequency of novel genetic variations with an unknown effect on 21-hydroxylase activity was also found. The high frequency of gene duplications, as well as novel variations, should be considered since they have an important involvement in carrier testing and genetic counseling."
https://openalex.org/W2083220586,"Background Meprin (EC 3.4.24.18), an astacin-like metalloprotease, is expressed in the epithelium of the intestine and kidney tubules and has been related to cancer, but the mechanistic links are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We used MDCK and Caco-2 cells stably transfected with meprinα and or meprinβ to establish models of renal and intestinal epithelial cells expressing this protease at physiological levels. In both models E-cadherin was cleaved, producing a cell-associated 97-kDa E-cadherin fragment, which was enhanced upon activation of the meprin zymogen and reduced in the presence of a meprin inhibitor. The cleavage site was localized in the extracellular domain adjacent to the plasma membrane. In vitro assays with purified components showed that the 97-kDa fragment was specifically generated by meprinβ, but not by ADAM-10 or MMP-7. Concomitantly with E-cadherin cleavage and degradation of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail, the plaque proteins β-catenin and plakoglobin were processed by an intracellular protease, whereas α-catenin, which does not bind directly to E-cadherin, remained intact. Using confocal microscopy, we observed a partial colocalization of meprinβ and E-cadherin at lateral membranes of incompletely polarized cells at preconfluent or early confluent stages. Meprinβ-expressing cells displayed a reduced strength of cell-cell contacts and a significantly lower tendency to form multicellular aggregates. Conclusions/Significance By identifying E-cadherin as a substrate for meprinβ in a cellular context, this study reveals a novel biological role of this protease in epithelial cells. Our results suggest a crucial role for meprinβ in the control of adhesiveness via cleavage of E-cadherin with potential implications in a wide range of biological processes including epithelial barrier function and cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2015265309,"6-Aminophenanthridine (6AP) and Guanabenz (GA, a drug currently in use for the treatment of hypertension) were isolated as antiprion drugs using a yeast-based assay. These structurally unrelated molecules are also active against mammalian prion in several cell-based assays and in vivo in a mouse model for prion-based diseases.Here we report the identification of cellular targets of these drugs. Using affinity chromatography matrices for both drugs, we demonstrate an RNA-dependent interaction of 6AP and GA with the ribosome. These specific interactions have no effect on the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome or on global translation. In contrast, 6AP and GA specifically inhibit the ribosomal RNA-mediated protein folding activity of the ribosome.6AP and GA are therefore the first compounds to selectively inhibit the protein folding activity of the ribosome. They thus constitute precious tools to study the yet largely unexplored biological role of this protein folding activity."

Here ecological and molecular evidence is presented demonstrating the existence of demersal free-living Symbiodinium populations in Caribbean reefs and the possible role of the stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride) as Symbiodinium spp. dispersers. Communities of free-living Symbiodinium were found within macroalgal beds consisting of Halimeda spp., Lobophora variegata, Amphiroa spp., Caulerpa spp. and Dictyota spp. Viable Symbiodinium spp. cells were isolated and cultured from macroalgal beds and S. viride feces. Further identification of Symbiodinium spp. type was determined by length variation in the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2, nuclear rDNA) and length variation in domain V of the chloroplast large subunit ribosomal DNA (cp23S-rDNA). Determination of free-living Symbiodinium and mechanisms of dispersal is important in understanding the life cycle of Symbiodinium spp."
https://openalex.org/W2038874598,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential anticancer agent that selectively induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells by interacting with death receptors DR4 and DR5. TRAIL can also bind to decoy receptors (DcR1, DcR2, and osteoprotegerin receptor) that cannot induce apoptosis. Different tumor types respond either to DR4 or to DR5 activation, and chemotherapeutic drugs can increase the expression of DR4 or DR5 in cancer cells. Thus, DR4 or DR5 receptor-specific TRAIL variants would permit new and tumor-selective therapies. Previous success in generating a DR5-selective TRAIL mutant using computer-assisted protein design prompted us to make a DR4-selective TRAIL variant. Technically, the design of DR4 receptor-selective TRAIL variants is considerably more challenging compared with DR5 receptor-selective variants, because of the lack of a crystal structure of the TRAIL-DR4 complex. A single amino acid substitution of Asp at residue position 218 of TRAIL to His or Tyr was predicted to have a favorable effect on DR4 binding specificity. Surface plasmon resonance-based receptor binding tests showed a lowered DR5 affinity in concert with increased DR4 specificity for the designed variants, D218H and D218Y. Binding to DcR1, DcR2, and osteoprotegerin was also decreased. Cell line assays confirmed that the variants could not induce apoptosis in DR5-responsive Jurkat and A2780 cells but were able to induce apoptosis in DR4-responsive EM-2 and ML-1 cells.

Computational protein design methods have been successfully employed to redesign several protein-protein interactions (1Shifman J.M. Mayo S.L. J. Mol.

Computational protein design methods allow the rational design of tailor-made protein therapeutics by modifying the binding characteristics of the protein, for example to reduce target binding promiscuity or to design novel mechanisms of activity.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 4The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; rh, recombinant human; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. 4The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin; WT, wild type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; rh, recombinant human; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance.-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential protein therapeutic currently attracting great interest because of its anti-cancer activity. TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo by a death receptor-mediated process. Unlike other apoptosis-inducing TNF family members, soluble TRAIL appears to be inactive against normal healthy tissue (5Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C.

TRAIL shows a high degree of promiscuity as it binds to five cognate receptors as follows: DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2) and three decoy receptors, DcR1 (TRAIL-R3), DcR2 (TRAIL-R4), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (6LeBlanc H.N.

DcR1 does not contain a death domain, and DcR2 contains a truncated death domain, and thus, binding of TRAIL to these receptors does not induce apoptosis. In contrast, these decoy receptors could prevent apoptosis by sequestering available TRAIL or by interfering with the formation of a TRAIL-DR4 or -DR5 signaling complex (14Kimberley F.C.

Cell Res. 2004; 14: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Use of DR4-selective variants could permit better tumor-specific therapies through escape from the decoy receptor-mediated antagonism, resulting in a higher efficacy with possibly less side effects as compared with wtTRAIL (15Griffith T.S.

Receptors DR4 and/or DR5 were shown to be up-regulated after treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, and the response to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was significantly increased (6LeBlanc H.N.

A recent study demonstrated that primary cells isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma were almost exclusively sensitive to DR4-mediated apoptosis (21MacFarlane M.

Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) prompted us to design a DR4-selective TRAIL variant.Because wild-type TRAIL has higher affinity for DR5 than DR4 (20van der Sloot A.M. Tur V. Szegezdi E. Mullally M.M. Cool R.H. Samali A. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8634-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Truneh A. Sharma S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23319-23325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the design of an effective DR4-selective TRAIL variant should preferably aim at both an enhanced affinity for DR4 and at decreased affinities for DR5 and decoy receptors. Consequently, it is essential to combine a positive design strategy strengthening the interactions between TRAIL and DR4 with a negative strategy that designs mutations disrupting interactions between TRAIL and the other receptors. Generally, it is less demanding to only disrupt an existing interaction (or create an unfavorable one) by an amino acid substitution than to combine this with the creation of a new favorable interaction. A high quality structural model describing all the relevant interactions between the interacting partners is therefore of paramount importance. As the only crystal structure available is that of the TRAIL-DR5 complex, the design of a DR4-selective variant critically depends on the quality of the homology model of the TRAIL-DR4 complex. We demonstrate here that the design of DR4-specific rhTRAIL variants is possible using homology modeling and computational protein design.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll reagents were of analytical grade unless specified otherwise. Isopropyl β-d-1-thio-galactoside, ampicillin, and dithiothreitol were from Duchefa (Haarlem, The Netherlands). Chromatographic columns and media were from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Recombinant TRAIL-receptor Ig fusion proteins formulated with bovine serum albumin were ordered fromR&D Systems. All other chemicals were from Sigma. All buffers used in SPR, ELISA, and biological activity assays were of physiological pH and ionic strength.Modeling of TRAIL-Receptor Complexes—At present only the crystal structure of TRAIL in complex with the DR5 receptor is known. The template selected was Protein Data Bank code 1D4V (25Mongkolsapaya J. Grimes J.M. Chen N. Xu X.N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct.

The homotrimer was generated using the protein quaternary structure server from the EBI, having the symmetry coordinates in the Protein Data Bank file. From the sequence alignment of the different TRAIL receptors (26Strausberg R.L. Feingold E.A. Grouse L.H. Derge J.G. Klausner R.D. Collins F.S. Wagner L. Shenmen C.M. Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F.

A. 2002; 99: 16899-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), it is observed that the receptor cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) involved in the interaction with TRAIL (CRD2 and CRD3) are highly conserved, with the exception of the soluble receptor OPG. Indeed, when compared with DR5, the sequence identity of any other membrane-attached TRAIL receptor is higher than 50% in each case, and there are neither insertions nor deletions in the sequence (with the exception of a glycine deletion in the middle of the CRD3 in DcR1). In addition, all the cysteines involved in the formation of internal disulfide bridges are conserved and share the same sequence position. Thus it is possible to build homology models of all TRAIL receptors except for OPG.The homology model of TRAIL-DR4 was built using the protein design capabilities of FoldX. The DR5 amino acid residues were mutated into the corresponding DR4 amino acids, and subsequently, all amino acid side chain interactions were optimized to accommodate TRAIL and receptor residues to their new interface.Computational Design of the Mutants—A detailed description of the empirical force field FoldX (version 2.6) is available elsewhere (27Guerois R. Nielsen J.E. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 28Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Martins I.C. Ferkinghoff-Borg J. Stricher F. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10147-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and on line. Briefly, this force field calculates the free energy of unfolding (ΔG) of a target protein or protein complex combining the physical description of the interactions with empirical data obtained from experiments on proteins. Force field components (polar and hydrophobic solvation energies, van der Waals interactions, van der Waals clashes, H-bond energies, and electrostatics in the complex and its effects on the kon and backbone and side chain entropies) were calculated evaluating the properties of the structure, such as its atomic contact map, the accessibility of its atoms and residues, the backbone dihedral angles, the H-bond network, and the electrostatic network of the protein. Water molecules making two or more H-bonds with the protein were also taken into account (29Kiel C. Serrano L. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1039-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).FoldX was able to perform amino acid mutations and simultaneously accommodate the new residues and its surrounding amino acids (28Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Martins I.C. Ferkinghoff-Borg J. Stricher F. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10147-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). FoldX first mutates the selected position to alanine and annotates the side chain energies of the neighbor residues. Then it mutates this alanine to the selected amino acid and recalculates the side chain energies of the same neighboring residues. Those that exhibit an energy difference are then mutated to themselves to see if another rotamer will be more favorable.This procedure was also used to reconstruct the binding interface of TRAIL in complex with the modeled DR4 receptor; to repair residues with bad torsion angles, residues having bad van der Waals clashes or to build up the putative interactions between TRAIL and the modeled receptor. the most optimal amino acid conformation was chosen using rotamer substitution (see above). The crystal structure of TRAIL in complex with the DR5 receptor was also refined this way.Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Selectivity Mutants—A cDNA corresponding to human soluble TRAIL (amino acids 114-281) was cloned in pET15B (Novagen) using NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. Mutants were constructed by PCR as described before (30van der Sloot A.M. Mullally M.M. Fernandez-Ballester G. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Homotrimeric TRAIL proteins were purified using a three-step purification as described previously (30van der Sloot A.M. Mullally M.M. Fernandez-Ballester G. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration and nonreducing gel electrophoresis confirmed that rhTRAIL WT, D218H, and D218Y are trimeric molecules; they do not form higher degree aggregates and do not contain inter-chain disulfide bridges.Determination of Receptor Binding—Binding experiments were performed using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 37 °C. DR4-Ig, DR5-Ig, DcR1-Ig, DcR2-Ig, and OPG-Ig receptor chimeras were captured at a 35 μl/min flow rate using a protein A (Sigma)-modified CM5 sensor chip (Biacore). Receptors chimeras were captured at a level of ∼500-800 response units. Purified rhTRAIL WT and rhTRAIL variants were injected 3-fold at concentrations ranging from 250 to 2 nm at 70 μl/min flow rate using HBS-EP (Biacore) as running and sample buffer. Binding of ligands to the receptors was monitored in real time. Between injections the protein A sensor surface was regenerated using a 30-s pulse of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0. The resonance signal measured on the reference cell (containing protein A only) was subtracted from the signal measured on the experimental flow cell. All sensorgrams were corrected for buffer injection. To obtain pre-steady state data that represent proper high affinity complex formation, and assuming the initial fast off-rate to represent lower affinity complexes, the response at each concentration was recorded 30 s after the end of the injections. The response data as a function of TRAIL concentration were fitted by using a four-parameter equation to give an apparent affinity constant.Selectivity of the variants toward the DR4 receptor was also assessed using a competitive ELISA experiment as described before (20van der Sloot A.M. Tur V. Szegezdi E. Mullally M.M. Cool R.H. Samali A. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8634-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In short, 10 ng/well rhTRAIL WT or receptor-selective variants were preincubated with 0-500 ng/well DR4 or DR5-Ig for 30 min. Preincubated solutions were added to microtiter plates coated with DR4-Ig. After washing away unbound sample, bound rhTRAIL WT or variants were detected with a polyclonal goat anti-TRAIL antibody (R & D Systems) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-goat antibody (BIOSOURCE) using the one-step turbo 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine-ELISA (Pierce) as detection reagent. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Binding of the receptor-selective variants to immobilized DR4-Ig at various concentrations of soluble competitor was calculated relative to the value measured in the absence of soluble receptor.Biological Activity, Cell Line, and Treatment—A2780, ovarian adenocarcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas Jurkat T cell leukemia, ML-1 acute myeloid leukemia, and EM-2 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 5 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate in a humidified incubator, 37 °C, 5% CO2 environment.Annexin V Staining—Cells were seeded the day before the experiment at a density of 3.5 × 105, 5 × 105, and 3 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates (0.5 ml/well) for A2780, Jurkat, ML-1 and EM-2 cell types, respectively. 10-250 ng/ml rhTRAIL WT, D269HE195R, D218H, or D218Y was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. FLAG-tagged TRAIL (Alexis) was preincubated with 1 μg/ml enhancer for 20 min (cross-linking) before adding it to Jurkat cell cultures in a concentration between 10 and 250 ng/ml. A2780 cells were trypsinized gently, and the cells were allowed to recover for 10 min with gentle shaking at 37 °C before pelleting by centrifugation. Jurkat, ML-1, and EM-2 cells were transferred into Eppendorf tubes and spun down. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of annexin V incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing 6 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (IQ Corp.) for 15 min on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding 300 μl of fresh incubation buffer, and the samples were analyzed immediately using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Results were expressed as percentage of annexin V-positive cells.RESULTSSelectivity Design—For the design of a DR4-selective TRAIL variant, the procedure previously used for the design of DR5-selective TRAIL variants was used (20van der Sloot A.M. Tur V. Szegezdi E. Mullally M.M. Cool R.H. Samali A. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8634-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In short, the receptor binding interface of TRAIL was screened for single amino acid substitutions that increase the affinity for the DR4 receptor (decreasing interaction energy (ΔΔGi)) or decreasing affinity for DR5. For the TRAIL-DR4-receptor complex, a homology model consisting of TRAIL in complex with CRD2 and -3 of DR4 was constructed based on the TRAIL-DR5-receptor complex. For the TRAIL-DR5-receptor complex, the 1D4V crystal structure was used (25Mongkolsapaya J. Grimes J.M. Chen N. Xu X.N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). CRD2 and -3 of DR4 show a considerable degree of sequence identity with DR5 (∼50%), and the alignment contains no insertions or deletions (not shown); consequently, it was decided to use a model with an identical amino acid backbone conformation as TRAIL-DR5. FoldX was used to build the TRAIL-DR4 model by mutating DR5 amino acid residues into the corresponding DR4 amino acids, followed by optimization of all amino acid side chain interactions (27Guerois R. Nielsen J.E. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 28Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Martins I.C. Ferkinghoff-Borg J. Stricher F. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10147-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, electrostatic charges mapped on the solvent-accessible surface of TRAIL, DR5, and the DR4 model are depicted. It can be seen that the surface electrostatics of TRAIL and DR5 are more complementary with each other than the surface electrostatics of TRAIL and DR4. The accuracy of the models and the force field was tested using the affinity data derived from the alanine scanning of rhTRAIL as performed by Hymowitz et al. (31Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The predictions of the energy change in the complex formation correlate with the changes in the dissociation constants measured (data not shown) (20van der Sloot A.M. Tur V. Szegezdi E. Mullally M.M. Cool R.H. Samali A. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8634-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This implies that the above method can reliably predict mutations in the binding interface that would alter ligand-receptor interaction.The FoldX design process (see “Experimental Procedures”) proposed several positions in the receptor-binding interface of TRAIL and (single) amino acid substitutions enhancing DR4 selectivity. One of the proposed mutations, K201R, was already present in a sextuple mutant selected by Kelley et al. (32Kelley R.F. Totpal K. Lindstrom S.H. Mathieu M. Billeci K. Deforge L. Pai R. Hymowitz S.G. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2205-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) using phage display, underlining the correctness of the DR4 model. In addition, new amino acid substitutions were predicted that have not been described before. Of these, the D218Y and D218H mutations were predicted to result in the highest increase in DR4 selectivity by maintaining or improving the interaction with DR4 and decreasing the interaction with DR5 (Fig. 2). To assess the effect of pH on receptor binding of D218H, calculations were performed while introducing a charged, neutral, and partially charged histidine at position 218 to reflect acidic, basic, and physiological pH environments, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the decreased affinity of D218H for DR5 is partially accounted for by electrostatic repulsion as the ΔΔGi increases from 1.2 to 2.0 kcal/mol when going from a neutral to a charged histidine. In contrast, the affinity for DR4 is not dependent on pH (Fig. 2). The D218A mutation has been described previously by Hymowitz et al. (31Hymowitz S.G. O'Connell M.P. Ultsch M.H. Hurst A. Totpal K. Ashkenazi A. de Vos A.M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) to reduce the affinity for DR4 (1.3-fold) and, more pronounced, for DR5 (1.9-fold). FoldX also predicts that this variant has a lowered affinity for DR5 (Fig. 2). The D218H and D218Y rhTRAIL mutants were made, produced, and purified as described before (20van der Sloot A.M. Tur V. Szegezdi E. Mullally M.M. Cool R.H. Samali A. Serrano L. Quax W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8634-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30van der Sloot A.M. Mullally M.M.

Receptor binding curves were recorded using rhTRAIL concentrations ranging from 2 to 250 nm at 37 °C (Fig. 3A and B). Apparent dissociation constants were calculated from pre-steady state response values (Table 1). Although the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for DR4 of both variants remained unchanged when compared with rhTRAIL WT, both variants showed a 3-3.5-fold increase in their apparent dissociation constant for DR5 (Table 1). Inspection of the sensorgrams recorded at 37 °C for DR4 and DR5 revealed that the koff for rhTRAIL WT was very low (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, left). On the other hand, both D218H and D218Y variants showed an initial increased off-rate, which in the case of binding to DR4 (supplemental Fig. 1A, middle, right) was much smaller than the off-rate at the DR5 receptor (supplemental Fig. 1B, middle, right).FIGURE 3Receptor binding of rhTRAIL WT and DR4-selective mutants as determined by SPR and competitive ELISA. Receptor binding of rhTRAIL WT, D218H, and D218Y to DR4-Ig was determined by SPR (A) or to DR5-Ig (B). To obtain pre-steady state data that represent proper high affinity complex formation, and assuming the initial fast off-rate to represent lower complexes, the response at each concentration was recorded 30 s after the end of the injections. Receptor binding was calculated relative to the response of rhTRAIL WT at 250 nm. Competition ELISA used DR4-Ig as competitor (C) or soluble DR5-Ig as competitor (D). rhTRAIL WT or variants were preincubated with 0-500 ng/well DR4 or DR5 during 30 min. Preincubated solutions were added to microtiter plates coated with DR4-Ig. Binding of the selective variants at various concentrations of soluble receptor toward the immobilized DR4-Ig was calculated relative to the value measured on"

In the basal state, they are sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IκB proteins. Pro-inflammatory signaling triggers polyubiquitination of intermediaries (e.g. RIP1), which activate IκB kinases that trigger Ser phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, thereby promoting nuclear translocation of NF-κB. A negative feedback loop exists whereby NF-κB drives resynthesis of IκBα, which promotes export of NF-κB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process relies on Cezanne, a deubiquitinating cysteine protease that stabilizes resynthesized IκBα by removing polyubiquitin from modified intermediaries. H2O2 is generated during inflammation. Here we examined the effects of H2O2 on NF-κB dynamics and pro-inflammatory activation in cultured cells co-stimulated with TNFα or IL-1β. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that H2O2 enhanced the induction of IL-8 by TNFα or IL-1β. We demonstrated by using assays of NF-κB nuclear localization and by imaging of live cells expressing a fluorescent form of NF-κB that H2O2 prolonged NF-κB nuclear localization in cells co-stimulated with TNFα or IL-1β by suppressing its export from the nucleus. We provide evidence that H2O2 suppresses NF-κB export by prolonging polyubiquitination of signaling intermediaries, which promotes Ser phosphorylation and destabilization of newly synthesized IκBα proteins. Finally, we observed that the catalytic activity of Cezanne and its ability to suppress RIP1 polyubiquitination and NF-κB transcriptional activity were inhibited by H2O2. We conclude that H2O2 prolongs NF-κB activation in co-stimulated cells by suppressing the negative regulatory functions of Cezanne and IκBα.

IL-1β) drive inflammation by activating the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, which induces pro-inflammatory molecules including chemokines (e.g. IL-8). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to inhibitory IκB molecules, which mask its nuclear localization sequence (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

TNFα or IL-1β activate distinct pathways that converge to activate IκB kinases (IKK), which phosphorylate IκB at Ser residues (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

This process is regulated by ubiquitin, a protein that can be covalently attached to Lys residues of other cellular proteins in the form of isopeptide-linked polyubiquitin chains (8Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Signaling through TNFR or IL-1/Toll-like receptor relies on modification of RIP1 or TRAF6 signaling intermediaries, respectively, with a “non-classical” form of polyubiquitin linked through Lys-63 that triggers the activation of IKKβ (9Deng L.

In addition, polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys-48 play a well recognized role during NF-κB activation by targeting phosphorylated IκB proteins for proteasomal degradation, thus liberating NF-κB for nuclear entry (2Hayden M.S.

The resolution of inflammatory responses is regulated by multiple negative feedback mechanisms that act in concert to suppress NF-κB activity. A key step in this process is the induction of IκBα by NF-κB in activated cells. Newly synthesized IκBα proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they target activated NF-κB complexes for export to the cytoplasm (18Arenzanaseisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F.

Both of these proteins can be recruited to activated TNFRs, where they suppress the activity of pro-inflammatory signaling intermediaries by removing polyubiquitin chains from them (13Wertz I.E.

Thus suppression of TNFR signaling by A20 and Cezanne stabilizes newly synthesized IκBα, which inhibits NF-κB by removing it from the nucleus. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide are generated in inflamed tissues and may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (27Cave A.C.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar), their potential effects on negative regulators of NF-κB have received little attention. Nevertheless, emerging reports suggest that ROS may enhance cellular activation by suppressing the activity of anti-inflammatory enzymes such as histone deacetylases (31Ito K. Hanazawa T. Tomita K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatases (MKPs) (32Kamata H.

Here we demonstrate that H2O2 can suppress the negative regulatory functions of IκBα and Cezanne, thus prolonging NF-κB nuclear localization and pro-inflammatory transcriptional responses in activated cells. Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant TNFα and IL-1β were obtained commercially (R&D, Minneapolis, MN). Anti-RelA (sc372; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-IκBα (sc-847; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphoIκBα Ser-32/Ser-36 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-RIP1 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Oxford, UK), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science, Burgess Hill, UK), anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-lamin B antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were obtained commercially. The generation of anti-Cezanne antibodies has been described (26Enesa K. Zakkar M. Chaudhury H. Luong L. Rawlinson L. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Dean J.L.E. Evans P.C. J. Biol.

Other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Plasmids—Expression vectors encoding HA epitope-tagged Cezanne (pHM6-Cezanne) or GFP-tagged Cezanne (pEGFP-Cezanne) have been described (23Evans P.C. Taylor E.R. Coadwell J. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Kilshaw P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An expression vector containing a dsRed-tagged version of RelA (pRelA-dsRed) was described previously (33Nelson G. Paraoan L. Spiller D.G. Wilde G.J.C. Browne M.A. Djali P.K. Unitt J.F. Sullivan E. Floettmann E. White M.R.H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Transfection—HeLa and A549 cells were cultured using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal-calf serum, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of cells was achieved using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular ROS were measured in live cells using CM-H2DCFDA, a probe that forms a fluorescent adduct (dichlorofluorescein) when oxidized. Cells were incubated with 5 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 15 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline prior to experimentation. Fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. ELISA to Detect IL-8—The levels of IL-8 proteins in cell culture supernatants were quantified using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, human IL-8 Duo Set; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance (OD) was measured at 450 nm on a microtiter plate reader. Concentrations were obtained by interpolation from standard curves as described previously (34Tsaprouni L.G. Ito K. Adcock I.M. Punchard N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2007; 150: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Comparative Real-time PCR—Transcript levels were quantified by comparative real-time PCR using gene-specific primers for IL-8 (sense, 5′-TGCCAAGGAGTGCTAAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCCACAACCCTCTGCAC-3′), IκBα (sense, 5′-CTGATGTCAACAGAGTTACCTACCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CGTGAACTCTGACTCTGTGTCATAG-3′), and β-actin (sense, 5′-CTGGAACGGTGAAGGTGACA-3′; antisense, 5′-AAGGGACTTCCTGTAACAATGCA-3′) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Quantitation of GNB2L1 was carried out using primers obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed as described previously (35Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was carried out using the iCycler system (Bio-Rad) and SYBR green master mix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min before thermal cycling at 95 °C for 10 s and 56 °C for 45 s. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Relative gene expression was calculated by comparing the number of thermal cycles that were necessary to generate threshold amounts of product (CT) as described previously (35Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). CT was calculated for the genes of interest and for the housekeeping gene β-actin. For each cDNA sample, the CT for β-actin was subtracted from the CT for each gene of interest to give the parameter ΔCT, thus normalizing the initial amount of RNA used. The amount of each target was calculated as 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT is the difference between the ΔCT of the two cDNA samples to be compared. Assays of NF-κB Intracellular Localization—Intracellular localization of endogenous RelA was assessed by immunostaining of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells using anti-RelA antibodies and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510 META; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) following Ref. 35Partridge J. Carlsen H. Enesa K. Chaudhury H. Zakkar M. Luong L. Kinderlerer A. Johns M. Blomhoff R. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Evans P.C. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3553-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. Image analysis was performed using Velocity software (Improvision, Coventry, UK) to calculate the ratio of RelA present in the nucleus when compared with the cytoplasm. Alternatively, levels of endogenous RelA were measured in cytosolic or nuclear lysates prepared using the NucBuster kit (Novagen, San Diego, CA) by Western blotting using anti-RelA antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent detection. The intracellular localization of RelA was also assessed in real time using cells cultured on glass coverslips in 60-mm dishes. They were transfected with 0.5 μg of mammalian expression vector containing RelA-dsRed and allowed to recover for 48 h. The localization of RelA-dsRed in live cells was assessed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope with a specialized stage that maintained cultures at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment (LSM 510 META; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were made every 3–5 min following stimulation. Image analysis was performed using Velocity software (Improvision, Coventry, UK) to calculate the proportion of RelA-dsRed in the nucleus at multiple time points following stimulation. The duration of nuclear localization was defined as the time interval at which the proportion of nuclear RelA exceeded 20%. Assay of NF-κB Transcriptional Activity—NF-κB transcriptional activity was measured using an NF-κB reporter (pGL2) as described previously (26Enesa K. Zakkar M. Chaudhury H. Luong L. Rawlinson L. Mason J.C. Haskard D.O. Dean J.L.E. Evans P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7036-7045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with pNF-luc and pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase to normalize transfection efficiency) using Lipofectamine and incubated for 16 h. Cells were then treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 16 h before measurement of NF-κB activity. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was assessed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and luminescence counter (Topcount microplate scintillation; Packard). Precipitation of TNF Receptor Complexes—HEK293 cells were treated with biotinylated TNFα (200 ng/ml) for varying durations and then lysed using 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm N-ethylmaleimide, 20 nm MG132, plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). Lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation and precleared using protein-G-Sepharose before precipitation of TNFR complexes using streptavidin-coated beads (Roche Applied Science). Beads were then washed extensively using lysis buffer. Precipitated material or lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent detection. Assay of Cezanne Catalytic Activity—The catalytic activity of Cezanne was assessed by measuring its capacity to bind to a ubiquitin-derived probe (HAUbVME), which contained a thiol-reactive vinylmethyl ester group at the C terminus (36Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). It was chosen because of its ability to bind covalently to the catalytic cysteine of Cezanne (25Evans P.C. Ovaa H. Hamon M. Kilshaw P.J. Hamm S. Bauer S. Ploegh H.L. Smith T.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The probe is tagged with HA epitope to facilitate detection and is ∼10 kDa in size. Cytosolic lysates were made from cells expressing GFP-tagged Cezanne using 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Probe was applied to cytosolic lysates, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Probe-Cezanne conjugates were detected by Western blotting using anti-HA epitope antibodies (1:1000; Roche Applied Science), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescent detection. Statistics—Differences between samples were analyzed using a paired Student's t test and analysis of variance (*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001, as shown in the figure legends). H2O2 Enhanced Transcriptional Activation of Pro-inflammatory Genes in Response to TNFα or IL-1β—We examined whether H2O2 could regulate pro-inflammatory activation of HeLa or A549 cells, either alone or in combination with IL-1β or TNFα. We observed by comparative real-time PCR that the application of H2O2 alone (6–100 μm) had little or no effect on IL-8 transcript levels in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, compare lane 1 with lanes 6–8). However, H2O2 significantly enhanced the production of IL-8 transcripts in a concentration-dependent manner in cells that were co-treated with IL-1β (Fig. 1A, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–5) without affecting cell proliferation or survival (data not shown). Thus we used H2O2 at 100 μm in subsequent experiments. In time course experiments, we observed that co-stimulation with H2O2 significantly enhanced the induction of IL-8 transcripts by IL-1β or TNFα at both early and late time points (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10 with lanes 5, 7, 9, and 11; Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6). Similarly, we observed by ELISA of cell culture supernatants that the application of H2O2 significantly enhanced the production of IL-8 protein in cells that were co-treated with IL-1β (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8) or TNFα (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 5 and 7). We next examined whether the effects of H2O2 were mediated via elevated levels of intracellular ROS. Using a fluorescent probe, it was demonstrated that levels of intracellular ROS were elevated rapidly by the application of exogenous H2O2 (either in the presence or in the absence of IL-1β) and were sustained for at least 360 min (Fig. 1F). In contrast, treatment of cells with IL-1β alone did not elevate intracellular ROS (Fig. 1F). Moreover, we observed that the capacity of H2O2 to enhance IL-8 induction in response to TNFα was suppressed in cultures that were pretreated with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) (10 mm, Fig. 1E, compare lanes 7 and 8), confirming that H2O2 exerts its modulatory effects on pro-inflammatory signaling by altering intracellular redox status. The potential effects of H2O2 on IL-8 mRNA stability were assessed using actinomycin D to block de novo transcription in activated cells. We observed that H2O2 did not alter the rate of decay of IL-8 transcript levels in cells co-treated with TNFα (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these observations suggest that H2O2 can enhance transcriptional activation of IL-8 in response to IL-1β or TNFα by altering intracellular redox. H2O2 Prolongs Nuclear Localization and Enhances DNA Binding of NF-κB in Activated Cells—We examined whether H2O2 modulated NF-κB activation by IL-1β or TNFα, which is a central event in IL-8 induction. Western blotting or immunostaining revealed that RelA accumulated in the nucleus in response to 15–30 min of treatment with IL-1β (Fig. 2A, upper panel, and Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2) or TNFα (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 6 and 7) but subsequently localized to the cytoplasm following 120 min of treatment (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 7 and 8; Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Co-stimulation with H2O2 and IL-1β or with H2O2 and TNFα led to increased nuclear localization of NF-κB at late (120–240 min) time points (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 5 and lanes 8 and 10; Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 5) without significantly affecting nuclear RelA expression at early time points (30 min) (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 7 and 9; Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4). Thus we conclude that co-stimulation with H2O2 significantly enhanced nuclear localization of NF-κB and binding to DNA sequences in cells that were co-stimulated with IL-1β or TNFα for 120–240 min. These findings were supported by in vitro assays, which revealed that H2O2 altered the kinetics of NF-κB activation in response to IL-1β by enhancing DNA binding following 120 or 240 min of co-treatment (data not shown). H2O2 Suppresses Export of RelA from the Nucleus in IL-1β-treated Cells—To assess directly the potential effects of H2O2 on NF-κB dynamics, we used laser-scanning confocal microscopy to monitor the intracellular localization of a fluorescent form of RelA (RelA-dsRed) in real time in living cells. Analysis of multiple cells revealed that RelA-dsRed translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to IL-1β and that peak nuclear fluorescence occurred following an average of 48 min of treatment (Fig. 3A, compare panels 1 and 3; Fig. 3B, treatment 1; Fig. 3C, left panel, lane 1). This was followed by export of RelA-dsRed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, compare panels 3 and 6; Fig. 3B). Thus RelA-dsRed was localized to the nucleus in IL-1β-treated cells for an average of 146 min (Fig. 3C, right panel, lane 1). Treatment with H2O2 alone did not stimulate nuclear translocation of RelA-dsRed (data not shown). However, H2O2 altered NF-κB dynamics in response to IL-1β by modestly delaying import of RelA-dsRed in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus peak nuclear fluorescence occurred at later time points in cells co-treated with IL-1β and H2O2 (Fig. 3A, compare panels 3 and 9; Fig. 3B; Fig. 3C, left panel, compare lane 3 with lane 1). We observed that H2O2 also suppressed the export of RelA-dsRed from the nucleus (Fig. 3A, compare panels 6 and 12; Fig. 3B). Thus the average duration of RelA-dsRed nuclear localization in response to IL-1β was significantly elevated by co-treatment with H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, right panel). We conclude that H2O2 enhances and prolongs pro-inflammatory activation in response to IL-1β or TNFα by delaying the export of NF-κB from the nucleus. H2O2 Promotes Ser-32/Ser-36 Phosphorylation and Degradation of Newly Synthesized IκBα Proteins—We reasoned that H2O2 may prolong NF-κB nuclear localization by suppressing the expression or stability of newly synthesized IκBα molecules, which normally inhibit pro-inflammatory activation by exporting NF-κB complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Western blotting of cytosolic lysates revealed that IκBα was degraded rapidly (15 min) in response to IL-1β (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 2) or TNFα (compare lanes 6 and 7) and that this process was not suppressed by co-treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 7 and 9). After 60–120 min, IκBα protein levels were restored fully in cells treated with IL-1β or TNFα (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 7 and 8) but only partially restored in cells that were co-treated with H2O2 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 8 and 10). Comparative real-time PCR revealed that co-treatment with H2O2 enhanced the induction of IκBα transcripts by IL-1β or TNFα (Fig. 4B). We conclude therefore that H2O2 suppresses newly synthesized IκBα at a post-transcriptional level. We next examined whether H2O2 regulates phosphorylation of resynthesized IκBα proteins at Ser-32/Ser-36, a modification that is known to target IκBα for proteasomal degradation. We observed that serine phosphorylation of newly synthesized IκBα was significantly greater in cells co-treated for 1 h with H2O2 and IL-1β when compared with cells treated with IL-1β alone (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 5 and 7). Thus we conclude that H2O2 suppresses export of RelA from the nucleus in activated cells by promoting Ser phosphorylation and destabilization of newly synthesized IκBα proteins. H2O2 Prolongs TNFR Signaling by Inhibiting an Anti-inflammatory Deubiquitinating Enzyme—We examined whether phosphorylation and destabilization of newly synthesized IκBα by H2O2 in activated cells was associated with prolonged activity of upstream signaling intermediaries.

https://openalex.org/W2055927100,"Hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning are strongly regulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and particularly by mGluR5. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying mGluR5-modulation of these phenomena. Prolonged pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 with MPEP produced a profound impairment of spatial memory. Effects were associated with 1) a reduction of mGluR1a-expression in the dentate gyrus; 2) impaired dentate gyrus LTP; 3) enhanced CA1-LTP and 4) suppressed theta (5–10 Hz) and gamma (30–100 Hz) oscillations in the dentate gyrus. Allosteric potentiation of mGluR1 after mGluR5 blockade significantly ameliorated dentate gyrus LTP, as well as suppression of gamma oscillatory activity. CA3-lesioning prevented MPEP effects on CA1-LTP, suggesting that plasticity levels in CA1 are driven by mGluR5-dependent synaptic and network activity in the dentate gyrus. These data support the hypothesis that prolonged mGluR5-inactivation causes altered hippocampal LTP levels and network activity, which is mediated in part by impaired mGluR1-expression in the dentate gyrus. The consequence is impairment of long-term learning."

The sample buffer was exchanged to 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 m NaCl and 15 mm imidazole, with a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column. The histidine affinity tag was cleaved by 250 μl of tobacco etch virus protease (4 mg/ml) at 25 °C for 3 h and was removed by a second passage through the His-Trap column. The protein sample was desalted on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column, and was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 10 mm NaCl and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol.

Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and the MAD phases were improved with RESOLVE (31Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was clear. Two cAMP molecules in the asymmetric unit were traced unambiguously. The model was built with the program TURBO-FRODO, and multiple cycles of model building and refinement were performed. The model was refined using CNS 1.1 (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

TLS refinement with 8 groups, defined by the TLSMD server, was used in Refmac5 for the final refinement stage (33Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

In the electron density map, the N-terminal artificial linkers and residues 423-427 in molecule A, and residues 246-247 and 420-427 in molecule B were disordered. The final model has good geometry, as examined by MolProbity (36Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

The ribbon, tube, ball-and-stick, and solvent-accessible surface models in the figures were drawn using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—All analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. The sample buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and all experiments were performed at 4 °C. The solvent density (ρ = 1.0129 g/ml) and the protein partial specific volume (v̄ = 0.728 ml/g) were estimated with SEDNTERP (37Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science, Royal Society of Chemistry, UK1992Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data were obtained at 40,000 rpm using an Epon double-sector centerpiece, with loading concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml of native protein. The data were collected every 5 min for 500 min. The data were analyzed with the program SEDFIT (38Schuck P. Biophys.

Overall Structure of the GAF-B Domain of PDE10A—The GAF-B domain monomer structure of human PDE10A contains a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β3-β2-β1-β6-β5-β4) sandwiched by a three-helix bundle (α1, α2, and α5) and three short helices (α3, α4, and 310) on each side (Fig. 1A). The topology is similar to those of the published GAF domain structures; namely, the GAF domains of mouse PDE2A, cyanobacterium Anabaena adenylyl cyclase cyaB2, yeast YKG9, and Deinococcus bacterial phytochrome (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A.

A structure-based sequence alignment of the PDE10A GAF-B domain with other PDE GAF domains and the cyaB2 GAF domains is shown in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of the GAF domains. A gray broken line separates the upper and lower lines of amino acid sequences. The upper lines are the nine sequence alignments of the GAF domains known to bind cAMP or cGMP: human PDE10A GAF-B, mouse PDE2A GAF-B, cyanobacterium Anabaena cyaB2 adenylyl cyclase GAF-A and -B, and GAF-As of human PDE5A, -6A, -6B, -6C, and -11A. The seven sequences of the lower lines are mouse PDE2A GAF-A, GAF-Bs of human PDE5A, -6A, -6B, and -6C, human PDE10A GAF-A, and human PDE11A GAF-B. Helices and β-strands are indicated by pink and green boxes, respectively, where the three-dimensional structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Strictly conserved and similar residues are represented by red and violet characters, respectively, in blue boxes (comparing all the sequences) and in red boxes (comparing the sequences in the upper lines). Residues that recognize the cNMP bases with their main chains and side chains are indicated by open boxes and triangles, respectively. Residues that recognize the phosphate group and/or the ribose with their main chains and side chains are indicated by filled boxes and triangles, respectively. The types of interactions are indicated as green for hydrophobic or van der Waals interaction, red for hydrogen bond, and pink for water-mediated hydrogen bond. Residues involved in homodimerization of the PDE10A GAF-B domain are indicated by purple (molecule A) and cyan (molecule B) asterisks. The highly conserved NNKFDE motif is shown below the alignment. The alignment was produced by Clustal_X (47Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GAF-B domain of human PDE10A forms a dimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (Fig. 1, C and D). Each GAF-B domain has a bound cAMP. The sedimentation velocity data from the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments at 4 °C showed that the PDE10A GAF-B domain sedimented as a single major peak, with an estimated s-value of 2.2013 S (Fig. 1B). The corrected s-value under water conditions at 20 °C is 3.3957 S. The molecular weight was estimated to be 41,144, which is in agreement with the formation of a dimer, with a calculated molecular weight of 42,430. The two molecules (A and B) superimpose each other well in the region of the six-stranded β-sheet and the three short helices (Fig. 1A), with a root mean square deviation of 0.74 Å for the 104 Cα atoms of residues 284-387. In contrast, the structure of the helical bundle is different: the α1 helix of molecule B is much shorter than that of molecule A (16 and 9 residues in molecule A and B, respectively); and the α5 helix has a kink at Phe404 only in molecule B (Fig. 1, A and E). Dimer Interface—Most of the dimer interface involves the three-helix bundle (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2). The interaction between the molecules buries a total surface area of 3,061 Å2, calculated with the AREAIMOL program in the CCP4 suite (41CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4)Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19745) Google Scholar). The homodimer interaction is asymmetric. The α1 and α2 helices of molecule B interact with the α5 helix of molecule A, but only the α1 helix of molecule A interacts with the α5 helix of molecule B (Fig. 1, C and D). The α1 helix of molecule B also interacts with the β5-β6 loop, the β5 strand, and the α3-β4 loop of molecule A, but the α1 helix of molecule A interacts only with the β5-β6 loop and the β5 strand, and not with the α3-β4 loop of molecule B (Fig. 1C). There is an intensive interaction between the α5 helices (Fig. 1E). The α5—α5 interaction surface is also asymmetric, with a slight translation along the long axis of the helices, and the conformations of the side chains of the corresponding amino acids are different between the two molecules (Fig. 1E). The homodimer interface is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1E). cAMP-binding Pocket—The bound cAMP molecules were unambiguously identified in the electron density map (Fig. 3A). cAMP is located between the β-sheet and the α4 helix of each GAF-B domain molecule (Figs. 1A and 3B). Because the structures of the cAMP-binding sites and cAMP recognition of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are essentially identical, we will describe only molecule A. The cAMP molecule is buried in the binding pocket, and only the C2 carbon of cAMP is visible through an opening on the protein surface (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the B factors for the cAMP atoms (21.1-24.6 Å2) are similar to the average B factor for the protein molecule (21.4 Å2). Thus, the interaction between the protein and cAMP is tight. This may explain the fact that even if cAMP was never added during either the purification or crystallization, cAMP complex crystals of PDE10A GAF-B, which diffract to 3.0-Å resolution, were obtained. The bound cAMP might have originated from the E. coli extract and remained bound tightly to the protein. A crystal diffracting to 2.1-Å resolution was obtained when cAMP was added in the crystallization drop. The adenine base of cAMP is sandwiched between the aromatic ring of Phe304 and the aliphatic side chain of Val385 (Fig. 3B). The N1 forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Arg286, and the side chain of Arg286 is sandwiched between the aromatic ring of Tyr362 and the main chain of Ile306 (Fig. 3B). The N3 forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Asp357 and Thr360. The N6 forms hydrogen bonds to the main chains of Cys287 and Asp305. The O2′ forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Thr364, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the main chains of Asn353 and Asp357. The oxygen atoms of the phosphate group form hydrogen bonds to the main chains of Ile330, Ala331, and Asn353, and to the side chain of Gln383 (Fig. 3B). Comparison with Structures of Other cNMP-binding GAF Domains—Two crystal structures of GAF domains bound to a cNMP have been reported previously: the tandem GAF domains of PDE2A complexed with cGMP (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the tandem GAF domains of cyaB2 cyclase complexed with cAMP (12Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In PDE2A, the GAF-A domain is involved in dimerization, and the GAF-B domain binds cGMP (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In cyaB2, both the GAF-A and GAF-B domains are involved in dimerization and cAMP binding (12Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The superposition of the PDE10A GAF-B domain over the GAF-A and GAF-B domains of PDE2A yielded root mean square deviation values of 2.9 and 4.4 Å for 149 and 156 Cα atoms, respectively. The superposition over the GAF-A and the GAF-B domains of cyaB2 yielded root mean square deviation values of 3.5 and 3.1 Å for 154 and 157 Cα atoms, respectively. The main difference in the conformation exists in the helical bundle, whereas the conformations of the β sheet and the three short helices are similar. The PDE10A GAF-B domain also contains the conserved NNKFDE motif, which is reportedly essential for nucleotide binding (11Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The conformation and the mutual interaction network of the motif are similar to those in PDE2A and cyaB2 (data not shown). The PDE10A GAF-B domain dimer and the PDE2A GAF-A domain dimer are parallel, whereas the cyaB2 dimer is antiparallel. Although the homodimer interaction mainly occurs at the helical bundle in both the PDE10A GAF-B and PDE2A GAF-A domains (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the dimer interaction mode is completely different. The PDE10A GAF-B domain homodimer interaction is asymmetric, whereas the PDE2A GAF-A domain homodimer interaction is symmetric. The buried area of the PDE10A GAF-B domain is much broader than that of the GAF-A domain of PDE2A (3,061 and 1,338 Å2, respectively). In addition, the connecting helix between the GAF-A and GAF-B domains of PDE2A is also critically involved in the homodimer interaction, which buries 1,476 Å2, and the PDE2A GAF-B domain is not involved in dimerization (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The interaction of the cyaB2 antiparallel dimer mainly occurs through the connecting helices, the two N-terminal helices of GAF-A, and the one C-terminal helix of GAF-B (12Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In PDE5, homodimerization occurs between the GAF-A domains and the GAF-B domains, and the connecting region between the GAF domains also contributes to the stability (42Zoraghi R. Bessay E.P. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12051-12063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 43Kameni Tcheudji J.F. Lebeau L. Virmaux N. Maftei C.G. Cote R.H. Lugnier C. Schultz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In retinal rod PDE6, the catalytic core is a heterodimer formed by the α and β subunits (43Kameni Tcheudji J.F. Lebeau L. Virmaux N. Maftei C.G. Cote R.H. Lugnier C. Schultz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the GAF-A domains of PDE6α and PDE6β determine the specificity of dimerization (44Muradov K.G. Boyd K.K. Martinez S.E. Beavo J.A. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues corresponding to the helical bundle in the GAF domains of the PDE family proteins are weakly conserved (Fig. 2). It seems that the dimer interaction mode differs among the PDE GAF domains, although the helical bundle is the main interacting portion in all of the PDE GAF domains studied thus far. cNMP Recognition by GAF Domains—All of the bound cNMPs in the GAF domains of PDE10A, PDE2A, and cyaB2 have an anti conformation and a C3′-endo ribose. The recognition manner of the sugar and phosphate group of cNMP is similar among the three crystal structures (Fig. 4A). The O2′ forms a hydrogen bond to the strictly conserved Thr residue (Fig. 4A, indicated in sky blue). In contrast, the corresponding residues of the non-cNMP-binding GAF domains of the PDE families are all aliphatic residues (Fig. 2). Therefore, this Thr residue may be one of the major determinants of the cNMP binding of the GAF domains (12Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the cases of PDE10A and cyaB2 cyclase, the phosphodiester ring is in the chair conformation, and the phosphate group forms two hydrogen bonds to the backbone amides of the Ile/Phe-Ala sequence in the α3 helix, and a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Gln (Fig. 4A, indicated in green). In the PDE2A GAF-B domain, although Ile458, Ala459, and Glu512, corresponding to Ile330, Ala331, and Gln383 in PDE10A, respectively, are at similar positions to those of PDE10A, the phosphodiester ring of the bound cGMP is in the boat conformation (7Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The cNMP is sandwiched between the side chains of Val/Leu and Phe/Ile on one side and the side chain of Val/Ile on the other (Fig. 4A, indicated in orange), except for the GAF-A domain of cyaB2. These residues are highly conserved among the GAF domains of the PDE families (Fig. 2). The N3 of cAMP or cGMP is recognized through water-mediated hydrogen bonds by the side chains of the conserved Thr/Asn and Asp residues in the α4 helix (Fig. 4A, indicated in pink). The GAF domains specifically recognize the 1 and 6 key positions of the purine ring in different manners. In PDE10A, the side chain of Arg286 forms a hydrogen bond to the N1 of cAMP (Figs. 3B and 4B). These interactions are similar to those of the cyaB2 complex, where the side chain of Arg103/Arg291, equivalent to Arg286 in PDE10A, forms a hydrogen bond to the N1. In contrast, the side chain of Asp439 forms a hydrogen bond to the N1 in PDE2A (Fig. 4B). The remarkable difference in cAMP recognition is the N6 recognition. The main chain carbonyl of Cys287 forms a hydrogen bond to the N6 in PDE10A (Fig. 4B). In cyaB2, the side chain of Thr105/Thr293, just after the corresponding residues of Cys287 in PDE10A, hydrogen bonds with the N6 and N7 of cAMP (Fig. 4B). In PDE2A, the side chain of the corresponding Ser424, at the same position as Thr105/Thr293 in cyaB2, also hydrogen bonds with the N7 of cGMP (Fig. 4B). The residue equivalent to these residues in the PDE10A GAF-B domain is Ala288. The N6 atom is also recognized by the PDE10A GAF-B domain and the cyaB2 GAF-A domain through hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygens of Asp305 and Ala122, respectively (Fig. 4B). The corresponding residue in PDE2A is Asp439, which forms hydrogen bonds to the O6 and the N1 through the main chain amide and the side chain, respectively, and contributes to the cGMP-specific recognition (Fig. 4B). Whereas Asp439 in PDE2A is at the β2-β3 turn, Asp305 in PDE10A is within the β2 strand (Fig. 2). The backbone directions of these Asp residues are completely different between the two structures (Fig. 4B). The side chain of Asp305 in PDE10A hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide of Gly307 (Fig. 3B). This interaction fixes the conformation of Asp305, and may contribute to the base recognition. Tight and Specific Interaction with cAMP—The expression of PDE10A is restricted to the brain and testis, and high levels of expression are only found in the GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the striatum (13Fujishige K.

In Huntington disease transgenic mice, PDE10A mRNA and protein levels decrease in the striatum prior to motor symptom development (45Hebb A.L. Robertson H.A. Denovan-Wright E.M. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Experiments using a chimeric construct of the PDE10A GAF domain and the cyanobacterial cyaB1 adenylyl cyclase suggested that the PDE10A GAF-B domain weakly binds cAMP (11Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To the contrary, we found that cAMP is bound tightly and specifically in the binding pocket of the PDE10A GAF-B domain in the crystal. The weak binding estimated by the experiments might be due to the pre-bound cAMP, which is bound during protein preparation. It has also been suggested by the experiments using a chimeric construct that cAMP binding stimulates the catalytic activity of PDE10A, like PDE2A and PDE5 (11Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The best crystals were obtained only when cAMP was added in the protein solution, suggesting that the cAMP-binding pocket of the purified PDE10A GAF-B domain sample was not fully occupied at low cAMP concentrations. In addition, Na+ inhibits the activity of the cyaB1 and cyaB2 adenylyl cyclases by binding to GAF domains at less than 1 μm cAMP, and this regulation is conserved in mammalian GAF domains specific to cGMP (46Cann M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Allosteric regulation of PDE10A may occur at relatively low cAMP concentrations. The tight and specific binding of cAMP to the PDE10A GAF domain may be important to critically control the basal ganglia circuit of the mammalian brain. PDE10A inhibitors may have the potential to treat schizophrenia and Parkinson disease (21Siuciak J.A. Chapin D.S. Harms J.F. Lebel L.A. McCarthy S.A. Chambers L. Shrikhande A. Wong S. Menniti F.S.

Although the targets of structure-based drug design are usually the catalytic sites, the regulatory GAF-B domain of PDE10A is also an attractive target.

https://openalex.org/W2000139434,"RhoA is known to be involved in myogenic differentiation, but whether it acts as a positive or negative regulator is controversial. To resolve this issue, we investigated the differentiation stage-specific roles of RhoA and its effector, Rho-associated kinase, using C2C12 myoblasts. We found that proliferating myoblasts show high levels of RhoA and serum-response factor activities and strong expression of the downstream target of RhoA, myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A or MAL); these activities and expression are markedly lower in differentiating myocytes. We further demonstrated that, in proliferating myoblasts, an increase in MRTF-A, which forms a complex with Smad1/4, strikingly activates the expression level of the Id3 gene; the Id3 gene product is a potent inhibitor of myogenic differentiation. Finally, we found that during differentiation, one of the forkhead transcription factors translocates into the nucleus and suppresses Id3 expression by preventing the association of the MRTF-A-Smad complex with the Id3 promoter, which leads to the enhancement of myogenic differentiation. We conclude that RhoA/Rho-associated kinase signaling plays positive and negative roles in myogenic differentiation, mediated by MRTF-A/Smad-dependent transcription of the Id3 gene in a differentiation stage-specific manner. RhoA is known to be involved in myogenic differentiation, but whether it acts as a positive or negative regulator is controversial. To resolve this issue, we investigated the differentiation stage-specific roles of RhoA and its effector, Rho-associated kinase, using C2C12 myoblasts.

Myogenic differentiation involves a sequence of processes as follows: withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, expression of myogenic differentiation markers in myocytes, and formation of multinucleated myotubes by myocyte fusion. These processes are controlled by the myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) 2The abbreviations used are: MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; MRTF-A, myocardin-related transcription factor; Id, inhibitor of DNA binding; FKHR, forkhead in human rhabdomyosarcoma; SRF, serum response factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain; SBE, Smad binding element; GM, growth medium; DM, differentiation medium; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; ca, constitutively active; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein. family and belong to basic helix-loop-helix proteins, consisting of MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (1Molkentin J.D.

The MRFs interact with ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix proteins such as E12/E47 (E proteins) via their helix-loop-helix motifs, and the basic domains of the dimerized proteins activate transcription by binding to a conserved DNA sequence known as the E-box in the promoter regions of target genes. A family of inhibitors of DNA binding (Id) (Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4), which has a helix-loop-helix domain but lacks the basic DNA-binding domain, counteracts the active MRF/E protein complexes by forming transcriptionally inactive complexes, consisting of either MRF/Id or E protein/Id (4Benezra R.

The Rho family GTPases are involved in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated cellular events, such as reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, microtubule dynamics, transcriptional regulation, and cell differentiation, including myogenic differentiation (7Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). The RhoA-dependent activation of serum response factor (SRF) is required for the expression of MyoD and skeletal (SK) α-actin. Thus, RhoA acts through SRF to positively regulate myogenic differentiation (8Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vandromme M. Tuil D. Lautredou N. Morris M. Soulez M. Kahn A. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Mol. Biol.

However, recent studies have revealed that the expression of constitutively active RhoA results in failed myotube formation, and the inactivation of one of the downstream effectors of RhoA, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), enhances myotube formation (12Castellani L. Salvati E. Alemà S. Falcone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15249-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Charrasse S. Comunale F. Grumbach Y. Poulat F. Blangy A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, apparently conflicting roles of RhoA signaling in myogenic differentiation have been reported. It is well documented that actin polymerization in response to RhoA signaling enhances SRF activity, as a consequence of the nuclear translocation of myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTF-A/B, also referred to as MAL1/2) (16Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). MRTF-A is reportedly involved in heart and smooth muscle gene expression (17Cen B. Selvaraj A. Prywes R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Pipes G.C. Creemers E.E. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the expression of dominant-negative forms of MRTF-A and MRTF-B (dn-MRTF-A and dn-MRTF-B), which inhibit SRF activation, generates abnormally thin muscle fibers in vivo (19Li S. Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Bassel-Duby R. Richardson J.A. Wiebel F.F. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41977-41987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying the contribution of the MRTFs to myogenic differentiation, however, remains unclear. One of the forkhead family transcription factors, FKHR (also named Foxo1), is required for myocyte fusion (15Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Bois P.R. Brochard V.F. Salin-Cantegrel A.V. Cleveland J.L. Grosveld G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7645-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because ROCK directly phosphorylates FKHR in myocytes, resulting in the export of FKHR from the nucleus, the inactivation of RhoA/ROCK signaling is prerequisite for the nuclear localization of FKHR and myocyte fusion (15Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In various other cell types, FKHR that is phosphorylated by Akt, but not by ROCK, is also exported from the nucleus, leading to the inhibition of FKHR-mediated transcription (23Birkenkamp K.U. Coffer P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 292-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the target partners of FKHR and its function in myogenic differentiation remain unknown, except for a Foxo1a-cyclic GMP-dependent kinase I interaction (22Bois P.R. Brochard V.F. Salin-Cantegrel A.V. Cleveland J.L. Grosveld G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7645-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the role of RhoA/ROCK signaling during myogenic differentiation using C2C12 cells and demonstrated that transcription of the Id3 gene is controlled by MRTF-A/Smad in an FKHR-dependent manner. In proliferating myoblasts, where RhoA activity and MRTF-A expression are relatively high, RhoA-triggered MRTF-A/Smad1/4 pre-dominantly activates transcription of the Id3 gene. Simultaneously, FKHR, possibly phosphorylated by ROCK, is retained in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in differentiating myocytes, where RhoA activity and MRTF-A expression are decreased, FKHR translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with MRTF-A/Smad1/4, causing the MRTF-A-Smad1/4 complex to dissociate from the Id3 promoter, and thereby suppressing the MRTF-A/Smad-dependent Id3 expression. Taken together, the results of this study uncover why there are conflicting views regarding the role of RhoA/ROCK signaling in myogenic differentiation; differentiation stage-specific RhoA/ROCK signaling and activities of its downstream transcription factors, MRTF-A and FKHR, regulate the Smad-dependent transcription of the Id3 gene. Reagents and Antibodies—Y-27632 was purchased from Cal-biochem. Tat-C3 was prepared according to a method described elsewhere (24Park J. Kim J.S. Jung K.C. Lee H.J. Kim J.I. Kim J. Lee J.Y. Park J.B. Choi S.Y. Mol. Cells. 2003; 16: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar). Commercially available antibodies were as follows: anti-FLAG (M2), anti-α-sarcomeric actin (5C5), and anti-α-tubulin (DM1A) antibodies (Sigma); anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (3F10) antibody (Roche Applied Science); anti-MyoD, anti-myogenin, anti-SRF, anti-Smad1/5/8, and anti-Id3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibody (MF20) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); anti-FKHR antibody (Cell Signaling); horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG (GE Healthcare); horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rat IgG (Rockland). Anti-MRTF-A and -MRTF-B antibodies were generated in rabbits using recombinant proteins consisting of amino acids 776-901 of human MRTF-A and amino acids 931-1061 of human MRTF-B as the epitopes. IgGs were affinity-purified from the antisera raised against MRTF-A and MRTF-B on their respective affinity columns and used in this study (25Morita T. Mayanagi T. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 3: 1027-1042Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—The cDNAs of mouse RhoA, Smad1, Smad4, MRTF-A, and FKHR were amplified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and inserted into a mammalian expression plasmid, pCS2+ or pcDNA3.1, with the indicated tags. Expression plasmids for the constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoA-V14) and pseudo-phosphorylated Smad1 (26Qin B.Y. Chacko B.M. Lam S.S. de Caestecker M.P. Correia J.J. Lin K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1303-1312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression plasmid for N-terminally deleted MRTF-A, which acts as a constitutively active form, was constructed as described previously (16Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the mouse Id3 gene, spanning from -2000 to +55, was isolated from the genome of C2C12 myoblasts using PCR and inserted into the pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega) (Id3 (-2000/+55)-Luc). Deletions and mutant derivatives from Id3 (-2000/+55)-Luc, as indicated, were constructed using the PCR-mediated method. The mutations in the Smad-binding element (SBE) were introduced into pGL3-Id3-Luc as follows: the mutant SBE was changed from GTCTG to ATGTA and from CAGAC to CGTGC. The tetracycline-regulated inducible expression plasmids for HA-tagged RhoA-V14 and FLAG-tagged constitutively active MRTF-A (ca-MRTF-A) were constructed in the pTRE-tight expression plasmid (Clontech). The 3×CArG-Luc, referred to as 3D.ALuc (27Copeland J.W. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which consists of three copies of c-fos serum-responsive element without the ternary complex factor binding element or the basal promoter region of the Xenopus actin gene (28Mohun T. Garrett N. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was constructed to assay the transcriptional activity of SRF. All these constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Cultures and Transfection—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (growth medium (GM)). To induce myogenic differentiation, the culture medium was shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum (differentiation medium (DM)) at the indicated times. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of the indicated expression plasmids into these cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants of C2C12 cells carrying the tetracycline-regulated inducible expression system of HA-RhoA-V14 and FLAG-ca-MRTF-A were isolated as follows. First, we selected C2C12 stable transfectants carrying the pTet-Off plasmid by geneticin. Second, we introduced the expression plasmid, pTER-HA-RhoA-V14 or pTRE-FLAG-ca-MRTF-A into stable C2C12-pTet-Off transfectants and isolated cells carrying both the pTet-Off plasmid and the respective expression plasmid (C2C12-HA-RhoA-V14 and C2C12-FLAG-ca-MRTF-A), by selection with hygromycin B. Promoter Assays—Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts cultured in GM were co-transfected with the indicated plasmid and pSV-β-gal (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed 2 days after changing the medium from GM to DM as follows. The cell extracts were prepared by passive lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase kit (Promega). The promoter activity was expressed in relative units normalized to the β-galactosidase activity in the cell extracts. These assays were done in triplicate and were performed independently at least three times. Immunocytochemistry—The cells were fixed with 4% formal-dehyde for 30 min, permeabilized, and blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with the anti-MHC antibody for 2 h followed by Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), with or without Hoechst 33258, for 2 h at room temperature. Fluorescence images were collected using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ), mounted on an Olympus IX-70 microscope with the appropriate filters, and MetaMorph software. GTP-bound RhoA Pulldown Assay—RhoA activity was determined by a GTP-bound RhoA pulldown assay using the Rho activation assay kit (Upstate Biotech), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were carried out using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotech), according to the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. DNAs isolated from the input chromatin fragments and those from chromatin fragments precipitated by the anti-MRTF-A antibody or control IgG were subjected to PCR using primers flanking the SBE motif in the mouse Id3 promoter (-531 to -316). These primer sequences were as follows: Id3 sense primer, CTCTGGTCACAAGATAATTCC; Id3 antisense primer, GCGCCCAAGTTCTCTGAG. Gel-shift Assay—A probe containing the SBE motif sequence of the Id3 promoter was amplified by PCR and end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by the Klenow fragment. The sequence of the sense strand of this probe was AATTCCTGACGCCAGTGAGTCTGGAGGTCAGACGAGCAGCAAATTGGGGA. The gel-shift assay was carried out using whole-cell extracts from C2C12 myoblasts (29Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 582-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—The total RNAs were extracted from C2C12 cells cultured under the indicated conditions, and the expression level of Id1, Id2, Id3, twist, myostatin, c-fos, and c-myc mRNAs was quantified by RT-PCR normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, as described previously (30Hayashi K. Nakamura S. Nishida W. Sobue K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9456-9470Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The specific primer sets were as follows: Id1 sense primer, TGGACGAGCAGCAGGTGAACG; Id1 antisense primer, GCACTGATCTCGCCGTTCAGG; Id2 sense primer, AGCCTTCAGTCCGGTGAGGTCC; Id2 antisense primer, TCAGATGCCTGCAAGGACACG; Id3 sense primer, TGCTACGAGGCGGTGTGCTG; Id3 antisense primer, AGTGAGCTCAGCTGTCTGGATCGG; twist sense primer, CCTCGGACAAGCTGAGCAAGAT; twist antisense primer, CTAGTGGGACGCGGACATGGA; myostatin sense primer, ACGCTACCACGGAAACAATC; myostatin antisense primer, TGGTCCTGGGAAGGTTACAG; c-fos sense primer, GGATTTGACTGGAGGTCTGC; c-fos antisense primer, AAGTAGTGCAGCCCGGAGTA; c-myc sense primer, CAGCAGAGCGAGCTGCAGC; c-myc antisense primer, TCTTTGCGCGCAGCCTGGTA; HA-RhoA-V14 sense primer, TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGAT; HA-RhoA-V14 antisense primer, CTAAACTATCAGGGCTGTCG; GAPDH sense primer, TCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGG; GAPDH antisense primer, GAAGGCCATGCCAGTGAG. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—The expression of Id3 mRNA in C2C12 cells was analyzed by real time RT-PCR using SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). The levels of Id3 mRNA were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. The primers used in these analyses are as follows: Id3 sense primer, TCCTGGCACCTCCCGAAC; Id3 antisense primer, TAAGTGAAGAGGGCTGGGTTAAG; GAPDH sense primer, CGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAAC; GAPDH antisense primer, TGGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCG. Knockdown Using siRNA—Proliferating C2C12 cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and were cultured in GM for 2 days. The siRNAs against Id3 were purchased from Sigma, and their sequences were as follows: Id3 siRNA1, 5′-GCAUGGAUGAGCUUCGAUCTT-3′; Id3 siRNA2, 5′-CUGGUCAGCAGCUGGGCAATT-3′. In control experiments, scrambled siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Cellular Fractionation—The whole-cell extracts were prepared from C2C12 and HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids by lysis in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), and sonication with a Digital Sonifier (Branson). The extracts thus obtained were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. The target proteins were detected with a SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). In immunoblotting analysis of the Id3 protein, we used Can Get Signal (TOYOBO) to detect chemifluorescent signals. The cytosol and nuclear fractions were prepared as described elsewhere (15Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DNA Affinity Binding Assay—The proteins translated by in vitro transcription/translation systems (Promega) were incubated with a double-stranded biotinylated DNA probe (1 mg) in gel-shift binding buffer (29Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 582-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) containing 5 mg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mg of herring sperm DNA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min on ice (31Suzuki T. Fujisawa J.I. Toita M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 15: 610-614Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Streptavidin M-280 Dynabeads (Dynal) were then added, and the mixture was further incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The DNA-bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The sequence of the sense strand of this probe was as follows: AATTCCTGACGCCAGTGAGTCTGGAGGTCAGACGAGCAGCAAATTGGGGA. RhoA/ROCK Signaling Orchestrates Myogenic Differentiation in a Stage-specific Manner—As described in the Introduction, conflicting roles of RhoA signaling in myogenic differentiation have been reported. We hypothesized that RhoA signaling may be differentially involved in myogenic differentiation in a stage-specific manner. To test our hypothesis, we studied the effects of RhoA on myogenic phenotypes at both the proliferating and differentiating stages (Fig. 1A). First, we analyzed the roles of RhoA and ROCK in myogenic differentiation using the cell-permeable Rho-specific inhibitor, tat-C3, and the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of the proliferating myoblasts with tat-C3 or Y-27632 suppressed the formation of myotubes after myogenic differentiation was induced, as determined by monitoring the expression of MHC and myotube formation. In contrast, when these treatments were given after the cells had started differentiating (treatment during the last 2 days in DM), MHC-positive myotube formation was markedly enhanced. In accordance with previous studies (12Castellani L. Salvati E. Alemà S. Falcone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15249-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), treatment with Y-27632 during the entire differentiation period (all 4 days in DM) also enhanced myogenic differentiation (data not shown). We performed the additional experiments using Y-27632, because its effect on myotube formation was greater than that of tat-C3 (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the morphological changes it caused, treatment with Y-27632 during differentiation enhanced the expression levels of myogenic markers, such as myogenin, SK α-actin, and MHC proteins, whereas these enhancements were not observed when the Y-27632 treatment was given during proliferation (Fig. 1C). MyoD expression in the Y-27632-treated proliferating myoblasts was down-regulated compared with that in control cells. To verify whether RhoA signaling regulates myogenic differentiation, we isolated stable C2C12 cell lines carrying a tetracycline-inducible expression system for constitutively active RhoA, RhoA-V14. The induction of RhoA-V14 expression during differentiation strikingly inhibited myotube formation (Fig. 1D) and the expression of SK α-actin and MHC, but it did not affect myogenin expression (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that RhoA/ROCK signaling in proliferating myoblasts is prerequisite for maintaining the capacity of myogenic differentiation, which features the up-regulation of MyoD expression, but RhoA/ROCK signaling suppresses differentiation in differentiating myocytes. RhoA and SRF Activities and MRTF-A Expression Are Down-regulated during Myogenic Differentiation—We next examined the endogenous activities of RhoA and its downstream molecules during myogenic differentiation. Consistent with a previous study (15Nishiyama T. Kii I. Kudo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47311-47319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we found the RhoA activity was decreased during differentiation (Fig. 2A). The activity of SRF, which is a well characterized downstream target of RhoA, rapidly decreased in association with the RhoA activity (Fig. 2B). The expression level of an SRF cofactor, MRTF-A, also decreased after the induction of myogenic differentiation, although the levels of SRF and another cofactor, MRTF-B, remained unchanged (Fig. 2C). Thus, the strong activation of RhoA and SRF and of MRTF-A expression in proliferating myoblasts and their down-regulation in differentiating myocytes is adapted to effect the appropriate myogenic processes. Inactivation of ROCK Results in the Down-regulation of Id3 Expression—To study the mechanism underlying the enhanced myogenic differentiation caused by Y-27632 (Fig. 1), we analyzed the expressional changes of factors that are known to be inhibitory for myogenic differentiation, such as Ids1-3 (4Benezra R.

The Id3 mRNA, but not the mRNA for twist, myostatin, c-fos, or c-myc, was further down-regulated in response to Y-27632 treatment. These results suggest that the Y-27632 treatment-induced enhancement of myogenic differentiation might have been due to the down-regulation of Id3 expression. To confirm the specific inhibition of ROCK by Y-27632, siRNA-mediated ROCK1 and ROCK2 knockdown was carried out. The expression of Id3 was decreased by knockdown of ROCK in proliferating myoblasts (data not shown). Furthermore, we addressed a role of RhoA, upstream effector of ROCK, in the transcription of Id3 gene. The induction of RhoA-V14 increased the expression of Id3 in tetracycline-regulated C2C12 cells (Fig. 3B). Both analyses by semi-quantitative and real time RT-PCR revealed that the up-regulation of Id3 expression is modest in proliferating myoblasts but is marked in differentiating myocytes. These results indicated that the transcription of Id3 gene is up-regulated by RhoA/ROCK1 signaling but is not regulated by the pathway mediated through ROCK2. Forced Activation of MRTF-A in Differentiating Myocytes Inhibits Myogenic Differentiation via the Induction of Id3 Expression—Because the expression of MRTF-A was reduced in differentiating myocytes compared with its high levels in proliferating myoblasts (Fig. 2C), we focused on downstream events in the RhoA/MRTF-A pathway. To examine the effect of MRTF-A on differentiating myocytes, we isolated stable C2C12 cell lines carrying a tetracycline-inducible expression system for constitutively active MRTF-A (ca-MRTF-A). Using these cell lines, we found that the induction of ca-MRTF-A after the start of differentiation markedly suppressed myotube formation (Fig. 4A) as well as the expression of myogenic differentiation markers, including myogenin, SK α-actin, and MHC (Fig. 4B). We also analyzed the expression levels of factors that are inhibitory for myogenic differentiation. Id3 expression was solely up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA levels in myocytes expressing ca-MRTF-A during differentiation, but the other inhibitory fact"

Results of present studies demonstrate that Hsf-1 causes specific and saturable inhibition of the transport activity of Ralbp1 and that the combination of Hsf-1 and POB1 causes nearly complete inhibition through specific bindings with Ralbp1. Augmentation of cellular levels of Hsf-1 and POB1 caused dramatic apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cell line H358 through Ralbp1 inhibition.

We proposed that just as POB1 could function as an inhibitor of the transport activity of Ralbp1, Hsf-1 could also function as a transport inhibitor. This model predicts that under heat stress, dissociation of Hsf-1 from Ralbp1 would release inhibition on the efflux of the proapoptotic glutathione conjugates of lipid peroxidation products generated as an unavoidable consequence of heat shock or other stress. We have addressed this prediction in H358 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (NSCLC) by examining the effect of Hsf-1 and POB1 on the transport of and cellular accumulation and efflux of DOX and on apoptosis. POB1 and Hsf-1 were found to inhibit Ralbp1 at independent binding sites and together almost completely abrogated its transport and anti-apoptotic activities. The results suggest a novel framework for viewing the chief regulatory mechanisms of the heat shock and stress response pathways. Materials—The human full-length Hsf-1 cDNA was a gift of Dr. Nahid F.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate. Cloning, Prokaryotic Expression, and Purification of His-tagged Hsf-1—The human full-length Hsf-1 cDNA was a gift of Dr. Nahid F. Mivechi. The cDNA of Hsf-1 was used as a template for PCR amplification of the Hsf-1 coding sequence. The upstream (5′-GGCGGTACCATGGAAGATTATACCAAAATAGAG-3′) and downstream (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTACATCTTCTTAATCTGATTGTC) primers were designed to introduce a KpnI restriction site (underlined) immediately upstream of the initiator codon and XhoI site (underlined) immediately downstream of the stop codon of the Hsf-1 open reading frame. The PCR amplification was performed under the following incubation conditions: DNA template, 500 ng; primers, 30 pmol each; dNTPs, 2.5 μm; thermopol buffer, 1×; bovine serum albumin, 1×; Vent polymerase 2.5 units. PCR cycles were at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 1 min at 72 °C and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product purified by using the Qiagen PCR purification kit was digested with KpnI/XhoI restriction enzymes. The cleaved PCR products were ligated into pET30a(+) previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ligated products were expressed into the DH5α-competent cells, and plasmid DNA was purified from the overnight culture of single colony using the Qiagen DNA purification kit. Techniques for restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, transformation, and other standard molecular biology manipulations were based on methods described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Miniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 17.3-17.9. Cold Spring Harbor University, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequence of Hsf-1 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Following verification of the sequence, the pET30a(+) plasmid containing the full-length Hsf-1 was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) grown at 37 °C after induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterially expressed human Hsf-1 was purified by metal affinity chromatography over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) with slight modifications, as described below. E. coli BL21(DE3) expressing Hsf-1 was lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 250 mm NaCl, 100 μm PMSF, and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, sonicated, and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin preequilibrated with the same buffer. The resin was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking and washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) until A280 was zero. The bound protein from the resin was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) and was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μm EDTA, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Prokaryotic Expression and Purification of POB1 and POB1-(1-512)—The 2200-bp full-length long version cDNA of POB1 was a gift from Prof. Leen J. Blok (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The bacterially expressed His-tagged POB1 and truncated mutant POB1-(1-512) (encoding aa 1-512) proteins were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (19Yadav S. Zajac E. Singhal S.S.

The final protein concentration in the liposome reconstitution mixture was 50 μg/ml. Liposome formation was initiated by the addition of SM2 Biobeads (200 mg/ml). We have shown that vesiculation is complete within 4 h and yields primarily unilammelar vesicles with a median diameter of 0.25 μm and intravesicular/extravesicular volume ratio of 18 μl/ml (8Awasthi S.

The liposomes reconstituted with purified recombinant Hsf-1, POB1, and Ralbp1 proteoliposomes were used for delivery of these proteins to cells in culture. Efficiency of delivery for Ralbp1 and POB1 proteoliposomes has been established previously (8Awasthi S. Cheng J. Singhal S.S. Saini M.K. Pandya U. Pikula S. Pikula J. Singh S.V. Zimniak P.

Transport Activity of Ralbp1 and Inhibition by Hsf-1 or POB1—In addition to being used to deliver Ralbp1 to cells, Ralbp1 liposomes were used in isolated cell-free systems to measure the transport activity of Ralbp1 toward model radiolabeled substrates, including 14C-DOX, [3H]DNP-SG, [3H]LTC4, and [3H]COL. The ATP-dependent specific uptake of each of these compounds was quantified as described previously (8Awasthi S. Cheng J. Singhal S.S. Saini M.K. Pandya U. Pikula S. Pikula J. Singh S.V. Zimniak P.

Uptake was measured in parallel in Ralbp1 proteoliposomes and control liposomes (prepared in the absence of protein) in the absence or presence of 4 mm ATP at a fixed time point of 5 min at 37 °C. In the transport reaction, the final concentration of Ralbp1 protein (in the form of Ralbp1 liposome) was 8.3 μg/ml. We have demonstrated previously that this method estimates the initial velocity of ATP-dependent transport (8Awasthi S. Cheng J. Singhal S.S. Saini M.K. Pandya U. Pikula S. Pikula J. Singh S.V.

Background drug binding to the 0.45-μm membrane in the filtration manifold was adjusted, and ATP-dependent uptake was calculated by subtracting out uptake in the proteoliposomes in the absence of ATP. To study the effect of purified Hsf-1 or POB1 protein on transport activity of Ralbp1, purified Hsf-1 or POB1 protein (without reconstitution in proteoliposomes) was added to the transport reaction mixture containing Ralbp1 proteoliposomes or control liposomes. The concentration of POB1 or Hsf-1 in the transport reaction mixture ranged from 0 to 13.3 μg/ml. In the controls for inhibition studies, Hsf-1 or POB1 protein was replaced with an equal amount of bovine serum albumin. Inhibition of Transport of 14C-DOX, [3H]COL, [3H]DNP-SG, and [3H]LTC4 by POB1—Crude membrane inside-out vesicles (IOVs) were prepared from Ralbp1+/+, Ralbp1+/-, and Ralbp1-/- MEFs using established procedures as described by us for the human erythrocytes (25Awasthi S. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Zimniak P. Bajpai K.K. Saxena M. Sharma R. Ziller S.A. Frenkel E.P. Singh S.V. Awasthi Y.C. J. Clin.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9327-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For these experiments, a fixed amount of IOV protein (20 μg/30 μl) was reconstituted in proteoliposomes along with varying amounts (0-300 ng/30 μl) of either purified reconstituted POB1 or its deletion mutant (POB1-(1-512)), and the transport rates of 14C-DOX, [3H]COL, [3H]DN-PSG, and [3H]LTC4 were measured as described above. In one control, POB1 proteins (full-length POB1 or its deletion mutant) were excluded, whereas in another control, an equivalent amount of heat-inactivated respective protein was reconstituted in proteoliposomes. Each determination was performed in triplicate. Effect of Full-length Hsf-1 and POB1 on Apoptosis by TUNEL Assay—In these studies, we assessed whether cellular levels of Hsf-1 and POB1 could be augmented by proteoliposome-mediated delivery to cultured lung cancer cells and assessed whether uptake is correlated with apoptosis by the TUNEL assay. The H358 non-small cell lung cancer cells (1 × 106 cells) were grown on the coverslips. The cells were treated with equal amounts of liposomes reconstituted with 40 μg/ml (final concentration) recombinant POB1-(1-512), POB1, Hsf-1, and POB1 plus Hsf-1 protein. After a 24-h incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS four times. A TUNEL assay was performed using the Promega fluorescence detection kit. Briefly, cells were fixed by immersing slides in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by washing with PBS. The cells were permeabilized by immersing the slides in 0.2% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 5 min followed by washing with PBS. Cells were equilibrated with equilibration buffer (provided by Promega) for 10 min. The equilibrated areas were blotted with tissue paper, and TdT incubation buffer was added to the cells and placed in the humidified chamber. The chamber was covered with aluminum foil to protect from direct light. Slides were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and the reaction was terminated by immersing the slides in 2× SSC buffer for 15 min followed by washing with PBS. The slides were stained in propidium iodide solution for 10 min in the dark and washed with distilled water several times. Slides were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope using a standard fluorescein filter set to view the green fluorescence at 520 nm and red fluorescence of propidium iodide at >620 nm. Fluorescence micrographs were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 META (Germany) laser-scanning fluorescence microscope at ×400 magnification. Effects of Hsf-1 and POB1 Liposomes on 14C-DOX Accumulation in Lung Cancer Cell—H358 cells were harvested and washed with PBS, and aliquots containing 5 × 106 cells (in triplicate for each time point) were inoculated into fresh medium. After overnight incubation, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 80 μl of medium containing 4 μg of Hsf-1 or POB1 proteoliposomes or control liposomes and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, 20 μl of 14C-DOX (final concentration 3.6 μm, specific activity 8.5 × 104 cpm/nmol) was then added to the medium and incubated for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min at 37 °C. Drug uptake was stopped by rapid cooling on ice. Cells were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and medium was completely decanted. Radioactivity was determined in the cell pellet after washing twice with ice-cold PBS. 14C-DOX Efflux Studies—H358 cells were harvested and washed with PBS, and aliquots containing 5 × 106 cells (in triplicate) were inoculated into fresh medium. After overnight incubation, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 80 μl of medium containing 4 μg of either control, Hsf-1, or POB1 liposomes and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After a 24-h incubation, 20 μl of 14C-DOX (final concentration 3.6 μm, specific activity 8.5 × 104 cpm/nmol) was then added to the medium and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, after which the supernatant was removed completely, and the cell pellet was washed with PBS twice. The pellet was immediately resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Aliquots of 50 μl of clear supernatant were removed every minute for radioactivity counting for 15 min, and total radioactivity remaining in the transport reaction was quantified at the end of the experiment. The back-added curves of cellular residual VRL versus time were constructed as described previously (11Stuckler D. Singhal J. Singhal S.S. Yadav S. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 991-998PubMed Google Scholar). Drug Sensitivity Assay—Cell density during the log phase was determined by counting trypan blue-excluding cells in a hemocytometer, and 20,000 cells were plated into each well of 96-well flat bottomed microtiter plates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were treated with control liposomes or liposomes containing reconstituted Hsf-1 or POB1 (final concentration 40 μg/ml). DOX was added, and IC50 was measured by performing a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay 96 h later, as described previously (19Yadav S. Zajac E. Singhal S.S.

Colony-forming Assay—H358 cells (0.1 × 106 cells/500 μl) were incubated with control, POB1-(1-512), POB1, Hsf-1, and POB1 plus Hsf-1 liposomes (40 μg/ml final concentration for each liposome) for 24 h, and then aliquots of 50 and 100 μlin 60-mm Petri dishes, separately, in a total volume of 4 ml by adding medium. After 10 days, control and proteoliposome-treated cells were stained with methylene blue for 30 min, and colonies were counted using an Innotech Alpha Imager. Subcellular Fractionation—Differential fractionation was carried out according to Jia et al. (27Jia Z. Moulson C.L. Pei Z. Miner J.H. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20573-20583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All steps were performed at 4 °C with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose used as fractionation buffer throughout the procedure. About 1 × 109 H358 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and washed with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer and Dounce-homogenized at 250 rpm (30 s × 2). The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min to isolate nuclei in the pellet (fraction N). The supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min to isolate plasma membrane in the pellet (fraction PM). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min to isolate mitochondria in the pellet (fraction M). The supernatant was again centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 60 min to isolate microsomes"
https://openalex.org/W2007996183,"Although Wnt signaling has been shown to be important for embryonic morphogenesis and cancer pathogenesis of several tissues, its role in prostatic development and tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here we show that Wnt signaling regulated prostatic epithelial branching morphogenesis and luminal epithelial cell differentiation in developing rat prostate organ cultures. Specifically, Wnt signaling regulated the proliferation of prostate epithelial progenitor cells. Assessment of the expression levels of a Wnt pathway transcriptional target gene, Axin2, showed that the Wnt pathway was activated in the developing prostate, but was down-regulated in the adult. Castration resulted in an upregulation of Axin2 whereas androgen replacement resulted in a down regulation of Axin2. Such dynamic changes of Wnt activity was also confirmed in a BAT-gal transgenic mouse line in which β-galactosidase reporter is expressed under the control of β-catenin/T cell factor responsive elements. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of Wnt signaling in prostate tumorigenesis. Axin2 expression was found upregulated in the majority of human prostate cancer cell lines examined. Moreover, addition of a Wnt pathway inhibitor, Dickkopf 1 (DKK1), into the culture medium significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and migration. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling regulates prostatic epithelial ductal branching morphogenesis by influencing cell proliferation, and highlights a role for Wnt pathway activation in prostatic cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W1980059815,"Linear endocytic motifs of signaling receptors as well as their ubiquitination determine the rate of ligand-induced endocytosis that mediates down-regulation of these receptors and restricts the magnitude and duration of their respective signal transduction pathways. We previously hypothesized that, in the absence of its cognate ligand, type I interferon (IFN), the IFNalpha receptor chain 1 (IFNAR1) receptor chain is protected from basal endocytosis by a hypothetical masking complex that prevents the Tyr-based endocytic motif within IFNAR1 from interacting with components of the adaptin protein complex 2 (AP2). Here we identify a member of the Janus kinase (Jak) family, Tyk2, as a component of such a masking complex. In the absence of ligand or of receptor chain ubiquitination, binding of Janus kinase Tyk2 within the proximity of the Tyr-based linear motif of IFNAR1 is required to prevent IFNAR1 internalization and to maintain its cell surface expression. Furthermore, interaction experiments revealed that Tyk2 physically shields this Tyr-based motif from the recognition by the AP50 subunit of AP2. These data delineate a long-sought ligand- and ubiquitin-independent mechanism by which Tyk2 contributes to both the regulation of total IFNAR1 levels as well as the regulation of the cell surface density of this receptor chain."
https://openalex.org/W2087770180,"Cation-selective cysteine (Cys)-loop transmitter-gated ion channels provide an important pathway for Ca2+ entry into neurones. We examined the influence on Ca2+ permeation of amino acids located at intra- and extracellular ends of the conduction pathway of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT3A) receptor. Mutation of cytoplasmic arginine residues 432, 436, and 440 to glutamine, aspartate, and alanine (the aligned residues of the human 5-HT3B subunit (yielding 5-HT3A(QDA)) increased PCa/PCs from 1.4 to 3.7. The effect was attributable to the removal of an electrostatic influence of the Arg-436 residue. Despite its relatively high permeability to Ca2+, the single channel conductance of the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor was depressed in a concentration-dependent and voltage-independent manner by extracellular Ca2+. A conserved aspartate, located toward the extracellular end of the conduction pathway and known to influence ionic selectivity, contributed to the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on macroscopic currents mediated by 5-HT3A receptors. We introduced a D293A mutation into the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor (yielding the 5-HT3A(QDA D293A) construct) to determine whether the aspartate is required for the suppression of single channel conductance by Ca2+. The D293A mutation decreased the PCa/PCs ratio to 0.25 and reduced inwardly directed single channel conductance from 41 to 30 pS but did not prevent suppression of single channel conductance by Ca2+. The D293A mutation also reduced PCa/PCs when engineered into the wild-type 5-HT3A receptor. The data helped to identify key residues in the cytoplasmic domain (Arg-436) and extracellular vestibule (Asp-293) that markedly influence PCa/PCs and additionally directly demonstrated a depression of single channel conductance by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2067584330,"The ability of synapses to undergo changes in structure and function in response to alterations of neuronal activity is an essential property of neural circuits. One way that this is achieved is through global changes in the molecular composition of the synapse; however, it is not clear how these changes are coupled to the dynamics of neuronal activity. Here we found that, in cultured rat cortical neurons, bidirectional changes of neuronal activity led to corresponding alterations in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylation of its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), as well as in the level of synaptic proteins. Exogenous BDNF reversed changes in synaptic proteins induced by chronic activity blockade, while inhibiting Trk kinase activity or depleting endogenous BDNF abolished the concentration changes induced by chronic activity elevation. Both tetrodotoxin and bicuculline had significant, but opposite, effects on synaptic protein ubiquitination in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, exogenous BDNF was sufficient to increase ubiquitination of synaptic proteins, whereas scavenging endogenous BDNF or inhibiting Trk kinase activity prevented the ubiquitination of synaptic proteins induced by chronic elevation of neuronal activity. Inhibiting the proteasome or blocking protein polyubiquitination mimicked the effect of tetrodotoxin on the levels of synaptic proteins and canceled the effects of BDNF. Our study indicates that BDNF-TrkB signaling acts upstream of the ubiquitin proteasome system, linking neuronal activity to protein turnover at the synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2120854970,"At the southern entrance to East Asia, early population migration has affected most of the Y-chromosome variations of East Asians.To assess the isolated genetic structure of Hainan Island and the original genetic structure at the southern entrance, we studied the Y chromosome diversity of 405 Hainan Island aborigines from all the six populations, who have little influence of the recent mainland population relocations and admixtures. Here we report that haplogroups O1a* and O2a* are dominant among Hainan aborigines. In addition, the frequency of the mainland dominant haplogroup O3 is quite low among these aborigines, indicating that they have lived rather isolated. Clustering analyses suggests that the Hainan aborigines have been segregated since about 20 thousand years ago, after two dominant haplogroups entered East Asia (31 to 36 thousand years ago).Our results suggest that Hainan aborigines have been isolated at the entrance to East Asia for about 20 thousand years, whose distinctive genetic characteristics could be used as important controls in many population genetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2054240329,"Heat shock protein 27, one of the low molecular weight stress proteins, is recognized as a molecular chaperone; however, other functions have not yet been well established. Phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 levels inversely correlate with the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma. This study shows that phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 interferes with cell growth of the hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HuH7 cells in the presence of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α, via inhibition of the sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal pathway. The activities of Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and subsequent activator protein-1 transactivation and the induction levels of cyclin D1 were lower in HuH7 cells transfected with phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 than those with unphosphorylated heat shock protein 27. Moreover, phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 up-regulated the levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1, an inhibitory protein of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. These results indicate that phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 might suppress the extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells via two separate pathways in an inflammatory state. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity is inversely correlated with phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 at serine 15 and also in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues in vivo. Because the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal pathway is a major proliferation signal of hepatocellular carcinoma, activator protein-1 activation is an early event in hepatocarcinogenesis.

HSPs are classified into high molecular weight HSPs such as HSP70 and HSP90, and low molecular weight HSPs with molecular masses from 10 to 30 kDa based on their apparent molecular sizes. Low molecular weight HSPs have significant similarities in terms of amino acid sequences, known as the α-crystallin domain and WDPF motif (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 2Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The high molecular weight HSPs act as molecular chaperones in protein folding, oligomerization, and translocation (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Although the functions of low molecular weight HSPs are not as well characterized as those of the high molecular weight HSPs, it is recognized that they may have chaperone activities (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The functions of HSP27 are regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (3Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 4Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3058-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse HSP27 is phosphorylated at two sites (Ser-15 and Ser-82), whereas human HSP27 is phosphorylated at three sites (Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82) (3Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Ser-78 and Ser-82 of HSP27 are adjacent to the amino-terminal sequence of the α-crystallin domain, whereas Ser-15 is on the amino terminus of the WDPF motif. HSP27 can form oligomers up to 1000 kDa and interfere with cell death induced by several stimuli (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 5Beere H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The oligomerization is regulated by phosphorylation of Ser-78 and/or Ser-82 and the WDPF motif, although phosphorylation of Ser-15 is unrelated to oligomerization (2Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). HSP27 is reportedly phosphorylated through the following activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by the MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAP) 2 and 3 (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated HSP27 forms a dimer, and the chaperone function is diminished (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, the role of phosphorylated HSP27 has not yet been precisely elucidated. Proinflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), are involved in the pathophysiology of viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (6Wullaert A. van Loo G. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). TNFα plays a dichotomous role in the liver, where it not only acts as a mediator of cell death but also induces hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. HSP27 was reported to be able to suppress TNFα-induced apoptosis and enhance NF-κB activity via promotion of the proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB in a human leukemic cell line (7Parcellier A. Schmitt E. Gurbuxani S. Seigneurin-Berny D. Pance A. Chantôme A. Plenchette S. Khochbin S. Solary E. Garrido C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5790-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Otherwise, TNFα activates MAPK that enhances phosphorylation of HSP27 (8Haddad J.J. Land S.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 520-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated HSP27 inhibits IκB kinase (IKK) and reduces IκB degradation, thus resulting in the suppression of the NF-κB activation in HeLa cells (9Park K.J. Gaynor R.B. Kwak Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35272-35278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that the phosphorylation of HSP27 holds the key to the TNFα related liver diseases. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly arises in the liver with chronic inflammation and ranks fifth in frequency on a worldwide basis, thus causing more than 1 million deaths annually (10Kojima S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 797-805PubMed Google Scholar). The overall survival of patients with HCC even after resection is still unsatisfactory because of frequent recurrence. The recurrence rate at 5 years after the curative treatment may exceed 70% (10Kojima S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 797-805PubMed Google Scholar). This high recurrence rate is not because of local recurrence or metastasis from the original lesion but rather from second primary lesions (10Kojima S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 797-805PubMed Google Scholar). However, the most suitable prognostic factor that suggests patients with HCC are at high risk for early recurrence has not yet been identified. MAPKs are essential components of intracellular signal transduction and are activated by phosphorylation in response to various extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and environmental stress. Among the MAPK family, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a key molecule that transfers signals into the nuclei to induce proliferation and differentiation (11Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). In HCC, the ERK are activated, and they up-regulate cyclin D1 expression, which thus stimulates progression (12Ito Y. Sasaki Y. Horimoto M. Wada S. Tanaka Y. Kasahara A. Ueki T. Hirano T. Yamamoto H. Fujimoto J. Okamoto E. Hayashi N. Hori M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Conversely, p38 MAPK negatively regulates cyclin D1 and antagonizes the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun pathway to suppress HCC development (13Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Müller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 14Hui L. Bakiri L. Mairhorfer A. Schweifer N. Haslinger C. Kenner L. Komnenovic V. Scheuch H. Beug H. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the level of phosphorylated HSP27 in human HCC tissues inversely correlates with the tumor size and the TNM stage of HCC (15Yasuda E. Kumada T. Takai S. Ishisaki A. Noda T. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Yoshimi N. Kato K. Toyoda H. Kaneoka Y. Yamaguchi A. Kozawa O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, a proapoptotic, tumor-suppressive molecule protein kinase Cδ regulates HSP27 phosphorylation at a point upstream of p38 MAPK in the human HCC-derived cell line, HuH7 cells (16Takai S. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Tokuda H. Yasuda E. Toyoda H. Kaneoka Y. Yamaguchi A. Kumada T. Kozawa O. Life Sci. 2007; 81: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the exact role and regulatory mechanism of HSP27 in human HCC remain to be clarified. This study aimed to clarify the role of phosphorylated HSP27 in HCC and to analyze the proliferation of the HCC cells transfected with unphosphorylatable or phospho-mimic mutants of human HSP27. The results showed that phosphorylated HSP27 repressed the HCC cell proliferation in the presence of proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα, via inhibition of the Raf-ERK kinase (MEK)-ERK signaling pathway and the activation of p38 MAPK-MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) pathway.

Schäfer (Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany). For mutant HSP27 vectors, the cDNA of HSP27 had been mutated at serine residues 15, 78, and 82 to aspartate (3D) to imitate the phosphorylated HSP27 form or mutated at the same residues to alanine (3A) to prevent phosphorylation of HSP27 (17Kubisch C.

Phosphorylated HSP27 (Ser-82) antibodies were obtained form Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibodies and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Sigma, respectively. Caspase 9 antibodies, ERK (p44/p42 MAPK) antibodies, phospho-ERK antibodies, MEK antibodies, phospho-MEK antibodies, phospho-c-Raf antibodies, cyclin D1 antibodies, p38 MAPK antibodies, phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies, and phospho-MKP-1 (Ser-359) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.

Caspase-9 inhibitor I (benzyloxycarbonyl-LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone), a cell-permeable and irreversible inhibitor of caspase 9, was purchased from Merck. Cell Culture and Stable Transfections—Human HCC-derived HuH7 cells, which originated from well differentiated HCC tissues, were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. HuH7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. For stable transfections, 4 × 105 HuH7 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes and then transfected with 2 μg of the WT or mutant HSP27 plasmids that expresses geneticin (G418) resistance using 12 μl of UniFECTOR transfection reagent (B-Bridge International, Mountain View, CA) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum per well. One ml/well medium with 10% fetal calf serum was added 5 h after transfection. The cells were subcultured and grown in the presence of 1 mg/ml of G418 (EMD Chemicals, Inc., San Diego) 2 days later. After about 2 weeks, single G418-resistant colonies were obtained by serial dilution in 96-well dishes. The colonies then were maintained and analyzed individually for the expression of HSP27s. Cell Growth Assay—Empty vector-transfected, WT, or mutant HSP27s stably expressing HuH7 cells were plated on 96-well dishes (1 × 103 cells/well). Twenty four h after seeding, the cells were treated with or without 1 nm TNFα for the indicated time, and cell numbers were counted using the trypan blue dye exclusion method or using WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To investigate the influence of caspase 9 on the cell growth, WT, or the 3D HSP27, stably expressed HuH7 cells were treated with caspase-9 inhibitor I simultaneously with or without 1 nm TNFα for 6 days. Western Blotting—The cultured cells, which overexpressed WT or mutant HSP27s, were stimulated with or without TNFα for the indicated time. The cells or the snap-frozen human HCC samples were lysed, homogenized, and sonicated in lysis buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. A Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Takai S. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Tokuda H. Yasuda E. Toyoda H. Kaneoka Y. Yamaguchi A. Kumada T. Kozawa O. Life Sci. 2007; 81: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Noda T. Kumada T. Takai S. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Yoshimi N. Yasuda E. Kato K. Toyoda H. Kaneoka Y. Yamaguchi A. Kozawa O. Oncol. Rep. 2007; 17: 1309-1314PubMed Google Scholar). Band intensities were visualized on x-ray film with the ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). The protein band intensities were determined by integrating the optical density over the band area (band volume) using NIH image software. The samples from the cell cultures to be quantitatively compared by Western blots were run in the same gel. Values represent the amount of phospho-ERK or phospho-MEK divided by those of total ERK or total MEK, respectively. The values represent the amount of full-length and cleaved caspase 9, phospho-c-Raf, cyclin D1, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-MKP-1 divided by those of GAPDH. To quantify the protein from the HCC tissue extracts, 0.25 μl of MagicMark XP Western protein standard (Invitrogen), the marker protein, was run in every gel. Based on the intensity of the marker protein band on x-ray film, the proteins of the tissue samples were quantitatively compared. After being normalized by the intensity of the marker protein, values represent the amount of phospho- and total HSP27s or phospho-ERK divided by those of β-actin or total-ERK, respectively. The data of the normalized values of the protein bands were statistically analyzed as described under “Statistics.” Luciferase Reporter Assay—A reporter plasmid, activator protein-1 (AP-1)-Luc was kindly provided by Dr. S. Kojima (RIKEN, Wako, Japan). The cells were stimulated with or without 1 nm TNFα for 48 h before transfection. At 5 h after transfection, another 24 h of stimulation of TNFα was performed. Transient transfection with the AP-1-Luc reporter (1 μg/35-mm dish) and measurement of luciferase activity of cell lysates were performed using UniFECTOR transfection reagent and a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as described previously (20Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Okuno M. Adachi S. Sano T. Akita K. Moriwaki H. Friedman S.L. Kojima S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7675-7682PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected with pRL-CMV (Renilla luciferase; 100 ng/35-mm dish) as an internal standard to normalize transfection efficiency. To examine the involvement of MEK-ERK system in AP-1-mediated transactivation activity within the 3D HSP27 mutant overexpressed cells, active MEK1 was cotransfected with the reporter plasmid. Tissue Specimens—HCC tissues were obtained by surgical resection from 44 patients infected with hepatitis viruses B (10 cases) or C (31 cases) and 3 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the Department of Surgery, Ogaki Municipal Hospital. No patient had previously undergone chemotherapy. The resected tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C until used for the Western blot analysis. The resected HCC specimens were obtained according to protocol approved by the Committee for the Conduct of Human Research at Ogaki Municipal Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Statistics—Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical significance of the data from the cell cultures was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's test, and the patient clinical data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). All p values were derived from two-tailed tests, and p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. A Pearson correlation coefficient of |r| > 0.400 was accepted as a positive correlation. Expression of HSP27 in Wild-type, Unphosphorylated Type, or Phospho-mimic Type HSP27-transfected HuH7 Cells—To investigate the effect of phosphorylated HSP27 on HCC cell growth, human HCC-derived HuH7 cells were stably transfected with cDNAs of mutant HSP27s with alanine 15, alanine 78, and alanine 82 (3A) that mimicked the unphosphorylated type or with aspartate 15, aspartate 78, and aspartate 82 (3D) that mimicked the phosphorylated type. For comparison purposes, HuH7 cells were also transfected with wild-type (WT) HSP27 cDNA or an empty pcDNA3.1 vector (empty). A Western blot analysis demonstrated that HSP27 was overexpressing in WT, 3A, or 3D HSP27 cDNA-transfected HuH7 cells (Fig. 1). The empty vector-transfected cells only expressed intact HSP27 proteins. Anti-phospho-Ser-15 HSP27 antibodies and anti-phospho-Ser-82 HSP27 antibodies reacted with the HSP27 protein that was overexpressed in both WT and 3D HSP27 vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated HSP27 protein level in WT HSP27 cDNA-transfected HuH7 cells was almost the same as that in 3D HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells. The antibodies for human-specific phospho-Ser-78 HSP27 also reacted with the HSP27 in WT or 3D HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells as the antibodies for other phosphorylated forms (data not shown). On the other hand, the overexpressed HSP27 protein in the 3A HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells did not react with the phospho-HSP27 antibodies (Fig. 1). Phosphorylated HSP27 Retarded the HCC Cell Growth in the Presence of TNFα—To clarify the relationship between phosphorylation of HSP27 and HCC cell growth, we first studied whether the cell growth of phosphorylated HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells was suppressed compared with that of unphosphorylated HSP27-overexpressed cells. HCC commonly arises in the liver with chronic inflammation (10Kojima S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 797-805PubMed Google Scholar, 21Maeda S. Kamata H. Luo J.L. Leffert H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 121: 977-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). In the liver, the levels of TNFα, a proinflammatory stimuli, in patients with cirrhosis and HCC have been reported to be significantly higher than those in normal individuals (22Ataseven H. Bahcecioglu I.H. Kuzu N. Yalniz M. Celebi S. Erensoy A. Ustundag B. Mediators Inflamm. 2006; 2006: 1-6Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cell growth of phosphorylated HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells was examined both in the presence and in the absence of TNFα. In the absence of TNFα, all WT, 3A, or 3D HSP27-overexpressed cell lines and the empty vector-transfected cell line showed almost the same growth curve (Fig. 2A, curves 1–4). Even in the presence of 1 nm TNFα, the empty vector or 3A HSP27 vector-transfected HuH7 cells also exhibited almost similar growth rate as in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 2A, curves 5 and 7). However, the cell growth of WT and 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells was remarkably delayed in comparison with that of 3A HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells in the presence of TNFα 6 days after incubation (Fig. 2A, curves 6 and 8). Phosphorylated HSP27 therefore seems to inhibit the cell growth of HCC under inflammatory conditions. Nonphosphorylated HSP27 is an inhibitor for caspase-dependent apoptosis (1Garrido C. Brunet M. Didelot C. Zermati Y. Schmitt E. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 5Beere H.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It inhibits the interaction of cytochrome c, which is released from the permeabilized mitochondria, and pro-caspase 9. To study the relationship of apoptosis and the growth retardation of phosphorylated HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells, the activities of caspase 9 were examined in WT, 3A, or 3D HSP27-transfected HuH7 cells in the presence of TNFα. Regardless of the presence or the absence of TNFα, the amount of the full-length caspase 9 increased in 3D HSP27 cDNA-transfected HuH7 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). The cleaved and activated caspase 9 significantly increased in WT HSP27 cDNA-transfected HuH7 cells after 2 h of stimulation of TNFα (Fig. 2C, lane 4). However, the increased activation of caspase 9 was shown also in the 3D HSP27-overexpressed cells in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 2C, lane 7). The cleavage of caspase 9 in the 3D HSP27-overexpressed cells in the presence of TNFα was even weaker than in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8). The similar tendency of the caspase 9 activities in the 2-h TNFα-stimulated cells was also shown in the cells after 72 h of stimulation of TNFα (data not shown). To confirm the cell growth retardation of WT and 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells in the presence of TNFα is not related to caspase 9, we investigated whether caspase-9 inhibitor I, an irreversible inhibitor of caspase 9, restored the cell growth of WT and 3D HSP27 in the presence of TNFα. As shown in Fig. 2D, caspase-9 inhibitor I, which alone had little effect on the cell number, did not affect the cell growth of both WT and 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells treated with 1 nm TNFα for 6 days (columns 4 and 8, in comparison with columns 3 and 7, respectively). Caspase-9 inhibitor I at a dose of 50 μm was toxic (data not shown). Therefore, it seems unlikely that caspase-dependent apoptosis caused the growth retardation of the phosphorylated HSP27-overexpressed cells in the presence of TNFα. Phosphorylated HSP27 Inhibited Prolonged Activation of ERK Signal Transduction in the HCC Cells—ERK has been reported to act as a potent proliferative factor of HCC and be constitutively activated in the human HCC cells and tissues (12Ito Y. Sasaki Y. Horimoto M. Wada S. Tanaka Y. Kasahara A. Ueki T. Hirano T. Yamamoto H. Fujimoto J. Okamoto E. Hayashi N. Hori M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 23Adachi S. Okuno M. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Takano Y. Kojima S. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. Okano Y. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Does the cell growth retardation of the phosphorylated HSP27-overexpressed cells correlate with the ERK activity? The basal levels of phosphorylated ERK were similar among all HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Although the ERK phosphorylation levels in all HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells were similarly increased after 2 h of stimulation with 1 nm TNFα, phospho-ERK levels in both WT and the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells significantly decreased in comparison with those in 3A HSP27 cDNA or empty vector-transfected HuH7 cells after 72 h of stimulation with TNFα (Fig. 3A). Total ERK proteins were expressed at almost the same levels among all HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells regardless of whether or not they were stimulated with TNFα. The ERK activity is regulated by upstream kinases MEK and c-Raf. As shown in Fig. 3B, a significant decline of MEK activity in WT and the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HCC cells was observed in comparison with that in 3A HSP27 cDNA or empty vector-transfected cells after 72 h of stimulation of TNFα. Furthermore, significant attenuation of c-Raf activity was also shown in WT and the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HCC cells following 48 h of TNFα stimulation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, phosphorylated HSP27 might act as a repressor for prolonged activation of ERK signaling pathway at a point upstream of c-Raf in the HCC cells. Transactivation Activities of AP-1 and Cyclin D1 Expression Were Suppressed in the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HCC Cells—ERK contributes to the induction of AP-1 transcriptional activity, and AP-1 activates the cyclin D1 promoter to induce cell proliferation (13Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Müller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 24Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the phosphorylated HSP27 on AP-1 transactivation activity was assessed (Fig. 4A). After 72 h of stimulation with TNFα, WT and the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells expressed significantly less transactivation activity of AP-1 than 3A HSP27-introduced cells (Fig. 4A, columns 6 and 8, in comparison with column 7). A remarkable decrease of AP-1 transactivation activity was observed especially in 3D HSP27 cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, column 8). To confirm that the attenuation of this AP-1 transactivation activity occurred because of the ERK signaling pathway, constitutive active MEK1 cDNA was transfected into the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells. The active MEK1 restored AP-1 transactivation activity of the 3D HSP27-overexpressed HuH7 cells to t"

Polarisation vision systems studied to date detect one to four channels of linear polarisation, combining them in opponent pairs to provide intensity-independent operation. Circular polarisation vision has never been seen, and is widely believed to play no part in animal vision.Polarisation is fully measured via Stokes' parameters--obtained by combined linear and circular polarisation measurements. Optimal polarisation vision is the ability to see Stokes' parameters: here we show that the crustacean Gonodactylus smithii measures the exact components required.This vision provides optimal contrast-enhancement and precise determination of polarisation with no confusion states or neutral points--significant advantages. Linear and circular polarisation each give partial information about the polarisation of light--but the combination of the two, as we will show here, results in optimal polarisation vision. We suggest that linear and circular polarisation vision not be regarded as different modalities, since both are necessary for optimal polarisation vision; their combination renders polarisation vision independent of strongly linearly or circularly polarised features in the animal's environment."
https://openalex.org/W2015509791,"Prothyrotropin-releasing hormone (pro-TRH) is initially cleaved by the prohormone convertase-1/3 (PC1/3) in the trans-Golgi network generating N- and C-terminal intermediate forms that are then packed into secretory vesicles. However, it is not known whether these peptides are differentially sorted within the secretory pathway. This is of key importance because the processing products of several prohormones fulfill different biological functions. Using AtT20 cells stably transfected with prepro-TRH cDNA, we found that two specific N- and C-terminal peptides were located in different vesicles. Furthermore, the C-terminal pro-TRH-derived peptides were more efficiently released in response to KCl and norepinephrine, a natural secretagogue of TRH. Similar sorting and secretion of N- and C-terminal peptides occurs in vivo. When we blocked the initial proteolytic processing by a mutagenic approach, the differential sorting and secretion of these peptides were prevented. In summary, our data show that pro-TRH-derived peptides are differentially sorted within the secretory pathway and that the initial cleavage in the trans-Golgi network is key to this process. This could be a common mechanism used by neuroendocrine cells to regulate independently the secretion of different bioactive peptides derived from the same gene product."

The non-biting midges Chironomus riparius and C. piger, interbreeding in the laboratory, have been shown to coexist frequently despite of their close relatedness, similar ecology and high morphological similarity. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to investigate factors shaping niche partitioning of these cryptic sister species, we explored the actual degree of reproductive isolation in the field. Congruent results from nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial haplotype analyses indicated complete absence of interspecific gene-flow. Autocorrelation analysis showed a non-random spatial distribution of the two species. Though not dispersal limited at the scale of the study area, the sister species occurred less often than expected at the same site, indicating past or present competition. Correlation and multiple regression analyses suggested the repartition of the available habitat along water chemistry gradients (nitrite, conductivity, CaCO3), ultimately governed by differences in summer precipitation regime. Conclusions We show that these morphologically cryptic sister species partition their niches due to a certain degree of ecological distinctness and total reproductive isolation in the field. The coexistence of these species provides a suitable model system for the investigation of factors shaping the distribution of closely related, cryptic species."
https://openalex.org/W1994279689,"CCAAT/enhancer binding proteindelta (C/EBPdelta) plays a key role in mammary epithelial cell G(0) growth arrest, and ""loss of function"" alterations in C/EBPdelta have been reported in breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. C/EBPdelta is regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels, suggesting tight control of C/EBPdelta content and function. Protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIASs) regulate a growing number of transcription factors, including C/EBPs. HC11 nontransformed mammary epithelial cells express PIAS3, PIASxbeta, and PIASy, and all three PIAS family members repress C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity. PIASy is the most potent, however, repressing C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity by >80%. PIASy repression of C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity is dependent upon interaction between the highly conserved PIASy N-terminal nuclear matrix binding domain (SAPD) and the C/EBPdelta transactivation domain (TAD). PIASy repression of C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity is independent of histone deacetylase activity, PIASy E3 SUMO ligase activity, and C/EBPdelta sumoylation status. PIASy expression is associated with C/EBPdelta translocation from nuclear foci, where C/EBPdelta co-localizes with p300, to the nuclear periphery. PIASy-mediated translocation of C/EBPdelta is dependent upon the PIASy SAPD and C/EBPdelta TAD. PIASy reduces the expression of C/EBPdelta adhesion-related target genes and enhances repopulation of open areas within a cell monolayer in the in vitro ""scratch"" assay. These results demonstrate that PIASy represses C/EBPdelta by a mechanism that requires interaction between the PIASy SAPD and C/EBPdelta TAD and does not require PIASy SUMO ligase activity or C/EBPdelta sumoylation. PIASy alters C/EBPdelta nuclear localization, reduces C/EBPdelta transcriptional activity, and enhances cell proliferation/migration."
https://openalex.org/W2002492903,"The natural cytotoxic receptors (NCRs) are a unique set of activating proteins expressed mainly on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. The NCRs, which include three members; NKp46, NKp44 and NKp30, are critically involved in NK cytotoxicity against different targets, including a wide range of tumor cells derived from various origins. Even though the tumor ligands of the NCRs have not been identified yet, the selective manner by which these receptors target tumor cells may provide an excellent basis for the development of novel anti-tumor therapies. To test the potential use of the NCRs as anti-tumor agents, we generated soluble NCR-Ig fusion proteins in which the constant region of human IgG1 was fused to the extracellular portion of the receptor. We demonstrate, using two different human prostate cancer cell lines, that treatment with NKp30-Ig, dramatically inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Activated macrophages were shown to mediate an ADCC response against the NKp30-Ig coated prostate cell lines. Finally, the Ig fusion proteins were also demonstrated to discriminate between benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. This may provide a novel diagnostic modality in the difficult task of differentiating between these highly common pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2067092833,"Migration is a commonly described phenomenon in nature that is often caused by spatial and temporal differences in habitat quality. However, as migration requires energy, the timing of migration may depend not only on differences in habitat quality, but also on temporal variation in migration costs. Such variation can, for instance, arise from changes in wind or current velocity for migrating birds and fish, respectively. Whereas behavioural responses of birds to such changing environmental conditions have been relatively well described, this is not the case for fish, although fish migrations are both ecologically and economically important. We here use passive and active telemetry to study how winter migrating roach regulate swimming speed and distance travelled per day in response to variations in head current velocity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical predictions on optimal swimming speeds in head currents and relate these to our empirical results. We show that fish migrate farther on days with low current velocity, but travel at a greater ground speed on days with high current velocity. The latter result agrees with our predictions on optimal swimming speed in head currents, but disagrees with previously reported predictions suggesting that fish ground speed should not change with head current velocity. We suggest that this difference is due to different assumptions on fish swimming energetics. We conclude that fish are able to adjust both swimming speed and timing of swimming activity during migration to changes in head current velocity in order to minimize energy use."
https://openalex.org/W2022583132,"We describe for the first time the association of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins with retroviral and lentiviral particles, similar to a process well established for cells, termed ""painting."" The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of modification of retroviral vectors by exogenous addition of recombinant protein, removing the need for genetic engineering of virus producer cell lines. The recombinant GPI protein CD59his was purified via fast protein liquid chromatography and associated with concentrated virus stock in a controlled incubation procedure. Reaction mixtures were purified in order to remove nonassociated GPI protein and endogenous protein. Analysis of samples by immunoblotting revealed that CD59his was only detectable in the presence of viral particles. From this, we conclude that CD59his could be stably associated with retroviral particles. In addition, we demonstrated by flow cytometry that virus particles remain infectious after these procedures. As well as suggesting a novel possibility for interaction between enveloped virus and host, we believe that the stable association of recombinant GPI proteins to retroviral particles can be developed into an important tool for both research and clinical applications, especially in the fields of gene therapy and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2144404388,"The pursuit of eternal youth has existed for centuries and recent data indicate that fat-storing tissues control lifespan. In a D. melanogaster fat body insertional mutagenic enhancer trap screen designed to isolate genes that control longevity, we identified a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain containing sorting nexin, termed snazarus (sorting nexin lazarus, snz). Flies with insertions into the 5' UTR of snz live up to twice as long as controls. Transgenic expression of UAS-Snz from the snz Gal4 enhancer trap insertion, active in fat metabolic tissues, rescued lifespan extension. Further, the lifespan extension of snz mutants was independent of endosymbiont, e.g., Wolbachia, effects. Notably, old snz mutant flies remain active and fertile indicating that snz mutants have prolonged youthfulness, a goal of aging research. Since mammals have snz-related genes, it is possible that the functions of the snz family may be conserved to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2062423108,"Bif-1 interacts with Bax and enhances its conformational rearrangement, resulting in apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism governing the interaction between Bif-1 and Bax is poorly defined. Here we provide evidence that Bif-1 is phosphorylated, an event that can be repressed by apoptotic stimuli. The protein kinase c-Src binds to and directly phosphorylates Bif-1 on tyrosine 80. Moreover, Src phosphorylation of Bif-1 suppresses the interaction between Bif-1 and Bax, resulting in the inhibition of Bax activation during anoikis. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of Bif-1 impairs its binding to Bax and represses apoptosis, providing another mechanism by which Src oncogenic signaling can prevent cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2162635358,"The SMTNL1 protein contains a single type-2 calponin homology (CH) domain at its C terminus that shares sequence identity with the smoothelin family of smooth muscle-specific proteins. In contrast to the smoothelins, SMTNL1 does not associate with F-actin in vitro, and its specific role in smooth muscle remains unclear. In addition, the biological function of the C-terminal CH-domains found in the smoothelin proteins is also poorly understood. In this work, we have therefore determined the solution structure of the CH-domain of mouse SMTNL1 (SMTNL1-CH; residues 346-459). The secondary structure and the overall fold for the C-terminal type-2 CH-domain is very similar to that of other CH-domains. However, two clusters of basic residues form a unique surface structure that is characteristic of SMTNL1-CH. Moreover, the protein has an extended C-terminal α-helix, which contains a calmodulin (CaM)-binding IQ-motif, that is also a distinct feature of the smoothelins. We have characterized the binding of apo-CaM to SMTNL1-CH through its IQ-motif by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR chemical shift perturbation studies. In addition, we have used the HADDOCK protein-protein docking approach to construct a model for the complex of apo-CaM and SMTNL1-CH.

Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the calponin homology (CH) 5The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; SMTNL1-CH, CH-domain of smoothelin-like 1; CaM, calmodulin; CaM-nt, the N-terminal domain of CaM; CaM-ct, the C-terminal domain of CaM; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; CSP, chemical shift perturbation; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy. domain was identified in the N-terminal portion of this protein as an ∼110-amino acid region that contributed to its actin-binding properties (3Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CH-domains have since been identified in a number of cytoskeletal and signaling proteins (4Stradal T. Kranewitter W. Winder S.J. Gimona M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Korenbaum E. Rivero F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3543-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The CH-domain has a highly conserved structure that is associated with diverse biological functions. Although the various CH-domains share relatively little amino acid sequence identity, a number of strictly conserved hydrophobic residues give rise to an almost invariant hydrophobic core (see Fig. 1). Thus, all of the CH-domain structures that have been determined to date are very similar. Despite a common overall fold, different CH-domains serve to interface with a wide variety of proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and/or signal transduction. Therefore, the divergence in CH-domain function is thought to result from discrete sequence elements that are exposed on the protein surface. CH-domains have been classified into several families (summarized in Ref. 5Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The type-1 and type-2 CH-domains are normally arranged in tandem and are found in many actin-binding proteins, including members of the spectrin, α-actinin, dystrophin, and fimbrin protein families. Single CH-domains are found in several proteins, such as calponin and IQGAP, and are usually classified as type-3 CH-domains. The type-2 CH-domain can also exist as an isolated CH-domain, and it is found in a few proteins, including smoothelins, MICALs, and RP/EBs (6Korenbaum E. Rivero F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3543-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Calponin and other CH-domain proteins may regulate smooth muscle contractility via the thin filament regulatory system. In a previous report, Borman et al. (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) identified a novel ∼60 kDa protein that was phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase during cGMP-induced Ca2+ densensitization in ileal smooth muscle. This protein was shown to contain a single type-2 CH-domain at its C terminus, which shared sequence similarity with the smoothelin family of smooth muscle-specific proteins (reviewed in Ref. 8van Eys G.J. Niessen P.M. Rensen S.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2007; 17: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 459-residue protein, initially called CHASM (calponin homology-associated smooth muscle), is termed SMTNL1 (smoothelin-like 1). However, unlike the smoothelins, it did not associate with actin filaments in vitro, and hence the specific role of SMTNL1 in smooth muscle relaxation remains undefined. Also, the interaction of smoothelin proteins with actin is mediated by additional N-terminal actin-binding domains such that their CH-domain was neither necessary nor sufficient for actin binding (9Quensel C. Kramer J. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biological role of the C-terminal type-2 CH-domain in the smoothelin protein family remains unclear. Close inspection of their amino acid sequences reveals that the CH-domains of the smoothelins and SMTNL1 contain a putative calmodulin (CaM)-binding IQ-motif sequence (Fig. 1). It has been reported that CaM can bind to many other CH-domain proteins, even though these generally do not posses IQ-motifs. These proteins include calponin (10Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 11Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Vasulka C. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13327-13333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), spectrin (12Sobel J.S. Goldstein E.G. Venuti J.M. Welsh M.J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 126: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), dystrophin (13Jarrett H.W. Foster J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32426-32433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in which CaM modulates the Ca2+ dependence of actin binding (13Jarrett H.W. Foster J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5578-5586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Nakamura F. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Szymanski P.T. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 306: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Some CH-domain proteins, such as IQGAP, also contain IQ-motifs, though these are located outside of the CH-domain region of the protein (16Briggs M.W. Sacks D.B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide the first insight into the structure of the C-terminal type-2 CH-domain from SMTNL1 (SMTNL1-CH) and discuss its structural characteristics with respect to previously reported CH-domains. We also demonstrate the binding of apo-CaM to SMTNL1-CH via the IQ-motif sequence and calculate a docking model for the SMTNL1-CH·apo-CaM complex using the HADDOCK protein-protein docking program (17Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of SMTNL1-CH—The full-length mouse SMTNL1 cDNA was generated from IMAGE clone 3593616 as described previously (7Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Haystead T.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A fragment of SMTNL1 encoding the CH-domain of SMTNL1 (residues 346-459) was then amplified by standard PCR techniques and subcloned into the pGEX-6P1 vector (GE Healthcare) using BamHI/NotI sites. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The GST-SMTNL1-CH fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli, strain BL21(DE3) in LB medium. Uniformly 15N-labeled and15N,13C-labeledGST-SMTNL1-CH proteins were prepared in M9 medium containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 1 g/liter [13C6] glucose (or unlabeled glucose). The fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and cleaved “on-column” by treatment with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). The eluted protein contained the cloning artifact “GPLGS” at its N terminus. The SMTNL1-CH construct was concentrated and exchanged into 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer with an Amicon centrifugal filter (Millipore). Expression and Purification of Calmodulin (CaM)—Chicken CaM was expressed from the pET30b(+) vector in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) grown in LB medium as described previously (18Nakashima K. Maekawa H. Yazawa M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5602-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N-labeled CaM was prepared in M9 medium containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl. CaM proteolytic fragments, the N-terminal domain of CaM (CaM-nt; residues 1-77), and the C-terminal domain of CaM (CaM-ct; residues 78-148) were produced as described previously (19Itakura M. Iio T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NMR Sample Preparation—All NMR samples contained 0.5-1.0 mm 15N-labeled or 13C,15N-labeled SMTNL1-CH; 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0); 10 mm 2H-labeled dithiothreitol; 0.03% NaN3; and 0.5 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. Unlabeled SMTNL1-CH sample was also prepared in 99.99% D2O. The samples used for residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements also contained 300 mm KCl, 20 mm bis-Tris (pH 6.9), and 10 mg/ml filamentous phage Pf1 (Asla Biotech Ltd.). All samples to monitor the interaction between SMTNL1-CH and apo-CaM also contain an additional 1 mm EDTA. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—All ITC experiments were performed on a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Solutions of ∼0.5 mm CaM, CaM-nt, or CaM-ct with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1 mm EDTA or 5 mm CaCl2 were sequentially injected into a sample cell containing 20 μm SMTNL1-CH in the same buffer. All buffers contained 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to prevent intermolecular disulfide bonding in SMTNL1-CH. The concentration of each protein was determined using their predicted molar extinction coefficients (cm-1 m-1): CaM, ϵ280 = 2560; CaM-ct, ϵ280 = 2980; CaM-nt, ϵ259 = 742; and SMTNL1-CH, ϵ280 = 18450. All titrations were performed at 30 °C, and the data were fit to a one-site binding model (MicroCal Origin software) to obtain dissociation constants (Kd). NMR Measurements—All NMR experiments were carried out at 20 °C on Bruker Avance 500 or 700 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with triple resonance inverse Cryoprobes with a single z-axis gradient. Sequential assignments of HN, N, CO, C-α and C-β resonances of SMTNL1-CH were achieved using two-dimensional 15N,1H HSQC and a series of three-dimensional experiments including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA. Side-chain assignments were performed using three-dimensional C(CCO)NH TOCSY, H(CCO)NH TOCSY and HBHA(CBCACO)NH experiments. Two-dimensional (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE experiments were also employed for the aromatic resonance assignments (20Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar). All NOESY experiments including the three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC, three-dimensional 13C NOESY-HSQC, and two-dimensional NOESY were measured with a mixing time of 100 ms. {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were acquired on a 700-MHz spectrometer with a recycle delay of 5 s (21Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). The experiments were repeated three times and averaged. H-N RDC measurements were performed using the in-phase/anti-phase 1H,15N HSQC experiment (22Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The chemical shift perturbation (CSP) studies were performed by monitoring the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled SMTNL1-CH and 15N-labeled apo-CaM by adding unlabeled apo-CaM and unlabeled SMTNL1-CH, respectively. The CSP value was then evaluated as a weighted average chemical shift difference of 1H and 15N resonances, using the equation CSP =√(ΔHN)2 + (ΔN/5)2 (23Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts in all spectra were referenced using 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid to obtain 1H,15N and 13C chemical shifts (24Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed using NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the NMRView software (26Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—The initial SMTNL1-CH structure was calculated with CYANA version 2.0 (27Jee J. Guntert P. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using distance restraints obtained from the automatic NOE assignment protocol. Dihedral angle restraints (Φ, φ) were predicted with TALOS (28Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar), and hydrogen bond restraints were based on secondary structure from a chemical shift index for the C-α and C′ atoms. Further structural refinement with the addition of RDC restraints were performed by XPLOR-NIH (29Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Initial estimates for the axial component of the molecular alignment tensor (Da) and the rhombicity (R) were obtained on the lowest energy structure calculated by CYANA using PALES (30Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Finally, the 30 lowest energy structures from a total of 200 were selected and analyzed. Docking Model for the SMTNL1-CH·Apo-CaM Complex—Based on the CSP data, a docking model for the SMTNL1-CH·apo-CaM complex was calculated with the HADDOCK2.0 (high ambiguity driven biomolecular docking) program in conjunction with CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The HADDOCK program is originally designed for the generation of protein·protein complex structures based on available experimental data (17Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). According to the outcome of the CSP and ITC data, only the C-terminal domain of apo-CaM was employed in this calculation. The 30-structure ensemble for SMTNL1-CH (determined in this study) and the 10-structure ensemble for the C-terminal domain of apo-CaM (residues 82-148; Protein Data Bank code 1F71) (32Chou J.J. Li S.P. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were used as the starting structures. The average solvent accessibilities per residue in the ensemble structures were calculated by NACCESS. The high solvent accessible residues (>40%) that exhibited a CSP >0.04 for SMTNL1-CH and >0.025 for the C-terminal domain of apo-CaM were designated as active residues (see below). The residues neighboring those active residues with a high solvent accessibility (>40%) were designated as passive residues. The active residues in SMTNL1-CH were Gly4, Lys6, Asn7, Asp93, Lys95, Thr99, Glu103, Arg106, and Gly112. The associated passive residues were Ser5, Ser94, Cys96, Gln102, Val109, Gln110, and Lys111. For the C-terminal domain of apo-CaM, the active residues were Lys94, Asp95, Gly96, Tyr99, Asp131, Gly134, and Gln135, and the passive residues were Asn97, Ser101, Gly132, Asp133, and Asn137. The positions of the active residues for both proteins are indicated on their structure (see below). In the first stage of the calculation, an initial set of 1000 rigid-body docking models was generated. The 200 lowest energy complex models were then selected and submitted for a second stage of calculations with semi-flexible simulated annealing. The 50 lowest energy models in the second stage were refined in water solvent and clustered using a 3.0 Å r.m.s.d. cutoff criterion. Finally, the 15 lowest energy complex models were selected from the most populated cluster with the lowest HADDOCK score and used for the analysis. All molecular graphics were created with MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Structure Determination of SMTNL1-CH—Using the HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO experiments, all amide resonances except for Gly1, Pro47, Pro52, and Pro92 were assigned in the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2). The side-chain resonance assignments were mainly obtained from the C(CO)NH TOCSY, H(CCO)NH TOCSY, and HBHA-(CBCACO)NH spectra. Because SMTNL1-CH contains a total of 16 aromatic residues, the (HB)CB(CGCD)HD and (HB)CB-(CGCDCE)HE experiments were also carried out to obtain unambiguous resonance assignments of the aromatic side chains. Consequently, 94.6% of the total 1H resonances were assigned and used in the structure calculation. The initial structures were calculated using the torsion angle dynamics and the automatic NOE assignment protocol with CYANA. At the first stage, a total of 3521 NOE signals were manually identified on the three-dimensional 15N and 13C NOESY-HSQC spectra as well as the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum acquired in D2O. 3261 NOE signals were automatically assigned by CYANA, and this generated 2136 distance restraints. The distribution of the distance restraints was determined as a function of residue number (Fig. 3a). The backbone r.m.s.d. for the well folded region (residues 5-111) of the calculated 30 structures together with the hydrogen bond and TALOS dihedral restraints was 0.29 ± 0.05 Å (data not shown). To determine accurate interhelical angles/positions, we employed H-N RDC restraints during the second stage of the structure calculation with the program XPLOR-NIH. The RDC values were available for 87.4% of the residues and ranged between -27.1 and 17.0 Hz with a digital resolution of 1.24 Hz. All restraints used for the final stage of the structure calculation are summarized in Table 1. The average number of restraints per residue was 18.7. The superimposition of the final 30 structures and the ribbon representation of the lowest energy structure of SMTNL1-CH are shown in Fig. 4, a and b, respectively. The r.m.s.d. values for the backbone and the entire heavy atoms in the well folded region (residues 5-111) were 0.27 ± 0.03 and 0.80 ± 0.04 Å, respectively. The experimentally determined RDC values correlate well with the best-fit RDC values calculated from the final structures of SMTNL1-CH with correlation (R) and quality (Q) factors of 1.00 and 0.015, respectively. The structures were validated with the PROCHECK program (34Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), and 84% of the residues were found in favored regions of the Ramachandran plot; the remaining residues were all found in the additionally allowed regions (Table 1). The SMTNL1-CH is a globular molecule containing five α-helices and one 310-helix with no β-sheet structure (Fig. 4b). The helices are located from residues 5-15, 30-32 (310-helix), 36-42, 60-75, 83-89, and 94-111, which agrees with the chemical shift index values obtained from the C-α and C′ atoms (Fig. 3b). Several irregular 310-helices were also identified for residues 47-49, 52-54, and 57-59.FIGURE 3a, structural data for SMTNL1-CH. The number of distance restraints for the structure calculation (top), r.m.s.d. values of the 30 calculated structures (middle), and the backbone {1H}-15N NOE (bottom) are shown as a function of residue number. In the top panel, white, gray, dark gray, and black bars indicate the number of intraresidue, sequential, medium range (2Szymanski P.T. J. Muscle Res.

In the middle panel, the r.m.s.d. values for the backbone and all the heavy atoms are shown with a solid and dashed line, respectively. b, chemical shift index values for C-α and C′ atoms. The secondary structures obtained from the calculated structures are also shown. The boxes with residue numbers indicate the position of the helices.

(Protein Data Bank code 2D87) (Fig. 5a), α-actinin 1 (code 2EYI) (Fig. 5b) (35Borrego-Diaz E. Kerff F. Lee S.H. Ferron F. Li Y. Dominguez R. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 155: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), spectrin (code 1BKR) (Fig. 5c) (36Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1419-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and MICAL-1 (code 2DK9) (Fig. 5d) (37Sun H. Dai H. Zhang J. Jin X. Xiong S. Xu J. Wu J. Shi Y. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 36: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The superimpositions were performed using the well structured regions of SMTNL1-CH and the corresponding regions of other CH-domain structures that were defined by sequence alignments (Fig. 1). The backbone r.m.s.d. was 1.15, 3.47, 3.72, and 2.88 Å with smoothelin, α-actinin 1, spectrin, and MICAL-1, respectively. Characterization of the Apo-CaM Interaction with SMTNL1-CH—The binding of apo-CaM with SMTNL1-CH was first characterized by ITC experiments. Apo-CaM exhibited an exothermic interaction with SMTNL1-CH (Kd = 2.7 × 10-6 m) in the presence of EDTA, whereas no heat of binding was detected in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6a). We also performed ITC experiments with the proteolytic C- and N-terminal fragments of apo-CaM. CaM-ct exhibited an exothermic interaction with a similar Kd (4.0 × 10-6 m) to that observed with intact CaM. However, CaM-nt did not bind to SMTNL1-CH (Fig. 6b). CSP values, determined from the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of SMTNL1-CH following the addition of unlabeled CaM, were plotted as a function of residue number (Fig. 7a). Amides that experience CSP >0.04 could be mapped to residues located either on the IQ-motif sequence of SMTNL1-CH or to regions that were in close proximity (Fig. 7c). Similarly, the CSPs were monitored in the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of apo-CaM by adding unlabeled SMTNL1-CH into the NMR sample (Fig. 7b). Residues with CSP values >0.025 were only found in the C-terminal domain of CaM and were located around its two Ca2+ binding loops (Fig. 7d). The backbone structure of 15 refined complex models and a ribbon representation of the lowest energy model for the interaction of SMTNL1-CH with the C-terminal domain of apo-CaM were generated (Fig. 8).

This is exemplified in the cardiovascular system where sGC governs smooth muscle tone and growth, vascular permeability, leukocyte flux, and platelet aggregation. As a consequence, aberrant NO-sGC signaling has been linked to diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Despite these key (patho)physiological roles, little is known about the expressional regulation of sGC. To address this deficit, we have characterized the promoter activity of human α1 and β1 sGC genes in a cell type relevant to cardiovascular (patho)physiology, primary human aortic smooth muscle cells. Luciferase reporter constructs revealed that the 0.3- and 0.5-kb regions upstream of the transcription start sites were optimal for α1 and β1 sGC promoter activity, respectively. Deletion of consensus sites for c-Myb, GAGA, NFAT, NF-κB(p50), and CCAAT-binding factor(s) (CCAAT-BF) revealed that these are the principal transcription factors regulating basal sGC expression. In addition, under pro-inflammatory conditions, the effects of the strongest α1 and β1 sGC repressors were enhanced, and enzyme expression and activity were reduced; in particular, NF-κB(p50) is pivotal in regulating enzyme expression under such conditions. NO itself also elicited a cGMP-independent negative feedback effect on sGC promoter activity that is mediated, in part, via CCAAT-BF activity. In sum, these data provide a systematic characterization of the promoter activity of human sGC α1 and β1 subunits and identify key transcription factors that govern subunit expression under basal and pro-inflammatory (i.e. atherogenic) conditions and in the presence of ligand NO.

Pivotal to NO-mediated modification of cell function is activation of the hemoprotein soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) 3The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; TF, transcription factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HASMC, human aortic smooth muscle cell; DETA-NO, DETA-NONOate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NFY, nuclear factor Y; A, α fragment; B, β fragment. and consequent production of the second messenger cGMP, which in turn activates specific cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, ion channels, and phosphodiesterases (4Hobbs A.J.

Within the last decade, the localization and structure of the genes encoding for sGC subunits have been elucidated in several mammalian species, nonvertebrates, and plants (14Andreopoulos S. Papapetropoulos A. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In mammals, two isoforms of each subunit, called α1,2 and β1,2, have been cloned and characterized (15Zabel U. Weeger M. La M. Schmidt H.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, to date only α1/β1 and α2/β1 heterodimers have been identified at the protein level. The chromosomal localization of sGC genes has been determined in rodents (16Azam M. Gupta G. Chen W. Wellington S. Warburton D. Danziger R.S. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Sharina I.G. Krumenacker J.S. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10878-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and humans (18Giuili G. Roechel N. Scholl U. Mattei M.G. Guellaen G. Hum. Genet. 1993; 91: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); in both cases the α1 and β1 subunits are co-localized on the same locus, whereas α2 and β2 lie on separate chromosomes. Previous reports have provided evidence that expressional regulation of the enzyme is a key means of modulating NO-sGC signaling. For instance, different tissues possess distinct levels of mRNA for sGC isoforms (19Budworth J. Meillerais S. Charles I. Powell K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), intimating tissue-specific expression of individual sGC subunits. Furthermore, splice variants of the α1 sGC subunit mRNA have been identified (20Ritter D. Taylor J.F. Hoffmann J.W. Carnaghi L. Giddings S.J. Zakeri H. Kwok P.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 811-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the human β1 subunit is encoded by a single transcript (∼3.5kb), suggesting the translation of a single protein. Such observations suggest that the expression of the β1 subunit is somewhat invariant, whereas alterations in the expression of the α subunit(s) may be an important physiological control mechanism. Changes in the expression of sGC have also been linked with disease states, intimating that expressional regulation of the enzyme is likely to have (patho)physiological significance. For instance, in aged and spontaneously hypertensive rats, expression of the β1 subunit is diminished and correlates with elevations in systemic blood pressure (21Ruetten H. Zabel U. Linz W. Schmidt H.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Kloss S. Bouloumie A. Mulsch A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, salt-sensitive hypertension in Dahl rats is associated with decreased and increased expression of the β1 and β2 subunits, respectively, suggesting that exchange of β subunits may be critical to blood pressure regulation (16Azam M. Gupta G. Chen W. Wellington S. Warburton D. Danziger R.S. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In animal models of pulmonary hypertension, sGC expression is reduced (23Tzao C. Nickerson P.A. Russell J.A. Gugino S.F. Steinhorn R.H. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2001; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Wedgwood S. Steinhorn R.H. Bunderson M. Wilham J. Lakshminrusimha S. Brennan L.A. Black S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: L660-L666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells exposed to hypoxia lose their ability to express sGC (25Hassoun P.M. Filippov G. Fogel M. Donaldson C. Kayyali U.S. Shimoda L.A. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reduced β1 sGC expression also correlates with intimal thickening following balloon injury (26Chen L. Daum G. Fischer J.W. Hawkins S. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells and/or tissues to pro-inflammatory cytokines, or NO itself, also induces changes in sGC expression. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin 1β, and NO donors cause reduced sGC β1 mRNA expression in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (27Papapetropoulos A. Abou-Mohamed G. Marczin N. Murad F. Caldwell R.W. Catravas J.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and in atherogenic lesions reduced sGC expression is linked to diminished cGMP-dependent signaling and neointimal proliferation (28Melichar V.O. Behr-Roussel D. Zabel U. Uttenthal L.O. Rodrigo J. Rupin A. Verbeuren T.J. Kumar H.S.A. Schmidt H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16671-16676Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, augmented β1 subunit expression has been linked to increased nitrovasodilator potency in animals with endothelial dysfunction (29Brandes R.P. Schmitz-Winnenthal F.H. Feletou M.

Bouloumie A. Fraccarollo D. Hu K. Busse R. Ertl G. Circulation. 1999; 100: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). These observations intimate that expressional regulation of sGC plays a key role in the cardiovascular system, both in terms of physiological homeostasis and pathogenesis. Despite these reports, however, there is a paucity of information regarding the regulation of sGC promoter activity, particularly in the human vasculature where the enzyme performs such an important physiological function. Previous studies have examined the promoter activity of individual sGC subunits in different species (32Vazquez-Padron R.I. Pham S.M. Pang M. Li S. Aitouche A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Yamamoto T. Suzuki N. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 337-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet only a single study has focused on the human β1 gene (34Sharina I.G. Martin E. Thomas A. Uray K.L. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11523-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, a key role for a CCAAT-binding factor (CCAAT-BF) was revealed, although this analysis was conducted in a neuronal, rather than cardiovascular, cell line. Thus, there is a key requirement to understand the factors regulating human α1 and β1 sGC promoter activity in the human vasculature to more fully appreciate the physiological roles and regulation of the NO receptor and how aberrant expression may underlie cardiovascular pathogenesis. To address this need, herein we investigated the transcriptional regulation of human α1 and β1 sGC genes in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Cell Culture—HASMCs (PromoCell) were cultured in smooth muscle cell growth medium 2 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor, 5 mg/ml recombinant human insulin, and 0.62 ng/ml phenol red (PromoCell). The cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and cells in passages 2–10 were used. Isolation of Genomic Clones for Human α1 and β1 sGC Subunits—Bacterial artificial chromosome clones containing α1 or β1 sGC subunits were purchased from BacPac Resources (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute). Bacterial artificial chromosome DNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. The full promoters of human α1 and β1 sGC were isolated from the bacterial artificial chromosome clones by PCR using Accuprime™ Taq high fidelity DNA polymerase, using primers based on the 5′-flanking regions of α1 (AY034777) and β1 (AY034778) sGC genes including the first exon. The identity of both promoter regions was verified by direct sequencing. Construction of Luciferase Deletion Plasmids—Different 5′-flanking regions of the α1 and β1 sGC genes upstream of the transcription start site (+1) and extending to the noncoding part of the first exon (+9) were cloned into NheI-XhoI restriction sites of the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Fragments were obtained by PCR as previously described for the full promoter. Insertions in the pGL3 reporter vector expressing firefly luciferase were identified by restriction digest, and the integrity of the constructs was confirmed by direct sequencing. Primer sequences used to generate the full promoter, and deletion constructs are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The A0.3- and B0.5-kb fragments, respectively, were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis by using the QuikChange II site-directed kit (Stratagene) and high fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). This kit was also used to repair errors during the construction of luciferase deletion constructs. All of the constructs were verified by direct sequencing. Transient Transfections—3,500 HASMCs/well and 15,000 COS-7 cells/well were seeded in 96-well clear plates 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 50 ng of plasmid DNA/well using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) with a 3:1 ratio (μl reagent:μg DNA). pGL3 control vector (Promega) was used as a transfection control. In each case, the cells were co-transfected with a pRL-TK vector expressing Renilla luciferase (Promega) at a 10:1 ratio (test vector:pRL-TK vector). Twenty-four hours later, where indicated cells were treated with either (a) “pro-inflammatory mixture” (100 mg/ml LPS (Salmonella typhimurium; Sigma), 200 units/ml IFN-γ, 400 units/ml interleukin-1β, and 2000 units/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (all Preprotech) in cell culture medium) or (b) the NO donor DETA-NONOate (DETA-NO; 0–200 μm). Luciferase Assays—Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min at room temperature using the passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on the Wallac Victor 2 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase derived from pRL-TK vector, and the data are expressed as relative luciferase light units. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—HASMC plated in 6-cm tissue culture dishes were stimulated for 2 h with the pro-inflammatory mixture or DETA-NO (100 or 200 μm), nuclear extracts were prepared, and samples were subjected to EMSA, as we have previously described (35Connelly L. Palacios-Callender M. Ameixa C. Moncada S. Hobbs A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3873-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The primers used to generate the double-stranded probes are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, distributed by Perbio Sciences Ltd., Northumberland, UK). Equal concentrations of protein were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using the mini Trans-blot electrophoresis transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were stained with Ponceau S stain to confirm equal transfer and incubated in 5% milk in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody (anti-sGC β1) or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam, Coventry, UK) diluted 1:2000 (β1) or 1:1000 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) in 5% milk in wash buffer for 3 h at room temperature with constant agitation followed by five washes (5 min/wash). The membranes were then incubated with shaking for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Cambridgeshire, UK) diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk in wash buffer. The membranes were washed as described above, and the proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantified by densitometry using AlphaImager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Cyclic GMP Measurements—HASMC (106 cells) were plated in 10-cm dishes and 24 h later exposed to the pro-inflammatory mixture for a further 24 h. At this time, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in assay buffer (2.36 mg/100 ml Tris-HCl, 760 mg/100 ml NaCl, 22.2 mg/100 ml KCl, 29.6 mg/100 ml MgSO4, 16.6 mg/100 ml Na2HPO4, 0.01 mg/100 ml CaCl2, pH 7.4) and treated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). The cells were then exposed to either 1 or 10 μm spermine-NONOate (Axxora, Nottingham, UK) for 5 min (“basal” samples did not receive spermine-NONOate), and the reaction was terminated by heating at 90 °C for 10 min. The cyclic GMP content was then measured using a commercially available assay (Amersham Biosciences). Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis—BLAST was used to identify and retrieve orthologous α1 sGC promoters from mouse, rat, and human genomes from project Ensembl at The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The α1 sGC upstream sequence was analyzed for the presence of repeat regions and transposable elements, using Repeat Masker version open-3.1.5. Confirmation of Pol II promoter was conducted with Promoter Scan II and Novel Neural Network Promoter Prediction. Identification of CpG islands was performed using CpGProD (CpG Island Promoter Detection) software. In silico analysis for transcription factor-binding sites was performed with MatInspector Suite, release 7.4 (36Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. A Student's t test was used to determine differences between data groups, where p < 0.05 was considered significant. Characterization of the 5′-Flanking Region of Human α1 and β1 sGC Genes—The transcriptional start sites were determined by pair-wise blasting of α1 and β1 sGC 5′-flanking regions with the complete mRNA sequences (NM_000856 and NM_000857, respectively). Scanning both α1 and β1 sGC sequences with the Novel Neural Network Algorithms for Improved Eukaryotic Promoter Site Recognition did not reveal any TATA box in close proximity to the transcription start site of both α1 and β1 sGC promoters. Analysis of promoter core elements (37Jin V.X. Singer G.A. gosto-Perez F.J. Liyanarachchi S. Davuluri R.V. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 114Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed the presence of consensus Inr (initiator) and DPE (downstream core promoter) elements but not TFIIB recognition (BRE) or the newly discovered motif 10 (MTE) elements in the α1 sGC promoter (supplemental Fig. S3). For the β1 sGC promoter, only DPE elements were found (supplemental Fig. S3). GC and CCAAT-BF boxes were detected in both proximal promoters. Furthermore, using Repeat Masker, we were able to identify three repeats in the α1 sGC promoter but only one in the β1 promoter region (Table 1). Finally, CpGProD software did not reveal the presence of CpG islands in either the α1 or β1 sGC promoters.TABLE 1The positions are according to the transcription start site (+1)RepeatNo. of elementsBeginEndLengthPercentage of sequencebpHuman α1 sGC promoter repeats according to RepeatMaskeraTotal length, 3048 bp; GC level, 36.5%; based masked, 382 bp (12.5%).

Open table in a new tab Analysis of Promoter Activity within the 5′-Flanking Region—Transiently transfected luciferase reporter constructs containing 0.3–3.0 kb of human α1 or 0.3–3.2 kb of human β1 sGC upstream sequence were analyzed for promoter activity in HASMCs. The A0.3-kb fragment showed the highest level of activity among the α1 sGC promoter constructs (Fig. 1). Reduced activity in the remaining (longer) constructs suggested the presence of repressor element(s) further upstream. The B0.5- and B0.8-kb fragments showed the highest level of activity among the β1 sGC promoter constructs (Fig. 1). The B1.4-kb fragment showed a decreased promoter activity, suggesting the presence of a repressor element(s) between –830 and –1392 bp. Extension of the promoter fragment up to 3.2 kb in length did not significantly alter the transcriptional activity of the B1.4-kb construct, suggesting the absence of net activation or repression in that region. However, the 126-bp deletion in B0.4 kb (to generate construct B0.3-kb) caused greater than 50% decrease in activity, suggesting that a key, putative enhancer(s) is located between B0.3 and B0.4-kb. In accord, the A0.3- and B0.5-kb constructs possessed the critical elements necessary for maximal promoter activity of the α1 and β1 sGC promoters, respectively, and were further analyzed. Interestingly, the A0.3-kb sequence exhibited only 44% homology with the mouse and rat sequence homologues and the B0.5-kb fragment possessed a 57% homology when compared with the rat sequence. As a consequence, there is likely to be disparate regulation of sGC expression (i.e. promoter activity) between species, highlighting the importance of characterizing the activity of the human promoter in human cells. Identification of Critical Transcription Binding Sites—Analysis of putative transcription factor-binding sites in the fragments containing the maximal promoter activity for the human α1 and β1 sGC genes was performed using MatInspector software (solution parameters: core similarity, 1.0; matrix similarity optimized) (supplemental Figs. S4A and 5A) and confirmed by Transcription Element Search Software. In both A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb constructs, putative TF-binding sites for several transcription factors located at the optimal regulatory distance from the transcription start site were investigated. To functionally determine the importance of these TFs for α1 and β1 sGC promoter activity, the cores of each TF-binding site were deleted individually in both the A0.3-kb and B0.5-kb basal constructs via site-directed mutagenesis. These deletions did not introduce any new binding sites as confirmed by sequence analysis with MatInspector software. Transcriptional activity of these mutant constructs was assessed in HASMCs and COS-7 cells; TF-binding sites that had a significant effect on sGC promoter activity in HASMCs are shown in supplemental Figs. S4B (α1 sGC) and S5B (β1 sGC). A0.3-kb fragments harboring deletions for CCAAT-BF-, c-Myb-, GAGA-, and NFAT-binding sites showed significant increases in promoter activity compared with A0.3-kb control in HASMCs (Fig. 2A), suggesting that binding of these TFs to their recognition sites has repressor effects on α1 sGC promoter activity in these cells. The effect of c-Myb was abolished in COS-7 cells, suggesting a HASMC-specific effect (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the effects of GAGA and NFAT were also reduced in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B), despite still having significant repressor activity. However, CCAAT-BF had a similar effect in COS-7 cells, suggesting that this TF may belong to the basal transcription machinery for α1 sGC gene in many cell types. B0.5-kb fragments harboring a deletion for an NF-κB(p50)-binding site showed almost 2-fold increase in promoter activity compared with B0.5kb control in HASMCs (Fig. 2C). This effect was identical in COS-7 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that NF-κB(p50) plays a key repressor role in the basal expression of β1 sGC, independent of cell type. In contrast, a B0.5-kb fragment harboring deletions for both NFY-binding sites showed a small reduction in B0.5-kb promoter activity in HASMCs, suggesting a slight activator effect of this TF (Fig. 2C). The activator effect of NFY was much stronger in COS-7 (Fig. 2D) and in a BE2 human neuroblastoma cell line (34Sharina I.G. Martin E. Thomas A. Uray K.L. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11523-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that a cell-specific effect of NFY is not so apparent in HASMC. PU1 and SP1 TFs showed activator and repressor effects, respectively, in COS-7 cells but not in HASMCs, again suggesting cell-specific regulation of sGC promoter activity. Effect of Pro-inflammatory Conditions on sGC Promoter Activity in HASMCs—To examine whether vascular inflammation modulates sGC expression in HASMCs, human α1 and β1 sGC promoter activity was examined in the presence of a pro-inflammatory mixture using the A0.3-kb (Fig. 3A) and B0.5-kB (Fig. 3B) constructs. Pro-inflammatory conditions significantly reduced both the α1 and β1 sGC promoter activity at 24 h. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed a clear, time-dependent decrease in sGC β1 expression following exposure of the HASMC to the pro-inflammatory mixture (Fig. 3C) that was mirrored by a significant reduction in both the basal and NO-stimulated sGC activity (Fig. 3D). As shown in Fig. 2, CCAAT-BF and NF-κB exerted the most pronounced effect on α1 and β1 sGC promoter activity, respectively, among the TFs studied. To determine whether these transcription factors bind to the target DNA sequences on the promoter, nuclear extracts from HASMCs were analyzed by EMSA. In terms of the α1 sGC promoter, three complexes were detected using the oligonucleotide probe containing –93 to –66 bp region (CCAAT-BF oligonucleotide) upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4A). The specificity of these complexes was demonstrated by a reduction of the intensity of all three bands in the presence of an excess of unlabeled probe. When the nuclear extract derived from HASMCs treated with the pro-inflammatory mixture was analyzed, an increase in the intensity of two of these complexes was observed (Fig. 4C), suggesting that vascular inflammation increased the binding of CCAAT-BF to the proximal α1 sGC promoter. The deletion of a single c (g) of the core of the CCAAT-BF site (position –82; supplemental Fig. S4) abolished the formation of two of the three complexes, highlighting the importance of that single base for the binding of the CCAAT-BF to the target promoter. For the β1 sGC promoter, interactions within the NF-κB(p50)-binding region were also assessed using a NF-κB oligonucleotide encompassing –138 to –109 bp region of this promoter (supplemental Fig. S5B). Three complexes were formed after incubation of the NF-κB probe with HASMC nuclear extracts. These complexes were no longer formed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled probe, confirming specificity (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, a supershift of the complexes was only observed when we used an anti-p50 antibody but not anti-p65 (Fig. 4E), suggesting that the smaller NF-κB subunit (perhaps as a p50 homodimer) is pivotal in regulating sGC β1 expression; this finding dovetails well with the observed increase in sGC β1 promoter activity in the construct with deleted p50 consensus site(s) and with previous reports detailing a predominantly repressor activity of p50 homodimers (38Tong X. Yin L. Washington R. Rosenberg D.W. Giardina C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 200"
https://openalex.org/W2037001860,"In their classical work (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1981, 78:6840–6844), Goldbeter and Koshland mathematically analyzed a reversible covalent modification system which is highly sensitive to the concentration of effectors. Its signal-response curve appears sigmoidal, constituting a biochemical switch. However, the switch behavior only emerges in the ‘zero-order region’, i.e. when the signal molecule concentration is much lower than that of the substrate it modifies. In this work we showed that the switching behavior can also occur under comparable concentrations of signals and substrates, provided that the signal molecules catalyze the modification reaction in cooperation. We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the proposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of constant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is robust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder is quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be observed at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological functions. It can be reduced by either increasing the conformation interconversion rate of the protein, or correlating the enzymatic reaction rates in the network."
https://openalex.org/W2027022533,"My understanding is that “reflections” can cover a multitude of sins. I have previously written a brief history of my career and do not want to duplicate that exposition (1Hammes G.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7 (1998): 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Instead, this “reflection” will trace a primary focus of my laboratory for many decades, namely how enzymes achieve their remarkable catalytic efficiency. (Indeed, this has been a focal point of the field of biochemistry for a much longer period.) This discussion will include personal interjections that trace my progress from undergraduate years to the present, as well as describe some of the other areas pursued in my research program. The answer to the question posed in molecular terms has been elusive, even though it has been a central theme of many research programs, including my own. A complete review of this subject is far beyond the scope of this article. Instead, I will review this subject as reflected in my personal interests and research program, although some historical perspective is included. I apologize in advance for not including all of the many noteworthy people and references that have significantly advanced the understanding of enzyme catalysis. My entry into the field of enzymology as an independent investigator occurred in 1960 when I was hired as an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). My background included a graduate degree in Physical Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin, where I did my graduate work in the laboratory of Robert Alberty, a wonderful mentor as well as a leading figure in the field of steady-state enzyme kinetics. This was followed by a postdoctoral year in Göttingen in the laboratory of Manfred Eigen, who developed the field of relaxation methods and received the Nobel Prize in 1967. These methods revolutionized the field of solution kinetics, and I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work closely with him. At this juncture, the importance of kismet should be noted. My choice of the University of Wisconsin for graduate school was not based on a careful analysis of graduate schools. It was a knee jerk reaction to my undergraduate years at Princeton University. Princeton provided a great education, but it was a social desert with no women coeds in the area and cars banned for students. This was especially difficult for a student coming from a high school in a small town in Wisconsin. After my Princeton experience, I wanted to return to the warmth (not referring to temperature) of the Midwest. My selection of a research supervisor was based on a single conversation with Robert Alberty after I arrived at graduate school. My choice of postdoctoral study was based on a seminar I heard Manfred Eigen give at the University of Wisconsin; he was relatively unknown at that time, but I found the work very exciting. Perhaps today’s students are worried too much about these decisions and their importance. My faculty position at MIT was also very fortunate. Walter Stockmayer, a senior professor at MIT and a brilliant scientist, visited Eigen’s laboratory, and I had lunch with him. A job offer followed soon afterward. The incredible catalytic efficiency of enzymes had been long recognized. Indeed, this efficiency of billions, trillions, and even more relative to the uncatalyzed reaction is unparalleled in chemistry. Consequently, the interest of many chemists, particularly organic chemists, was aroused. By 1960, the understanding of enzyme catalysis had advanced beyond the lock and key hypothesis of Emil Fisher, in which the substrate (key) was presumed to fit exactly into the enzyme (lock). This hypothesis dealt with the specificity of enzymes rather than their efficiency. The efficiency of enzymes was first postulated to be due primarily to the close proximity of the amino acid side chains of the enzyme participating in catalysis to the substrate, thereby raising the effective concentration of the catalyst, and to the proper orientation of the catalytic groups of the enzyme. However, the effective concentration of the enzyme cannot be a dominant effect: the concentration of pure water is only 55 m, so an enhancement greater than ∼100 is not possible. Thus, proper orientation of the catalytic groups was assumed to be of predominant importance. In studies of acid-base catalysis of model “substrates,” Tom Bruice and collaborators demonstrated that freezing in the rotational degrees of freedom of the substrates greatly enhanced catalysis, in some cases by more than a factor of a million (2Bruice T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This caused a flurry of rethinking of enzyme catalysis, and a popular way of viewing this process was to view the enzyme as an “entropy trap” that froze the substrate into a particular configuration relative to translation and rotation (3Jencks W.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 219-410PubMed Google Scholar). Many talented organic chemists attempted to create small molecule catalysts that contained acid-base groups required for catalysis and a binding site to dock the substrate. However, to this day, such attempts have not produced a small molecule catalyst that comes close to achieving the efficiency of enzymes. A related approach is to try to proteolyze enzymes to make them smaller than the original molecule of biological origin. This approach has also not been successful: the minimum molecular mass for an efficient enzyme is ∼10,000 Da. In other words, an enzyme must be a macromolecule. The prevalent method for studying the kinetics of enzyme mechanisms in 1960 was steady-state kinetics. Such studies are extremely useful in characterizing the specificity of the active site of the enzyme, in some cases giving a reasonable picture of the active site, and in determining the overall turnover number of the enzyme. Studies of the pH dependence also provide useful information about the approximate pK values of groups involved in catalysis, but identifying the specific side chain is hazardous, as pK values are frequently shifted in enzymes relative to model compounds. Chymotrypsin, in particular, was intensively studied with steady-state kinetic methods, with literally hundreds of such studies being published. Unfortunately, steady-state kinetic studies provide little direct information about reaction intermediates, as the enzyme concentration is too low to detect reaction intermediates directly. In a landmark study, Peller and Alberty (4Peller L. Alberty R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 5907-5914Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar) provided an insightful analysis of steady-state kinetics that indicated exactly what information steady-state kinetics can provide with regard to reaction intermediates and pK determinations. (This is not to negate the use of isotope rate effects and isotope exchange, which have proved extremely useful in mechanistic studies of enzymes, although they, too, are limited with regard to the direct information obtained about reaction intermediates (5Nagel Z. Klinman J.P. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3095-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).) The obvious way to circumvent the shortcomings of steady-state kinetics is to study enzyme catalysis at high concentrations of enzymes. The difficulty with this approach is that because of the extreme catalytic efficiency of enzymes, the reactions become very fast, typically occurring in times <1 s, in fact, usually in the millisecond and microsecond ranges. Stopped-flow methods were available at this time, which extended the observable time range to milliseconds, but their use was not widespread because appropriate equipment had to be home-built. Chance and collaborators, among others, developed this method and found transitions between reaction intermediates in enzyme catalysis, especially with redox systems having visible chromophores such as flavins and porphyrins (6Chance B. Green D.E. Currents in Biochemical Research. Wiley InterScience, New York1956: 308-337Google Scholar). Again, chymotrypsin became a special target with the use of nitrophenol ester substrates: the solution becomes yellow when nitrophenolate ion is formed (7Gutfreund H. Sturtevant J.M. Biochem. J. 1956; 63: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Such experiments provided clear kinetic evidence for the now well known acyl-enzyme intermediate, and its isolation further documented the existence of this reaction intermediate (8Hess G.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 3. Academic Press, New York1970: 213-248Google Scholar). (It should be noted that the extensive studies of chymotrypsin were not due to intrinsic interest in this enzyme, but were motivated primarily by the ease of preparation of large quantities of the enzyme and the relative ease of preparing hundreds of substrates because the enzyme is both a protease and esterase.) The time resolution of the stopped-flow method is limited to a few milliseconds (although with special adaptations, modern instrumentation has achieved submillisecond time resolution). This situation was remedied with the development of relaxation methods by Manfred Eigen and collaborators (9Eigen M. De Maeyer L. Friess S.L. Lewis E.S. Weissberger A. Investigation of Rates and Mechanisms of Reactions. 3r2 Ed. Wiley InterScience, New York1963: 895-1054Google Scholar). These techniques extended the observable time range into the subnanosecond regime. The temperature jump method is especially useful for enzymes, as microsecond time resolution is easily achieved with joule heating via electrical discharge, and submicrosecond times with lasers. These methods also permitted the study of reactions previously deemed to be immeasurably fast, such as protolytic reactions and hydrogen bonding. Studies of model compounds in this instance are important for understanding the role of these elementary steps in enzyme catalysis. When my laboratory entered the field of enzyme mechanisms, we were particularly interested in elucidating the elementary steps in enzyme catalysis using transient kinetics and thermodynamics. By direct observation of reaction intermediates, it was possible to arrive at the details of enzyme mechanisms not previously achieved and to generalize this information into a global picture of enzyme catalysis. I will not dwell on the use of x-ray crystallography in this endeavor. Obviously, this method is essential to arrive at a molecular description of enzyme catalysis. However, as has been often stated, in most cases, static structures of enzymes are observed, and their role in catalysis, a dynamic process, must be inferred. In addition to studying enzyme mechanisms, we devoted a considerable effort to determining the rates of the elementary steps involved in protein conformational changes and the role of cooperativity in the rates of protein conformational changes. This knowledge is critical in developing a general model for enzyme catalysis. Although my laboratory worked with a large number of different enzymes, I will discuss only the results obtained with ribonuclease A and aspartate aminotransferase, as these were studied in considerable detail and illustrate the type of information that can be obtained with thermodynamic and transient kinetic methods. Ribonuclease was selected for study because it is a relatively small enzyme (∼14,000 Da) and could be obtained in pure form commercially. It had been extensively studied with physical and chemical methods, so considerable information was available about its structure and function (10Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of the enzyme was being determined in two laboratories with x-ray crystallographic methods. Although physiologically ribonuclease catalyzes the breakdown of RNA, small molecule substrates could be obtained relatively easily, either commercially or by synthesis. The breakdown of a dinucleoside occurs in two steps: formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, followed by hydrolysis into a 3′-nucleotide phosphate. The enzyme has a strong preference for cytidine and uridine in the cyclic phosphate. Steady-state kinetic studies of the breakdown of dinucleosides into the cyclic phosphate intermediate and of the hydrolysis of the cyclic phosphate yielded turnover numbers in the range of 2000–3000 s–1 and Michaelis constants in the range of 1–5 mm. Temperature jump studies of ribonuclease produced immediate results: the native enzyme was found to exist in two conformations that interconvert in the microsecond time domain. Furthermore, this interconversion is pH-dependent and is associated with a pK of ∼6.1. (The specific amino acid involved is histidine 48.) Studies of the association of pyrimidine 3′-phosphates with the enzyme indicated that the expected bimolecular reaction is followed by a conformational change of the enzyme occurring in the microsecond time domain. Investigating the interaction of dinucleosides and pyrimidine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates with ribonuclease was a bit trickier, as the overall hydrolysis of dinucleosides is essentially irreversible. To circumvent this problem, an entirely new method was devised, namely a stopped-flow temperature jump, in which the substrate is rapidly mixed with the enzyme, and a temperature jump is applied within milliseconds of the mixing. At this point in time, I moved to Cornell University as a Professor of Chemistry (1965), and I enjoyed 23 wonderful and productive years. I was fortunate to be recruited to Cornell by Harold Scheraga, who, in addition to becoming a close friend, was a leader in the study of the chemical and physical properties of ribonuclease. The results obtained with the stopped-flow temperature jump revealed a pattern similar to that obtained in studies of the pyrimidine 3′-phosphates, namely the bimolecular reaction is followed by a conformational change. These results were noteworthy for two reasons. First, the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction between enzyme and substrates is very large, approaching the limit for a diffusion-controlled reaction. Such large bimolecular rate constants appear to be typical for enzymes in general. Second, the binding of substrates is followed by a conformational change, again a general finding for enzyme reactions. A schematic view of the overall mechanism is shown in Scheme 1 (11Hammes G.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 1968; 1: 321-329Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This mechanism already displays a very important attribute of enzyme mechanisms in general, namely that many intermediates and conformational states of the enzymes are involved in the catalytic process. A detailed modeling of the pH dependence of the hydrolysis of cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate revealed an even larger number of potential pathways, including parallel paths, in the mechanism (12Erman J.E. Hammes G.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 5607-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These kinetic results can be rationalized in terms of the structure of the enzyme that emerged after the kinetic studies were largely completed. The molecule is kidney-shaped with short helices packed against a central β-pleated sheet. The enzyme also has a long N-terminal helix. The overall structure is stabilized by four disulfide bonds. The substrate-binding pocket is a groove, as might be envisaged for an enzyme that hydrolyzes RNA. Knowledge of the enzyme structure has led to the development of a structural model for the reaction. Conformational changes that occur as the reaction proceeds are very small. The dynamic equilibrium found in the unliganded enzyme can be envisaged as an opening and closing of the groove. Histidine 48 is at the top of the hinge, and its protonation state is important for this process. More direct evidence for the role of this residue in the conformational change of the isolated enzyme and in the catalytic reaction has been obtained recently with nuclear magnetic resonance methods (13Watt E.D. Shimada H. Kovrigin E.L. Loria J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11981-11986Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). When the substrate binds, the hinge closes, squeezing out water and creating a hydrophobic environment. The reaction then proceeds through a series of proton transfer reactions involving histidines 12 and 119 and a pentacoordinated intermediate. The details of these reactions will not be considered here. The hinge then opens to release the product. An important finding for later considerations is that iodination of tyrosines far from the active site alters the catalytic properties of the enzyme (14Hammes G.G. Walz F Jr G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 604-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This suggests that the integrity of the entire structure is important for catalysis and that communication occurs between the active site and residues quite distant from the site. A second enzyme selected for detailed study was aspartate aminotransferase. The reason for selecting this enzyme was entirely happenstance, although in retrospect, it turned out to be a great choice. When I was a postdoctoral fellow in Germany, I used some of my National Science Foundation travel money to visit the laboratory of Professor Rossi-Fanelli in Rome. He spoke no English, and I spoke no Italian. After a brief discussion in German, he turned me over to an assistant professor, Paolo Fasella, who spoke fluent English. I also discovered that he was married to the sister of a classmate of mine at Princeton. Paolo was working on aspartate aminotransferase, and thus, a long-term collaboration and lifelong friendship began. This involved many visits back and forth between our laboratories, including an extended stay by Paolo and his family when I was at MIT. Aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to ketoglutarate to give glutamate and oxalacetate. This mitochondrial enzyme was nontrivial to prepare, as it required fresh pig hearts as the starting material. Obtaining fresh pig hearts from slaughterhouses was far from an enjoyable task. The advantages of the enzyme were 2-fold. 1) The reaction could be easily studied in two parts, namely the addition of the amino group from either amino acid to enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate and the subsequent transfer of the amino group from pyridoxamine phosphate to either keto acid. 2) The enzyme-bound cofactor served as a wonderful spectral probe of the reaction in the visible region of the spectrum (∼300–500 nm). Our first temperature jump experiments with aspartate aminotransferase were encouraging in that they clearly showed the transition between the aldimine (360 nm) and ketimine (330 nm) intermediates, but were disappointing in that they did not reveal other reaction intermediates. Nevertheless, we continued to pursue characterization of the enzyme and its mechanism, and other intermediates soon emerged (15Fasella P. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The culmination of the investigation of aspartate aminotransferase occurred when we found a substrate that slowed down the reaction somewhat, β-erythro-aspartic acid (16Hammes G.G. Haslam J.L. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This allowed us to detect a very large number of intermediates. The analysis of the 11 relaxation times observed proved challenging, but in the end, we were able to delineate a detailed mechanism with seven intermediates in the transition from the initial pryridoxal enzyme to the intermediate pyridoxamine enzyme (15 intermediates for the overall reaction!). As an added bonus, we were able to determine the spectra of all of the intermediates. The mechanism of the half-reaction obtained is summarized in Scheme 2. The initial formation of the enzyme with the substrate is followed by a conformational change prior to formation of an aldimine with the substrate and pyridoxal phosphate. The enzyme then forms a quinoid structure with maximum absorption at 490 nm. The ketimine form of the enzyme substrate follows, which in turn becomes the enzyme-keto acid complex. A conformational change then occurs, and the keto acid and pyridoxamine substrate are formed. I do not know of any other enzyme for which so many intermediates have been directly observed. Some years after our kinetic studies, the crystal structure of the enzyme was determined, along with the structures of the enzyme complexed with various inhibitors and substrates (17Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F.A. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 187-285Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of ∼45,000 Da. The two identical catalytic sites are formed from two different (identical) polypeptide chains. The active site has two clearly defined conformations, open and closed. The mechanism proposed on the basis of the crystal structures exactly parallels the mechanism derived from the kinetic studies, but in addition, details of the molecular interactions between the protein and substrate are delineated. Following the initial binding, a significant conformational change occurs as the polypeptide chains close around the substrate. This closed conformation sequesters the amino acid substrate from the solvent, and the sequence of aldimine-substrate, quinoid, ketimine-substrate, keto acid-pyridoxamine occurs within this closed structure. The conformation then switches to the open form to permit dissociation of the keto acid. Thus, the mechanism for aspartate aminotransferase has many of the same features as that for ribonuclease, namely multiple intermediates and conformational changes. In the case of the Escherichia coli form of this enzyme, it has been demonstrated that residues not at the active site influence the catalysis (18Gloss I.M. Spencer D.E. Kirsch J.F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This view of enzyme catalysis is buttressed by many other experiments with these and other enzymes that are not discussed here. As part of my goal of dissecting enzyme mechanisms into all of the individual steps and intermediates, knowledge of more elementary steps, such as protolysis, hydrogen bonding, and alterations in water structure, was essential. In a 1963 review, Eigen and I summarized current knowledge of these elementary steps (19Eigen M. Hammes G.G. Adv. Enzymol. 1963; 25: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar). Eigen and collaborators had done an impressive job with protolytic reactions, reactions deemed too fast to measure before the advent of relaxation methods. In fact, for most protolytic reactions, the rates can be calculated at least as accurately as they can be measured because the reactions of protons and hydroxyl ions with acids and bases are diffusion-limited, except for a few exceptional cases. The implications of these findings for enzymes were 2-fold: an upper limit of ∼103 s–1 for turnover numbers of enzymes utilizing water in the proton transfer reactions and an upper limit of ∼105–106 s–1 for enzymes utilizing direct proton transfer from enzyme to substrate. This discourse will not consider the details of proton transfer reactions in enzyme catalysis, although they are obviously of great importance. I will continue to focus on reaction intermediates and conformational changes. At the time of the review, there was scant information regarding the second-order rate constant characterizing the combination of enzyme and substrate, although the limited information available suggested that this rate constant was close to its diffusion-controlled limit. At the present time, it seems quite clear that this is the case, but most of the second-order rate constants seem to fall somewhat short of the diffusion-controlled limit (20Hammes G.G. Schimmel P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 2. Academic Press, New York1970: 67-114Google Scholar). It should be noted that for a reaction to be diffusion-limited, it is necessary for the step following the initial combination of enzyme and substrate to be faster than diffusion apart of the reactants; therefore, diffusion-limited reactions are indirect evidence for a conformational change following the combination of enzyme and substrate. To characterize protein conformational changes better, we decided to study the kinetics of simpler systems such as hydrogen bonding and alterations in water structure (21Hammes G.G. Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar). In addition, transformations such as the helix-coil interconversion in polypeptides were probed. The primary tool used initially was ultrasonic attenuation measurements. Later in time, temperature jump methods (many in other laboratories) would prove very useful. For simple hydrogen bonding reactions such as dimer formation with 2-pyridone, the reaction is always diffusion-controlled. This implies that the rate of hydrogen bonding after the monomers have diffused together is of the order of 1011− 1012 s–1. The rate of water structure breakdown in pure water can be derived from the frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant and was known to be ∼1012 s–1. On the other hand, the first-order rate constant for the breakdown of water structure around a simple polymer such as polyethylene glycol was found to be ∼108 s–1 from ultrasonic attenuation measurements. The reason for this relatively small first-order rate constant is that water structure is formed around the polymer, and the breakdown and formation of this structure are cooperative, i.e. they involve multiple water molecules. This is one of the simplest examples of an organized or cooperative system, but demonstrates an important point: cooperative processes occur much slower than the individual elementary steps. In simple terms, this is because initiation of the change becomes rate-limiting. Perhaps a more relevant example of a cooperative process is the helix-coil transition in polypeptides: the rate constants associated with this process lie in the range of 107–108 s–1 (22Hammes G.G. Roberts P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 1812-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Williams K. Causgrove T.P. Glilmanshen R. Fang K.S. Callendar R.H. Woodruff W.H. Dyer R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 24Thompson P.A. Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9200-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The rate constant associated with formation and breakdown of β-sheet structures is somewhat less, ∼106 s–1 (25Munoz V. Thompson P.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1997; 300: 196-199Crossref Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Another cooperative process of importance in biological systems, namely the stacking and unstacking of bases in nucleic acids, has characteristic rate constants in the range of 106–107 s–1 (26Dewey T.G. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5757-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on the above analysis, the fact that the observed conformational transitions in enzymes are much slower than the elementary steps involved implies that these conformational changes are highly cooperative. Other evidence also suggests that these changes are highly cooperative. This evidence includes the following: 1) the alteration of enzyme activity and, as will be discussed below, conformational changes by modification of amino acids distant from the active site; 2) the fact that enzymes must be fairly large macromolecules to function (more than ≈10,000 Da); 3) failure to synthesize small molecules that approach enzymatic efficiency; and 4) theoretical analyses, also to be discussed below. This does not imply that all conformational transitions within proteins are cooperative. Proteins are dynamic structures, and rapid motions of single amino acids or of a few amino acids have been observed by a variety of methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance and fluorescence polarization. Such motions are generally not cooperative in nature and are generally too fast to be directly involved in enzyme catalysis. Instead, these motions will be equilibrated during the relatively slower steps involved in enzyme catalysis. However, both the rates and equilibrium characteristics of these motions may be altered by slower conformational changes and other catalytic events. Consequently, it is important to characterize all of the potential conformations of the protein in structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic terms. By the 1970s, it was well established that enzyme catalysis proceeds through a large number of intermediates and involves cooperative conformational changes. The question of how this creates efficient enzyme catalysis was still a matter of speculation, however. I referred earlier to the more obvious factors of a high effective concentration of the catalyst, exact orientation of catalytic groups, and restriction of substrate rotational freedom. A popular term for the conformational change following the initial binding of substrates to enzyme was “induced fit.” This term was coined by Dan Koshland, an exceptional enzymologist and great wordsmith (27Koshland Jr., D.E. Adv. Enzymol. 1960; 22: 45-97PubMed Google Scholar). The implication is that the conformational change creates a conformation that binds the substrate better than the free enzyme, and the enzyme adapts a shape fitting the substrate better. This is a very attractive picture but does not explain why the conformational change enhances catalysis. In point of fact, from the standpoint of thermodynamics, any change in conformation must bind the substrate better or it"
https://openalex.org/W2013411504,"Background The architectural organization of protein structures has been the focus of intense research since it can hopefully lead to an understanding of how proteins fold. In earlier works we had attempted to identify the inherent structural organization in proteins through a study of protein topology. We obtained a modular partitioning of protein structures with the modules correlating well with experimental evidence of early folding units or “foldons”. Residues that connect different modules were shown to be those that were protected during the transition phase of folding. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work, we follow the topological path of ubiquitin through molecular dynamics unfolding simulations. We observed that the use of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) could lead to the identification of the transition state during unfolding. Additionally, our earlier contention that the modules uncovered through our graph partitioning approach correlated well with early folding units was vindicated through our simulations. Moreover, residues identified from native structure as connector hubs and which had been shown to be those that were protected during the transition phase of folding were indeed more stable (less flexible) well beyond the transition state. Further analysis of the topological pathway suggests that the all pairs shortest path in a protein is minimized during folding. Conclusions We observed that treating a protein native structure as a network by having amino acid residues as nodes and the non-covalent interactions among them as links allows for the rationalization of many aspects of the folding process. The possibility to derive this information directly from 3D structure opens the way to the prediction of important residues in proteins, while the confirmation of the minimization of APSP for folding allows for the establishment of a potentially useful proxy for kinetic optimality in the validation of sequence-structure predictions."

Recent data suggests that dopamine can regulate expression of progestin receptors within restricted regions of the developing rat brain by activating estrogen receptors in a ligand-independent manner. It is unclear whether changes in neuronal activity induced by dopaminergic activation of estrogen receptors are also region specific. To investigate this question, we examined where the dopamine D1-like receptor agonist, SKF 38393, altered Fos expression via estrogen receptor activation. We report that dopamine D1-like receptor agonist treatment increased Fos protein expression within many regions of the developing female rat brain. More importantly, prior treatment with an estrogen receptor antagonist partially reduced D1-like receptor agonist-induced Fos expression only within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the central amygdala. These data suggest that dopaminergic activation of estrogen receptors alters neuronal activity within restricted regions of the developing rat brain. This implies that ligand-independent activation of estrogen receptors by dopamine might organize a unique set of behaviors during brain development in contrast to the more wide spread ligand activation of estrogen receptors by estrogen."

We have evaluated the immunogenicity, persistence of immune response, immune memory and safety of an investigational DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC conjugate vaccine given to infants in Northern Ghana.In this phase II, double blind, randomized, controlled study, 280 infants were primed with DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC or DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. At 12 months of age, children in each group received a challenge dose of serogroup A+C polysaccharides. Antibody responses were assessed pre, and one month-post dose 3 of the priming schedule and pre and 1 month after administration of the challenge dose. One month post-dose 3, 87.8% and 88.2% of subjects in the study group had bactericidal meningococcal serogroup A (SBA-MenA) and meningococcal serogroup C (SBA-MenC) antibody titres > or = 1:8 respectively. Seroprotection/seropositivity rates to the 5 antigens administered in the routine EPI schedule were non-inferior in children in the study group compared to those in the control group. The percentages of subjects in the study group with persisting SBA-MenA titres > or = 1:8 or SBA-MenC titres > or = 1:8 at the age of 12 months prior to challenge were significantly higher than in control group (47.7% vs 25.7% and 56.4% vs 5.1% respectively). The administration of 10 microg of serogroup A polysaccharide increased the SBA-MenA GMT by 14.0-fold in the DTPW-HBV/HibMenAC-group compared to a 3.8 fold increase in the control-group. Corresponding fold-increases in SBA-MenC titres following challenge with 10 microg of group C polysaccharide were 18.8 and 1.9 respectively. Reactogenicity following primary vaccination or the administration of the challenge dose was similar in both groups, except for swelling (Grade 3) after primary vaccination which was more frequent in children in the vaccine than in the control group (23.7%; 95%CI [19.6-28.1] of doses vs 14.1%; 95% CI [10.9-17.8] of doses). Fifty-nine SAEs (including 8 deaths), none of them related to vaccination, were reported during the entire study.Three dose primary vaccination with DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC was non-inferior to DTPw-HBV/Hib for the 5 common antigens used in the routine EPI schedule and induced bactericidal antibodies against Neisseria meningitidis of serogroups A and C in the majority of infants. Serogroup A and C bactericidal antibody levels had fallen below titres associated with protection in nearly half of the infants by the age of 12 months confirming that a booster dose is required at about that age. An enhanced memory response was shown after polysaccharide challenge. This vaccine could provide protection against 7 important childhood diseases (including meningococcal A and C) and be of particular value in countries of the African meningitis belt.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN35754083."
https://openalex.org/W2027086933,"Mutations in human α-skeletal actin have been implicated in causing congenital nemaline myopathy, a disease characterized histopathologically by nemaline bodies in skeletal muscle and manifested in the patient as skeletal muscle weakness. Here we investigate the functional effects of three severe nemaline myopathy mutations (V43F, A138P, and R183G) in human α-skeletal actin. Wild-type and mutant actins were expressed and purified from the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The mutations are located in different subdomains of actin; Val-43 is located in a flexible loop of subdomain 2, Ala-138 is near a hydrophobic cleft in the “hinge” region between subdomains 1 and 3, and Arg-183 is near the nucleotide-binding site. None of the three mutations affected the folding of the actin monomer, the velocity at which skeletal myosin moves actin in an in vitro motility assay, or the relative average isometric force supported by F-actin. Defects in fundamental actomyosin interactions are, therefore, unlikely to account for the muscle weakness observed in affected patients. There were, however, significant changes observed in the polymerization kinetics of V43F and A138P and in the rate of nucleotide release for V43F. No detectable defect was found for R183G. If these subtle changes in polymerization observed in vitro are amplified in the context of the sarcomere, it could in principle be one of the primary insults that triggers the development of nemaline myopathy.

Actin is an ubiquitous and highly conserved protein in muscle and non-muscle cells. There are greater than 90 mutations, including three recently discovered null mutations (1Nowak K.J. Sewry C.A. Navarro C. Squier W. Reina C. Ricoy J.R. Jayawant S.S. Childs A.M. Dobbie J.A. Appleton R.E. Mountford R.C. Walker K.R. Clement S. Barois A. Muntoni F. Romero N.B. Laing N.G. Ann.

These congenital myopathies are distinguished by the histopathological characteristics of muscle biopsies from affected patients. The presence of rod-like structures or “nemaline bodies” that appear to originate from the Z-discs in the sarcoplasm and contain deposits of actin and Z-line proteins (4Conen P.E. Murphy E.G.

How or why these nemaline rods form is unknown. Their presence in NM patients with homozygous ACTA1 null mutations, which lack human α-skeletal actin but retain reduced levels of the α-cardiac fetal isoform, and under non-NM myopathic conditions (7Karpati G. Carpenter S. Eisen A.A. Arch. Neurol. 1972; 27: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Kawabuchi M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1982; 41: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggests that the development of these rods may occur in any muscle tissue where an imbalance of sarcomeric proteins exists (1Nowak K.J. Sewry C.A. Navarro C. Squier W. Reina C. Ricoy J.R. Jayawant S.S. Childs A.M. Dobbie J.A. Appleton R.E. Mountford R.C. Walker K.R. Clement S. Barois A. Muntoni F. Romero N.B. Laing N.G. Ann. Neurol. 2007; 61: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Clinically, patients with NM present with non-progressive or slowly progressive skeletal muscle weakness resulting largely from dominant de novo point mutations. This means that the afflicted patients have a combination of a mutant actin with a single amino acid change and the wild-type actin in their muscles. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of NM has been complicated by the genetic heterogeneity (mutations in five different thin filament genes lead to the same disease) and phenotypic heterogeneity (mutations in the same gene lead to a wide range of clinical severities) that have been observed in patients (9Agrawal P.B. Strickland C.D. Midgett C. Morales A. Newburger D.E. Poulos M.A. Tomczak K.K. Ryan M.M. Iannaccone S.T. Crawford T.O. Laing N.G. Beggs A.H. Ann.

Several approaches have been used to study the effects of actin NM mutations, including in vitro transcription/translation systems, C2C12 and NIH3T3 cell transfections, and analyses of actin purified from human muscle biopsies. A wide range of effects were observed, including but not limited to polymerization defects, folding defects, or actin-binding protein interaction defects in vitro and aggregation in vivo (11Bathe F.S.

Until recently, an in-depth study of actin mutations at the molecular level has been limited to yeast actin since a suitable in vitro expression system that yielded milligram quantities of human actin was unavailable. Now that the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system for expressing and purifying milligram amounts of pure human α-skeletal actin has been developed (16Anthony Akkari P. Nowak K.J. Beckman K. Walker K.R. Schachat F. Laing N.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Bookwalter C.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 111-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), analysis of human disease mutations are best studied in the appropriate context. This is the approach we have taken to investigate at the molecular level the primary defects of several actin NM mutations. Three ACTA1 point mutations, V43F, A138P, and R183G (Fig. 1) were chosen for individual analysis. Any one of these mutations causes severe NM in patients, a phenotypic classification that indicates a high probability of death within the first year of life. Val-43 is located in a flexible loop of subdomain 2 that binds to DNase I (20Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), Ala-138 is located near a hydrophobic cleft in the hinge region between subdomains 1 and 3, and Arg-183, near the active site, adopts different conformations in the presence of ATP or ADP (21Rould M.A. Wan Q. Joel P.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31909-31919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We surveyed the effects of these three point mutations on several functional properties of actin and on the interaction of myosin with actin. None of the three mutations affected the folding of the actin monomer, the velocity at which skeletal myosin moves actin in an in vitro motility assay, or the relative average isometric force supported by F-actin. However, changes in the rate of nucleotide release, the polymerization kinetics, and the qualitative behavior of the actin mutants during the motility assays were observed. If these subtle changes observed in vitro are amplified in the context of the sarcomere, they could in principle trigger the development of NM. Additional work in a cellular context with a more extensive battery of mutants will be necessary to understand if there is a common molecular mechanism by which these mutations lead to a clinical manifestation of nemaline myopathy. Plasmid Construction—The coding sequence for wild-type α-skeletal actin (WT) was created by site-directed mutagenesis of the Drosophila 5C actin gene (gift from Loy Volkman). The untagged WT-actin was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcUW51 (BD Biosciences) behind the p10 promoter. N- or C-terminal FLAG-tagged versions of the WT actin were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcSG2 (BD Biosciences) behind the polyhedron promoter. The C-FLAG actin contained a thrombin cleavage site (amino acid sequence LVPRGS) between the protein and the FLAG tag. The FLAG tag at the N terminus was followed by a linker sequence (AMGAL) and either a thrombin or a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (amino acid sequence ENLYFQD). For both N-FLAG actin constructs, a Kozak sequence (GCCGCCACC), which is thought to enhance expression (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar), was added just before the start site. Actin mutants (V43F, A138P, and R183G) were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the untagged WT template. All constructs were sequenced to verify their correctness. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Actins—Recombinant baculovirus were prepared according to established protocols (23O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Untagged actins were expressed and purified using previously described methods (17Bookwalter C.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16777-16784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with a few minor changes. Notably, the elution gradient from the Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column (50-ml bed volume, 1.5 × 48 cm) was 0.15–0.45 m NaCl. Also, the final F-actin was depolymerized by dialysis against G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 3 days and then clarified at 350,000 × g for 40 min. Tagged actins were harvested from infected Sf9 cells after 72 h and lysed in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 m KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml Tween 20, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin for 1.5 h (50 ml/1 billion cells). After clarification at 178,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight into 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Na2ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The dialysate was clarified at 25,000 × g for 30 min and then incubated with FLAG resin (Sigma) for 1.5 h. The resin was washed with 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaN3, and 0.2 mm Na2ATP until the A280 was negligible. Bound protein was eluted from the resin using 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaN3, and 0.2 mm Na2ATP. Fractions containing measurable amounts of protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight into G-buffer. The protein was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.). The typical yield of tagged-actin was ∼2–2.5 mg/3 billion cells. Actin concentration was determined from the absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 ml mg–1 cm–1. Actin either was used within 5 days or was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the G-actin state after the addition of 2 mg of sucrose per 1 mg of actin. Chicken Skeletal Protein Purification—Chicken skeletal actin was used as a control in all experimental assays and was purified from chicken pectoralis acetone powder according to methods previously described (24Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal myosin for the in vitro motility and average force assays was purified using established methods (25Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and then stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol. Preparation of Unlabeled and Labeled Actin for the Polymerization Assay—Recombinant human skeletal and chicken skeletal G-actins were polymerized by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 m KCl for 1 h at room temperature. The F-actin was then depolymerized for 3 days with three changes of G buffer and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 350,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) to isolate pure monomeric actin, free of oligomers. The actin was stored on ice and used within 1 week. Oregon Green (OG)-labeled actin was prepared by modification of previously described methods (26Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal F-actin was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 10 mm imidazole, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, 1 mm NaN3. The sulfhydryls were reduced by the addition of 2 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature. The actin was then dialyzed overnight with 2 changes of buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm NaN3) to remove the DTT. Using a fresh 10 mm solution of OG 488 iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) in N,N-dimethylformamide, a 10–15-fold molar excess of label was added dropwise to the actin with stirring and then gently stirred overnight at 4 °C. OG-labeled actin filaments were pelleted at 350,000 × g for 1.5 h and then depolymerized for 3 days against two changes of G buffer followed by dialysis into G6.5 buffer (5 mm PIPES-Tris, pH 6.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3). The actin was clarified at 350,000 × g for 30 min and applied to a 1 × 5-cm column of DEAE-cellulose DE53 (Whatman) equilibrated in G6.5 buffer. OG and unlabeled actins were separated using a 100–350 mm KCl gradient in G6.5 buffer. The absorbance at 491 nm was used to determine the fractions containing labeled actin, which were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 3 changes of G buffer. The labeled actin was concentrated ∼20-fold using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and dialyzed overnight against 2 changes of G buffer. The labeled actin was clarified a final time at 350,000 × g for 30 min. The concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 290 and 491 nm using E491 = 77,800 m–1 cm–1 as the extinction coefficient for OG and a correction for OG absorbance at 290 nm (corrected A290 = A290 – 0.16991 × A491). The stoichiometry of labeling was 0.9 mol/mol of actin. Labeled actin was stored on ice at 4 °C and used within 4 weeks to visualize actin polymerization. TEV Protease—The TEV protease (autoinactivation-resistant mutant S219V; see the website of Dr. D. Waugh at the National Cancer Institute, Frederick for information) was isolated from an Escherichia coli strain (BL21(DE3)-RIL/pRK793) using previously described methods (27Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Induced bacterial cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) and sonicated for 10 min in pulse mode (0.5 s “on” and 0.5 s “off”). After clarification at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was removed and applied to a prepared HIS6 column (HIS-Select, Sigma) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Proteins binding nonspecifically were removed by washing with 30 mm imidazole lysis buffer. The TEV protease was then eluted in lysis buffer using a linear gradient to 200 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the TEV protease were pooled, and EDTA and DTT were added to final concentrations of 1 mm. The protein was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.) and then dialyzed overnight into 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT. After centrifugation at 350,000 × g for 15 min the protease was separated into aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Enzymatic Reactions—Digests to remove the FLAG tag from actin (100 μg) with thrombin (Haemtech, Essex Junction, VT, 0.1 units) were performed in 5 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mm NaCl at room temperature for 3 h. Reactions were stopped with 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin (Sigma) and 50 mm N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (Sigma). TEV protease digests, to remove the N-terminal FLAG tag from actin (1:10 enzyme:substrate ratio), were performed at room temperature for 3 h in 5 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP buffer. The trypsin (Sigma) digest (1:25 enzyme:substrate ratio) of Mg-G-actin (C-FLAG) was performed at room temperature for 1 h in 5 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP buffer. The reaction was stopped with 3 mm N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride. Thermal Denaturation—Unfolding of actin was assayed using a DNase-I inhibition assay according to the methods described in Blikstad et al. (28Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1978; 15: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and Schuler et al. (29Schuler H. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) modified by (17Bookwalter C.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16777-16784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A plot of the percent of DNase I inhibition as a function of temperature (25–66 °C) was fitted with the curve (y = 0 + 100/(1 + exp(–(x – x0)/b))) to determine the melting temperature (Tm; x0 in the equation), defined as the 50% point of DNase-I inhibition. Rate of Nucleotide Release—The rate of ATP dissociation from G-actin was measured by following the fluorescence decrease of etheno-ATP (ϵ-ATP; Molecular Probes) using methods previously described (21Rould M.A. Wan Q. Joel P.B. Lowey S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31909-31919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Unbound ATP was removed from 10 μm actin by the addition of 10% by volume of 50% Dowex AG-1 × 8 resin (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in assay buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 μm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT). The slurry was mixed for 1 min, and the resin was removed by centrifugation. This step was repeated twice more followed by high speed centrifugation (350,000 × g) for 20 min to remove remaining resin. After incubation of the actin with 100 μm ϵ-ATP for a minimum of 2 h on ice, the excess ϵ-ATP was removed by treatment with Dowex resin 3 times as before. A final high speed centrifugation (350,000 × g) step removed the remaining resin. G-actin was diluted to 2 μm with assay buffer just before measurement of nucleotide release at 25 °C. The decrease in fluorescence of ϵ-ATP as a function of time after the addition of 100 μm non-fluorescent ATP was fitted with a single exponential decay curve. t tests were used to determine significance (p < 0.05). In Vitro Motility and Relative Isometric Force Assays—Chicken skeletal myosin was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (30Malmqvist U.P. Aronshtam A. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15058-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) immediately preceding the assay to remove myosin that was functionally compromised. Actin filament velocity was then measured using methods described previously (31Trybus K.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, skeletal myosin was added to nitrocellulose-coated flow cells at 100 μg/ml. The surface was then blocked by 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Next, an unlabeled actin/ATP wash was used (1 μm vortexed actin followed by the addition of 1 mm ATP) to “block” myosin molecules unable to dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. The velocity of rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled filaments at 30 °C was visualized upon the addition of ATP in motility buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5% methylcellulose, 1 mm MgATP, 10 mm DTT, 2.9 mg/ml glucose, 0.125 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), and 0.023 mg/ml catalase (Sigma)). To determine the velocity for each actin species, a semi-automated filament tracking program (a gift from D. A. Winkelmann, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ) was used to determine a weighted probability of the actin filament velocities of at least 500 filaments as described previously (32Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Wang Q. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4227-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A gaussian distribution fitted to a plot of probability versus velocity generated a mean ± S.D. t tests were used to determine significance (p < 0.05). Isometric force in the motility assay was measured using previously described methods (17Bookwalter C.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16777-16784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Malmqvist U.P. Aronshtam A. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15058-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Varying concentrations of α-actinin, an actin-binding protein, were added to the motility assay to create an internal load on the actin filament until movement was stopped. T-tests were used to determine significance (p < 0.05). Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Assay for Actin Polymerization—The kinetics of polymerization at the barbed end of actin were measured using direct observation of polymerization with TIRF microscopy, based on modifications to the methods developed by Kuhn and Pollard (26Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A 20-μl flow cell chamber was created by using two different sized coverslips (bottom, 24 × 60 mm Corning no. 1; top, 22-mm square Corning no. 1) separated by 0.125 μm Mylar shim strips placed along the long axis of the bottom coverslip. Just before assembly, the shims were dipped in an adhesive (Norland no. 61, Cranbury, NJ) that can be cured under UV light to seal the flow cell on two sides. The actin for each experiment (stored as a 10–15 μm Ca-ATP-actin stock) was prepared for polymerization by adding a 110 part of 10× exchange buffer (10 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2) and then diluting with G buffer to 2× the final actin concentration (2–6 μm) followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. The flow cell was prepared at room temperature by addition of (a)20 μl of 0.2 μm N-ethylmaleamide-inactivated myosin for 1 min, (b)20 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 600 mm NaCl), and (c) 20 μl of 1% BSA in low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl). Excess solution was removed from the flow cell with a Q-tip. To visualize polymerization of 1–3 μm actin at 30 °C, 15 μl of 2× actin (containing 30% OG labeled actin) was quickly mixed with 15 μl of 2× TIRF buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 200 mm DTT, 0.4 mm ATP, 30 mm glucose, 1% methylcellulose, 40 μg/ml catalase, and 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase), and 20 μl was flowed through the flow cell chamber using a Q-tip or filter paper. If the time course for data collection was longer than 5 min, the ends of the flow cell were sealed with vacuum grease to prevent evaporation. A Nikon TE2000-U microscope equipped with a PlanApo objective lens (×100, numerical aperture 1.45) for through-the-objective TIRF was used for all experiments. Actin filaments were visualized in TIRF mode through a ChromaHQ560/80 filter after excitation with an argon laser (488 nm, Spectra-Physics model 133). To decrease the amount of photobleaching, a neutral density filter was used to lower the laser intensity. Filaments were detected at 200× magnification using an image-intensified digital charge-coupled device camera (DVC Intensicam IV S, Austin, TX). Image-capturing software (QED Imaging, Pittsburgh, PA) allowed the recording of digital images (an average of 2–6 frames) every 2–10 s for 1.5–20 min depending upon the actin concentration. Barbed end growth rates (subunits/s) of 10 individual actin filaments at each actin concentration were determined manually from each TIFF stack using Image J (National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) assuming a monomer length of 5.4 nm. The average growth rate at a minimum of four actin concentrations was plotted against actin concentration and fitted with a linear regression to determine the barbed end association rate (slope), dissociation rate (y intercept), and critical concentration (x intercept) for each experiment. Expression of Human α-Skeletal Actins—Our original strategy was to engineer a FLAG tag at the N or C terminus of actin to facilitate purification of expressed human α-skeletal actin by affinity chromatography (Fig. 2A). Because the location and the type of tag (FLAG, His6 or Myc) have been shown to perturb actin function (34Brault V. Sauder U. Reedy M.C. Aebi U. Schoenenberger C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Buzan J. Du J. Karpova T. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2823-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 36Rommelaere H. Waterschoot D. Neirynck K. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biol. Proced. Online. 2004; 6: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a thrombin cleavage site was engineered to allow for tag removal. Typical yields before tag cleavage were ∼0.75 mg of actin/billion Sf9 cells. Surprisingly, thrombin was incapable of removing the FLAG tag at either the N or C terminus (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the FLAG tag or the structure of the tagged actin interfered with thrombin recognizing its cleavage site. The C-terminal FLAG tag could, however, be removed by digestion of Mg-G-actin with trypsin, which cleaves after Arg-372 and Lys-373 (37Mossakowska M. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resulting actin was not a viable alternative for our structure/function studies because removal of the C-terminal residues has significant effects on actin function (37Mossakowska M. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Mossakowska M. Wozniak A. Moraczewska J. Nakayama H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We next engineered a TEV protease cleavage site between the N-terminal FLAG tag and Asp-1 of actin such that no additional amino acids would remain after proteolytic digestion."

The positive sense RNA genome of JV is organised into ORF1 (non-structural proteins), ORF2 (major capsid protein) and ORF3 (minor capsid protein). The lack of a cell culture system for studying JV replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing. Principal Findings Only two of the three major ORF1 proteins were identified (p110 and 2C) following in vitro translation of JV RNA, the N-term protein was not detected. The N-term encoding genomic sequence (5′GS) was tested for IRES-like function in a bi-cistronic system and displayed no evidence of IRES-like activity. The site of translation initiation in JV was determined to be at the predicted nucleotide 22. Following the insertion of an epitope within the 5′GS the JV N-term protein was identified in vitro and within RNA transfected cells. Conclusions The in vitro transcription/translation system is currently the best system for analysing protein synthesis and processing in JV. Unlike similarly studied human noroviruses JV initially did not appear to express the N-terminal protein, presenting the possibility that the encoding RNA sequence had a regulatory function, most likely involved in translation initiation in an IRES-like manner. This was not the case and, following determination of the site of translation initiation the N-term protein was detected using an epitope tag, both in vitro and in vivo. Although slightly larger than predicted the N-term protein was detected in a processed form in vivo, thus not only demonstrating initial translation of the ORF1 polyprotein but also activity of the viral protease. These findings indicate that the block to noroviral replication in cultured cells lies elsewhere."
