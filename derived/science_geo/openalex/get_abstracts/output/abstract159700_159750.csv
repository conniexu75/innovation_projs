https://openalex.org/W2035587516,"A record of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene, obtained from the Dome Concordia, Antarctica, ice core, reveals that an increase of 76 parts per million by volume occurred over a period of 6000 years in four clearly distinguishable intervals. The close correlation between CO 2 concentration and Antarctic temperature indicates that the Southern Ocean played an important role in causing the CO 2 increase. However, the similarity of changes in CO 2 concentration and variations of atmospheric methane concentration suggests that processes in the tropics and in the Northern Hemisphere, where the main sources for methane are located, also had substantial effects on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2099667979,"A precise relative chronology for Greenland and West Antarctic paleotemperature is extended to 90,000 years ago, based on correlation of atmospheric methane records from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 and Byrd ice cores. Over this period, the onset of seven major millennial-scale warmings in Antarctica preceded the onset of Greenland warmings by 1500 to 3000 years. In general, Antarctic temperatures increased gradually while Greenland temperatures were decreasing or constant, and the termination of Antarctic warming was apparently coincident with the onset of rapid warming in Greenland. This pattern provides further evidence for the operation of a ""bipolar see-saw"" in air temperatures and an oceanic teleconnection between the hemispheres on millennial time scales."
https://openalex.org/W1997006452,"Estrogen receptors (ERs) mediate most of the biological effects of estrogen in mammary and uterine epithelial cells by binding to estrogen response elements in the promoter region of target genes or through protein-protein interactions. Anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen inhibit the growth of ER-positive breast cancers by reducing the expression of estrogen-regulated genes. However, anti-estrogen-resistant growth of ER-positive tumors remains a significant clinical problem. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and AKT activate ERα in the absence of estrogen. Although PI 3-kinase increased the activity of both estrogen-independent activation function 1 (AF-1) and estrogen-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) of ERα, AKT increased the activity of only AF-1. PTEN and a catalytically inactive AKT decreased PI 3-kinase-induced AF-1 activity, suggesting that PI 3-kinase utilizes AKT-dependent and AKT-independent pathways in activating ERα. The consensus AKT phosphorylation site Ser-167 of ERα is required for phosphorylation and activation by AKT. In addition, LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway, reduced phosphorylation of ERα in vivo. Moreover, AKT overexpression led to up-regulation of estrogen-regulated pS2 gene, Bcl-2, and macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1. We demonstrate that AKT protects breast cancer cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results define a molecular link between activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT survival pathways, hormone-independent activation of ERα, and inhibition of tamoxifen-induced apoptotic regression.

ERs, through their estrogen-independent and estrogen-dependent activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2, respectively), regulate transcription by recruiting coactivator proteins and interacting with the general transcriptional machinery (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tamoxifen, which functions as a cell type-specific anti-estrogen, competitively binds to ERα and inhibits estrogen-stimulated growth of mammary epithelial cells. Depending on the concentration of tamoxifen, growth-arrested cells undergo apoptosis within 24 h or after 72 h of tamoxifen treatment (3Bursch W. Ellinger A. Kienzl H. Torok L. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Walker R. Hermann R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although most ERα-positive breast cancers initially respond to tamoxifen therapy, tamoxifen-resistant tumors eventually develop (4Johnston S.R. Anticancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and heregulin confer estrogen-independent growth properties to ERα-positive breast cancer cells (5Lupu R. Cardillo M. Cho C. Harris L. Hijazi M. Perez C. Rosenberg K. Yang D. Tang C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 7Lee A.V. Yee D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1995; 49: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is suggested that EGF- and IGF-1-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylates Ser-118 of ERα, increases the activity of AF-1, and confers hormone-independent growth (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). However, a recent study indicates that, although prolonged activation of MAPK is growth inhibitory in breast cancer cells, parallel activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway by EGF and IGF-1 is sufficient to overcome such inhibition (8Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Therefore, these growth factors may utilize the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway to activate ERα and confer hormone-independent growth.Growth factor-dependent survival of a wide variety of cultured cells types ranging from fibroblasts to neurons is dependent on PI 3-kinase pathway (9Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Growth factor-induced activation of transmembrane receptors (IGF-1, EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and heregulin) results in recruitment of PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane (9Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, PI 3-kinase promotes generation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn bind to AKT. AKT bound to phosphoinositides is translocated from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, where it is activated through phosphorylation. Apart from growth factors, estrogen also activates AKT by triggering the binding of ERα to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (10Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). However, induction of AKT by estrogen is cell type-specific, as it is not observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (11Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35893-35901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activated AKT promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and modulating the activity of various transcription factors in the nucleus. The tumor suppressor PTEN gene, which dephosphorylates 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in vivo, inhibits AKT activation (12Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Several clinical and laboratory observations prompted us to study whether ERα is the target of AKT and whether AKT protects breast cancer cells against tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. For example, PI 3-kinase and AKT amplification is observed in breast and ovarian cancer (13Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C. Pinkel D. Powell B. Mills G.B. Gray J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 14Nakatani K. Thompson D.A. Barthel A. Sakaue H. Liu W. Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Masciullo V. Ferrandiana G. Panici P.B. Mancuso S. Neri G. Testa J.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Cowden disease patients, who have a germ line-inactivating PTEN mutation, display increased breast cancer risks (16Liaw D. Marsh D.J. Li J. Dahia P.L. Wang S.I. Zheng Z. Bose S. Call K.M. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Eng C. Parsons R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Similarly, PTEN mutation is observed in endometrial cancer (17Tonks N.K. Myers M.P. Science. 1999; 286: 2096-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, IGF-1 and heregulin, whose overexpression correlates with tamoxifen resistance, activate AKT (5Lupu R. Cardillo M. Cho C. Harris L. Hijazi M. Perez C. Rosenberg K. Yang D. Tang C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Lee A.V. Yee D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1995; 49: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, serine at amino acid position 167 of ERα is a consensus AKT phosphorylation site (RXRXX(S/T)) (9Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that AKT phosphorylates Ser-167 of ERα and confers tamoxifen resistance.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway modulates ERα activity in vivo, which correlates with phosphorylation of Ser-167 by AKT in vitro. Recent studies indicate that estrogen promotes association of ERα with IGF-1 receptor and p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in the plasma membrane, which leads to AKT activation (10Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 32Kahlert S. Nuedling S. van Eickels M. Vetter H. Meyer R. Grohe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that AKT serves as a functional link between membrane-associated and nuclear ERα. By phosphorylating Ser-167, AKT may modulate coactivator:AF-1 and/or corepressor:AF-1 interactions in the nucleus. Consistent with this possibility, previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Ser-118 of ERα alters both coactivator:AF-1 and corepressor:AF-1 interactions (33Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

A. 1998; 95: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar).AF-1 region of ERα contains phosphorylation sites for a number of kinases including MAPK and cyclin A/cdk2 (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 28Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22296-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Some of these sites are conserved between ERα and ERβ (36Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar). However, AKT phosphorylation site is present only in ERα (36Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar). ERs exist as homodimers as well as ERα·ERβ heterodimers, and these combinations have different affinity for EREs (37Pace P. Taylor J. Suntharalingam S. Coombes R.C. Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25832-25838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 38Hyder S.M. Chiappetta C. Stancel G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, induction of ERE containing genes upon activation of AKT may be cell type-dependent. Furthermore, regulation of ERα activity by AKT may be controlled by p90RSK1 as it can also phosphorylate Ser-167 (26Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Finally, MAPK may indirectly control AKT-mediated activation of ERα as it can activate p90RSK1(39Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).We observed up-regulation of pS2, MIC-1, and Bcl-2 but not c-Myc in CA-AKT-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the ability of AKT to induce ERE-containing genes is promoter context-dependent. Because 4-HT repressed pS2 but not MIC-1 and Bcl-2 expression in CA-AKT cells, promoter context may also play a role in determining the ability of 4-HT to suppress AKT-mediated activation of estrogen-responsive genes (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). Both pS2 and Bcl-2 are well characterized estrogen-regulated genes, whereas MIC-1 promoter is yet to be characterized. While induction of pS2 by estrogen requires an ERE (40Berry M. Nunez A.M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), activation of Bcl-2 by estrogen requires a SP-1 binding site, cAMP response element-binding protein binding site, and an ERE in the Bcl-2 promoter (31Dong L. Wang W. Wang F. Stoner M. Reed J.C. Harigai M. Samudio I. Kladde M.P. Vyhlidal C. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32099-32107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 41Perillo B. Sasso A. Abbondanza C. Palumbo G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2890-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cAMP response element-binding protein binding site is required for AKT-mediated increase in Bcl-2 (42Pugazhenthi S. Nesterova A. Sable C. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Heasley L.E. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10761-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the ability of 4-HT to repress AKT-mediated activation of ERE-containing promoters is determined by promoter elements other than ERE. Alternatively, AKT may activate certain ERE-containing promoters independent of ERα, which is not subject to repression by 4-HT. Additional experiments with dominant negative mutants of ERα (43Chien P.Y. Ito M. Park Y. Tagami T. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2122-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44de Haan G. Chusacultanachai S. Mao C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13493-13501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are essential to distinguish between these possibilities.Our results indicate that activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway leads to increased Bcl-2 expression, which correlates with 4-HT resistance in breast cancer cells. Consistent with our results, Her2/Neu-mediated 4-HT resistance in MCF-7 correlates with Bcl-2 overexpression (45Kumar R. Mandal M. Lipton A. Harvey H. Thompson C.B. Clin Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1215-1219PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results of our cell culture studies are inconsistent with clinical observations that correlate high Bcl-2 expression with favorable response to tamoxifen therapy and prolonged disease-free intervals (46Elledge R.M. Green S. Howes L. Clark G.M. Berardo M. Allred D.C. Pugh R. Ciocca D. Ravdin P. O'Sullivan J. Rivkin S. Martino S. Osborne C.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is possible that Bcl-2 works in concert with additional anti-apoptotic proteins to confer tamoxifen resistance, which is in accordance with the proposal that overall level of Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins dictates cellular response to therapy (47Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar).The PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway is the major survival pathway for a wide variety of cultured cell types (9Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). ERα may be the central element in this survival pathway, at least in certain cell types. Broader implications of our results are on endometrial cancers as well as on Cowden's disease patients, who show a 30–50% incidence of breast cancer in affected females (16Liaw D. Marsh D.J. Li J. Dahia P.L. Wang S.I. Zheng Z. Bose S. Call K.M. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Eng C. Parsons R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). In both neoplastic conditions, AKT activity is increased due to mutation of PTEN. The PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway, therefore, may be an ideal target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers. Estrogen-induced proliferation of mammary and uterine epithelial cells is primarily mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs),1 which belong to steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of transcription factors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6027) Google Scholar). ERs, through their estrogen-independent and estrogen-dependent activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2, respectively), regulate transcription by recruiting coactivator proteins and interacting with the general transcriptional machinery (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tamoxifen, which functions as a cell type-specific anti-estrogen, competitively binds to ERα and inhibits estrogen-stimulated growth of mammary epithelial cells. Depending on the concentration of tamoxifen, growth-arrested cells undergo apoptosis within 24 h or after 72 h of tamoxifen treatment (3Bursch W. Ellinger A. Kienzl H. Torok L. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Walker R. Hermann R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although most ERα-positive breast cancers initially respond to tamoxifen therapy, tamoxifen-resistant tumors eventually develop (4Johnston S.R. Anticancer Drugs. 1997; 8: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and heregulin confer estrogen-independent growth properties to ERα-positive breast cancer cells (5Lupu R. Cardillo M. Cho C. Harris L. Hijazi M. Perez C. Rosenberg K. Yang D. Tang C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 7Lee A.V. Yee D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1995; 49: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is suggested that EGF- and IGF-1-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylates Ser-118 of ERα, increases the activity of AF-1, and confers hormone-independent growth (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). However, a recent study indicates that, although prolonged activation of MAPK is growth inhibitory in breast cancer cells, parallel activation of the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway by EGF and IGF-1 is sufficient to overcome such inhibition (8Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Therefore, these growth factors may utilize the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway to activate ERα and confer hormone-independent growth. Growth factor-dependent survival of a wide variety of cultured cells types ranging from fibroblasts to neurons is dependent on PI 3-kinase pathway (9Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Growth factor-induced activation of transmembrane receptors (IGF-1, EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and heregulin) results in recruitment of PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane (9Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane, PI 3-kinase promotes generation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which in turn bind to AKT. AKT bound to phosphoinositides is translocated from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, where it is activated through phosphorylation. Apart from growth factors, estrogen also activates AKT by triggering the binding of ERα to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (10Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). However, induction of AKT by estrogen is cell type-specific, as it is not observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (11Dupont J. Karas M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35893-35901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activated AKT promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and modulating the activity of various transcription factors in the nucleus. The tumor suppressor PTEN gene, which dephosphorylates 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in vivo, inhibits AKT activation (12Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Several clinical and laboratory observations prompted us to study whether ERα is the target of AKT and whether AKT protects breast cancer cells against tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. For example, PI 3-kinase and AKT amplification is observed in breast and ovarian cancer (13Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C. Pinkel D. Powell B. Mills G.B. Gray J.W. Nat.

Cowden disease patients, who have a germ line-inactivating PTEN mutation, display increased breast cancer risks (16Liaw D. Marsh D.J. Li J. Dahia P.L. Wang S.I. Zheng Z. Bose S. Call K.M. Tsou H.C.

Science. 1999; 286: 2096-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, IGF-1 and heregulin, whose overexpression correlates with tamoxifen resistance, activate AKT (5Lupu R. Cardillo M.

Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that AKT phosphorylates Ser-167 of ERα and confers tamoxifen resistance. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that PI 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway modulates ERα activity in vivo, which correlates with phosphorylation of Ser-167 by AKT in vitro. Recent studies indicate that estrogen promotes association of ERα with IGF-1 receptor and p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in the plasma membrane, which leads to AKT activation (10Simoncini T.

Our results suggest that AKT serves as a functional link between membrane-associated and nuclear ERα. By phosphorylating Ser-167, AKT may modulate coactivator:AF-1 and/or corepressor:AF-1 interactions in the nucleus. Consistent with this possibility, previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Ser-118 of ERα alters both coactivator:AF-1 and corepressor:AF-1 interactions (33Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y.

Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar). ERs exist as homodimers as well as ERα·ERβ heterodimers, and these combinations have different affinity for EREs (37Pace P. Taylor J. Suntharalingam S. Coombes R.C. Ali S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, regulation of ERα activity by AKT may be controlled by p90RSK1 as it can also phosphorylate Ser-167 (26Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Finally, MAPK may indirectly control AKT-mediated activation of ERα as it can activate p90RSK1(39Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).We observed up-regulation of pS2, MIC-1, and Bcl-2 but not c-Myc in CA-AKT-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the ability of AKT to induce ERE-containing genes is promoter context-dependent. Because 4-HT repressed pS2 but not MIC-1 and Bcl-2 expression in CA-AKT cells, promoter context may also play a role in determining the ability of 4-HT to suppress AKT-mediated activation of estrogen-responsive genes (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). Both pS2 and Bcl-2 are well characterized estrogen-regulated genes, whereas MIC-1 promoter is yet to be characterized. While induction of pS2 by estrogen requires an ERE (40Berry M. Nunez A.M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), activation of Bcl-2 by estrogen requires a SP-1 binding site, cAMP response element-binding protein binding site, and an ERE in the Bcl-2 promoter (31Dong L.

Therefore, it is likely that the ability of 4-HT to repress AKT-mediated activation of ERE-containing promoters is determined by promoter elements other than ERE. Alternatively, AKT may activate certain ERE-containing promoters independent of ERα, which is not subject to repression by 4-HT. Additional experiments with dominant negative mutants of ERα (43Chien P.Y. Ito M. Park Y. Tagami T. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. Mol.

Consistent with our results, Her2/Neu-mediated 4-HT resistance in MCF-7 correlates with Bcl-2 overexpression (45Kumar R. Mandal M. Lipton A. Harvey H. Thompson C.B. Clin Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1215-1219PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results of our cell culture studies are inconsistent with clinical observations that correlate high Bcl-2 expression with favorable response to tamoxifen therapy and prolonged disease-free intervals (46Elledge R.M.

Broader implications of our results are on endometrial cancers as well as on Cowden's disease patients, who show a 30–50% incidence of breast cancer in affected females (16Liaw D. Marsh D.J. Li J.

Lateral organs are patterned along proximodistal, dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. Here we show that the Arabidopsis mutant asymmetric leaves1 (as1) disrupts this process. AS1 encodes a myb domain protein, closely related to PHANTASTICA in Antirrhinum and ROUGH SHEATH2 in maize, both of which negatively regulate knotted-class homeobox genes. AS1 negatively regulates the homeobox genes KNAT1 and KNAT2 and is, in turn, negatively regulated by the meristematic homeobox gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS. This genetic pathway defines a mechanism for differentiating between stem cells and organ founder cells within the shoot apical meristem and demonstrates that genes expressed in organ primordia interact with meristematic genes to regulate shoot morphogenesis."

Although the predicted RPW8.1 and RPW8.2 proteins are different from the previously characterized R proteins, they induce localized, salicylic acid–dependent defenses similar to those induced by R genes that control specific resistance. Apparently, broad-spectrum resistance mediated by RPW8 uses the same mechanisms as specific resistance."

A problem with engineering tissues that exist in a mechanically dynamic environment, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels, is that most drug delivery systems have been designed to operate under static conditions. We thought that polymeric matrices, which release growth factors in response to mechanical signals, might provide a new approach to guide tissue formation in mechanically stressed environments. Critical design features for this type of system include the ability to undergo repeated deformation, and a reversible binding of the protein growth factors to polymeric matrices to allow for responses to repeated stimuli. Here we report a model delivery system that can respond to mechanical signalling and upregulate the release of a growth factor to promote blood vessel formation. This approach may find a number of applications, including regeneration and engineering of new tissues and more general drug-delivery applications."

Tight-binding calculations for models based on observed atomic structures show good agreement with spectroscopy and provide insight into the topological defects forming intramolecular junctions.

https://openalex.org/W2065868028,"All aspects of cellular RNA metabolism and the replication of many viruses require DExH/D proteins that manipulate RNA in a manner that requires nucleoside triphosphates. Although DExH/D proteins have been shown to unwind purified RNA duplexes, most RNA molecules in the cellular environment are complexed with proteins. It has therefore been speculated that DExH/D proteins may also affect RNA-protein interactions. We demonstrate that the DExH protein NPH-II from vaccinia virus can displace the protein U1A from RNA in an active adenosine triphosphate-dependent fashion. NPH-II increases the rate of U1A dissociation by more than three orders of magnitude while retaining helicase processivity. This indicates that DExH/D proteins can effectively catalyze protein displacement from RNA and thereby participate in the structural reorganization of ribonucleoprotein assemblies."

The temperature of its black-body spectrum has been measured at the present time, $T_{\rm CMBR,0}$ = 2.726$\pm$ 0.010 K, and is predicted to have been higher in the past. At earlier time, the temperature can be measured, in principle, using the excitation of atomic fine structure levels by the radiation field. All previous measurements however give only upper limits as they assume that no other significant source of excitation is present. Here we report the detection of absorption from the first {\sl and} second fine-structure levels of neutral carbon atoms in an isolated remote cloud at a redshift of 2.33771. In addition, the unusual detection of molecular hydrogen in several rotational levels and the presence of ionized carbon in its excited fine structure level make the absorption system unique to constrain, directly from observation, the different excitation processes at play. It is shown for the first time that the cosmic radiation was warmer in the past. We find 6.0 < T_{\rm CMBR} < 14 K at z = 2.33771 when 9.1 K is expected in the Hot Big Bang cosmology."

We present results for an area of 34 square degrees. Using photometric variability as our main selection criterion, as well as follow-up spectroscopy, we confirmed 168 previously unidentified pre-main sequence stars that are about 0.6 to 0.9 times the mass of the sun (Mo), with ages of about 1 million to 3 million years (Ori OB1b) and about 3 million to 10 million years (Ori OB1a). The low-mass stars are spatially coincident with the high-mass (at least 3 Mo) members of the associations. Indicators of disk accretion such as Halpha emission and near-infrared emission from dusty disks fall sharply from Ori OB1b to Ori OB1a, indicating that the time scale for disk dissipation and possibly the onset of planet formation is a few million years."

Here, we describe the signal-binding specificity and affinity of the medium subunit μ4 of the recently described adaptor protein complex AP-4. To elucidate the determinants of specificity, we screened a two-hybrid combinatorial peptide library using μ4 as a selector protein. Statistical analyses of the results revealed that μ4 prefers aspartic acid at position Y+1, proline or arginine at Y+2, and phenylalanine at Y−1 and Y+3 (Ø). In addition, we examined the interaction of μ4 with naturally occurring YXXØ signals by both two-hybrid and in vitro binding analyses. These experiments showed that μ4 recognized the tyrosine signal from the human lysosomal protein LAMP-2, HTGYEQF. Using surface plasmon resonance measurements, we determined the apparent dissociation constant for the μ4-YXXØ interaction to be in the micromolar range. To gain insight into a possible role of AP-4 in intracellular trafficking, we constructed a Tac chimera bearing a μ4-specific YXXØ signal.

AP-2 is associated with the plasma membrane and mediates rapid internalization of endocytic receptors, whereas AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4 are associated with the trans-Golgi network and/or endosomes and mediate intracellular sorting events. AP complexes are thought to participate in protein sorting by inducing the formation of coated vesicles as well as concentration of cargo molecules within the vesicles. Concentration of integral membrane proteins is mediated by direct interaction of the AP complexes with sorting signals present within the cytosolic tails of the proteins. Several types of cytosolic sorting signals have been described, the most common of which are referred to as “tyrosine-based” or “dileucine-based” depending on which residues are critical for activity (5Marks M.S.

Extensive analyses of the α chain of AP-2 have shown that it interacts, either directly or indirectly, with many regulators of coat assembly and/or vesicle formation (7Owen D.J. Luzio J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By analogy, the γ/δ/ε chains are presumed to interact with other proteins that play similar regulatory roles. β1, β2, and β3 interact with the scaffolding protein, clathrin (8Gallusser A.

Our laboratory has been particularly interested in the role of the μ chains in signal recognition. We have previously demonstrated that μ1 and μ2 display a bipartite structure, with the amino-terminal one-third being involved in interactions with the corresponding β chains and the C-terminal two-thirds being involved in recognition of YXXØ-type signals (23Aguilar R.C.

X-ray crystallography revealed that the YXXØ-binding domain of μ2 consists of a banana-shaped all-β structure to which the signals bind in an extended conformation (19Owen D.J. Evans P.R.

J. 1998; 335: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) studies have suggested that the identities of the Ø residue and the residues surrounding the critical Tyr residue are important determinants of the specificity of interaction. Although the subsets of YXXØ signals recognized by μ1, μ2, and μ3A overlap to a significant extent, each chain nonetheless exhibits certain preferences for residues neighboring the critical Tyr residue (14Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, μ1, μ2, and μ3A prefer Leu, Leu, and Ile residues at the Ø positions and neutral, basic, and acidic residues at the X positions, respectively. We have argued that these preferences alone are unlikely to account for the functional specificity of each AP complex (14Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, they probably contribute to the selectivity and efficiency of specific signal recognition events. Although much has been done to characterize the signal-binding specificity of μ1, μ2, and μ3A, little is known about sequence preferences for the more recently described μ4 (also known as μ-ARP2) (24Wang X. Kiliman M.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that μ4 interacts weakly with YXXØ signals from the lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP-1 (AGYQTI) (18Stephens D.J. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and CD63 (SGYEVM) (25Hirst J. Bright N.A. Rous B. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2787-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and thetrans-Golgi network protein TGN38 (SDYQRL) (18Stephens D.J. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To determine whether μ4 might be able to recognize with higher affinity a defined subset of YXXØ signals, we have undertaken a yeast two-hybrid screening of a combinatorial YXXØ library. The results show that μ4 prefers signals with Phe at position Y−1, Asp at Y+1, Pro or Arg at Y+2, and Phe at Y+3 (Ø). A signal that fits this latter preference is found in the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2, and indeed, we found that the LAMP-2 signal binds to μ4 both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. We also found that a reporter integral membrane protein bearing a μ4-specific YXXØ signal is delivered to the endosomal-lysosomal system without being internalized from the plasma membrane. The constructs Gal4AD-μ1, Gal4AD-μ2, and Gal4AD-μ3A in the pACTII(LEU2) plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) have been described previously (12Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I.

The Gal4AD-μ4 construct was prepared by ligating a BamHI-SacI polymerase chain reaction fragment corresponding to the 5′-part of μ4 and a SacI-PstI cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3′-part of μ4 into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the pACTII(LEU2) vector using aPstI-XhoI adaptor. As previously described (14Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), a DNA fragment encoding the 33-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 engineered to contain an EagI site (by introduction of silent mutations in place of the codons for Arg21 and Pro22 from the TGN38 cytoplasmic tail) was used to prepare the pGBT9-TGNΔ-EagI construct by ligation into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGBT9(TRP1) vector (CLONTECH). Oligonucleotides encoding either a combinatorialXXXYXXØ peptide library (14Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or different YXXØ-type signals were digested with EagI and PstI and then ligated into pGBT9-TGNΔ-EagI cut with EagI and PstI. The amino acid sequence encoded by the resulting constructs was Gal4BD-HNKRKIIAFALEGKRSKVTRRPKXXXYXXØ. The construct Gal4BD-β2 was kindly provided by Dr. M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom). All of the other two-hybrid constructs were made by ligation of polymerase chain reaction products into the pGBT9 or pACTII vector. The construct pET28a-μ4-(156–453) was obtained by cloning nucleotides 466–1362 of the coding sequence of μ4 into pET28a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using NheI and HindIII restriction sites. pET28a-μ4-(156–453) was digested with NdeI andBstEII to release a 1066-base pair fragment containing the amino-terminal His6 tag and ligated with theNdeI-BstEII fragment of vector pET16b (Invitrogen) containing the His10 tag. The resulting construct was named pET28a-His10-μ4-(156–453). Interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (Tac) chimeric constructs were prepared by ligation of complementary oligonucleotides (coding for the PLSYTRF, DLYYDPM, and DLYADPM sequences) between an XbaI site inserted at the 3′-end of the Tac cDNA and theBamHI site from the expression vector pCDL-SRα (26Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c (MAT a, ura3-52, HIS3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, GAL4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL417-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ) (CLONTECH) was maintained on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose-agar plates. Transformations were done by the lithium acetate procedure as described in the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (CLONTECH). For colony growth assays, HF7c transformants were streaked on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and allowed to grow at 30 °C, usually for 4–5 days, until colonies were visible. For two-hybrid screening of the combinatorial library, the yeast cells were first transformed with Gal4AD-μ4 and plated onto yeast dropout agar plates lacking leucine as described in the protocol for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system. Transformants were re-transformed with the combinatorial DNA library and selected on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan for selection of co-transformants and lacking histidine for selection of interacting clones; Leu+Trp+ and His+ colonies were then tested for β-galactosidase activity. Colonies expressing β-galactosidase were cultured in dropout medium containing leucine but lacking tryptophan to obtain cells carrying only the library plasmid and not the medium subunit plasmid. The resulting cells were then mated with the yeast strain Y187 (MAT a) transformed with Gal4AD-μ4 constructs or with pTD1-1 (SV40 large-T antigen cDNA in pACTII; negative control for histidine auxotrophy and β-galactosidase activity) to test the binding specificity of library clones. HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) (regular medium). Primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from AP-3-deficient mocha mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were obtained as previously described (27Dell'Angelica E.C. Aguilar R.C. Wolins N. Hazelwood S. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1300-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and maintained in regular medium. The night before transfection, cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (Costar Corp., Corning, NY) in 2 ml of regular medium. The following day, the cells were cotransfected with the Tac constructs and pCI-NEO (Promega, Madison, WI) using Fugene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To obtain stable transfectant clones, the regular medium from HeLa cells was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) 24 hours after transfection. The clones obtained were analyzed for expression of the Tac constructs by immunofluorescence microscopy. The experimental (observed) frequency for each residue at each position of theXXXYXXØ sequence was calculated using the sequences selected by the μ4 subunit from the combinatorial library. Preferences were evaluated by calculating the difference between the observed and expected frequencies (ΔF) in standard error units (14Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Any ΔF value above 1 (i.e. favored) or below −1 (i.e. disfavored) was considered to be significantly different from 0 (random). Single amino acid substitutions were made using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, 50 ng of plasmid carrying the target cDNA was incubated with two complementary primers (2 mm each) containing the desired mutation in the presence of 2 mmdNTP mixture and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase for 16 cycles according to the following temperature profile: 0.5 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 8 or 16 min at 68 °C. After replication of both vector strands, the methylated parental DNA was digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units of DpnI endonuclease, and the nicked vector with the desired mutation was transformed into Escherichia coli. 35S-labeled μ4-(156–453) protein was obtained by in vitrotranscription/translation using the TNT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and EasytagTMexpression protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturers' instructions. In brief, 500 ng of the pET28a-μ4-(156–453) construct was incubated with 20 μl of TNT Quick Master Mix and 11 μCi of [35S]methionine in a total volume of 25 μl at 30 °C for 90 min. The transcription/translation reaction mixture (containing35S-labeled μ4-(156–453)) was diluted 1:100 in binding buffer and centrifuged (180,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). 500 μl of supernatant was applied to peptide-coupled beads and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times at 4 °C with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The SDS gel was soaked in sodium salicylate and subjected to autoradiography. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET28a-His10-μ4-(156–453); a single colony was picked; and the presence of the construct was verified. 2 liters of LB/kanamycin medium was inoculated with 100 ml of preculture and grown at 37 °C until A600 reached 1.6. Protein expression then was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 3 mm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 4 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole), and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA), and the recombinant protein was eluted using buffer A with 1 m imidazole. μ4-(156–453)-containing elution fractions were pooled; dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; and concentrated by centrifugation in a Centriprep-3 device (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The following peptides were obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA): CWKRHHTGYEQF, CWKRHHTGAEQF, CWKRHHTGYEQA, CWRPKETLYRRF, CWRPKETLARRF, and CWRPKETLYRRA. Peptide-coupled beads for in vitro binding assays were prepared by coupling the Cys residue of the peptides to EZ-LinkTM PEO-maleimide-activated biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.9) at peptide and biotin concentrations of 1 and 1.67 mm, respectively. The reaction was quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 10 mm. 50 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.9), incubated overnight with 300 μl of biotinylation reaction, and washed three times with binding buffer (0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on a BIAcore 1000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala) at 25 °C using SA sensor chips with streptavidin covalently immobilized on a carboxymethylated dextran matrix. The chips were conditioned by 10 consecutive 1-min injections of 1 m NaCl, 50 mmNaOH, and 0.25% (w/v) SDS at a flow rate of 10 μl/min and washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20). Biotinylated peptides were injected at a concentration of 500 nm in Tris-buffered saline running buffer at a flow rate of 2 μl/min onto the chip surface until the desired level of immobilization (∼150 response unit) was achieved. Unoccupied streptavidin was blocked by biotin (30 μl of a 10 μm solution at a flow rate of 5 μl/min). The sensor chip was then washed by five consecutive 1-min injections of regeneration solution (25 mm NaOH, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.0005% (w/v) SDS). Flow cell 1 (with biotin-treated streptavidin) was left blank and used as a reference surface. Surface plasmon resonance permits, in a label-free mode, real-time detection of binding events on the chip surface and estimation of binding parameters (28Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of μ4-(156–453) at the indicated concentrations was injected onto sensor chip surfaces. Dissociation of bound protein was carried out for 10 min, and then the surface was regenerated by two 30-s injections of regeneration solution and by two 30-s injections of running buffer. All experiments were repeated twice on two different chips. Data transformation and overlay sensorgrams were prepared using BIAevaluation Version 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). The response from the reference surface was subtracted from the other three flow cells to correct for refractive index changes, matrix effects, nonspecific binding, injection noise, and base-line drift. Using nonlinear least-squares fitting, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was evaluated by fitting data to a single site interaction model (Equation 1), [RUeq]=RUmax/1+(KD/C)Equation 1 where RUeq is the steady-state response level, RUmax is the maximal capacity of the surface (which was floated during the fitting procedure), and C is the concentration of μ4 in micromolar. Immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed permeabilized cells and antibody internalization microscopy experiments were done as previously described (27Dell'Angelica E.C. Aguilar R.C. Wolins N.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-mouse LAMP-2 monoclonal antibody ABL-93, anti-human LAMP-2 monoclonal antibody H4B4, and anti-human CD63 monoclonal antibody H5C6 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). A polyclonal antiserum to recombinant Tac was raised in rabbits. Alexa 448 and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). We have previously analyzed the signal-binding specificity of μ1, μ2, and μ3 (A and B isoforms) by screening a Gal4AD-XXXYXXØ combinatorial library using the yeast two-hybrid system (14Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Here, we have used the same method to define the signal-binding specificity of the μ4 subunit of AP-4. To this end, the combinatorial library was coexpressed with a Gal4AD-μ4 construct in yeast cells. Twenty clones that grew in medium lacking histidine and that tested positive for β-galactosidase activity were isolated, and their amino acid sequences were deduced from DNA sequencing (Fig. 1 A). A statistical analysis of the residues found at each position is shown in Fig. 1 B; positive or negative ΔF values correspond to residues that were favored or disfavored, respectively. Only residues with ΔF values equal to or greater than 1 or equal to or lower than −1 were considered significant. Overall, μ4 seemed to have a distinct preference for aromatic amino acids at several positions of the XXXYXXØ sequence. The most commonly found amino acids at each position were Cys, Tyr, Phe, Tyr, Asp, Pro, and Phe, respectively. Tyr was also favored at Y−1 and Arg at Y+2. Among the residues at the Ø position, the only preference was for Phe, whereas Val was strongly disfavored (Fig.1 B). Some of the sequences selected by μ4 (DLYYDPM, ETLYRRF, DFYYERL, and DYCYDRF) were tested for their ability to interact with other μ subunits (Fig. 1 C). The results showed that the DLYYDPM sequence was specific for μ4, whereas the ETLYRRF and DYCYDRF sequences interacted with μ2 and μ4, and the DFYYERL sequence interacted with all four μ chains (Fig. 1 B). Thus, μ4 shares with the other μ chains the ability to interact with distinct but overlapping sets of YXXØ-type sequences. To further characterize the interactions of μ4 with YXXØ motifs, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to test for interactions with YXXØ signals found in the cytosolic tails of some transmembrane proteins. The YXXØ signal of TGN38 was replaced by the analogous signals from LAMP-1, CD68, CD63, and LAMP-2, and interactions with μ chains were tested using the yeast two-hybrid system. A qualitative assay for growth on histidine-deficient plates revealed that μ4 interacted only with the YXXØ signal from human LAMP-2 (HTGYEQF) (Fig.2 A). The LAMP-2 signal was not recognized only by μ4 though, as it bound even more strongly to μ2 and μ3A (Fig. 2, A and B). A salient feature of this signal is the presence of Phe at the Ø position, which fits the μ4 preferences deduced from the combinatorial analyses. The Tyr-to-Ala and Phe-to-Ala variants of the LAMP-2 signal (HTGAEQF and HTGYEQA, respectively) were unable to interact with μ4 or with any other μ chain (Fig. 2 B). To verify the yeast two-hybrid results, we performed a binding assay using in vitro transcribed/translated μ4-(156–453) and chemically synthesized and biotinylated LAMP-2 peptides. The peptides were bound to streptavidin beads and incubated with radioactively labeled μ4-(156–453). Bound μ4 was revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 2 C, μ4-(156–453) bound well to the wild-type LAMP-2 sequence (HTGYEQF), but only barely to the Tyr-to-Ala (HTGAEQF) and Phe-to-Ala (HTGYEQA) variants of the sequence. The resolution of the crystal structure of the μ2 signal-binding domain allowed identification of residues that are directly involved in interactions with the critical tyrosine residue of the signals (19Owen D.J. Evans P.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Several of those residues are conserved in the other μ chains, including μ4 (3Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To determine whether interactions of μ4 with YXXØ signals involved conserved residues in the tyrosine-binding pocket, we mutated the conserved Asp190 or Lys438 residue of μ4 to Ala. Two-hybrid assays revealed that these mutations abrogated interactions of μ4 with the tyrosine-based signal from LAMP-2 (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the structural bases for the recognition of YXXØ signals by μ4 appear to be similar to those of μ2. μ4-YXXØ interactions were further characterized by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2039499063,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are sudden, intense flashes of gamma rays that, for a few blinding seconds, light up in an otherwise fairly dark gamma-ray sky. They are detected at the rate of about once a day, and while they are on, they outshine every other gamma-ray source in the sky, including the sun. Major advances have been made in the last 3 or 4 years, including the discovery of slowly fading x-ray, optical, and radio afterglows of GRBs, the identification of host galaxies at cosmological distances, and evidence showing that many GRBs are associated with star-forming regions and possibly supernovae. Progress has been made in understanding how the GRB and afterglow radiation arises in terms of a relativistic fireball shock model. These advances have opened new vistas and questions on the nature of the central engine, the identity of their progenitors, the effects of the environment, and their possible gravitational wave, cosmic ray, and neutrino luminosity. The debates on these issues indicate that GRBs remain among the most mysterious puzzles in astrophysics."

Chem. 2000; 275: 40887-40896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DGPP phosphatase expression is greater in stationary phase cells, and the inositol- and growth phase-dependent regulation of the enzyme is additive (23Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G.

These growth conditions have profound effects on the expression of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes and on the regulation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism (5Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog.

Interestingly, DGPP phosphatase regulation by inositol occurs in a manner that is opposite that of many phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes (23Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G. Quinn J.E. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40887-40896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Studies performed with a dpp1Δ mutant reveal that DGPP phosphatase plays a role in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism by inositol as well as regulating the cellular levels of DGPP, PA, and phosphatidylinositol (16Toke D.A.

Moreover, inhibition of DGPP phosphatase activity by CDP-diacylglycerol and stimulation of phosphatidylserine synthase activity by DGPP may contribute to this regulation on a biochemical level (23Oshiro J.

Zinc deprivation induced DGPP phosphatase in wild-type cells. This regulation was mediated by the Zap1p transcriptional activator through a zinc-responsive element (UASZRE) in the promoter of the DPP1 gene. The pattern of DGPP phosphatase regulation in mutants defective in plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane zinc transporters indicated that enzyme expression was sensitive to the cytoplasmic levels of zinc. DGPP phosphatase activity was inhibited by zinc through a mechanism that involved formation of DGPP-zinc complexes. We also showed that DGPP phosphatase was localized to the vacuolar membrane.DISCUSSIONThe DPP1 gene was first identified by Toke et al. (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

This identification was based on amino acid sequence information derived from the purified enzyme (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent studies identify DPP1 as a gene that is regulated by zinc deprivation (46Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The work presented here advances the understanding of the regulation of DGPP phosphatase by zinc and the localization of the enzyme. Using a PDPP1-lacZ reporter gene, we showed that the expression of DPP1 was induced in a time- and dose-dependent manner when wild-type cells were deprived of zinc. The DPP1 promoter contains a putative UASZRE (47Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is present in several genes that are regulated by zinc deprivation (48Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P.

The regulation of DPP1expression by zinc was dependent on this UASZRE. Mutations in the element, as well as the deletion of the element from the PDPP1-lacZ reporter gene, precluded the regulation by zinc deprivation. The DPP1 gene is also induced when cells are supplemented with inositol and when they enter the stationary phase of growth. This regulation is not dependent on the UASZRE. 2J. Oshiro and G. M. Carman, unpublished data.Induction of UASZRE-containing genes such asZRT1, ZRT2, and ZRT3, in response to zinc deprivation (47Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol.

The depletion of zinc from the growth medium of wild-type cells resulted in a 10-fold increase in DGPP phosphatase activity, which corresponded to a 10-fold increase in the level of the DGPP phosphatase protein. The magnitude of induction of the DGPP phosphatase enzyme was considerably less than the 64-fold induction of β-galactosidase activity driven by the PDPP1-lacZ reporter gene. However, the regulation of the DGPP phosphatase enzyme was more consistent with that of DPP1 mRNA abundance (46Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lyons T.J.

J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis and vacuolar degradation (55Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic levels of zinc are controlled further by the vacuolar membrane efflux (Zrt3p) and influx (Cot1p and Zrc1p) zinc transporters (50MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Expression of DGPP phosphatase activity in thezrt1Δ zrt2Δ mutant grown in the presence of zinc was significantly greater (4.3-fold) than that found in wild-type cells. The zrt3Δ mutation in the vacuolar membrane zinc efflux transporter also caused an increase (2-fold) in expression of DGPP phosphatase activity, but to a smaller magnitude. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that expression of DGPP phosphatase was sensitive to the cytoplasmic levels of zinc.DPP1-encoded DGPP phosphatase activity is independent of any divalent cation requirement (2Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, DGPP phosphatase activity is inhibited by manganese, calcium, and magnesium ions (2Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this work, we showed that the enzyme was inhibited by zinc ions. The inhibitor constant for zinc ions (150 μm) was within its cellular concentration (150–1500 μm, based on a cell volume of 5 × 10−13 liter/cell), determined for cells grown with varying concentrations of zinc (47Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 55Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of DGPP phosphatase activity by zinc may be physiologically relevant. Pyrophosphate compounds have the ability to chelate divalent cations (57Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). Our studies indicated that DGPP had the ability to form complexes with zinc. This observation was consistent with a mechanism of inhibition of DGPP phosphatase that involved the formation of DGPP-zinc complexes.Based on studies using well characterized subcellular fractions and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, the DGPP phosphatase enzyme was localized to the vacuolar membrane. DGPP phosphatase is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with six transmembrane-spanning regions distributed over its entire protein sequence (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The three domains that comprise the active site of DGPP phosphatase (20Toke D.A. McClintick M.L. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14606-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are positioned on the same side of the membrane (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The internal pH of the vacuole and the pH optimum for DGPP phosphatase activity are acidic, suggesting that the active site of the enzyme may be located on the internal surface of the vacuolar membrane. Additional studies will be required to address this hypothesis and establish the topology of the enzyme within the membrane.Zinc is an essential mineral (58Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a cofactor for more than 300 enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, carbonic anhydrase, and alcohol dehydrogenase, as well as several proteases (58Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several proteins, including transcription factors, require zinc as a structural cofactor for folding of specific domains (59Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding its essential nature, zinc can be toxic if it is accumulated in excess amounts (58Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic levels of zinc are controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including cellular influx (60Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), efflux (61Nies D.H. Silver S. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 14: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 62Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and chelation by metallothioneins (63Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the plasma membrane zinc transporters play a major role in this regulation. Why is a vacuolar membrane-associated DGPP phosphatase activity regulated in a coordinate manner with zinc transporters whose main function is to regulate zinc homeostasis? The DPP1 gene is not essential (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, dpp1Δ mutants do not exhibit any dramatic phenotypes under a variety of growth conditions (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), including fluctuations in zinc supplementation (data not shown) (46Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of DGPP phosphatase in response to zinc deprivation would have to be complimentary to other mechanisms that respond to this stress. DGPP phosphatase plays a role in regulating the levels of DGPP, PA, and phosphatidylinositol in S. cerevisiae (16Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Oshiro J. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 14331-14338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G. Quinn J.E. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40887-40896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the function of DGPP is unclear, it is tempting to speculate that it may function to chelate a specific pool of zinc ions at the surface of the vacuolar membrane. This function would be eliminated by the dephosphorylation of free DGPP by the phosphatase, especially under zinc-limiting conditions. An alternative role for the enzyme may be to control the levels of PA and phosphatidylinositol in vacuolar membranes. These two phospholipids play critical roles in the structure and function of membranes inS. cerevisiae and in higher eukaryotic cells (5Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D.

Accordingly, future studies will address the role DGPP phosphatase plays in the regulation of vacuolar phospholipid metabolism in response to zinc deprivation. The DPP1-encoded diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP)1 phosphatase (1Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Chen X. Oshiro J. Ostrander D.B. Wu W.-I. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J.

DGPP is a minor phospholipid in S. cerevisiae (2Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DGPP is derived from PA via the reaction catalyzed by PA kinase (2Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S.

Metabolic labeling studies with plants, where DGPP was first discovered (3Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), show that DGPP accumulates upon G protein activation (7Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol.

This occurs by a mechanism that involves the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, an important event in the immunoinflammatory response of leukocytes (10Balboa M.

In particular, the highest energy cosmic rays observed have macroscopic energies up to several 10 20 electron volts and thus provide a probe of physics and astrophysics at energies unattained in laboratory experiments. Theoretical explanations range from astrophysical acceleration of charged particles, to particle physics beyond the established standard model, and processes taking place at the earliest moments of our universe.

Interestingly, C. testosteroni can use a variety of steroid substrates as a sole carbon source through the reaction of a set of steroid-inducible enzymes (3Talalay P. Dobson M.M. Tapley D.F.

Although the metabolic intermediates of the steroid substrates have been identified, and the basic catabolic pathway is known, only limited information is available on the molecular structure and function of the participating enzymes (5Genti Raimondi S.

Moreover, nothing was known about the mechanism of induction of steroid-metabolizing enzymes or about the basis of their transcriptional regulation. The occurrence of several hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs)1 in microbial organisms raises the question of the physiological function of these enzymes in procaryotes. Because steroids simultaneously serve both as signal molecules and as a carbon source, they play a particularly important role in certain procaryotes. The same applies to procaryotic HSDs. On the one hand, procaryotic HSDs may play a regulatory role in the steroid-inducible gene expression. On the other hand, it is established that they participate in steroid degradation. Enzymatic C3-dehydrogenation of ring A, which occurs at the initial stage of steroid catabolism in C. testosteroni, is mediated by 3α-HSD, the production of which has been shown to be inducible by testosterone, progesterone, and lanosterol (12Oppermann C.T. Netter K.J. Maser E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the pioneering work of Marcus and Talalay (13Marcus P.I. Talalay P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 661-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is well known that 3α-HSD is one of the first enzymes of the steroid catabolic pathway and that, therefore, it plays a central role in steroid metabolism. 3α-HSD, which was first identified by its activity in converting dihydrocortisone to 3α-tetrahydrocortisone (14Tomkins G.M.

Gene. 1993; 130: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Despite similar substrate specificities, eucaryotic and procaryotic 3α-HSDs belong to two different protein superfamilies. Whereas eucaryotic 3α-HSD (EC 1.1.1.213) belongs to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (21Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), the procaryotic 3α-HSD (EC 1.1.1.50) is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (22Persson B. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 23Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D.

In previous investigations, we isolated and characterized the 3α-HSD enzyme from C. testosteroni and determined the primary structure by the cloning and sequencing of its gene (10Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Möbus E. Jahn M. Schmid R. Jahn D. Maser E. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 3α-HSD has been shown to mediate the oxidoreduction at position 3 of the steroid nucleus of a great variety of C19 to C27 steroids (10Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this enzyme is also capable of catalyzing the carbonyl reduction of nonsteroidal xenobiotic aldehydes and ketones and has therefore been named 3α-HSD/CR (10Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that the substrate pluripotency of 3α-HSD/CR, as well as its inducibility, not only increase the resistance of C. testosteroni to the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid but also enhance the metabolic capacity of insecticide degradation in this organism (26Oppermann U.C.T. Belai I. Maser E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, no information is available on the transcriptional regulation of 3α-HSD/CR itself or on the molecular regulation of the complete steroid degradation pathway. The present paper provides the first data on the molecular mechanism of steroid signaling in procaryotes. It reports on the regulation of the steroid-inducible gene (hsdA) of 3α-HSD/CR, one of the first enzymes in steroid degradation in C. testosteroni. The results suggest that hsdA in C. testosteroni is under negative transcriptional control by a repressor protein, the gene of which has an opposite orientation to that of hsdA and which overlaps the hsdA sequence. Host strainsEscherichia coli HB101 (Promega) and C. testosteroni ATCC 11996 (Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen) were used for gene cloning and expression. Subcloning of fragments was carried out in plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 (Life Technologies, Inc.), pKK232–8 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the cat gene, and pBBR1MCS-2 (27Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop R.M., II Peterson K.M. Gene. 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Of special importance was the broad host range cloning vector pBBR1MCS-2, which contains the kanamycin resistance gene and which was found in our investigations to be able to replicate not only in E. colibut also in C. testosteroni ATCC 11996. pK18, which contains the kanamycin resistance gene, was a gift obtained from CIBA-Geigy AG, Department of Biotechnology, Basel. The plasmid copy numbers determined were as follows: 80 copies per cell of pUC18 and pUC19 in E. coli, 10 copies per cell of pKK232–8 in E. coli, 6 copies per cell of pBBR1MCS-2 in both E. coli and C. testosteroni, 80 copies per cell of pK18 in E. coli. Copy numbers remained unchanged, notwithstanding the size of the inserted fragments. Bacterial cells were grown in standard I nutrient broth medium (Merck) or standard LB medium at 37 °C (E. coli) or at 30 °C (C. testosteroni). Restriction enzymes, ligase, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and S1 nuclease were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Biolabs, MBI Fermentas, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Ampicillin and kanamycin antibiotics were from AGS (Heidelberg, Germany). Recombinant DNA work was carried out following standard techniques according to Sambrook et al.(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was cloned into pUC18 to get p6. p6 was digested with HincII and XmaI, and the resulting 2.979- and 2.937-kb fragments were ligated again into pUC18 to give pH2 and pX12, respectively. AvrII (restriction site on the p6C. testosteroni insert upstream of hsdA) andXbaI (restriction site in pUC18) were used for double digestion of p6 and ligated to yield pAX1. For transforming C. testosteroni with the same fragments, HincII,XmaI, AvrII, and XbaI restriction enzymes were used again to subclone respective inserts from p6 into pBBR1MCS-2, to obtain pBB21B, pBBH31, pBBX1, and pBBAX7. TheAvrII/XbaI-EcoRI fragment was also cloned into pK18 to get pKAX1. The 2.708-kbEcoRI-ClaI fragment from p6 was cloned into pBBR1MCS-2, and a corresponding 2.741-kbSalI-ClaI fragment was cloned into pKK232–8, to generate pBB7 and pBKB12, respectively. The same cloning strategies as described above were performed to generate pBKH1, pBKX8, and pBKAX1, which represent descendants from pKK232–8 containing theHincII-ClaI (0.430 kb),XmaI-ClaI (0.388 kb), andAvrII/XbaI-ClaI (0.185 kb) fragments, respectively, from p6 upstream of the cat gene. For getting deleted pBBR1MCS-2/CAT reporter constructs, the cat gene fragment from pKK232–8 was first subcloned with BamHI andAviII into pBBR1MCS-2 to yield pBBK1 (data not shown). A 2.735-kb XbaI-ClaI fragment from p6 was then ligated to pBBK1 upstream of cat to receive pBBK4. Similarly, constructs of the HincII-ClaI,XmaI-ClaI, andAvrII/XbaI-ClaI fragments plus thecat gene yielded pBBKH13, pBBKX7, and pBBKAX1. Subcloning of theC. testosteroni hsdA repressor gene and the preparation of respective plasmids are also shown in Fig. 1. A 2.451-kbKpnI-NdeI fragment of p6 was cloned into either pUC18 or pUC19 to yield pKpN6 or pKpN7, respectively. Plasmids pKAN10 and pKAN12 (containing a 1.030-kb insert) were obtained by excising a 1.421-kb KpnI-AvrII fragment from pKpN6 or pKpN7, respectively. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestions of the isolated plasmids. Plasmids were purified with the Qiagen Tip-100 kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Ligations were transferred into E. coli or C. testosteroni. Competent cells were prepared by the CaCl2 or electroporation methods. Double plasmid transformations were performed by exploiting the kanamycin resistance gene of pK18 and pBBR1MCS-2 and the ampicillin resistance gene of pUC18, pUC19, and pKK232–8. In these cases both antibiotics were added to the culture medium. Plasmid isolation and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to prove successful double transformations. The mutant promoters (pMx, where x indicates the plasmid number) were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (29Xiong G. Lutz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The following set of primers was used (see Table I): pL1 and pR2 for hsdA promoter mutations, pL1 and pR1 for wild-type hsdA promoter-cat constructs, pML and pMR for the mutated promoter-cat constructs, and pM0 and pR2 for promoterless hsdA constructs. Mutant plasmids were then transferred into E. coli HB101, and 3α-HSD/CR activity was assayed by HPLC analysis as described previously (10Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For determining the mutant promoter activity with the CAT reporter assay, mutant promoter-cat constructs were transformed intoC. testosteroni, and the CAT activities were assayed as described below. All mutant promoters generated in this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotec, Ebersberg, Germany).Table IPrimers used in this studyMutated bases are indicated in underlined italics. New restriction sites inserted (except for ClaI in pRse) are underlined. Open table in a new tab Mutated bases are indicated in underlined italics. New restriction sites inserted (except for ClaI in pRse) are underlined. Total RNA was prepared from E. coli HB101, previously transformed with plasmids p6, pX12, or pAX1, after growth for 6, 9, 12, or 16 h. The 15-mer oligonucleotide primer pRse (complementary to a sequence withinhsdA and later used as the sequencing primer; see TableI) was end-labeled with [32P]ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals kit). Primer extension was performed by hybridizing 20,000 cpm-labeled pRse for 20 min at 65 °C with 5 μg of total RNA of each preparation, followed by 10 min at room temperature. Annealed primer was extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) for 1 h at 41 °C. The resulting mixture was separated on a sequencing gel. As a reference, DNA sequence reactions of pX12 and pAX1 were performed with the same primer (pRse). A 204-mer oligonucleotide was prepared from plasmid p6 by polymerase chain reaction with primers pL1 and pR2 (see Table I), agarose gel electrophoresis, and ClaI digestion. The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [32P]ATP and subsequently digested with XbaI to yield a single-stranded 32P-labeled 185-mer. The oligonucleotide (50,000 cpm) was mixed in hybridization buffer with 10 μg of total RNA from E. coli HB101, previously transformed with plasmids p6, pX12, or pAX1, after growth for 6, 9, 12 or 16 h. The mixture was denatured at 85 °C for 10 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The annealed oligonucleotide/mRNA hybrid was treated with 200 units of S1 nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 1 h, and the resulting products were separated on a sequencing gel. As a reference, DNA sequence reactions of pX12 and pAX1 were performed with the sequencing primer pRse. Point mutations of both possible ATG start codons (resulting in pRm1 and pRm3) and shift mutations by insertion of an additional base within the repAsequence (resulting in pRm2 and pRm4) were generated by two-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (29Xiong G. Lutz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) according to standard procedures. The resulting plasmids were used in cotransformation experiments together with pAX1, and 3α-HSD/CR protein production was measured by ELISA. E. coliHB101 cells, carrying pKpN6, were grown for 18 h, and total protein was isolated. Ten μg of protein (10 μl) was mixed with 0.1 μCi of [3H]testosterone at room temperature for 20 min. Nonlabeled testosterone was used in increasing concentrations as a specific binding competitor. The samples were washed on nitrocellulose filters with 0.2 × TEN (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and 0.5% Tween 20 buffer and mixed with a scintillator, and the cpm were determined. Two-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to prepare 5-nucleotide and 10-nucleotide deleted mutants (29Xiong G. Lutz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All primers and oligonucleotides were prepared by MWG Biotec. The polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned into p6 for the preparation of pL10n (deletion at 0.935 kb) and pL5n (TGGGC deleted on location 2.568 kb). All clones prepared were sequenced by MWG Biotec. Three 34-bp double-stranded DNA fragments (Op1, Op2, and Co) for gel shift experiments with RepA were prepared by the annealing of six oligonucleotides synthesized by MWG Biotec. Oligonucleotides (100 pmol) were incubated pairwise in TEN buffer at 95 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool down slowly to 25 °C in 1.5 h. Finally, 4 pmol of DNA was labeled with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP. Electrophoresis was performed according to the instructions in the kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 8% polyacrylamide was used in gel shift assays. Op1 contained the 10-bp palindromic motif TCAAAGCCCA at 0.935 kb, Op2 contained the 10-bp palindromic motif TGGGCTTTGA at 2.568 kb, and Co represented a region outside the operator motifs and served as a control. For the quantification of 3α-HSD/CR protein expression, an ELISA was established, and respective antibodies were generated. Rabbit antibodies directed against 3α-HSD/CR fromC. testosteroni were prepared according to standard methods. ELISA plates were coated with protein extracts containing 3α-HSD/CR in coating buffer. After washing, antibodies against 3α-HSD/CR were added in 1:10,000 dilution. The further procedure corresponded to that of the CAT ELISA kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 3α-HSD/CR enzyme activity was assessed by HPLC as described previously (10Oppermann U.C.T. Maser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CAT expression from pKK232–8 and its derivatives was measured by the ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because nontransformed E. coli and C. testosteroni cells exhibited some background CAT activity, fresh competent cells were transformed and then cultivated for 16 h until used. In these cases CAT activity showed very low background levels, thus facilitating the procedure. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of enzymatic activities (HPLC) and protein expressions (ELISA) were analyzed by the Student'st test. Four independent plates of cells were transformed, and each extract was assayed in duplicate. As shown in Fig. 1, plasmids p6, pH2, pX12, and pAX1, which are derived from pUC18, were transferred into E. coli strain HB101. Plasmids pBB21B, pBBH31, pBBX1, and pBBAX7, which represent descendants of pBBR1MCS-2, were successfully transferred into C. testosteroni. Subsequent expression of 3α-HSD/CR in E. coli and C. testosteroniresulted in comparable enzyme activities in both bacteria, as determined by HPLC (Fig. 2), revealing the promoter region of hsdA to be recognized by the E. coli transcription machinery. Importantly, nontransformed E. coli cells had no detectable 3α-HSD/CR background activity. Accordingly, E. coli represents a suitable system for investigating the hsdA regulatory domains. Fig. 2 also shows that, compared with transformations with pH2, pBBH31, pX12, pBBX1, pAX1, and pBBAX7, 3α-HSD/CR activities in strains carrying p6 and pBB21B are very low. This low level of enzyme production with p6 and pBB21B in E. coli and C. testosteroni, respectively, not only reveals a pattern of negative regulation of hsdA transcription, but also suggests that a repressor protein might be encoded by a gene that is also located on the 5.257-kb EcoRI fragment of C. testosteronichromosomal DNA. In addition, because deletions downstream of theAvrII site (plasmids pAX1 and pBBAX7) lead to high enzyme activity, the promoter region of hsdA must be located within this 93-bp domain. The higher enzyme activity in strains carrying pAX1 and pBBAX7, relative to that with pH2, pBBH31, pX12, and pBBX1, may be explained by the action of two operator domains identified at 0.935 and 2.568 kb on the EcoRI fragment (see below). The same promoter regions of hsdA fused to the catreporter gene (plasmids pBBK4, pBBKH13, pBBKX7, and pBBKAX1) and transferred into C. testosteroni yielded a similar increase in CAT expression (data not shown). The transcription start site of hsdA was determined by primer extension analysis and confirmed by S1 nuclease protection assay (Fig.3). Total RNA from E. coliHB101 transformed with p6, pX12, or pAX1 was obtained after growth for 6, 9, 12, or 16 h. For the primer extension reaction (Fig.3 A) the sequencing primer pRse (TableI), complementary to a region within thehsdA coding region (positions +93 to +78), was used, and a single band representing the 5′-end was determined. For the S1 nuclease protection assay (Fig. 3 A), a 32P-labeled antisense DNA probe that extended from the AvrII site (at 2.532 kb) to the ClaI site (at 2.708 kb) on the entireEcoRI C. testosteroni fragment of plasmid p6 was used together with total RNA as described above. The 5′-end was thus localized 28 bp upstream of the ATG codon. The 5′-end (marked by anarrow in Fig. 3 B) is preceded by a promoter sequence (−35, TAGCCT; −10, TTTGAT; with a spacing of 17 bp) that has been verified by point mutation analysis (see below). Site-specific mutations in the −35 (TAGCCT) and −10 (TTTGAT) motifs were introduced by polymerase chain reaction and are shown in Table II. Mutant promoter fragments were inserted into pAX1 descendants and transferred into E. coli HB101 to determine 3α-HSD/CR activity, or pMx-cat constructs (in plasmid pBBKAX1) were transferred into C. testosteroni to test for CAT expression. As compared with respective control experiments, all point mutations except one resulted in a decrease of 3α-HSD/CR activities or CAT reporter expressions (Table II). For example, a T to G transition of the first T in the −10 motif resulted in a residual 3α-HSD/CR activity of only 1.8%, and a T to G transition of the first T in the −35 motif gave a residual CAT expression of only 13%. Interestingly, the C to A transition in the −35 motif yielded an enhanced activity of up to 135% (3α-HSD/CR) and 123% (CAT).Table IIPoint and deletion mutations in the hsdA promoter region and the effects thereof on the transcriptional activityCCTAGGGGAATTACATCGTCCGTTTGCATGTAGCCTGGTTGTTCATGATGGGCTTTGATGTGCGCCATCACCACCCAGACAAAAGGAGACAAGACATGAvrII −35 −10 SD hsdA or catOriginal SequencesTAGCCTTTTGATPromoter activity3α-HSDCATpAX1 pBBKAX111.5 ± 0.316.5 ± 1.1Mutated sequencespM101GTTGAT0.21 ± 0.030.95 ± 0.501.8%5.8%pM102TATGAT6.24 ± 0.739.08 ± 1.4254%55%pM103TTGGAT3.48 ± 0.168.03 ± 2.4130%49%pM104TTTAAT8.15 ± 1.009.08 ± 2.7871%55%pM105TTTGCT2.10 ± 0.351.03 ± 0.3518%6.2%pM106TTTGAC2.35 ± 0.516.73 ± 1.8122%40%pM351ATGTAGCCT1.51 ± 0.412.51 ± 0.3313%13%pM352ATGTCGCCT1.22 ± 0.221.96 ± 0.5410%12%pM353ATGTATCCT0.47 ± 0.200.70 ± 0.054.1%4.2%pM354ATGTAGACT0.09 ± 0.050.52 ± 0.210.8%3.3%pM355ATGTAGCAT15.5 ± 2.0420.3 ± 4.33135%123%pM356ATGTAGCCG0.36 ± 0.090.86 ± 0.313.1%5.2%pM-2AGTAGCCT9.86 ± 1.4216.6 ± 1.7386%101%pM-3CTGTAGCCT9.82 ± 0.5517.8 ± 1.0785%108%pM0Promoter sequence deleted (3α-HSD)<0.01pBBK1Promoter sequence deleted (CAT)1.48 ± 1.339.0%pUC18Vector without insert (3α-HSD)<0.01pBBR1MSC-2Vector without insert (CAT)1.08 ± 1.15Cell extracts of E. coli HB101 (transformed with p6-derived mutant promoter fragments) and of C. testosteroni (harboring mutant promoter-cat constructs derived from pBBKAX1) were prepared and tested for 3α-HSD activity or CAT expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Single point mutations are underlined and indicated in italics. 3α-HSD activities (nmol × min−1 × mg−1) and CAT expression (ng × mg−1 of protein) are given as percentages relative to control values obtained with plasmids pAX1 and pBBKAX1.

Open table in a new tab Cell extracts of E. coli HB101 (transformed with p6-derived mutant promoter fragments) and of C. testosteroni (harboring mutant promoter-cat constructs derived from pBBKAX1) were prepared and tested for 3α-HSD activity or CAT expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Single point mutations are underlined and indicated in italics. 3α-HSD activities (nmol × min−1 × mg−1) and CAT expression (ng × mg−1 of protein) are given as percentages relative to control values obtained with plasmids pAX1 and pBBKAX1. The data correspond to averages ± S.D. of at least four independent determinations. As controls, two mutations located 2 and 3 bp upstream of the −35 sequence were introduced to give plasmids pm-2 and pm-3, which were transferred into E. coli andC. testosteroni. No changes in the promoter activity could be observed, as revealed by both 3α-HSD/CR and CAT determinations (Table II). In addition, we prepared mutant plasmids (pM0 and pBBK1) in which the entire promoter sequence (downstream of the AvrII restriction site) was deleted. Cells transformed with these plasmids showed no 3α-HSD/CR activity or very low CAT activities, respectively (Table II). These experiments identified the promoter region of hsdA and demonstrate that the −35 and −10 regions are critical for full activity. These sequences are separated by 17 bp, the optimal distance (17 ± 2 bp) for promoters recognized by the ς70 RNA polymerase holoenzyme. As is the case with many negatively regulated enzymes, the coding region of a putative repressor protein was suspected to lie adjacent to hsdA. To test this hypothesis, the upstream and downstream regions of hsdA were searched for potential repressor genes in separate experiments. First, the 2.708-kbEcoRI-ClaI upstream fragment of hsdAwas subcloned into pBBR1MCS-2 to generate pBB7 (Fig. 1). Levels of 3α-HSD/CR expression of p6, pH2, pX12, and pAX1 in E. coliwere compared after double plasmid transformation with either pBBR1MCS-2 (control) or pBB7 in medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin. From the fact that pBB7 did not affect 3α-HSD/CR expression, it was obvious that no repressor gene is located on the 2.708-kb upstream fragment of hsdA (data not shown). To search for the coding region of the repressor protein downstream of hsdA, we fused theEcoRI-ClaI fragment from p6 (lackinghsdA) to the cat gene in pKK232–8 (Fig. 1). pKK232–8 (control) and the resulting plasmid descendants pBKB12, pBKH1, pBKX8, and pBKAX1 were each double-transformed into E. coli with the second plasmids pBBR1MCS-2 (control), pBB7, pBBAX7, and pBB21B in medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin. As has already been found with 3α-HSD/CR expression, theEcoRI-ClaI upstream fragment of hsdA(pBB7) failed to inhibit CAT expres"
https://openalex.org/W1971396002,"Rapid adaptive fixation of a new favorable mutation is expected to affect neighboring genes along the chromosome. Evolutionary theory predicts that the chromosomal region would show a reduced level of genetic variation and an excess of rare alleles. We have confirmed these predictions in a region of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster that contains a newly evolved gene for a component of the sperm axoneme. In D. simulans , where the novel gene does not exist, the pattern of genetic variation is consistent with selection against recurrent deleterious mutations. These findings imply that the pattern of genetic variation along a chromosome may be useful for inferring its evolutionary history and for revealing regions in which recent adaptive fixations have taken place."

Recently, the deposits have been shown to contain protein fragments of ubiquitin-B and amyloid precursor protein (APP) with an aberrant carboxyl terminus resulting from frameshift mutations (dinucleotide deletions; ΔGU or ΔGA) in or adjacent to GAGAG motifs in their mRNAs, a process referred to as molecular misreading. We have now used a bacterial expression system with the green fluorescent protein as a reporter to screen gene transcripts from aged controls, Alzheimer's disease, and Down's syndrome for molecular misreading. Novel frameshift mutations at a number of locations in the transcripts of the ubiquitin-B and APP genes were discovered (ΔGA, ΔG, ΔGU, ΔGG, ΔCA, ΔAU, ΔA, ΔAA, ΔC, ΔU, and insertion of an A). Interestingly, most mutations were in close proximity of short simple repeats (GAGAG, GGUGGU, GAGACACACA, UCAUCAUCA, CAAACAAA, and GAAGAAGAA), demonstrating that the GAGAG motif does not constitute the only hot spot for transcriptional errors. Unlike the previously detected aberrant APP fragments, some of the novel ones have the potential to generate the neurotoxic peptide β-amyloid.

The disease is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques in the brain. A major constituent of the plaques is β-amyloid, a neurotoxic peptide generated by processing of the type I transmembrane β-amyloid precursor protein APP (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys.

The sporadic form accounts for more than 60% of all AD cases, but the cause of the development of these cases is unknown. A recent study provided a new view on the mechanism that may underly aging and that in particular may contribute to the development of the sporadic forms of AD and Down's syndrome (DS; see Refs. 2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H.

The new view is referred to as molecular misreading and is based on the finding of a novel type of dinucleotide deletion in or adjacent to a GAGAG motif in the mRNA transcripts of two neuronal genes encoding APP and the cytoplasmic garbage protein ubiquitin-B (Ubi-B) (2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H.

Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein Down's syndrome ubiquitin-B green fluorescent protein polymerase chain reaction base pair To examine how widespread the phenomenon of molecular misreading is and whether hot spots other than GAGAG may occur, we have developed a bacterial expression system with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter and successfully used this system for the screening of frameshift mutations in mRNAs even when the mutational rate is low. We discovered novel frameshift mutations at different sites in Ubi-B and APP gene transcripts isolated from cortical regions of aged individuals. Using a standard Trizol procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.), total RNA was extracted from cortical regions of aged individuals that had suffered from AD or DS (patients 92-080 (DS, 58, ♀) and 93-048 (DS, 67, ♀) were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; patients 92-50-529 (control, 96, ♀), 92-50-692 (control with plaques, 85, ♀), 94-52-312 (control, 85, ♀), 95-50-665 (control, 84, ♀), 88-50-322 (AD, 85, ♀), 88-52-120 (AD, 83, ♀), 92-51-371 (AD, 81, ♀), 95-51-242 (AD, 79, ⌖), and 95-51-014 (AD, 81, ♀) were obtained from the Department of Pathology, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Single stranded cDNA was synthesized by using 2 μg of total RNA, randomly primed with hexamers and reverse transcribed with RT Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR was performed with PWO DNA polymerase (proofreading activity; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Initially, we experienced a technical problem in that a substantial percentage (∼1%) of the synthesized primers was found to contain a deletion or an insertion of a nucleotide. Therefore, primers (Biolegio, Malden, The Netherlands) were purified by SDS-PAGE to diminish background signals caused by the mistakes made during primer synthesis. The primers used for Ubi-B mRNA analysis were 5′-ggggggggaagcttccgctatcaggtcaaaatg-3′ as forward and 5′-gggggtctagatcttcacgaagatctgcat-3′ as reverse primer (255-bp PCR product). For APP mRNA analysis, the following primer sets were used: APP-ex9 with 5′-gggggaagctttgcccatttccagaaagcc-3′ as forward and 5′-gggggtctagacggcggtcattgagcatggc-3′ as reverse primer (242-bp product); APP-BA with 5′-ggggaagctttgggttgacaaatatcaagagc-3′ as forward and 5′-ggggtctagattctgcatctgctcaaagaac-3′ as reverse primer (APP-BA1; 341-bp product) or 5′-ggggtctagattttcgtagccgttctgctgc-3′ as reverse primer (APP-BA2; 312-bp product); APP-CT with 5′-gggggaagcttgaagaagaaacagtacaca-3′ as forward and 5′-ggggtctagattctgcatctgctcaaagaac-3′ as reverse primer (APP-CT1; 141 bp product) or 5′-ggggtctagattttcgtagccgttctgctgc-3′ as reverse primer (APP-CT2; 112 bp product). PCR products were gel-purified, digested with HindIII and XbaI, and subcloned into the bacterial vector pGFPuv (6079–1; CLONTECH; GenBankTM accession number U62636; see Fig. 1). DNA was isolated from selected clones (Flexiprep kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and insert sizes were determined. During the development of this method we experienced a background signal caused by internal initiation of translation at the first AUG of the GFP coding region. To prevent this background signal, this AUG was removed via PCR with 5′ primer ggtcgactctagaaaaaagtaaaggagaagaacttttcactgg and 3′ primer ctcagttggaattcattatttgtagagctcatgcatgccatg. The mutated construct is referred to as pGFP*uv and was used for the cloning of the PCR products to identify the frameshift mutations. DNA sequence analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (ABI Prism 310; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The screening strategy provides different ways to detect frameshift mutations. The Ubi-B primers were designed in such a way that clones containing a wild type insert would show no fluorescence, whereas clones containing an insert with a dinucleotide deletion would generate weak fluorescence. By changing the 3′ primer one could also search for deletions of one nucleotide. For the detection of mutations in APP gene transcripts, the primers were designed in such a way that the wild type APP is in frame with GFP, whereas a frameshift would lead to nonfluorescent bacteria. However, one of the wild type APP PCR fragments (generated with primers APP-BA1 and APP-BA2) was found to result in a nonfluorescent GFP fusion protein because of the size of the insert. Surprisingly, in this case a number of fluorescent bacteria were still detected, and sequencing of these clones revealed the presence of APP frameshift mutations. These frameshifts caused an early termination of translation, and it is likely that reinitiation of translation occurred to generate a fluorescent GFP fusion protein. Age-related frameshift mutations in gene transcripts have been shown to occur in Brattleboro rats (5Evans D.A.P. van der Kleij A.A.M. Sonnemans M.A.F. Burbach J.P.H. Van Leeuwen F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in patients who had suffered from AD or DS (2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.V. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These frameshift mutations are generated at the RNA and not the DNA level, and this process has been referred to as molecular misreading (6Van Leeuwen F.W. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 331-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The frameshifts were detected with an immunoscreening procedure implying the need for a specific antibody for each mutation to be investigated. To circumvent the necessity for the generation of an antibody for the detection of any new mutation, we developed a bacterial expression cloning strategy involving the use of GFP as a reporter protein to screen PCR fragments up to 300 nucleotides in length for the presence of frameshift mutations (see “Experimental Procedures”). To examine the sensitivity of the method and to show that the mutations are not generated as a result of a PCR artifact, constructs containing either wild type Ubi-B or Ubi-B with the dinucleotide deletion previously described (ΔGU; Ubi-B+1; see Ref. 2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.V. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) were used in different ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:10000 (wild type:ΔGU). Even at a ratio of 1:10000 the (weakly) fluorescent clones containing the frameshift mutation could still be detected at the expected frequency. Subsequently, the validity of the procedure was checked by searching for a frameshift that is known to occur in Ubi-B gene transcripts isolated from human DS brain tissue (2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.V. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A GU deletion following a GAGAG motif in the Ubi-B transcript identical to the one reported earlier (2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A.

Because the PCR primers corresponded to regions located in separate exons of the Ubi-B gene, the size of the PCR fragment (255 bp) revealed that the mutations were detected at the RNA and not the DNA level. Interestingly, in addition to the ΔGU, we discovered several novel mutations (ΔGA, ΔG, ΔGG, and insertion of an A) (Table I). These novel mutations were also located adjacent to the GAGAG motif described earlier, except for the insertion of an A, which occurred adjacent to a GGUGGU motif. This latter observation indicates the importance of simple repeats for the process of molecular misreading.Table IFrameshift mutations detected in human brain RNA of aged individuals (controls (C) and patients that had suffered from AD or DS)Nucleotide numbering corresponds to accession number X04803 (Ubi-B; see Ref. 15Baker R.T.

YIndicates an aged control with plaques. Another transcript previously shown to contain dinucleotide deletions at a GAGAG motif is produced by the APP gene (2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.V. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In exons 9 and 10 of the APP gene, three GAGAG motifs are clustered. When applying our strategy on RNA derived from aged individuals, we were again able to confirm the previously observed GA deletion in the second GAGAG motif in exon 9 (Table I). Furthermore, we detected a CA deletion in exon 11 that, remarkably, occurred in a GAGACACACA motif, again pointing to the involvement of simple repeats in molecular misreading. Molecular misreading in neither exon 9 nor exon 11 of the APP gene can, however, by itself lead to an increase in the production of Aβ, because the APP fragments generated by these frameshift mutations do not contain the Aβ peptide region (encoded by exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene). In contrast, the occurrence of a frameshift mutation in a region of the mRNA corresponding to the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of APP would lead to an aberrant protein with the potential to give rise to Aβ (Fig. 1). We therefore searched for mutations in the mRNA region encoding the C-terminal part of APP, and this analysis revealed a number of novel frameshift mutations, namely ΔA and ΔAA (both in UCAUCAUCAAAAAUUGG), ΔA (UUCAAACAAAGGUGCAAUCAUUC), ΔG (UUGGACUCAUGGUGGGCGGUUGUU; UUCAAACAAAGGUGCAAUCAUUC; GAAGAAGAAACAGUACACA), ΔU (UGAUCGUCAUCACACCU), and ΔC (CTGTCACCCCAGAGGAG) (Table I). Some of these mutations occurred in close proximity of short simple repeats (UCAUCAUCA, CAAACAAA, and GAAGAAGAA). The mutations were not only detected in mRNAs derived from patients who had suffered from AD or DS but also in temporal cortex mRNAs of aged controls. Interestingly, the control that showed the highest mutation frequency exhibited plaques in the brain. The aberrant proteins resulting from molecular misreading might affect cell physiology. For instance, the previously published Ubi-B+1 protein, lacking Glycine residue 76 that is essential for recognition of the target protein (7Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), is no longer able to ubiquitinilate proteins in vitro. 2F. A. A. Weijts, W. H. van den Hurk, and G. J. M. Martens, unpublished data. The above-mentioned novel frameshift mutations in the Ubi-B gene transcripts probably also result in ubiquitin molecules unable to function properly. Concerning the APP protein one should consider its cytoplasmic tail that contains two sorting signals (YTSI and YENPTY), characterized as internalization and endosomal/lysosomal targeting signals, and necessary for intracellular trafficking of APP. Deleting or mutating these signals indeed affects APP routing (8Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9De Strooper B.

Biochem. 1997; 121: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The frameshift deletions ΔG at nucleotide 2103 and ΔC at nucleotide 2153, in the part of the APP transcript encoding the cytoplasmic region, result in proteins with an aberrant and elongated cytoplasmic tail lacking one or both of the targeting signals of APP (Fig. 1). Because an affected APP routing may lead to an increased production of Aβ (14Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), the novel APP proteins with the aberrant tails may give rise to this neurotoxic peptide. Although the frameshift mutations were found at a relatively low rate (1:950 to 1:8600 transcripts; see Table I), at the single cell level the frequency may be considerably higher. Immunocytochemical analysis has revealed that only a small percentage of cells contain the aberrant frameshift proteins, indicating that molecular misreading is indeed restricted to a minority of neuronal cells (2Van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.V. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In an affected cell, the percentage of mutated transcripts may well be relatively high, which could significantly contribute to the malfunctioning of such a cell, possibly eventually even promoting its degeneration. We conclude that during aging molecular misreading is a widespread event occurring at a variety of short simple repeats.

We have identified and characterized a fourth sulfotransferase that is homologous to HNK-1 ST with 23% identical amino acids.N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 2 (GalNAc-4-ST2) transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc in the sequence GalNAc-β1,4GlcNAcβ-R and to the C-4 hydroxyl of internal β1,4-linked GalNAc moieties in chondroitin and dermatan.

The insert of the corresponding I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (LLNL) cDNA clone, ID 49547 (IMAGp951B2016 obtained from RZPD, Berlin, Germany) (27Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), was sequenced and found to contain a complete open reading frame encoding for a 358-amino acid protein showing significant sequence similarity to rat and human HNK-1 sulfotransferases. This sequence was designated as GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) (GenBankTM accession number AF332473). The forward primer 5′-GGG AGA GTG GAG AAG AGA AGA GAA C-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAG CCA ATC CAT TTA GTA CCA TCA GA-3′ were used to amplify a 595-bp fragment (nucleotides at position 211–805 in the GalNAc-4-ST2 cDNA) including the putative start codon from first-strand cDNA produced from 100 ng of total RNA obtained from a human glioma and the human kidney 293 cell line using Omniscript® reverse transcriptase (Qiagen). An additional 38 bps (designated exon 4 in Fig. 3) were present in this product when compared with GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) and shifted the stop codons located 5′ out of the reading frame of the putative translation start site. Similarity searches identified a bovine EST (GenBankTM accession number BE724107) with sequence homology to the 5′ end of the amplified fragment, allowing us to predict a chimeric sequence from the human and bovine cDNAs that would contain an open reading frame encoding for a putative 443-amino acid protein. Human genomic clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AC009872, AC023575, andAC010854) were analyzed with FGENESH (28Salamov A.A. Solovyev V.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and the predicted exons were evaluated using the chimeric GalNAc-4-ST2 cDNA. Primer pairs derived from exonic sequences were designed and used to amplify the full-length GalNAc-4 ST2 sequence shown in Fig. 1 A(GenBankTM accession number AF332472) from both human embryonic kidney 293 cell line and glioma cDNA.Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of human GalNAc-4-ST2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number ).

The genomic clone with the GenBankTM accession number AC010854 was retrieved with a BLASTN search against the nonredundant data base. The organization of the GalNAc-4-ST2 gene shown in Fig. 3 was deduced by comparing the cDNA of GalNAc-4-ST2 with these genomic sequences. The complete open reading frame of GalNAc-4-ST2 was amplified from cDNA prepared from human kidney 293 cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following: 1) the 5′-specific primer 5′-ATA TGG ATC CGC CAC CAT GCA GCC ATC TGA AAT G-3′ containing a BamHI site, the consensus Kozak sequence GCCACC (29Kozak M.

The open reading frame of GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) was amplified by PCR from the human I.M.A.G.E.

PCRs were carried out using PfuTurbo® polymerase (Stratagene) with 35 cycles of a reaction consisting of 45 s denaturation at 95 °C, 60 s annealing at 55 °C, and 60 s of elongation at 72 °C. The PCR fragments had the expected lengths of 1332 and 1077 bp, respectively, and were directionally subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). CHO/Tag cells were transfected with 13 μg of pcDNA3.1-GalNAc-4-ST2, pcDNA3.1-C4ST-1, pcDNA3.1-GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86), or pcDNA3.1 and 35 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free medium for 6 h per the manufacturer's protocol. Sixty hours after transfection, the cells and medium were collected separately for analysis. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 175 mm KCl, 2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (23 millitrypsin inhibitor units of aprotinin and 4 μg each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin) per 100-mm diameter culture plate. The homogenate was mixed by rotation for 1 h and sedimented at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was designated as the cell extract. The culture medium was pooled, sedimented at 12,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant adjusted to a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors were added as noted above. GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase reactions (50 μl) were carried out as described (30Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

Chondroitin and dermatan GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activities were determined using a previously described assay (23Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

[35S]SO4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-MCO obtained by incubation with GalNAc-4-ST2 or GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) for 16 h at 28 °C was isolated on a Sep-Pak C18(Waters) and characterized as described previously with a CarboPak PA1 column (Dionex) (30Skelton T.P. Hooper L.V. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17142-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfated monosaccharides were released from the [35S]SO4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-MCO product by mild acid hydrolysis and separated from intact oligosaccharides and other degradation products by gel filtration on Sephadex G-10 in 100 mm NH4HCO3prior to analysis by HPLC on CarboPak PA1 column (Dionex) as described (30Skelton T.P.

The [35S]SO4-labeled chondroitin and dermatan products were digested with 30 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Inc.) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 16 h at 37 °C. The completeness of digestion was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 in 100 mmNH4HCO3. The released [35S]SO4-labeled saccharides were characterized by HPLC using a 4.6 × 250 mm MicroPak AX-5 column (Varian Associates). Saccharides were separated using a linear gradient of 10 mm KH2PO4 to 450 mm KH2PO4 over 40 min at 1.0 ml per min (32Green E.D. Baenziger J.U. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Standards were detected by their absorbance at 210 or 234 nm, and fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals for determination of radioactivity. In excess of 90% of the [35S]SO4 label was recovered. Glycoproteins were tested as substrates for GalNAc-4-ST2 using the conditions described above for oligosaccharide acceptors with the following modifications. No unlabeled PAPS was added to the [35S]PAPS. Each 50-μl reaction contained 3 μg of purified bovine parotid carbonic anhydrase VI (CA-VI) (33Hooper L.V. Beranek M.C. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J.

After 16 h at 28 °C, duplicate reactions were either stopped by addition of an equal volume of sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.003% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) or were digested with 34 microunits of peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) as described (3Baenziger J.U.

The [35S]SO4-labeled proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide) and detected by autoradiography. Human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN®) blots and Human Multiple Tissue Expression (MTETM) arrays were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. They were hybridized with 5–15 × 106 cpm of a GalNAc-4-ST2 specific α-32P-labeled cDNA probe and washed according to the manufacturer's specifications. The membranes were exposed to Biomax MS films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2–6 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The 503-bp probe used for the labeling reactions corresponds to nucleotide 745–1247 of the GalNac-4-ST2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF332472). We recently identified and characterized a human GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferase, GalNAc-4-ST1 (24Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.-G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38402-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), based on its homology to the HNK-1 ST that transfers sulfate to GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R to produce the HNK-1 epitope SO4-3-GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R. In contrast to HNK-1 ST, GalNAc-4-ST1 transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl of β1,4-linked GalNAc on N-linked oligosaccharides such as those found on the glycoprotein hormones LH and TSH (24Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.-G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38402-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Okuda T. Mita S. Yamauchi S. Fukuta M.

Further screening of the EST database at GenBankTM, National Center for Biotechnology Information, using the deduced amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of rat HNK-1 ST (GenBankTM accession number AF022729) identified the human EST H15485. The insert of the corresponding I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (LLNL) cDNA clone ID 49547 contains an open reading frame of 1077 bp with a single in-frame ATG codon at the 5′ end preceded by two in-frame stop codons. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 358 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 42.1 kDa and four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The predicted protein sequence is closely related to GalNAc-4-ST1 with 44% identical residues. However, no membrane-spanning regions are predicted to be present by hidden Markov model based algorithm TMHMM (34Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. ISMB. 1998; 6: 175-182Google Scholar). This suggests the presumptive sulfotransferase, designated as GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) (GenBankTM accession number AF332473), is synthesized as a soluble glycoprotein. Transcripts derived from a human embryonic kidney 293 cell line and glioma cDNA contained an additional 38-bp sequence, later identified as exon 4 (see below), that was not present in GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86). A virtual cDNA consisting of this amplified sequence and an EST (GenBankTM accession number BE724107) from the 5′ end of the coding region of the bovine orthologue was deduced and used to analyze genomic clones representing the human GalNAc-4-ST2 locus (see below). Primer pairs were designed for the predicted open reading frame and used to amplify the sequence designated GalNAc-4-ST2 in Fig.1 A (GenBankTMaccession number AF332472) from first strand cDNAs derived from both 293 cells and a glioma. The open reading frame of GalNAc-4-ST2 is preceded at its 5′ end by a stop codon in all three reading frames and predicts a protein of 443 amino acids with four potential glycosylation sites and a molecular mass of 52.1 kDa. GalNAc-4-ST2 is predicted to have a membrane-spanning domain by the TMHMM algorithm (34Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. ISMB. 1998; 6: 175-182Google Scholar) and a type II topology. If exon 4 is absent due to alternative splicing, GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) would be initiated from the alternative ATG start codon located at the position of the Met that is equivalent to amino acid 86 in full-length GalNAc-4-ST2 (Fig. 1). Multiple alignment of the protein sequence of GalNAc-4-ST2 with other members of the HNK-1 sulfotransferase family using the ClustalW algorithm implemented in the BIOEDIT suite (35Hall T. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar) (Fig.2) revealed that GalNAc-4-ST2 is 46% identical to GalNAc-4-ST1. GalNAc-4-ST2 also has a high percentage of identical amino acids when compared with other HNK-1 ST-related sulfotransferases as follows: 23% to human HNK-1 ST, 27% to human chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1), and 24% to human chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-2 (C4ST-2) (Fig. 2). Regions with the highest degree of identity include the putative 5′-phosphosulfonate-binding site (5′-PSB), the putative 3′-phosphate-binding site (3′-PB), and three regions designated III, IV, and V (23Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that do not have an identified function. BLAST similarity searches of the htgs and the nonredundant data set were performed using the GalNAc-4-ST2 cDNA sequence and retrieved multiple matching sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). Among the genomic clones retrieved GenBankTM accession numbers AP001272 and AP001087 were both annotated to be mapped on chromosome 18q11.2. Comparisons between the cDNA and the genomic sequences AC009872, AC023575, and AC010854showed that the coding region of GalNAc-4-ST2 is distributed over five exons (Fig. 3 A). The sizes of the untranslated regions of exon 1 and exon 5 have not yet been determined. As noted above, GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) does not contain exon 4. Synthesis of GalNAc-4-ST2(Met-86) is therefore initiated from the alternative start codon located at amino acid position 86 of GalNAc-4-ST2 producing a protein that does not have a transmembrane domain (Fig. 3 B). Each of the exons identified, including exon 4, was found to have conserved donor and acceptor splice sites (Fig. 3 C). Since GalNAc-4-ST2 is cl"

Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Horovitz and coworkers (11Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have proposed a nested model describing the mixed cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis by GroEL, positive cooperativity within the same rings and negative cooperativity between the two rings. In the model, each GroEL ring is in equilibrium between two allosteric states, a tense (T) state with low affinity for ATP and a relaxed (R) state with high affinity for ATP. Binding of ATP occurs with strong positive cooperativity to one of the rings (12Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Bochkareva E.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The allosteric transitions of GroEL are most likely to correspond to the upward movement of the apical domains (16White H.E. Chen S. Roseman A.M. Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Saibil H.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A second level of cooperativity undergoes sequential transitions from the TT state via the TR state to the RR state (11Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This negative cooperativity between two rings prevents ATP binding to the second ring (16White H.E. Chen S. Roseman A.M. Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Saibil H.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).We previously reported a mutant GroEL (GroELAEX; C138S,C458S,C519S,D83C,K327C)1in which apical and equatorial domains can be cross-linked in a reversible manner (apical-equatorial cross (X)-link) (17Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, GroELAEX is fully active as a chaperonin. However, under oxidative conditions, a disulfide cross-link is formed between two introduced cysteines, locking GroELAEX in a closed conformation, which can bind ATP and polypeptide but is unable to hydrolyze bound ATP, release bound polypeptide, or bind GroES (17Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, to investigate the role of each subunit in the tetradecameric GroEL complex, we prepared intersubunit hybrid complexes containing various copies of the oxidized GroELAEX monomers by reconstituting the denatured GroEL monomers. Remarkably, the hybrid GroEL complex containing one or two disulfide cross-linked GroELAEX monomers per ring showed larger ATPase activity at saturating ATP concentration than wild-type GroEL (GroELWT). This is likely caused by removal of the negative cooperativity between rings. In contrast, hybrid between GroELWT and GroELD398A, which is ATPase-deficient but can undergo domain-opening motion, retained negative cooperativity of the ATPase activity. The coordinate closed to open conformational transition might be essential for the cooperative nature of GroEL. The Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL binds to non-native proteins and facilitates their folding. GroEL is assisted by the cofactor GroES and uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis (1Sigler P.B. Xu Z.

Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar). GroEL consists of fourteen identical 58-kDa subunits, which are arranged in two heptameric rings stacked upon one another in a back to back manner, forming a large central cavity (3Braig K.

Each subunit of GroEL has a site for ATP hydrolysis (4Boisvert D.C. Wang J. Otwinowski Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and the ATPase cycle controls binding and release of substrate protein, as well as GroES (6Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H.
