By screening >94,000 drug pairs in vitro, Lehár et al. show that synergistic combinations tend to be more selective than single drugs and are therefore unlikely to cause synergistic side effects. Drug combinations are a promising strategy to overcome the compensatory mechanisms and unwanted off-target effects that limit the utility of many potential drugs. However, enthusiasm for this approach is tempered by concerns that the therapeutic synergy of a combination will be accompanied by synergistic side effects. Using large scale simulations of bacterial metabolism and 94,110 multi-dose experiments relevant to diverse diseases, we provide evidence that synergistic drug combinations are generally more specific to particular cellular contexts than are single agent activities. We highlight six combinations whose selective synergy depends on multitarget drug activity. For one anti-inflammatory example, we show how such selectivity is achieved through differential expression of the drugs' targets in cell types associated with therapeutic, but not toxic, effects and validate its therapeutic relevance in a rat model of asthma. The context specificity of synergistic combinations creates many opportunities for therapeutically relevant selectivity and enables improved control of complex biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2036307272,"Richard Houlston, Melissa Bondy and colleagues identify variants at five loci associated with glioma susceptibility, providing insights into the etiology of this primary brain tumor. The risk loci include common variants near TERT, CDKN2A-CDKN2B and RTEL1. To identify risk variants for glioma, we conducted a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies by genotyping 550K tagging SNPs in a total of 1,878 cases and 3,670 controls, with validation in three additional independent series totaling 2,545 cases and 2,953 controls. We identified five risk loci for glioma at 5p15.33 (rs2736100, TERT; P = 1.50 × 10−17), 8q24.21 (rs4295627, CCDC26; P = 2.34 × 10−18), 9p21.3 (rs4977756, CDKN2A-CDKN2B; P = 7.24 × 10−15), 20q13.33 (rs6010620, RTEL1; P = 2.52 × 10−12) and 11q23.3 (rs498872, PHLDB1; P = 1.07 × 10−8). These data show that common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing glioma and provide insight into disease causation of this primary brain tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1986834354,"Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase with tumor grade, and elevated serum IL-6 correlates with poor breast cancer patient survival. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes such as impaired E-cadherin expression or aberrant Vimentin induction are associated with enhanced metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Despite this fact, few tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular signaling factors capable of provoking such a phenotypic transition have been identified. In this study, we showed that IL-6 promoted E-cadherin repression among a panel of estrogen receptor-α-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic stable IL-6 expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7IL−6) exhibited an EMT phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin expression and induction of Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail and Twist. MCF-7IL−6 cells formed xenograft tumors that displayed loss of E-cadherin, robust Vimentin induction, increased proliferative indices, advanced tumor grade and undifferentiated histology. Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2133980633,"The causes of glioblastoma and other gliomas remain obscure. To discover new candidate genes influencing glioma susceptibility, we conducted a principal component-adjusted genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 275,895 autosomal variants among 692 adult high-grade glioma cases (622 from the San Francisco Adult Glioma Study (AGS) and 70 from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) and 3,992 controls (602 from AGS and 3,390 from Illumina iControlDB (iControls)). For replication, we analyzed the 13 SNPs with P < 10(-6) using independent data from 176 high-grade glioma cases and 174 controls from the Mayo Clinic. On 9p21, rs1412829 near CDKN2B had discovery P = 3.4 x 10(-8), replication P = 0.0038 and combined P = 1.85 x 10(-10). On 20q13.3, rs6010620 intronic to RTEL1 had discovery P = 1.5 x 10(-7), replication P = 0.00035 and combined P = 3.40 x 10(-9). For both SNPs, the direction of association was the same in discovery and replication phases."
https://openalex.org/W2070140741,"We report a genome-wide association study of melanoma conducted by the GenoMEL consortium based on 317K tagging SNPs for 1,650 selected cases and 4,336 controls, with replication in an additional two cohorts (1,149 selected cases and 964 controls from GenoMEL, and a population-based case-control study in Leeds of 1,163 cases and 903 controls). The genome-wide screen identified five loci with genotyped or imputed SNPs reaching P < 5 x 10(-7). Three of these loci were replicated: 16q24 encompassing MC1R (combined P = 2.54 x 10(-27) for rs258322), 11q14-q21 encompassing TYR (P = 2.41 x 10(-14) for rs1393350) and 9p21 adjacent to MTAP and flanking CDKN2A (P = 4.03 x 10(-7) for rs7023329). MC1R and TYR are associated with pigmentation, freckling and cutaneous sun sensitivity, well-recognized melanoma risk factors. Common variants within the 9p21 locus have not previously been associated with melanoma. Despite wide variation in allele frequency, these genetic variants show notable homogeneity of effect across populations of European ancestry living at different latitudes and show independent association to disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2091298691,"Simon Stacey and colleagues report several new susceptibility variants for basal cell carcinoma, including coding variants in KRT5, a variant at 9p21 near CDKN2A and CDKN2B and a variant at 7q32 near KLF14. The latter is an imprinted gene, and the effect at this locus is dependent on the parental origin of the risk allele. In a follow-up to our previously reported genome-wide association study of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC)1, we describe here several new susceptibility variants. SNP rs11170164, encoding a G138E substitution in the keratin 5 (KRT5) gene, affects risk of BCC (OR = 1.35, P = 2.1 × 10−9). A variant at 9p21 near CDKN2A and CDKN2B also confers susceptibility to BCC (rs2151280[C]; OR = 1.19, P = 6.9 × 10−9), as does rs157935[T] at 7q32 near the imprinted gene KLF14 (OR = 1.23, P = 5.7 × 10−10). The effect of rs157935[T] is dependent on the parental origin of the risk allele. None of these variants were found to be associated with melanoma or fair-pigmentation traits. A melanoma- and pigmentation-associated variant in the SLC45A2 gene, L374F, is associated with risk of both BCC and squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, we report conclusive evidence that rs401681[C] in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus confers susceptibility to BCC but protects against melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1967987158,"myc is a proto-oncogene that plays an important role in the promotion of cellular growth and proliferation. Understanding the regulation of c-myc is important in cancer biology, as it is overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers, including most gynecological, breast, and colon cancers. We previously demonstrated that a guanine-rich region upstream of the P1 promoter of c-myc that controls 85-90% of the transcriptional activation of this gene can form an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4) that functions as a transcriptional repressor element. In this study, we used an affinity column to purify proteins that selectively bind to the human c-myc G-quadruplex. We found that nucleolin, a multifunctional phosphoprotein, binds in vitro to the c-myc G-quadruplex structure with high affinity and selectivity when compared with other known quadruplex structures. In addition, we demonstrate that upon binding, nucleolin facilitates the formation and increases the stability of the c-myc G-quadruplex structure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nucleolin overexpression reduces the activity of a c-myc promoter in plasmid presumably by inducing and stabilizing the formation of the c-myc G-quadruplex. Finally, we show that nucleolin binds to the c-myc promoter in HeLa cells, which indicates that this interaction occurs in vivo. In summary, nucleolin may induce c-myc G4 formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2129212414,"The role of feedforward inhibition onto Purkinje cells during learning is still not well understood. Here, the authors report that selective genetic removal of GABAA receptor–mediated inhibition onto Purkinje cells modulates fine-scale patterns of Purkinje cell activity. These patterns may mediate the induction of downstream plasticity and, ultimately, the consolidation of cerebellar motor learning. Although feedforward inhibition onto Purkinje cells was first documented 40 years ago, we understand little of how inhibitory interneurons contribute to cerebellar function in behaving animals. Using a mouse line (PC-Δγ2) in which GABAA receptor–mediated synaptic inhibition is selectively removed from Purkinje cells, we examined how feedforward inhibition from molecular layer interneurons regulates adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Although impairment of baseline motor performance was relatively mild, the ability to adapt the phase of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and to consolidate gain adaptations was strongly compromised. Purkinje cells showed abnormal patterns of simple spikes, both during and in the absence of evoked compensatory eye movements. On the basis of modeling our experimental data, we propose that feedforward inhibition, by controlling the fine-scale patterns of Purkinje cell activity, enables the induction of plasticity in neurons of the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2054254449,"When learning to use a novel tool, autistic children build a stronger link between their movements and proprioceptive feedback than typically developing children. Their greater reliance on proprioception correlates with the severity of social and impairment deficits. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have deficits in motor control, imitation and social function. Does a dysfunction in the neural basis of representing internal models of action contribute to these problems? We measured patterns of generalization as children learned to control a novel tool and found that the autistic brain built a stronger than normal association between self-generated motor commands and proprioceptive feedback; furthermore, the greater the reliance on proprioception, the greater the child's impairments in social function and imitation."
https://openalex.org/W2039035015,"Oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome is associated with mutations in the co-repressor BCOR. Mesenchymal stem cells from OFCD patients show higher osteo- and dentinogenic potential, partly due to defects in AP-2a expression. BCOR mutations impair the recruitment of the histone demethylase JHDM1B to the AP-2a promoter. The BCL-6 co-repressor (BCOR) represses gene transcription by interacting with BCL-6 (Refs 1, 2). BCOR mutation is responsible for oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome, which is characterized by canine teeth with extremely long roots, congenital cataracts, craniofacial defects and congenital heart disease3,4,5. Here we show that BCOR mutation increased the osteo-dentinogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from a patient with OFCD, providing a molecular explanation for abnormal root growth. AP-2α was identified as a repressive target of BCOR, and BCOR mutation resulted in abnormal activation of AP-2α. Gain- and loss-of-function assays suggest that AP-2α is a key factor that mediates the increased osteo-dentinogenic capacity of MSCs. Moreover, we found that BCOR maintained tissue homeostasis and gene silencing through epigenetic mechanisms. BCOR mutation increased histone H3K4 and H3K36 methylation in MSCs, thereby reactivating transcription of silenced target genes. By studying a rare human genetic disease, we have unravelled an epigenetic mechanism for control of human adult stem cell function."

https://openalex.org/W1985188792,"Histone levels are tightly regulated to prevent harmful effects such as genomic instability and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents due to the accumulation of these highly basic proteins when DNA replication slows down or stops. Although chromosomal histones are stable, excess (non-chromatin bound) histones are rapidly degraded in a Rad53 (radiation sensitive 53) kinase-dependent manner in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we demonstrate that excess histones associate with Rad53 in vivo and seem to undergo modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation, before their proteolysis by the proteasome. We have identified the Tyr 99 residue of histone H3 as being critical for the efficient ubiquitylation and degradation of this histone. We have also identified the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) Ubc4 and Ubc5, as well as the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Tom1 (temperature dependent organization in mitotic nucleus 1), as enzymes involved in the ubiquitylation of excess histones. Regulated histone proteolysis has major implications for the maintenance of epigenetic marks on chromatin, genomic stability and the packaging of sperm DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2069597649,"Andromonoecy is a widespread sexual system in angiosperms, characterized by plants carrying both male and bisexual flowers. Monoecy is characterized by the presence of both male and female flowers on the same plant. In cucumber, these sexual forms are controlled by the identity of the alleles at the M locus. In melon, we recently showed that the transition from monoecy to andromonoecy result from a mutation in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) gene, CmACS-7. To isolate the andromonoecy gene in cucumber we used a candidate gene approach in combination with genetical and biochemical analysis. We demonstrated co-segregation of CsACS2, a close homolog of CmACS-7, with the M locus. Sequence analysis of CsACS2 in cucumber accessions identified four CsACS2 isoforms, three in andromonoecious and one in monoecious lines. To determine whether the andromonoecious phenotype is due to a loss of ACS enzymatic activity, we expressed the four isoforms in Escherichia coli and assayed their activity in vitro. Like in melon, the isoforms from the andromonoecious lines showed reduced to no enzymatic activity and the isoform from the monoecious line was active. Consistent with this, the mutations leading andromonoecy were clustered in the active site of the enzyme. Based on this, we concluded that active CsACS2 enzyme leads to the development of female flowers in monoecious lines, whereas a reduction of enzymatic activity yields hermaphrodite flowers. Consistent with this, CsACS2, like CmACS-7 in melon, is expressed specifically in carpel primordia of buds determined to develop carpels. Following ACS expression, inter-organ communication is likely responsible for the inhibition of stamina development. In both melon and cucumber, flower unisexuality seems to be the ancestral situation, as the majority of Cucumis species are monoecious. Thus, the ancestor gene of CmACS-7/CsACS2 likely have controlled the stamen development before speciation of Cucumis sativus (cucumber) and Cucumis melo (melon) that have diverged over 40 My ago. The isolation of the genes for andromonoecy in Cucumis species provides a molecular basis for understanding how sexual systems arise and are maintained within and between species."
https://openalex.org/W2307098563,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by accumulation of mature monoclonal CD5+ B cells. The disease results mainly from a failure of cells to undergo apoptosis, a process largely influenced by the existence of constitutively activated components of B-cell receptor signaling and the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic molecules. Recent evidence pointing to a critical role of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in ligand-independent BCR signaling prompted us to examine its role in primary B-CLL cell survival. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of constitutive Syk activity and silencing by siRNA led to a dramatic decrease of cell viability in CLL samples (n=44), regardless of clinical and biological status and induced typical apoptotic cell death with mitochondrial failure followed by caspase 3-dependent cell death. We also provide functional and biochemical evidence that Syk regulated B-CLL cell survival through a novel pathway involving PKCδ and a proteasome-dependent regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Together, our observations are consistent with a model wherein PKCδ downstream of Syk stabilizes Mcl-1 through inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 by Akt. We conclude that Syk constitutes a key regulator of B-CLL cell survival, emphasizing the clinical utility of Syk inhibition in hematopoietic malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2059040596,"Mainly regulated at the transcriptional level, the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, CDKN1A/p21(WAF1) (p21), is a major cell cycle regulator of the response to DNA damage, senescence and tumor suppression. Here, we report that COUP-TF-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2), recruited to the p21 gene promoter, silenced p21 gene transcription through interactions with histone deacetylases and methyltransferases. Importantly, treatment with the specific SUV39H1 inhibitor, chaetocin, repressed histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at the p21 gene promoter, stimulated p21 gene expression and induced cell cycle arrest. In addition, CTIP2 and SUV39H1 were recruited to the silenced p21 gene promoter to cooperatively inhibit p21 gene transcription. Induction of p21(WAF1) gene upon human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection benefits viral expression in macrophages. Here, we report that CTIP2 further abolishes Vpr-mediated stimulation of p21, thereby indirectly contributing to HIV-1 latency. Altogether, our results suggest that CTIP2 is a constitutive p21 gene suppressor that cooperates with SUV39H1 and histone methylation to silence the p21 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2065157632,"The subcellular localization of the Rho family GTPases is of fundamental importance to their proper functioning in cells. The Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) plays a key regulatory role by influencing the cellular localization of Rho GTPases and is essential for the transforming activity of oncogenic forms of Cdc42. However, the mechanism by which RhoGDI helps Cdc42 to undergo the transition between a membrane-associated protein and a soluble (cytosolic) species has been poorly understood. Here, we examine how RhoGDI influences the binding of Cdc42 to lipid bilayers. Despite having similar affinities for the signaling-inactive (GDP-bound) and signaling-active (GTP-bound) forms of Cdc42 in solution, we show that when RhoGDI interacts with Cdc42 along the membrane surface, it has a much higher affinity for GDP-bound Cdc42 compared with its GTP-bound counterpart. Interestingly, the rate for the dissociation of Cdc42·RhoGDI complexes from membranes is unaffected by the nucleotide-bound state of Cdc42. Moreover, the membrane release of Cdc42·RhoGDI complexes occurs at a similar rate as the release of Cdc42 alone, with the major effect of RhoGDI being to impede the re-association of Cdc42 with membranes. These findings lead us to propose a new model for how RhoGDI influences the ability of Cdc42 to move between membranes and the cytosol, which highlights the role of the membrane in helping RhoGDI to distinguish between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and holds important implications for how it functions as a key regulator of the cellular localization and signaling activities of this GTPase.

The Rho family GTPases are a tightly regulated class of signaling proteins that controls a number of important cellular processes.

The Rho family member Cdc42 was discovered for its essential role in bud formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12.Adams A.E. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, after its identification in higher organisms (13.Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Cdc42 has been implicated in a diverse array of signaling pathways including those involved in the regulation of cell growth and in the induction of malignant transformation (14.Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 127-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Indeed, point mutations which enable Cdc42 to undergo the spontaneous exchange of GDP for GTP cause NIH3T3 cells to form colonies in soft agar and grow in low serum, two hallmarks of cellular transformation (15.Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The introduction of activated Cdc42 mutants into nude mice gives rise to tumor formation (16.Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, cellular transformation by oncogenic Ras, one of the most commonly mutated proteins in human cancers, requires the activation of Cdc42 (17.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, there are a number of mechanisms that possibly contribute to the roles played by Cdc42 in cell growth control and cellular transformation. These include the ability of Cdc42 to activate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38/Mpk2 signaling pathways (18.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

To mediate such a wide range of cellular responses, two parameters must be properly regulated; that is, the activation state of Cdc42 and its subcellular localization. As is the case with other GTPases, the activation of Cdc42 occurs as an outcome of GDP-GTP exchange, which then enables it to undergo high affinity interactions with effector proteins (25.Abdul-Manan N.

Two families of proteins work in opposing fashion to regulate the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of Cdc42. GTPase-activating proteins recognize the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, rendering Cdc42 inactive (28.Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A.

The vast majority of in vitro studies performed on Cdc42 have been carried out in the absence of lipids, which is an important omission considering that virtually all of the physiological functions of Cdc42 occur on a membrane surface (34.Nalbant P. Hodgson L. Kraynov V. Toutchkine A. Hahn K.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1615-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Cdc42, along with most other Rho family GTPases, undergoes a series of carboxyl-terminal modifications which result in the covalent attachment of a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl lipid anchor (35.Hancock J.F.

A ubiquitously expressed 22-kDa protein called Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) was found to form a soluble (cytosolic) complex with Cdc42 and other Rho GTPases and to apparently promote their release from membranes (39.Leonard D.

RhoGDI was originally discovered and named for its ability to block the GEF- and EDTA-stimulated nucleotide exchange activity of Rho family GTPases (39.Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A.

Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and to be capable of interacting with the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 in solution with equal affinity (44.Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of a complex between RhoGDI and Cdc42-GDP revealed two types of binding interactions (45.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). An amino-terminal regulatory arm of RhoGDI was shown to form a helix-loop-helix motif that binds to both of the switch domains of Cdc42, leading to the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis and GDP dissociation (45.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 46.Gosser Y.Q. Nomanbhoy T.K. Aghazadeh B. Manor D. Combs C. Cerione R.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of RhoGDI assumes an immunoglobulin-like domain, forming a hydrophobic pocket that in effect provides a membrane substitute for the geranylgeranyl moiety of Cdc42. After release from membranes, the lipid anchor of Cdc42 binds in the hydrophobic pocket of RhoGDI, thereby helping to maintain Cdc42 in solution (45.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 46.Gosser Y.Q. Nomanbhoy T.K. Aghazadeh B. Manor D. Combs C. Cerione R.A. Rosen M.K.

Prior work from our laboratory has demonstrated an essential role for RhoGDI in Cdc42-mediated cellular transformation. Based on the x-ray crystal structure for the Cdc42·RhoGDI complex, Arg-66 of Cdc42 makes multiple contacts with RhoGDI. When this residue was changed to alanine, Cdc42 was unable to bind to RhoGDI but was still capable of interacting with its other regulatory and effector proteins. Interestingly, when the R66A mutant of Cdc42 was examined in the constitutively active Cdc42(F28L) background, the resulting Cdc42 double mutant was no longer able to transform cells (48.Lin Q. Fuji R.N. Yang W. Cerione R.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1469-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Knocking down RhoGDI by small interfering RNA also blocked transformation by Cdc42. These findings highlighted a key role for RhoGDI in the ability of Cdc42 to stimulate signaling pathways of importance to cellular transformation, presumably by influencing the membrane association of Cdc42 and ensuring its proper cellular localization. In the present study we have set out to better understand how RhoGDI regulates the signaling functions of Cdc42 and, in particular, how RhoGDI affects the association of Cdc42 with membranes. We show how the membrane plays a previously unappreciated role in allowing RhoGDI to distinguish between the signaling-inactive (GDP-bound) and signaling-active (GTP-bound) forms of Cdc42. By assaying the binding of Cdc42 to insect cell membranes and compositionally defined liposomes through different approaches including a sensitive, real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) readout, we have been able to establish how RhoGDI influences the ability of Cdc42 to transition between a membrane-bound and soluble species. This has led us to propose a new mechanism describing how RhoGDI performs its important regulatory function. Cdc42 was purified as a His6-tagged protein by baculovirus-mediated expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) insect cells. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. One-liter stirred cultures of Sf21 cells underwent baculoviral infection for 48 h as carried out at Kinnakeet Biotechnology (Midlothian, VA). Cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm sodium borate, pH 10.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. The membrane-containing components of the lysate were spun down at 150,000 × g in a Ti70 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 20 min, after which the supernatant containing non-prenylated Cdc42 was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of TBS-containing magnesium (TBSM; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). The procedure was repeated twice, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in TBSM that contained 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was further homogenized and agitated for 30 min on a rotisserie, resulting in the solubilization of the geranylgeranylated Cdc42. The remaining insoluble fraction was pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge at 9000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and discarded. The supernatant containing detergent-solubilized, isoprenylated His6-tagged Cdc42 was incubated for 30 min with chelating Sepharose beads (Qiagen) charged with Ni2+. The beads were washed with 400 ml of a high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, and 20 mm imidazole), and protein was eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, and 500 mm imidazole). The fractions containing Cdc42 were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 2 ml. Bacterial cells harboring plasmids encoding His6-Cdc42 or glutathione S-transferase-RhoGDI were grown at 37 °C until an absorbance of 0.8 was reached. Induction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and the cells were allowed to grow for another 3 h before pelleting at 6000 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were homogenized in TBSM and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for purification. His6-tagged Cdc42 was purified using Ni2+-charged Sepharose beads as described above. Supernatants containing glutathione S-transferase-tagged RhoGDI were incubated with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with TEDA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium azide) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with several column volumes of TEDA-containing 500 mm NaCl. After a final rinse with TBSM, the protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in TBSM. All eluents were concentrated in a 10 MWC Amicon Ultra concentrator (Fisher). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Membranes were prepared from uninfected Sf21 cells using a modification of the Thom procedure (49.Thom D. Powell A.J. Lloyd C.W. Rees D.A. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ml of stationary phase cells were incubated in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm sodium borate, pH 10.2) at 4 °C and then subjected to Dounce homogenization. The cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, separating the membranes from the soluble components. The membrane-rich pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TBSM. Two approaches were used to prepare liposomes. For large liposomes (i.e. several microns in diameter) that can be pelleted by low speed centrifugation, rapid solvent exchange was utilized (50.Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, smaller lipid vesicles were prepared by extrusion (Avanti mini-extruder). All lipids used in these experiments were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids unless stated otherwise. The standard lipid composition in molar percentages was 35% phosphatidylethanolamine, 25% phosphatidylserine, 5% phosphatidylinositol, and 35% cholesterol (Nu Chek Preps). To assay the binding of Cdc42 or RhoGDI to liposomes, 1 μg of E. coli-expressed Cdc42, insect cell-expressed Cdc42, or E. coli-expressed RhoGDI was incubated in 200 μl of 1 mg/ml lipids, prepared by rapid solvent exchange, for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged at maximum speed for 20 min. Supernatants and lipid pellets were examined by SDS-PAGE. For radioactive assays measuring the dissociation of Cdc42 from liposomes or insect cell membranes, Cdc42 (100 pmol) was preloaded with [35S]GTPγS (1400 cpm/pmol) or [α-32P]GTP (1500 cpm/pmol) by EDTA-stimulated nucleotide exchange. The [α-32P]GTP bound to Cdc42 was allowed to hydrolyze to [α-32P]GDP by performing a 30-min incubation on ice in the presence of excess magnesium. The protein was then mixed with 500 μl of insect cell membranes (or with liposomes prepared from 1 mg/ml lipids by rapid solvent exchange) for 10 min and pelleted for 20 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The lipids were resuspended in TBSM buffer containing different concentrations of RhoGDI and incubated for 10 min and subjected to a final centrifugation, and then radioactivity was measured in the supernatant and lipid pellet. The degree of release of the Cdc42·RhoGDI complex from the liposome/membrane preparations as a function of RhoGDI concentration was fit to the equation, Cdc42⋅GDI=Cdc42totalGDIKD+GDI(Eq. 1) where KD is the dissociation constant describing the interaction between Cdc42 and RhoGDI, as reflected by the transition between the membrane and soluble forms of Cdc42, and [GDI] is the concentration of free RhoGDI where [GDI] ∼ [GDI]total. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter in the counting mode. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 and 440 nm, respectively. Samples were stirred continuously at 25 °C in TBSM. To prepare hexadecanoylaminofluorescein (HAF)-labeled lipids for FRET assays, 1.25 nmol of HAF (Molecular Probes) was vortexed in 50 μl of lipids (1 mg/ml). The association of insect cell Cdc42 with liposomes was assayed as follows. A Cdc42-Mant-nucleotide complex (50 nm) was mixed with liposomes prepared by extrusion that contained different concentrations of HAF-labeled lipids, resulting in the quenching of Mant fluorescence. For comparison, the association curves were fit to a single exponential equation of the form, Ft=F01−e−kobst(Eq. 2) or, in the case of increasing fluorescence (i.e. when monitoring the release of Cdc42-Mant-nucleotide complexes from liposomes containing HAF), Ft=Foe−kobst(Eq. 3) where F(t) represents the relative fluorescence as a function of time, Fo represents the initial fluorescence, and kobs is the rate constant describing the fluorescence change. A rate constant (koff) characterizing the dissociation of Cdc42 from liposomes was estimated by applying the equation (also, see supplemental Equations S1), kobs=koff+konlipids(Eq. 4) To monitor the release of Cdc42 from liposomes, Cdc42 was preloaded with Mant-nucleotide (GDP or GMP-PNP) and incubated with 30 μl of HAF-containing liposomes at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was added to the cuvette, and at the designated time point RhoGDI was added with stirring. Typically, the initial 2.5 min were recorded, generating traces that monitored the changes in Mant fluorescence due to changes in FRET between Mant-nucleotide-bound Cdc42 and liposomes containing HAF. The FRET assay used in these studies provides a real-time readout of the formation of the Cdc42·RhoGDI complex as a function of time. The interaction between Cdc42 and RhoGDI is proposed to consist of two steps, an initial binding step and a rate-limiting membrane dissociation step, with k1 and k−1 representing the forward and reverse rate constants, respectively, for step 1, whereas k2 and k−2 are the forward and reverse rate constants, respectively, for step 2. By assuming the initial binding step is in rapid equilibrium and that the second step is rate-limiting, we arrive at the following rate equation for the association of Cdc42 with RhoGDI (also, see supplemental Equations S2), Cdc42⋅GDICdc42⋅GDImax=1−e−kobst(Eq. 6) where kobs=k2GDIKD1+GDI+k−2(Eq. 7) The plots of kobs versus [GDI] were fit with Equation 7 where KD1 = k−1/k1. As an initial step toward determining how RhoGDI helps to increase the amount of soluble (non-membrane-associated) Cdc42 as well as examining whether RhoGDI interacts preferentially with a specific nucleotide-bound state of the membrane-associated GTPase, we set out to establish experimental systems for monitoring the binding of Cdc42 to membranes. We first verified that insect cell (Sf21)-expressed, recombinant Cdc42, by virtue of its carboxyl-terminal geranylgeranyl moiety, was capable of associating with lipid bilayers. The results presented in Fig. 1A show that when the insect cell-expressed Cdc42 protein was briefly incubated with liposomes prepared by rapid solvent exchange (50.Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), pelleted by centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, virtually all of the Cdc42 was recovered in the membrane pellet. In contrast, when E. coli-expressed recombinant Cdc42, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal geranylgeranyl tail, was used, the entire pool of Cdc42 was detected in the soluble fraction. We then confirmed these results by examining the ability of the different recombinant Cdc42 proteins bound to radiolabeled guanine nucleotides to associate with membranes derived from insect cells. Recombinant Cdc42 purified from insect cells, when bound to either [α-32P]GDP or [35S]GTPγS, was able to associate with insect cell membranes. An example for [35S]GTPγS-bound Cdc42 is shown in Fig. 1B, where the majority of the insect cell Cdc42 protein was present in the membrane pellet. Again the converse was true for E. coli recombinant Cdc42, as the [35S]GTPγS-bound protein was mainly present in the soluble (supernatant) fraction. We then examined the ability of RhoGDI to increase the amount of insect cell Cdc42 in the soluble fraction and, in particular, set out to determine whether there were differences in the effectiveness of RhoGDI depending upon whether Cdc42 was bound to GDP or GTP. Fig. 2A shows that the E. coli recombinant RhoGDI, in a dose-dependent manner, was able to increase the amount of GTPγS-bound, His6-Cdc42 in the soluble (supernatant) fraction relative to the membrane fraction. We then compared the effects of RhoGDI on the dissociation of GDP- versus GTPγS-bound Cdc42 from insect cell membranes. Fig. 2B shows that the decrease in the amount of [α-32P]GDP-bound Cdc42 associated with membrane pellets, as a function of RhoGDI concentration, closely mirrored the appearance of GDP-bound Cdc42 in the soluble supernatant fraction. The apparent KD values (Equation 1) estimated for the interaction of [α-32P]GDP-Cdc42 with RhoGDI from these two dose-response curves were similar (i.e. ranging from ∼60–70 nm). Fig. 2C shows the corresponding set of assays for the effects of RhoGDI on membrane-associated, [35S]GTPγS-bound Cdc42. A significantly greater amount of RhoGD"
https://openalex.org/W2088485356,"The transcription factor p73, a member of the p53 family, mediates cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage-induced cellular stress, acting thus as a proapoptotic gene. Similar to p53, p73 activity is regulated by post-translational modification, including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation. In C. elegans, the F-box protein FSN-1 controls germline apoptosis by regulating CEP-1, the single ancestral p53 family member. Here we report that FBXO45, the human ortholog of FSN-1, binds specifically to p73 triggering its proteasome-dependent degradation. Importantly, SCFFBXO45 ubiquitylates p73 both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, siRNA-mediated depletion of FBXO45 stabilizes p73 and concomitantly induces cell death in a p53-independent manner. All together, these results show that the orphan F-box protein FBXO45 regulates the stability of p73, highlighting a conserved pathway evolved from nematode to human by which the p53 members are regulated by an SCF-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2023154099,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ATP-binding cassette B1) is a drug pump that extracts toxic drug substrates from the plasma membrane and catalyzes their ATP-dependent efflux. To map the residues in the drug translocation pathway, we performed arginine-scanning mutagenesis on all transmembrane (TM) segments (total = 237 residues) of a P-gp processing mutant (G251V) defective in folding (15% maturation efficiency) (glycosylation state used to monitor folding). The rationale was that arginines introduced into the drug-binding sites would mimic drug rescue and enhance maturation of wild-type or processing mutants of P-gp. It was found that 38 of the 89 mutants that matured had enhanced maturation. Enhancer mutations were found in 11 of the 12 TM segments with the largest number found in TMs 6 and 12 (seven in each), TMs that are critical for P-gp-drug substrate interactions. Modeling of the TM segments showed that the enhancer arginines were found on the hydrophilic face, whereas inhibitory arginines were located on a hydrophobic face that may be in contact with the lipid bilayer. It was found that many of the enhancer arginines caused large alterations in P-gp-drug interactions in ATPase assays. For example, mutants A302R (TM5), L339R (TM6), G872R (TM10), F942R (TM11), Q946R (TM11), V982R (TM12), and S993R (TM12) reduced the apparent affinity for verapamil by approximately 10-fold, whereas the F336R (TM6) and M986R (TM12) mutations caused at least a 10-fold increase in apparent affinity for rhodamine B. The results suggest that P-gp contains a large aqueous-filled drug translocation pathway with multiple drug-binding sites that can accommodate the bulky arginine side chains to promote folding of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2012323592,"Background Outside pregnancy, arterial pulse wave analysis provides valuable information in hypertension and vascular disease. Studies in pregnancy using this technique show that vascular stiffness is raised in women with established pre-eclampsia. We aimed to establish normal ranges for parameters of pulse wave analysis in normal pregnancy and to compare different ethnic groups. Methodology/Principal Findings This prospective study was conducted at The Homerton University Hospital, London between January 2006 and March 2007. Using applanation tonometry, the radial artery pulse waveform was recorded and the aortic waveform derived. Augmentation pressure (AP) and Augmentation Index at heart rate 75/min (AIx-75), measures of arterial stiffness, were calculated. We recruited 665 women with singleton pregnancies. Women who developed pre-eclampsia (n = 24, 3.6%) or gestational hypertension (n = 36, 5.4%) were excluded. We also excluded 47 women with other pregnancy complications or incomplete follow-up, leaving 541 healthy normotensive pregnant women for subsequent analysis. In the overall group of 541 women, there were no significant changes in AP or AIx-75 as pregnancy progressed. In 45 women followed longitudinally, AP and AIx-75 fell significantly from the first to the second trimester, then rose again in the third (P<0.001). The two main ethnic groups represented were Caucasian (n = 229) and Afrocaribbean (n = 216). There were no significant differences in AP or AIx-75 in any trimester between these two ethnic groups. Conclusions This study is the largest to date of pulse wave analysis in normal pregnancy, the first to report on a subset of women studied longitudinally, and the first to investigate the effect of ethnicity. These data provide the foundation for further investigation into the potential role of this technique in vascular disorders in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1969079506,"The general stress response of Bacillus subtilis can be activated by stimuli such as the addition of salt or ethanol and with blue light. In the latter response, YtvA activates sigma(B) through a cascade of Rsb proteins, organized in stressosomes. YtvA is composed of an N-terminal LOV (light, oxygen, and voltage) domain and a C-terminal STAS (sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor) domain and shows light-modulated GTP binding in vitro. Here, we examine the mechanism of YtvA-mediated activation of sigma(B) in vivo with site-directed mutagenesis. Constitutive off and constitutive on mutations have been identified. Disruption of GTP binding in the STAS domain eliminates light activation of sigma(B). In contrast, modification of sites relevant for phosphorylation of STAS domains does not affect the stress response significantly. The data obtained are integrated into a model for the structure of full-length YtvA, which presumably functions as a dimer."

Here we present the high resolution crystal structures of Tom71 and the protein complexes between Tom71 and the Hsp70/Hsp90 C terminus. The crystal structures indicate that Tom70/Tom71 may exhibit two distinct states. In the closed state, the N-terminal domain of Tom70/Tom71 partially blocks the preprotein-binding pocket. In the open state, the N-terminal domain moves away, and the preprotein-binding pocket is fully exposed. The complex formation between the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 could lock Tom71 in the open state where the preprotein-binding pocket of Tom71 is ready to receive preproteins. The interactions between Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 N-terminal domain generate conformational changes that may increase the volume of the preprotein-binding pocket. The complex formation of Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 also generates significant domain rearrangement within Tom71, which may position the preprotein-binding pocket closer to Hsp70/Hsp90 to facilitate the preprotein transfer from the molecular chaperone to Tom71.

In the open state, the N-terminal domain moves away, and the preprotein-binding pocket is fully exposed. The complex formation between the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 could lock Tom71 in the open state where the preprotein-binding pocket of Tom71 is ready to receive preproteins. The interactions between Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 N-terminal domain generate conformational changes that may increase the volume of the preprotein-binding pocket. The complex formation of Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 also generates significant domain rearrangement within Tom71, which may position the preprotein-binding pocket closer to Hsp70/Hsp90 to facilitate the preprotein transfer from the molecular chaperone to Tom71. Therefore, molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90 may function to prepare the mitochondrial outer membrane receptor Tom71 for preprotein loading. The mitochondrion plays important roles in cell physiology. The mitochondrion functions as the “cellular power house” by generating most of the supply of ATP for the cell. In addition, the mitochondrion is involved in a number of critical cellular processes including the synthesis of metabolites, lipid metabolism, free radical production, and metal ion homeostasis. The mitochondrion consists of four compartments, the outer membrane, the inner membrane, the intermembrane space, and the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondrion contains a large number of proteins (1.Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schönfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N.

Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Therefore, the majority of the mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and translocated into the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial preproteins contain specific targeting signals to reach the correct compartments within the mitochondria. The mitochondrial matrix preproteins contain N-terminal targeting sequences that form the short amphipathic helices (2.Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F.

On the other hand, some mitochondrial proteins of the inner and outer membrane contain internal targeting signals within the mature proteins (7.Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P.

The crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tom70 revealed that Tom70 contained 11 TPR motifs, and the TPR motifs were clustered into two domains. The three TPR motifs in the N-terminal domain of Tom70p form a peptide-binding groove for the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70/Hsp90, whereas the C-terminal domain of Tom70p contains a large preprotein-binding pocket (13.Wu Y.

The C-terminal EEVD motifs of Hsp70/Hsp90 may interact directly with the N-terminal domain of Tom70p to target the preproteins to TOM complex (13.Wu Y. Sha B. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Tom71 (also known as Tom72) was identified as a homologue with Tom70 with high amino acid sequence identity (>50%) (22.Bömer U. Pfanner N. Dietmeier K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Tom71 shares overlapping functions with Tom70 to transfer the preproteins and maintain the mitochondrial morphology (23.Koh J.Y. Hájek P. Bedwell D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24.Kondo-Okamoto N. Shaw J.M. Okamoto K. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined the crystal structures of S. cerevisiae Tom71 and the complexes of Tom71 and Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motifs. These structures suggest that the Hsp70/Hsp90 binding to Tom70/Tom71 may keep Tom70/Tom71 in the open state for receiving preproteins. The Hsp70/Hsp90 interactions may also increase the volume of the preprotein-binding pocket of Tom70/Tom71 and prepare Tom70/Tom71 for preprotein loading. The gene encoding S. cerevisiae Tom71 cytosolic fragment (residues 107–639) was cloned into the vector pET28b. The Tom71 sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The BL21(DE3) cells were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 of 0.5–0.6. After shaking overnight at 15 °C, the cells were harvested and sonicated in a buffer with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), NaCl 500 mm, imidazole 5 mm. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h and loaded to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity beads (GE Healthcare). The protein was stripped by buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA. After thrombin cleavage overnight at room temperature, the protein was concentrated and purified by Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in a buffer with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. The peak fraction was collected, concentrated to 20 mg ml−1, and subjected to crystallization trials. Large rod-shaped crystals (0.5 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm) were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The well solution consisted of 1 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m NaCl. The crystals of Tom71 complexed with yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 C-terminal peptide (PEAEGPTVEEVD) were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing Tom71 and Hsp70 peptide using a 1:1.2 molar ratio in buffer 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl. The well solution contains 1 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 10% ethylene glycol. The crystals of yeast Tom71 and yeast Hsp90 Hsp82 C-terminal peptide (EVPADTEMEEVD) complex were obtained using similar protocols as for the Tom71 and Hsp70 complexes. The peptides were synthesized in Genscript. The Tom71 crystals diffracted x-ray to 2.0 Å in the beamline Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team at Advanced Photon Source. The atomic coordinates of the N- and C-terminal domains of yeast Tom70 were used individually to search for molecular replacement solutions for the crystals of Tom71 by the program PHASER (27.CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The initial model was built by use of WARP/ARP at 2.0 Å resolution (28.Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Nat. Prot. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), followed by manual model building using COOT (29.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The final model was refined by REFMAC5 to and Rfactor of 18.7% and an Rfree of 22.7% (30.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Tom71 complexed with Hsp70 crystals diffracted x-ray to 2.15 Å in the beamline Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team at Advanced Photon Source. The refined atomic coordinates of Tom71 were used as a searching model to obtain molecular replacement solution. The initial model building was completed by use of WARP/ARP at 2.15 Å resolution, followed by manual model building using COOT. The final model was refined by REFMAC5 to an Rfactor of 20.8% and an Rfree of 26.1%. Tom71 complexed with yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) crystals diffracted x-ray to 2.0 Å in the beamline Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team at Advanced Photon Source. The structure of yeast Tom71 and yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) C-terminal peptide complex was solved using similar protocols as for Tom71-Hsp70 complex. The complex structure was refined with an Rfactor of 19.9% and an Rfree of 23.6%. To generate the sequence conservation drawing, program ClustalW was utilized to align the Tom71 sequences from S. cerevisiae with those from Candida albicans and Tom70 from S. cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, and Drosophila melanogaster. The aligned sequences in multiple sequence alignment formats were converted into a property file by use of the program ProSkin. The property file was then visualized by using the program Pymol. The S. cerevisiae Tom71 (639 amino acids) contains a short N-terminal transmembrane fragment anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane and a large C-terminal fragment located in cytosol. The crystal structure of yeast Tom71 (residues 107–639) was determined to 2.0 Å resolution by a molecular replacement method using the yeast Tom70 structure as the searching model (Table 1). The structure of the Tom71 monomer consists of 28 α-helices (A0–A27) and no β-strands (Fig. 1, a and b). The electron densities for the loops between helices A1 and A2, A7 and A8, and A22 and A23 are missing. A majority of the helices of Tom71 form 11 TPR motifs (TPR1–TPR11). Two domains can be clearly identified from the Tom71 structure. The N-terminal domain covers helices A0–A7 (TPR1–TPR3), and the C-terminal domain includes helices A8–A27 (TPR4–TPR11). The N-terminal domain of Tom71 contains the Hsp70/Hsp90-binding site, and the C-terminal domain constitutes the preprotein-binding pocket. The two domains are connected by a long helix A7. Most of the helices in the C-terminal domain (A10–A26) stack together to form one turn of the “superhelix” (Fig. 1, a and b).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for crystal structures of yeast Tom71, Tom71-Hsp70 complex, and Tom71-Hsp90 complexTom71Tom71-Hsp70Tom71-Hsp90Data collectionSpace groupP212121P212121P212121Cell dimensions: a, b, c (Å)76.90, 83.42, 109.1147.82, 116.03, 150.6547.87, 116.29, 150.74Wavelength (Å)1.0001.0000.9718Resolution (Å)2.02.152.0Rsym or Rmerge0.053 (0.226)0.078 (0.506)0.088 (0.446)I/σI47.1 (9.2)19.2 (2.3)25.0 (2.47)Completeness (%)99.8 (99.9)90.3 (77.7)97.2 (86.1)Redundancy7.2 (7.0)5.0 (3.9)5.0 (2.5)RefinementNo. reflections47,00842,31657,803Rwork/Rfree18.9 (21.9)/22.7 (28.3)20.8 (26.1)/26.1 (35.3)19.9 (24.7)/23.6 (27.9)No. atoms protein (water)4735 (573)4427 (268)4559 (451)B factors34.5517.8536.59Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0180.0230.018Bond angels (°)1.461.7871.524 Open table in a new tab When the crystal structure of yeast Tom71 is compared with that of Tom70, we found that the individual N- and C-terminal domains of Tom71 resemble the folds from those of Tom70 (Fig. 1, a and c) (13.Wu Y. Sha B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the N- and C-terminal domains of Tom71 are arranged in a very different fashion from that in the Tom70 crystal structure. In the crystal structure of Tom71, the N-terminal domain is swung away from the C-terminal domain, which renders the Tom71 structure an “open” state (Fig. 1a). In the yeast Tom70 structure, the two domains are packed together to form an elongated molecule as a superhelix, which represents a “closed” state (Fig. 1c). The N-terminal domain in the Tom71 structure (open state) moves away from that in the Tom70 structure (closed state) along helix A7. A putative preprotein-binding pocket was identified in the Tom70 C-terminal domain (13.Wu Y. Sha B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the Tom70 structure, the preprotein-binding pocket is partially blocked by the N-terminal domain. However, in the Tom71 structure, the preprotein-binding pocket is dramatically enlarged and fully exposed and accessible to the solvent (Fig. 1). In the closed state, the N-terminal domain of Tom70 is connected to the C-terminal domain by polar interactions between A7 and A25. In the open state, the N-terminal domain of Tom71 is associated to the C-terminal domain by hydrophobic interactions between A6, A7, and A26. Because yeast Tom70 and Tom71 share high protein sequence homology (53% sequence identity) and have overlapping cellular functions, we reason that Tom70 and Tom71 may adopt both open and closed states in solution and on the mitochondrial membrane. In the closed state, the preprotein-binding pocket of Tom70/Tom71 is blocked and not ready to receive preprotein, whereas in the open state, the pocket is exposed for preprotein loading. Previous biophysical and thermodynamics studies showed that Tom70 exhibited substantial structural flexibility and may undergo multiple conformational changes at physiological temperature (25.Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our structural observations. In the open state, the N-terminal domain of Tom71 moves away, which creates significantly more space for the preprotein-binding pocket. In the open state, the pocket has an estimated dimension of ∼25 × 35 × 20 Å (width × length × depth), which more than doubles the size of pocket in the closed state. The preprotein-binding pocket is large enough to accommodate a polypeptide with secondary structures. A pair of α-helices can be easily modeled into the pocket. Helices A12, A14, A16, A18, A20, A22, A24, and A26 from the C-terminal domain of Tim71 constitute the inner surface of the preprotein-binding pocket. Helices A6 and A7 from the N-terminal domain of Tom71 are also involved in forming one side of the wall for the pocket (Fig. 1). The conservation drawing of Tom71 structure showed that the residues involved in forming the preprotein-binding pocket surface are quite conserved among Tom70 and Tom71 families, indicating that Tom70 and Tom71 proteins may share similar specificity for preproteins (Fig. 1d). A large portion of the conserved areas in the preprotein-binding pocket are generated by hydrophobic residues. On the upper part of the pocket, residues Met215, Leu223, Leu236, Leu240, Leu575, Phe606, and Ala609 form a long hydrophobic strip. On the lower half of the pocket, residues Pro264, Phe272, Phe356, Leu357, Leu386, Ala389, Phe423, Ile424, Tyr447, and Phe485 form most of the bottom of the pocket (Fig. 1, e and f). The hydrophobicitiy of these residues is nicely conserved as shown by sequence alignment (Fig. 2). This structural feature is consistent with the hypothesis that Tom70/Tom71 recognizes the hydrophobic internal targeting sequences from the preproteins (12.Chan N.C. Likiæ V.A. Waller R.F.

Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90 can target the preproteins to Tom70/Tom71 by anchoring the Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motif to the N-terminal domain of Tom70/Tom71 (13.Wu Y. Sha B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14.Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of yeast Tom71 complexed with yeast Hsp70 (Ssa1) C-terminal peptide PEAEGPTVEEVD to 2.15 Å resolution. The crystal structure of yeast Tom71 complexed with yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) C-terminal peptide EVPADTEMEEVD was determined to 2.0 Å resolution. Residues PTVEEVD (residues −6 to 0) of Hsp70 and residues MEEVD (residues −4 to 0) of Hsp90 are clearly visible in the electron density map. Both bound peptides exhibit similar conformations and are located in a groove formed within the N-terminal domain of Tom71 (Fig. 3). The Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal peptide binds to a region of Tom71 that is overall quite basic. In both complex structures, the Asp at position 0 of Hsp70/90 makes polar interactions with residues Lys131, Asn135, and Lys196 from Tom71. The main chain nitrogen of this Asp residue forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn166 of Tom71. The Val at position −1 makes hydrophobic interactions with Phe138. The carbonyl oxygen of Glu at position −2 forms strong hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Lys196 and Arg200 of Tom71. The Val at position −4 of Hsp70 makes hydrophobic interactions with Leu199 of Tom71. The Met at position −4 of Hsp90 contacts Leu199 and the hydrophobic side chain of Lys196 from Tom71. These residues (Lys131, Asn135, Phe138, Asn166, Lys196, Leu199, and Arg200) of Tom71 involved in binding the C-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70/Hsp90 are very nicely conserved for Tom71 and Tom70 among species, suggesting that the binding mechanism is shared within the Tom70/Tom71 family members (Fig. 2). These residues form a conserved surface at the Hsp70/90-binding site located on the N-terminal domain of Tom71 (Fig. 1d). The hydrophobic interactions between the Val/Met at the −4 position of Hsp70/Hsp90 with Leu199 of Tom71 make the bound Hsp70/Hsp90 peptide to form a turn at the upstream of the EEVD fragment of Hsp70/Hsp90 (Fig. 3, b and d). The turn of the bound peptide indicated that the upstream part of the Hsp70/Hsp90 C terminus does not make specific contacts with Tom70/Tom71. This phenomenon is also observed in the complex structure of CHIP and the Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motif (20.Zhang M. Windheim M. Roe S.M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 525-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This may provide flexibility for Hsp70/Hsp90 to deliver the bound preprotein to the Tom70/Tom71 preprotein-binding pocket. The binding of the Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motif to Tom71 may lock Tom71 in the open state. The bound EEVD motif of Hsp70/Hsp90 may cause severe collisions with a loop region between A22 and A23 of Tom71 C-terminal domain if the N-terminal domain of Tom71 moves back into the closed state. Tom71 has to stay in the open state after molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90 binding, which is the favored state for Hsp70/Hsp90 to load the preproteins. The binding of the Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motif to Tom71 generates significant conformational changes in the Tom71 structure (Fig. 4). When Hsp70/Hsp90 binds the Tom71 N-terminal domain, Lys196 and Arg200 from helix A5 form a salt bridge and strong hydrogen bonds with Asp at position 0 and Glu at position −2 of Hsp70/Hsp90 C terminus. Leu199 of helix A5 forms hydrophobic interactions with the Val at position −4 of Hsp70 (or Met at the position −4 of Hsp90). All of these interactions pull helix A5 of Tom71 toward the bound Hsp70/Hsp90 C terminus peptide by ∼1.5 Å after Hsp70/Hsp90 binding (Fig. 4a). Helix A5 of Tom71 is associated with helices A6 and A7 by a hydrophobic cluster formed by Leu198, Leu199, and Ala202 from A5; Leu218, Leu221, and Val220 from A6; and Met235 from the N terminus of the long helix A7. The salt bridges formed by Arg201 from A5, Asp217 from A6, Glu206 from A5, and Arg238 from A7 also contribute to the association of helices A5, A6, and A7. The binding between the Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motifs and Tom71 cause helix A5 of Tom71 to move to the bound Hsp70/Hsp90 peptide by ∼1.5 Å. Because of the association of helices A5, A6, and A7, the conformational changes are translated to A6 and A7 and, surprisingly, significantly amplified within helices A6 and A7. After Hsp70/Hsp90 binding to Tom71, helix A6 of Tom71 moves toward the bound Hsp70/Hsp90 peptide by ∼2.5 Å. Helix A7 moves toward the center of N-terminal domain by ∼4.5 Å. More importantly, the pulling at the N terminus of helix A7 causes the long helix A7 to rotate ∼20° after Hsp70/Hsp90 binding (Fig. 4a). The residues of Tom71 involved in mediating the conformational changes (Lys196, Leu198, Leu199, Arg200, Arg201, Ala202, Glu206, Asp217, Leu218, Val220, Leu221, Met235, and Arg238) are well conserved among the Tom70/Tom71 family (Fig. 2). The N-terminal domain of Tom70/Tom71 may function as a sensor to detect the presence of the molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90. Lys196 and Arg200 of Tom71 play central roles to bind Hsp70/90 and induce the subsequent conformational changes. Lys196 and Arg200 protrude out of the molecular surface of Tom71 to form strong hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with the Hsp70/90 C-terminal EEVD motif (Fig. 3). The interactions between Lys196/Arg200 and Hsp70/Hsp90 function as the major driving force for the downstream conformational changes. The functions of the conserved Lys196 and Arg200 can be defined as a “Lys/Arg switch.” The structural consequence of the Hsp70/Hsp90 EEVD motif binding to Tom71 is that the volume of the preprotein-binding pocket located on the C-terminal domain of Tom71 is significantly increased. Because helices A6 and A7 are involved in forming one side of the preprotein-binding pocket, the translations of helices A6 and A7 toward the center of the N-terminal domain after Hsp70/Hsp90 binding widens up the pocket located at the C-terminal domain substantially (Fig. 4a). In addition, the rotation of helix A7 after EEVD motif binding may also contribute to the opening up of the pocket. The width of the pocket increases to ∼30 Å after Hsp70/Hsp90 binding from ∼25 Å before binding. For example, residues Pro234 and Phe496 are located at the opposite side on the preprotein-binding pocket of Tom71. The distance between the Cα atoms of Pro234 and Phe496 increases to 32 Å after complex formation, whereas the distance was 27 Å before Hsp70/Hsp90 binding. (Figs. 1d and 3, a and d). An enlarged preprotein-binding pocket may facilitate efficient preprotein loading from Hsp70/Hsp90 to Tom70/Tom71. As a similar comparison, the cavity inside of chaperonin GroEL is also significantly increased after GroES binding (26.Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Helix A7 is positioned at the joint of Tom71 N-terminal and C-terminal domains and acts as a hinge to link the two domains together. The rotation of helix A7 (∼20°) of Tom71 after Hsp70/Hsp90 binding is transduced to the entire C-terminal domain and generates significant rearrangement of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Tom71. The C-terminal domain of Tom71 is swung from the open state to the closed state by ∼20° after the Hsp70/Hsp90 binding (Fig. 4a). The 20° rotation of the Tom71 C-terminal domain after the Hsp70/Hsp90 binding can bring the preprotein-binding pocket much closer to the molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90, which may facilitate the preprotein transfer from Hsp70/Hsp90 to Tom71 (Fig. 4b). Therefore the domain rearrangement within Tom71 molecule may have significant functional benefit for Tom71 to receive the preproteins from Hsp70/Hsp90. The crystal structures of yeast Tom71 and Tom70 suggest that the mitochondrial translocon receptor Tom70/Tom71 may exhibit the open and closed states. In the closed state, the N-terminal domain of Tom70/Tom71 folds on top of the C-terminal domain and partially covers the preprotein-binding pocket. This may block the preproteins from entering the pocket. In the open state, the N-terminal domain moves away, and the preprotein-binding pocket is dramatically enlarged and exposed. When molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90 escorts preproteins to approach the TOM complex, the Hsp70/Hsp90 C-terminal EEVD motif will bind the Tom71 N-terminal domain. The interactions will lock Tom71 in the open state. The binding between Hsp70/Hsp90 and Tom71 could generate significant conformational changes in Tom71 structure, which could further increase the volume of the preprotein-binding pocket and rotate the pocket closer to Hsp70/Hsp90. Thus, the molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90 could ensure that Tom70/Tom71 only receive the preproteins escorted by molecular chaperones (Fig. 5). The cooperativity of Tom70/Tom71 and the molecular chaperone Hsp70/Hsp90 provides a delicate gating system for Tom70/Tom71 to recognize the correct preprotein substrates.

ERK5 is approximately twice the size of ERK1/2, and its amino-terminal half contains the kinase domain that shares homology with ERK1/2 and TEY activation motif, whereas the carboxyl-terminal half is unique. In this study, we examined a physiological role of ERK5 in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), comparing it with ERK1/2. Nerve growth factor (NGF) induced phosphorylation of both ERK5 and ERK1/2, whereas the cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) caused only ERK1/2 phosphorylation. U0126, at 30 μm, that blocks ERK1/2 signaling selectively attenuated neurite outgrowth induced by NGF and Bt2cAMP, but BIX02188 and BIX02189, at 30 μm, that block ERK5 signaling and an ERK5 dominant-negative mutant suppressed only NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Next, we examined the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis. Both NGF and Bt2cAMP increased tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter activity in an ERK1/2-dependent manner but was ERK5-independent. However, when both ERK5 and ERK1/2 signalings were inhibited, tyrosine hydroxylase protein up-regulation by NGF and Bt2cAMP was abolished, because of the loss of stabilization of tyrosine hydroxylase protein by ERK5. Taking these results together, ERK5 is involved in neurite outgrowth and stabilization of tyrosine hydroxylase in PC12 cells, and ERK5, along with ERK1/2, plays essential roles in the neural differentiation process.

ERK1/2 is activated by variety of stimuli, and the signaling pathway leading to ERK1/2 activation has been well characterized (1.Goldsmith Z.G. Dhanasekaran D.N.

ERK5 is approximately double the molecular size of ERK1/2. The kinase domain is encoded by its amino-terminal half and shares ∼50% homology with ERK1/2, whereas its unique carboxyl terminus encodes two proline-rich regions, a nuclear export domain and a nuclear localization domain (4.Wang X. Tournier C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5.Nishimoto S. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the autophosphorylated carboxyl terminus of ERK5 plays a critical role in activating transcription (6.Morimoto H. Kondoh K. Nishimoto S. Terasawa K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35449-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The threonine and tyrosine residues on ERK5 are phosphorylated by MEK5 but not MEK1/2. In contrast, ERK1/2 is not phosphorylated by MEK5 but is phosphorylated by MEK1/2 (7.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Several physiological roles of ERK5 have been reported (4.Wang X. Tournier C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5.Nishimoto S. Nishida E.

For example, ERK5 regulates S-phase entry by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in HeLa cells (10.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In dorsal root ganglia, ERK5 is activated by nerve growth factor (NGF) during retrograde transport of TrkA, and this action prevents apoptosis (11.Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In developing cortical neurons, ERK5 plays a critical role in survival promoted by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (12.Liu L. Cavanaugh J.E. Wang Y. Sakagami H. Mao Z. Xia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Neuronal differentiation is reduced by ERK5 knockdown using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in Xenopus laevis (13.Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Also, ERK5 is required for generation of neurons from cortical progenitors (14.Liu L. Cundiff P. Abel G. Wang Y. Faigle R. Sakagami H. Xu M. Xia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In animal models, ERK5 gene knockout is lethal at E9.5–10.5 because of cardiovascular defects, indicating the involvement of ERK5 in heart development (15.Hayashi M. Lee J.D. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Pathophysiological roles for ERK5 have been proposed for tumor development and cardiac hypertrophy (4.Wang X. Tournier C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, ERK5 plays essential physiological roles in addition to ERK1/2. In rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), EGF and NGF activate ERK5 via the small G-protein Ras (16.Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). But it has been shown that another neurotrophin, BDNF, activates ERK5 through Rap1 in cortical neurons (17.Wang Y. Su B. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35965-35974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the mink lung epithelial cell line, interaction of Lck-associated adapter with MEKK2 is involved in activation of ERK5 (18.Sun W. Wei X. Kesavan K. Garrington T.P. Fan R. Mei J. Anderson S.M. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2298-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas in bone marrow-derived mast cells, protein kinase C mediates FcϵRI-induced ERK5 activation and cytokine production (19.Li G. Lucas J.J. Gelfand E.W. Cell. Immunol. 2005; 238: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signals also activate ERK5. For example, GPCR agonists such as carbachol and thrombin activate ERK5 via Gαq/11 and Gα12/13 families of heterotrimeric G-proteins (1.Goldsmith Z.G. Dhanasekaran D.N. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3122-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 20.Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ERK5 activation by carbachol and thrombin is not blocked by dominant-negative mutants of Ras and Rho nor the C3 toxin that inactivates Rho-mediated functions (20.Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, prostaglandin E2 and forskolin, both of which promote cAMP production, attenuate ERK5 phosphorylation induced by EGF via protein kinase A (21.Pearson G.W. Earnest S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3039-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently reported that βγ subunits of Gi/o activated by lysophosphatidic acid blocked ERK5 activation by EGF and NGF in PC12 cells (22.Obara Y. Okano Y. Ono S. Yamauchi A. Hoshino T. Kurose H. Nakahata N. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of ERK5 regulation is complex, and the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. PC12 cells are a good in vitro model of immature neurons. In response to NGF, they differentiate toward sympathetic neurons (23.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). We have shown that NGF and cAMP promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation via Ras or Rap1 in PC12 cells, and ERK1/2 activation is essential for neurite outgrowth by NGF or cAMP (24.Obara Y. Labudda K. Dillon T.J. Stork P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the role of ERK5 in neural differentiation is suggested (13.Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14.Liu L. Cundiff P. Abel G. Wang Y. Faigle R. Sakagami H. Xu M. Xia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the detailed molecular mechanism in neuronal differentiation remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to clarify the physiological role of ERK5 in the neural differentiation process, especially focusing on neurite outgrowth and neuron-specific gene expression such as tyrosine hydroxylase. NGF, Bt2cAMP, D-luciferin, Hoechst-33258, and antibodies against FLAG M2 and β-actin were purchased from Sigma. EGF was purchased from PeproTech EC. (London, UK).

This phospho-specific ERK5 antibody also recognizes phospho-ERK1/2. Antibodies against ERK2, Rap1 and C3G, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence assay kit and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from GE Healthcare. Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. Phosphotyrosine hydroxylase (Ser-31) antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). BIX02188 and BIX02189 were kindly provided from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ridgefield, CT). DNA plasmid encoding tyrosine hydroxylase promoter-driven luciferase was kindly provided by Dr. Bistra Nankova (New York Medical College). DNA plasmids for measuring transcriptional activity of myocyte-enhancer factor (MEF) 2 (MEF2C/Gal4 and Gal4/Luciferase) were kindly given by Dr. Zhengui Xia (University of Washington) (25.Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA plasmid encoding mycERK5, MEK5A (S311A/T315V), and MEK5D (S311D/T315D) were from Dr. Eisuke Nishida (Kyoto University). mycERK5 kinase-dead mutant (K83M) was created from mycERK5 in this laboratory by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Adenovirus encoding RasS17N (RasN17) was provided by Dr. Dennis Stacey (Cleveland Clinic Institute). Adenovirus encoding FLAG-Rap1GAP1 was constructed using FLAG-Rap1GAP1 (26.Carey K.D. Dillon T.J.

C3G siRNA (sense, GGACUUUGAUGUUGAAUGUtt; antisense, ACAUUCAACAUCAAAGUCCtg) was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX) (27.Wang Z. Dillon T.J. Pokala V. Mishra S. Labudda K. Hunter B. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2130-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Bank (Tokyo, Japan). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Cell Culture Laboratory, Cleveland, OH), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) in an incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC12 cells that stably overexpress dominant-negative MEK5 were cultured in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen). To obtain PC12 cells that stably overexpress EGFP-tagged Rap1GAP (28.Meng J. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43417-43424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the cells were transfected with EGFP-tagged Rap1GAP and cultured in the presence of G418. Then the EGFP-positive and -negative cells were selected by cell sorting using FACSAria (BD Biosciences). HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the above antibiotics. Electrophoresis was performed on 8–11% acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred electrically from the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by the semi-dry blotting method. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed several times and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody as a secondary antibody in TBST containing 5% low fat milk at room temperature for 2 h. After rinsing with TBST, blots were developed using a chemiluminescence assay kit and visualized by the exposing the chemiluminescence from the membrane to the Hyperfilm enhanced chemiluminescence. The densities of the bands corresponding to tyrosine hydroxylase were analyzed by densitometry (ImageJ 1.36b, National Institutes of Health). Activated Rap1 was isolated from cell lysates using a protocol adapted from that of Franke et al. (29.Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Treated cells were lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were clarified by low speed centrifugation, and supernatants containing 500–1000 μg of total protein were incubated with 40 μg of GST-RalGDS fusion protein (gift of Dr. J. L. Bos, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands) for 40 min, followed by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads for an additional 40 min at 4 °C. Beads were rinsed three times with lysis buffer, and protein was eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample loading buffer. The amount of Rap1 bound to the beads was detected by Western blotting using antibody to Rap1. The neurite extension from PC12 cells was utilized as an index of neuronal differentiation. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then the nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258. The photographs were taken with CELAVIEW-RS100 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The number of nuclei and total length of neurites were calculated with the CELAVIEW software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and then the value of total neurite length divided by nucleus number was expressed as neurite length per cell (μm/cell). For transfection experiments (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7), the number of nuclei and total neurite length in GFP-positive cells were selectively counted by using the software. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the values of three wells (30.Obara Y. Aoki T. Kusano M. Ohizumi Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The DNA plasmids were transfected into PC12 cells using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000. Briefly, the cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at 1 × 105 (cells/well) and cultivated for a day. The DNA plasmids ((0.25 μg of Elk-1/Gal, 0.25 μg of 5× Gal4-E1B/Luciferase, 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase, and 0.3 μg of ERK5/MEK5 mutants or 0.1 μg of MEF2C/Gal, 0.1 μg of Gal-luciferase, 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase, and 1.2 μg of ERK5 mutants or 0.4 μg of tyrosine hydroxylase promoter/luciferase, 0.4 μg of ERK5 or MEK5 mutants, and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase)) and transfection reagent (1 μl/tube) were mixed gently in DMEM (10 μl/tube) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After the addition of DMEM (40 μl/tube), this entire mixture was transferred to the cultured media (50 μl/well), which had been replaced with serum-free DMEM (200 μl). The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and then the media were replaced with growth medium (500 μl) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. For reporter gene assays, the cells were incubated with drugs at 37 °C for 6–8 h after serum starvation and subjected to luciferase assay. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 110 mm K2HPO4, 15 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.8)) (100 μl/well). Then after centrifuging the lysates to remove the cell debris, the supernatant (50 μl/tube) was mixed with 300 μl of assay buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaOH). The luciferase reaction was started by adding 100 μl of luciferin solution (150 μm), and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (GENE LIGHT 55, Microtech Nition, Funabashi, Japan). As an internal control, β-actin promoter-driven β-galactosidase activity was measured in the lysates to normalize for the transfection efficiency. PC12 cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding dominant-negative RasN17 and FLAG-Rap1GAP1 that block endogenous activities of Ras and Rap1, respectively (31.Obara Y. Horgan A.M. Stork P.J. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The infection was carried out for 3 days at 50 m.o.i. for RasN17 adenovirus. FLAG-Rap1GAP1 adenovirus at 50 m.o.i. was applied to cells together with transactivating virus at 250 m.o.i. Control cells were infected with transactivating virus alone. After infection for 3 days, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were stimulated with drugs. Data were expressed as the mean values ± S.E., and significant differences were analyzed using Tukey's method. To examine whether NGF or cAMP can activate ERK5 in PC12 cells, PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) or Bt2cAMP (0.5 mm) for 3–360 min. Then phosphorylation of ERK5 and ERK1/2 was observed by Western blotting (Fig. 1). As shown previously, NGF induced the sustained phosphorylation of ERK5 and ERK1/2 (24.Obara Y. Labudda K. Dillon T.J. Stork P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). In contrast, although Bt2cAMP induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, it did not induce ERK5 phosphorylation. Whereas it has been reported that MEK inhibitors, such as PD98059 and U0126, block MEK5 as well as MEK1/2 (16.Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), it has been shown that these inhibitors do not block ERK5 signaling efficiently at low doses (33.Rovida E.

To examine the selectivity of these MEK inhibitors in our system, PC12 cells were preincubated with U0126 (10 or 30 μm) for 30 min and then further stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) or Bt2cAMP (0.5 mm) for 10 min. Although ERK1/2 phosphorylation by both reagents was abolished by pretreatment with U0126, ERK5 phosphorylation was not blocked at all (Fig. 2A). Another MEK inhibitor, PD98059, also suppressed ERK1/2 phosphorylation by NGF and Bt2cAMP but did not suppress ERK5 phosphorylation by NGF (Fig. 2B). Judging from these results, we used U0126 as a selective inhibitor for ERK1/2 signaling in this study. Recently, BIX02188 and BIX 02189 were developed as selective pharmacological inhibitors of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway (36.Tatake R.J. O'Neill M.M. Kennedy C.A. Wayne A.L. Jakes S. Wu D. Kugler Jr., S.Z. Kashem M.A. Kaplita P. Snow R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were pretreated with or without BIX02188 and BIX02189 (3–30 μm) for 30 min, and the cells were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Both inhibitors blocked ERK5 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were unaffected (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we used BIX02188 and BIX02189 as selective pharmacological inhibitors for ERK5 signaling in this study. Next, we attempted to confirm the selectivity of dominant-negative mutants of ERK5 or MEK5. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the constitutively active MEK5 mutant (MEK5D) and empty vector, ERK5 wild-type (ERK5WT), or dominant-negative ERK5 mutant (ERK5KD). MEK5D caused phosphorylation of both ERK5WT and ERK5KD, but the band shift of ERK5KD was smaller because ERK5KD lacks its kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation (Fig. 3A). It has been established that ERK5 and p38 MAPK also phosphorylate MEF2C at Ser-387 that is critical for transcriptional activation. In addition, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 activated by ERK1/2 phosphorylates MEF2C on Ser-192 that is also required for transcriptional activation (37.Wang Y. Liu L. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To confirm the inhibitory effect of ERK5KD on endogenous ERK5 activity, MEF2C-dependent transcription was examined. PC12 cells were stimulated by NGF (100 ng/ml) for 8 h in the presence of U0126 (10 μm) and a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (1 μm). NGF significantly promoted MEF2C-dependent transcription, and this effect was significantly blocked by ERK5KD (Fig. 3B). Because constitutively active Ras oncogenic mutant (RasV12) is a strong activator for ERK1/2 signaling (38.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), we examined whether ERK5KD or dominant-negative MEK5 mutant (MEK5A) interferes with ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by RasV12 in PC12 cells. Although U0126 completely inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation was not affected by ERK5KD or MEK5A (Fig. 3C). Luciferase expression resulting from Elk1 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 was often regarded as an index of in vivo ERK1/2 kinase activity, and it has been shown that ERK5 does not phosphorylate Elk1 (16.Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 25.Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NGF (100 ng/ml, 6 h) robustly promoted ERK1/2 activity, and this effect was completely blocked by U0126 but not affected by ERK5KD or MEK5A (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that ERK5KD or MEK5A does not affect ERK1/2 signaling. Whereas it has been shown that Ras regulates ERK5 activity in PC12 cells and COS7 cells (16.Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), there are reports demonstrating that Ras was not involved in ERK5 activation by growth factors or GPCR agonists such as carbachol and thrombin (10.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 20.Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rap1, another small G-protein, is necessary for ERK5 activation by BDNF in cortical neurons (17.Wang Y. Su B. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35965-35974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other studies examining Rap1 have shown contrasting results that Rap1 activated by exchange protein activated by cAMP inhibits ERK5 activity within protein complexes containing protein kinase A anchoring protein (39.Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of Ras and Rap1 in ERK5 activation is controversial. Therefore, we attempted to examine the involvement of these small G-proteins in ERK5 activation in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were infected with adenovirus encoding dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) for 3 days at 50 m.o.i. Then the cells were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) or EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Although the Ras-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation by NGF and EGF was largely reduced by RasN17, ERK5 phosphorylation by these growth factors was resistant to RasN17, suggesting that Ras is not involved in ERK5 phosphorylation by NGF and EGF in PC12 cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, FLAG-Rap1GAP1 that inactivates Rap1 activity was overexpressed by adenoviral infection at 50 m.o.i. for 3 days, and then PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. ERK5 phosphorylation was resistant to Rap1GAP1 as shown in the case of RasN17 (Fig. 4B). In addition, Rap1 activity was completely blocked by infection of adenovirus encoding FLAG-Rap1GAP1 (data not shown). Also, a major Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G, is known to mediate Rap1 activation by NGF (32.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 40.Hisata S. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Yamada T. Aoki K. Matsuda M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 843-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to block Rap1 activation by C3G knockdown. In the condition that C3G expression is diminished by siRNA, ERK5 phosphorylation was not largely reduced (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, ERK5 phosphorylation by NGF or EGF was examined in PC12 cells that stably overexpress EGFP-Rap1GAP. However, ERK5 phosphorylation was not blocked again by NGF (100 ng/ml) or EGF (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 4D). In EGFP-Rap1GAP cells, Rap1 activation by NGF was efficiently reduced, as determined by pulldown assay with GST-RalGDS (Fig. 4E). Taking these results together, ERK5 phosphorylation by NGF is Ras- and Rap1-independent. PC12 cells extend neurites in response to NGF or Bt2cAMP in an ERK1/2-dependent manner (24.Obara Y. Labudda K. Dillon T.J. Stork P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown previously, we confirmed that U0126 significantly attenuated the neurite outgrowth by both NGF and Bt2cAMP (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, both BIX02188 and BIX02189 (30 μm) significantly reduced neurite extension by NGF (100 ng/ml, 1 day) in PC12 cells (Fig. 5B), indicating ERK5 is required for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Next, PC12 cells were co-transfected with GFP and empty vector or ERK5KD and then further stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml, 1 day) or Bt2cAMP (0.5 mm, 1 day). When GFP-positive cells were examined, ERK5KD significantly reduced the NGF-induced neurite extension (Fig. 6A). However, the neurite outgrowth induced by Bt2cAMP was not attenuated by ERK5KD overexpression (Fig. 6A). Similarly, the neurite outgrowth induced by NGF (100 ng/ml, 1 day) but not"

To investigate the effects of OPN on COD growth, COD crystals were grown with phosphorylated OPN or a polyaspartic acid-rich peptide of OPN (DDLDDDDD, poly-Asp86–93). Crystals grown with OPN showed increased dimensions of the {110} prismatic faces attributable to selective inhibition at this crystallographic face. At high concentrations of OPN, elongated crystals with dominant {110} faces were produced, often with intergrown, interpenetrating twin crystals. Poly-Asp86–93 dose-dependently elongated crystal morphology along the {110} faces in a manner similar to OPN. In crystal growth studies using fluorescently tagged poly-Asp86–93 followed by imaging of crystal interiors using confocal microscopy, sectoral (compositional) zoning in COD was observed resulting from selective binding and incorporation (occlusion) of peptide exclusively into {110} crystal sectors. Computational modeling of poly-Asp86–93 adsorption to COD {110} and {101} surfaces also suggests increased stabilization of the COD {110} surface and negligible change to the natively stable {101} surface. Ultrastructural, colloidal-gold immunolocalization of OPN by transmission electron microscopy in human stones confirmed an intracrystalline distribution of OPN. In summary, OPN and its poly-Asp86–93 sequence similarly affect COD mineral growth; the {110} crystallographic faces become enhanced and dominant attributable to {110} face inhibition by the protein/peptide, and peptides can incorporate into the mineral phase. We, thus, conclude that the poly-Asp86–93 domain is central to the OPN ability to interact with the {110} faces of COD, where it binds to inhibit crystal growth with subsequent intracrystalline incorporation (occlusion).

Calcium oxalate is the major mineral phase of human renal calculi, constituting roughly 70% by weight of the stones (1.Wesson J.A. Worcester E.M. Wiessner J.H. Mandel N.S. Kleinman J.G. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 952-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two polymorphs of calcium oxalate, calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) 3The abbreviations used are: COMcalcium oxalate monohydrateCODcalcium oxalate dihydrateOPNosteopontinFAM5-carboxyfluoresceinSEMscanning electron microscopy. and calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD), are the most abundant mineral types, but others may exist in smaller amounts, including calcium phosphate minerals. It has been reported that the occurrence of COM, the more thermodynamically stable polymorph of calcium oxalate, is often at the core of most kidney stones and is approximately twice as frequent as COD (2.Mandel N.S. Mandel G.S. J. Urol. 1989; 142: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although both crystal types typically exist to some degree in most stones (3.Durrbaum D. Rodgers A.L.

COM is commonly found in the urine of “stone formers,” but seldom is seen in healthy urine; on the other hand, COD crystals are typically found in the urine of both healthy people and stone formers and are routinely excreted during urination (5.Cerini C. Geider S. Dussol B. Hennequin C. Daudon M. Veesler S. Nitsche S. Boistelle R. Berthézène P. Dupuy P. Vazi A. Berland Y. Dagorn J.C. Verdier J.M.

Importantly, in patients with severe uremia and hypercalciuria, elongated, large rod-shaped COD crystals are not only often observed but are the sole mineral phase present in the kidneys in these pathologies (8.Lewis R.D.

In comparing physiologic differences between calcium oxalate polymorphs, one study has shown that for a given amount of added crystals, ∼50% more COM than COD crystals bound to inner medullary collecting duct cells in vitro (10.Wesson J.A. Worcester E.M. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 415-424PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have reported that COD crystals are less prone than COM crystals to adhere to cell surfaces, suggesting that COD might, thus, contribute to a lesser degree than COM to the retention of mineral in the renal collecting ducts leading to kidney stone formation (5.Cerini C. Geider S. Dussol B. Hennequin C. Daudon M. Veesler S. Nitsche S. Boistelle R. Berthézène P. Dupuy P. Vazi A. Berland Y. Dagorn J.C. Verdier J.M.

This is supported by the fact that COM crystals are large cationic particulates, presenting more calcium ions than COD crystals at their surface that would have a stronger affinity for anionic molecules on renal epithelial cell membranes (10.Wesson J.A. Worcester E.M. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 415-424PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Verkoelen C.F. van der Boom B.G. Kok D.J. Romijn J.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1072-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further to this, COM and COD crystals bind to cultured renal cells with different face-selective affinities (13.Wesson J.A. Ward M.D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.Sheng X. Jung T. Wesson J.A. Ward M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tissue Int. 1996; 58: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and COM crystals are known to be more injurious to cell membranes than COD crystals (17.Wiessner J.H. Mandel G.S. Mandel N.S. J. Urol. 1986; 135: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this regard, Wesson et al. (1.Wesson J.A. Worcester E.M. Wiessner J.H. Mandel N.S. Kleinman J.G. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 952-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) proposed that the preferential formation of COD crystals in vivo protects against urolithiasis because they are less likely to adhere to renal tubular cells and are, thus, more readily excreted. This notion is supported by direct experimental measurements of the macromolecular adhesion force on specific crystal faces of COM or COD at the near-molecular level (13.Wesson J.A. Ward M.D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2006; 15: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14.Sheng X. Jung T. Wesson J.A. Ward M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Given this, conversely, inhibition of the formation of COD crystals could lead to preferential COM deposition and the formation of kidney stones. Although calcium and oxalate ionic concentrations are frequently supersaturated with respect to both COM and COD mineral polymorphs, normal human urine likely contains factors that can modulate calcium oxalate crystallization into COD (10.Wesson J.A. Worcester E.M. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 415-424PubMed Google Scholar). In this context the presence of urinary macromolecular inhibitors of crystal growth can cause preferential crystallization of COD, rather than COM, from a supersaturated solution of calcium chloride and sodium oxalate (10.Wesson J.A. Worcester E.M. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 415-424PubMed Google Scholar). Substantial elegant work has been performed on COM growth and the effect of citrate and peptides/proteins as crystal growth modifiers. Some macromolecules, including urinary osteopontin (OPN), contain polyanionic regions and net negative charges that have been shown to inhibit calcium oxalate crystallization (14.Sheng X. Jung T.

Although there appears to be preferential inhibition of COM, several studies present evidence for higher affinity of OPN binding to COD, and here we investigate this further to show the effects of OPN (and a peptide of OPN) on COD crystal growth and provide information on peptide/protein occlusion that might facilitate crystal dissolution as originally proposed by Ryall et al.

OPN is a highly acidic, glycosylated phosphoprotein produced by many types of epithelial cells and can be found in normal plasma and in various body fluids such as bile, urine, and milk (25.Brown L.F.

OPN contains a 15–20% aspartic acid residue content, and the mineral binding and inhibitory properties of OPN have often been partly attributed to an aspartic acid-rich sequence within this protein (10.Wesson J.A.

In a rat model of urolithiasis, although increased OPN mRNA expression was associated with increased renal calculi formation, the urinary excretion level of OPN was less than in controls, discussed as being attributable to incorporation of OPN into stones (37.Kohri K. Nomura S. Kitamura Y. Nagata T. Yoshioka K. Iguchi M. Yamate T. Umekawa T. Suzuki Y. Sinohara H. Kurita T. J. Biol.

In general, the inclusion of OPN plus other urinary macromolecules into renal calculi has been suggested to be part of a cellular defense mechanism designed to inhibit crystal growth and limit the growth of kidney stones, to interrupt inorganic crystal structure of the calcium oxalate minerals, and to provide an organic volume whose degradation by permeating proteases creates channels facilitating dissolution of the mineral phase (23.Ryall R.L. Chauvet M.C. Grover P.K. BJU Int. 2005; 96: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24.Grover P.K. Thurgood L.A. Fleming D.E. van Bronswijk W. Wang T. Ryall R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F355-F361Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Given these possibilities, our aim was to determine whether full-length phosphorylated OPN and a poly-Asp peptide of OPN affect COD crystal growth and morphology, and if so, we further aimed to identify the contribution of face-specific binding and intracrystalline incorporation (occlusion) of OPN peptide into COD. Combining experimental and computational approaches, we have identified preferential binding and unique occlusion of a peptide of OPN at a specific crystallographic face of COD. Furthermore, we present a possible adsorption mechanism in a model where multiple peptide carboxylate groups bind calcium atoms at the COD {110} surface. Taken together, our findings provide new information on the pathogenesis of renal calculi by describing specific actions of phosphorylated full-length OPN and a short peptide sequence of OPN (not having post-translational modifications) on specific COD crystal faces that modulate calcium oxalate growth and crystal morphologies. Kidney stones from two female patients (age 66 and 69) obtained from the Kidney Stone Clinic of the Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University Hospital Centre, were characterized as being calcium oxalate-containing stones by routine x-ray diffraction performed by a commercial service on a fragment of each stone. The bulk of the stones were washed briefly multiple times with tap water and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 days. Stones were decalcified in a 4.13% EDTA solution containing 1% glutaraldehyde. For light microscopy immunohistochemistry, the decalcified kidney stone samples were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were immunostained for OPN using rabbit anti-human OPN (LF-123) polyclonal antibodies (antibodies courtesy of Dr. Larry W. Fisher, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Briefly, deparaffinized sections were treated with 1% bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by incubation with anti-OPN LF-123 antibody diluted 1:200 in 5% normal goat serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST) (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 (pH 7.6)). Sections were washed with TBST, and secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag Laboratories, Invitrogen) antibody incubation was followed by TBST washing and application of the Vectastain ABC-AP kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for an additional 45 min at room temperature. Color development was achieved by treatment with Fast Red TR/Naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) containing 1 mm levamisole to inhibit endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Sections were counterstained with methyl green (Vector Laboratories) and mounted with coverslips using Kaiser's glycerol jelly. Light micrographs were obtained using a DXC-950 3-CCD camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on an optical microscope (model Leitz DMRBE, Leica Wetzlar, Germany). For ultrastructural immunolocalization of OPN in the kidney stones, aldehyde-fixed samples were fully decalcified with EDTA (also containing aldehyde), dehydrated, and then embedded in LR White acrylic resin (London Resin Co., Berkshire, UK) as previously described (39.McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 44-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Survey sections (0.5 μm) of embedded tissue were cut with a diamond knife on an ultramicrotome (Model Reichert Ultracut E, Leica), stained for light microscopy with toluidine blue, and coverslipped. For transmission electron microscopy, selected regions were trimmed, and ultrathin sections (80 nm) were placed on polyvinyl Formvar- and carbon-coated nickel grids. Grid-mounted tissue sections were processed for colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry by incubation of the sections with primary anti-OPN LF-123 antibody (1:10 dilution), after which immunolabeling patterns were visualized by incubation with protein A-colloidal gold complex (14 nm). Contrasting of the sections was performed using conventional uranyl acetate and lead citrate staining, and this was followed by their examination using a JEM 2000FXII transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV. The metastable limit of human urine with respect to oxalate, slightly below 4 mm sodium oxalate final concentration, was determined as described by Ryall et al. (40.Ryall R.L. Hibberd C.M. Marshall V.R. Urol. Res. 1985; 13: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the protocol to precipitate calcium oxalate crystals from human urine was adapted from Doyle et al. (41.Doyle I.R. Ryall R.L. Marshall V.R. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh morning urine (200–500-ml volume) was collected without added anti-bacterial agents from 6 males between the ages of 23 and 45, with each having no history of kidney stones. The pH of each sample was taken, and urine analysis was performed to identify and discard abnormal samples using ChemStrip 5L (Roche Applied Science), which identifies the presence of leukocytes, glucose, ketones, or red blood cells in the samples. Urinary protein concentrations were quantified by the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) as well as by the mini-Lowry method. A 200 mm solution of sodium oxalate was added to the urine samples to get a final concentration of 4 mm sodium oxalate, and the samples were left at room temperature for intervals of 1–3 h. Crystals precipitated in the samples were collected by centrifugation at 8200 rpm for 30 min followed by filtration harvesting through a hydrophilic polypropylene membrane (0.2–0.8-mm pore size, Gelman Sciences, Pall Corp., East Hills, NY) and washing with distilled and de-ionized water. To obtain/release crystal-bound proteins, 30 mg of crystals were demineralized with 7 ml of 0.25 m EDTA at pH 8.0 and 4 °C for a period of 3 days with gentle agitation (41.Doyle I.R. Ryall R.L. Marshall V.R. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Dialysis was done against distilled, de-ionized water to remove EDTA using cellulose membranes with a 12-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Sigma) for more than 24 h at 4 °C. The extracts were collected in 15-ml conical tubes and concentrated 5-fold with the appropriate volume of distilled, de-ionized water. Twenty μl of total protein extract from the precipitated crystals were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and then probed with the following primary antibodies; 1) monoclonal mouse anti-human OPN Mb53 antibody (1:5,000 dilution, kindly provided by Dr. A. Chambers, University of Western Ontario, Canada), 2) polyclonal rabbit anti-human OPN LF-124 (anti-N terminus) or polyclonal rabbit anti-human LF-123 (anti-C-terminal) antibodies (LF-124 used at 1:2,000 dilution; LF-123 used at 1:10,000 dilution; kindly provided by Dr. Larry W. Fisher, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). This was followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies that included 1) goat anti-mouse-HRP/1:2000 (Dupont Biotechnology, Johnston, IA) for the monoclonal antibody and 2) goat anti-rabbit/1:2000 (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the polyclonal antibodies. The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). To investigate the effects of full-length OPN and an acidic OPN peptide on COD growth, COD crystals were grown from aqueous CaCl2-Na2C2O4 solutions in the presence of OPN or the synthetic poly-Asp peptide. The OPN used for these experiments was full-length, phosphorylated bovine milk OPN as characterized (42.Sørensen E.S. Petersen T.E. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and supplied by Esben Sørensen (Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, Denmark) and Arla Foods (Denmark). Synthetic, linear polyaspartic acid-rich (poly-Asp) peptide with or without a fluorescein (FAM) tag was constructed according to the sequence of the aspartate-rich domain of bovine OPN (poly-Asp86–93, residues 86–93, DDLDDDDD) at the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre of McGill University, and peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Commercial polyaspartic acid (molecular mass range 5,000–15,000 daltons, range of 37–113 residues, Sigma) was also used to compare effects with the linear synthesized poly-Asp86–93. OPN, poly-Asp86–93, or commercial polyaspartic acid was added to the sodium oxalate solution before the crystal growth experiments, with various final concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 5 μm, which spans the physiologic range (43.Thurgood L.A. Grover P.K. Ryall R.L. Urol. Res. 2008; 36: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and extends beyond. The detailed procedure for the growth of COD crystals was essentially that described by Lepage and Tawashi (44.Lepage L. Tawashi R. J. Pharm. Sci. 1982; 71: 1059-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The growth experiments were performed in a free-drift system at 4 °C. In brief, 3 ml of 0.005 m sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4, Fisher, room temperature) with or without added protein or peptide was added to 5 ml of 1 m calcium chloride solution at 4 °C (CaCl2, Fisher) in 15-ml conical polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt). The Na2C2O4 solution was added to the center of the air-liquid interface of the CaCl2 solution using a micropipette. The mixture was left without agitation for 24 h at 4 °C. The COD crystals that formed were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. COD crystals are stable in air at 4 °C for 2 weeks; however, when these crystals are kept in normal saline at 37 °C, they are stable only for 24 h. This is attributable to the gradual transformation of the dihydrate form of calcium oxalate to the monohydrate form, which is more stable in normal saline at 37 °C (44.Lepage L. Tawashi R. J. Pharm. Sci. 1982; 71: 1059-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As COD is insoluble in alcohol (45.Bartholomew R.S. Rebello P.F. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1979; 88: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the crystals were washed briefly with distilled, de-ionized water (resistance >18 megaohms) and dehydrated sequentially in gradient 50, 70, and 100% ethyl alcohol solutions; the 100% ethyl alcohol was changed 3 times to ensure that the dehydration was complete. The crystals were kept at 4 °C and rehydrated sequentially as needed. COD crystals grown in vitro were mounted with conductive carbon cement onto metallic SEM stubs. Samples were then sputter-coated with a 20–25-nm-thick gold-palladium thin film using a Hummer VI Sputter System (Anatech Ltd., Hayward, CA) and imaged using a Hitachi field-emission gun SEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 3–5 kV (model S-4700, Hitachi High Technologies America, Pleasanton, CA) and using working distances of <12 mm. COD crystals grown in the presence of fluorescein-tagged poly-Asp86–93 (as above) were suspended in absolute alcohol and deposited on microscope glass slides. Samples were viewed as whole mounts by immunofluorescence microscopy, and pictures were taken with Leica model DC300F camera mounted on a phase contrast/fluorescence"
https://openalex.org/W2099464373,"The accumulation of triglycerides (TG) in the liver, designated hepatic steatosis, is characteristically associated with obesity and insulin resistance, but it can also develop after fasting. Here, we show that fasting-induced hepatic steatosis is under genetic control in inbred mice. After a 24-h fast, C57BL/6J mice and SJL/J mice both lost more than 20% of body weight and approximately 60% of total body TG. In C57BL/6J mice, TG accumulated in liver, producing frank steatosis. In striking contrast, SJL/J mice failed to accumulate any hepatic TG even though they lost nearly as much adipose tissue mass as the C57BL/6J mice. Mice from five other inbred strains developed fasting-induced steatosis like the C57BL/6J mice. Measurements of the uptake of free fatty acids (FA) in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that SJL/J mice were protected from steatosis because their heart and skeletal muscle took up and oxidized twice as much FA as compared with C57BL/6J mice. As a result of this muscle diversion, serum-free FA and ketone bodies rose much less after fasting in SJL/J mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice. When livers of SJL/J and C57BL/6J mice were perfused with similar concentrations of FA, the livers took up and esterified similar amounts. We conclude that SJL/J mice express one or more variant genes that lead to enhanced FA uptake and oxidation in muscle, thereby sparing the liver from FA overload in the fasting state."
https://openalex.org/W2074695556,"Hyperinsulinemia and type II diabetes are associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal tumors. We found previously that in intestinal cells, insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulates c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein expression through both Akt-dependent and Akt-independent mechanisms. The effect of Akt is attributed to the stimulation of c-Myc translation by mammalian target of rapamycin. However, Akt-independent stimulation was, associated with an increase in β-catenin (β-cat) in the nucleus and an increased association between β-cat and T-cell factor binding sites on the c-Myc promoter, detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. In this study, we show that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation/activation of p-21-activated protein kinase-1 (PAK-1) in an Akt-independent manner in vitro and in an in vivo hyperinsulinemic mouse model. Significantly, shRNA (small hairpin RNA)-mediated PAK-1 knockdown attenuated both basal and insulin-stimulated c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression, associated with a marked reduction in extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and β-cat phosphorylation at Ser675. Furthermore, PAK-1 silencing led to a complete blockade of insulin-stimulated β-cat binding to the c-Myc promoter and cellular growth. Finally, inhibition of MEK, a downstream target of PAK-1, blocked insulin-stimulated nuclear β-cat accumulation and c-Myc expression. Our observations suggest that PAK-1 serves as an important linker between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1986055146,"Leptospira interrogans is a pathogenic spirochete that causes disease in both humans and animals. LigB (Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein B) contributes to the binding of Leptospira to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (Fn), fibrinogen, laminin, and collagen. A high affinity Fn-binding region of LigB has been recently localized to LigBCen2, which contains the partial eleventh and full twelfth immunoglobulin-like repeats (LigBCen2R) and 47 amino acids of the non-repeat region (LigBCen2NR) of LigB. In this study, LigBCen2NR was shown to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn (KD = 379 nm) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isothermal titration calorimetry. Interestingly, this sequence was not observed to adopt secondary structure by far UV circular dichroism or by differential scanning calorimetry, in agreement with computer-based secondary structure predictions. A low partition coefficient (Kav) measured with gel permeation chromatography, a high hydrodynamic radius (Rh) measured with dynamic light scattering, and the insensitivity of the intrinsic viscosity to guanidine hydrochloride treatment all suggest that LigBCen2NR possesses an extended and disordered structure. Two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC NMR spectra of intact LigBCen2 in the absence and presence of NTD are consistent with these observations, suggesting the presence of both a β-rich region and an unstructured region in LigBCen2 and that the latter of these selectively interacts with NTD.

Previously, a high affinity Fn-binding region was localized to LigBCen2, which includes the partial eleventh and complete twelfth immunoglobulin-like repeat region and the first 47 amino acids of the non-repeat regions of LigB (15.Lin Y.P.

LigBCen2 was shown to bind to both the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the gelatin binding domain (GBD) of Fn. The addition of calcium induces a conformational change in LigBCen2 and enhances binding between LigBCen2 and the NTD of Fn (15.Lin Y.P. Raman R. Sharma Y. Chang Y.F. J. Biol.

It was recently discovered that the Fn-binding domains in certain Fn-binding proteins are disordered and extended but gain structure upon binding to the NTD of Fn (20.House-Pompeo K. Xu Y. Joh D.

We have performed a fine-mapping study of the NTD-binding site on LigBCen2 and identified this site as LigBCen2NR, a portion of the non-repeat region (amino acids 1119–1165). The addition of NTD promotes the folding of LigBCen2NR from a disordered and extended structure to a folded structure. This finding is notable, since LigBCen2NR is located in the non-immunoglobulin-like region of LigB, as compared with other Fn-binding proteins, such as Staphylococcus aureus FnbpA and FnbpB (23.Meenan N.A. Visai L. Valtulina V. Schwarz-Linek U. Norris N.C. Gurusidappa S. Hook M. Speziale P. Potts J.R. J. Biol.

This finding provides the fundamental groundwork for the development of a therapeutic agent to target this interaction in order to prevent or treat Leptospira infection. Rabbit anti-GST antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were ordered from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Diego, CA), respectively. NTD or GBD of Fn, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen A, ribonuclease A, aprotinin, insulin chain B, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate monobasic, and sodium phosphate dibasic were purchased from Sigma. The construction, expression, and purification of LigCon (amino acids 1–630) were performed as described previously (12.Palaniappan R.U. Chang Y.F. Jusuf S.S. Artiushin S. Timoney J.F. McDonough S.P. Barr S.C. Divers T.J. Simpson K.W. McDonough P.L. Mohammed H.O. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5924-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Constructs for the expression of histidine-tagged or GST-fused LigBCen2 (amino acids 1014–1156) and GST were generated using the vector pQE30 (Qiagen, Alencia, CA) and/or pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare), respectively, as previously described (14.Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Constructs for the expression of histidine-tagged or GST-fused LigBCen2R (amino acids 1014–1123) and LigBCen2NR (amino acids 1119–1165) were generated using the vector pQE30 and pGEX-4T-2 (Fig. 1). To perform the PCRs, the following forward and backward primers were utilized (14.Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar): LigBCen2R forward primer 5′-GGATCCACTGCGACTTACAAT-3′ and backward primer 5′-GTCGACCGTGTCCGTTTTGTT-3′; LigBCen2NR forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCAACAAAACGGACACG-3′ and backward primer 5′-CGGTCGACATTGGAACTATTAAT-3′. Primers were engineered to introduce a BamHI site at the 5′-end of each fragment and a stop codon followed by a SalI site at the 3′-end of each fragment. PCR products were sequentially digested with BamHI and SalI and then ligated into pQE30 or pGEX-4T-2 cut with BamHI and SalI, respectively. In this study, we purified the soluble form of the histidine tag or GST fused with LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR from Escherichia coli, as previously described (25.Palaniappan R.U. McDonough S.P. Divers T.J. Chen C.S. Pan M.J. Matsumoto M. Chang Y.F. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Tris buffer (25 mm Tris and 150 mm sodium chloride at pH 7.0) containing 100 μm calcium chloride was used in all experiments, since we have previously shown that calcium enhances the binding of LigBCen2 to NTD (15.Lin Y.P. Raman R. Sharma Y. Chang Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25140-25149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that both LigBCen2R and LigBCen2NR bind calcium (data not shown). E. coli harboring the expression plasmid for His-tagged LigBCen2 were cultured in M9 minimal medium. The recombinant LigBCen2 (retaining the His6 tag) was labeled with 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotopes, Cambridge, MA), expressed, and purified, as previously described (26.Jayaraman B. Nicholson L.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12174-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The purified 15N-labeled LigBCen2 was dialyzed against Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride at pH 6.0 and concentrated to 0.95 mm (0.3 ml) using the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For some spectra, 15N-labeled LigBCen2 was also mixed with 1.44 mm (unlabeled) NTD. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen) z axis pulse-field gradient probe. Two-dimensional 15N-1H fast HSQC spectra were recorded with spectral widths of 2.4 kHz in t1 (400 real + imaginary data points) and 10 kHz in t2 (2048 real + imaginary data points) (27.Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), with 16 or 32 transients per free induction decay for LigBCen2 in the absence or presence of NTD and a recycle delay of 1.0 s. NMR data were processed and analyzed using the software tools nmrPipe, nmrDraw, and Pipp (28.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar, 29.Garrett D. Powers R. Gronenborn A. Clore M. J. Magn. Reson. (1969). 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Data were apodized using a phase-shifted sine bell function and zero-filled prior to Fourier transformation. Association and dissociation rate constants for LigBCen2/NTD binding were measured by SPR analysis performed with a Biacore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 26.7 °C. 1 μm His-tagged LigBCen2 in Tris buffer containing 100 μm CaCl2 was immobilized on an nitrilotriacetic acid chip (GE Healthcare) conjugated with 500 μm nickel sulfate. Serial concentrations (100, 200, 400, and 800 nm) of NTD were injected into the flow cells at a flow rate of 5 μl/min over the immobilized LigBCen2. All experiments are duplicated. All sensogram data have been corrected by subtracting data from a control cell injected with Tris buffer containing 100 μm CaCl2. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the data to the one-step biomolecular association reaction model (1:1 Langmuir model) with the curve-fitting BIAevaluation software, version 3.0. To determine the binding of GST-LigBCen2, GST-LigBCen2R, GST-LigBCen2NR, or GST-LigCon (negative control) to the NTD of Fn, 1 μm NTD was coated on microtiter plate wells, incubated at 4 °C for 16 h, and blocked with blocking buffer (100 μl/well) containing 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride at room temperature for 2 h. Then serial concentrations (as indicated by Fig. 3A) of GST-LigBCen2, GST-LigBCen2R, GST-LigBCen2NR, or GST-LigCon in 100 μl of Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride were added to the microtiter plate wells for 1 h at 37 °C. To detect the binding of GST-LigBCen2, GST-LigBCen2R, GST-LigBCen2NR, or GST-LigCon, rabbit anti-GST (1:200) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000) were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. After washing the plates three times with TBST (0.05% Tween 20, 100 μm calcium chloride in Tris buffer), 100 μl of TMB (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each well and incubated for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.5% hydrofluoric acid to each well. Each plate was read at 630 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bioteck EL-312, Winooski, VT). Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of three trials in triplicate samples. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences are indicated by an asterisk. The experiments were carried out with a CSC 5300 microcalorimeter (Calorimetry Science Corp., Lindon, UT) at 25 °C, as described previously (14.Lin Y.P. Chang Y.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, the cell contained 1 ml of a solution of NTD, and the syringe contained 250 μl of a solution of LigBCen2R or LigBCen2NR. The concentrations of LigBCen2R, LigBCen2NR, and NTD are described in Table 1. Both solutions were in Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride. The titration was performed in 25 injections of 10 μl with a stirring speed of 250 rpm, and the delay time between the injections was 5 min. Data were analyzed using Titration Binding Work version 3.1 software (Calorimetry Science), fitting them to an independent binding model.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of NTD and LigBCen2R or LigBCen2NRMacromoleculeLigB residues[LigB][NTD]ΔHTΔSΔGKdnμmμmkcal mol−1kcal mol−1kcal mol−1nmLigBCen2NR1119–11653626113.13 ± 1.5522.25−9.12379 ± 160.94 ± 0.01LigBCen2R1014–11231185.9NFaNF, non-fittable.NFNFNFNFa NF, non-fittable.

The excess heat capacity Cp(T) of LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR was measured using a DSC Q1000 microcalorimeter (Waters, New Castle, DE). Degassed samples containing 3 μm LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, LigBCen2NR, or Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride were heated at a 10-K/h scan rate. Cp(T) data were recorded, corrected for buffer base line, and normalized to the amount of the samples. The TA Universal Analysis software (Waters) was used for the data analysis and display. All calorimetric experiments in this study were repeated three times to ensure reproducibility. LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, and LigBCen2NR were analyzed for their partition coefficient (Kav) and effective radii (Stokes radii, RS) in Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare) system. Protein samples were preequilibrated with Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated using a low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare). The standard globular proteins contained in the kit were ribonuclease A (13,700 Da), chymotrypsinogen (25,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), and albumin (67,000 Da). Blue dextran 2000 (2,000,000 Da) (Amersham Biosciences) and aldolase (158,000 Da) were used to indicate the void volume (Vo) and the total volume (Vt), respectively. The elution volume (Ve) of each sample was measured. To define the relationships between the elution volumes of protein samples and their respective molecular weight, the Kav value for each protein was calculated using Equation 1, Kav=Ve−VoVt−Vo(Eq. 1) where Vo and Vt for the column used were 7.96 and 23.56 ml, respectively. Kav values of standard and LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR were plotted against the logarithm of the protein molecular weights to fit Equation 2 as follows (33.Ohno H. Blackwell J. Jamieson A.M. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), logMr=a⋅Kav+b(Eq. 2) where a and b are constants. RS values of the proteins were determined using sample elution volumes and standard curves, as described in the calibration kit (GE Healthcare). One mg/ml LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR was dialyzed against prefiltered (0.22-μm Millipore filters) Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride. The samples were placed in a 1-ml plastic cuvette. The standard globular proteins, including albumin (67,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000 Da), ribonuclease A (13,700 Da), aprotinin (6,500 Da), or insulin chain B (3,400 Da), were used to generate the calibration curve of globular proteins. The automated measurements were collected with a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK), using a 2-min equilibrium delay at each measurement. The data were adjusted using the method of cumulants to obtain the hydrodynamic radii (Rh). The logarithms of the Rh values of standards and LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR were plotted against the logarithm of the protein molecular weights to fit the equation, logMr=a⋅Rh+b(Eq. 3) where a and b are constants. The viscosities of the LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, and LigBCen2NR were measured using a Cannon-Ubbelohde Semi-Micro Dilution Viscometer (catalog number 25 9722-H50; Cannon Instrument Co., State College, PA) with a viscometer constant, 0.002044 mm2/s2, at 25 °C. Before measuring the viscosities, 1 ml of each protein at concentrations of 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.5 mg/ml were dialyzed overnight against Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride, with or without 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and the same buffer was used as a reference solution. The specific viscosity (ηsp) was determined as previously described (34.Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. Hooker Jr., T.M. Zarlengo M.H. Salahuddin A. Aune K.C. Takagi T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Specific viscosity/concentration values of untreated or 6 m guanidine hydrochloride-treated LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR were plotted against the concentration of proteins, and the intrinsic viscosity [η] was calculated using the following equation, ηspC=η+kη2C(Eq. 4) where c represents protein concentration and k is a dimensionless constant. The values of [η] expected for a denatured protein shown in Table 3 were obtained from the following equation (34.Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. Hooker Jr., T.M. Zarlengo M.H. Salahuddin A. Aune K.C. Takagi T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), η=0.716n0.66(Eq. 5) where n represents the number of residues in the protein. CD analysis was performed on an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ) under N2 atmosphere. CD spectra were measured at room temperature (25 °C) in a 1-cm path length quartz cell. Spectra of LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR were recorded in Tris buffer with 100 μm calcium chloride at a protein concentration of 10 μm. Three spectra were recorded for each condition from 190 to 250 nm for far UV CD in 1-nm increments. In the thermal denaturation experiment, 10 μm LigBCen2, LigBCen2R, or LigBCen2NR were used, and data were collected at 2 °C/min increments from 20 to 100 °C, recording the ellipticity at 205 nm, with 30-s temperature equilibrations, followed by 30-s data averaging.

The Arabidopsis AMT1 proteins mediate uptake of the ionic form of ammonium. AMT transport activity is controlled allosterically via a highly conserved cytosolic C terminus that interacts with neighboring subunits in a trimer. The C terminus is thus capable of modulating the conductivity of the pore. To gain insight into the underlying mechanism, pore mutants suppressing the inhibitory effect of mutations in the C-terminal trans-activation domain were characterized. AMT1;1 carrying the mutation Q57H in transmembrane helix I (TMH I) showed increased ammonium uptake but reduced capacity to take up methylammonium. To explore whether the transport mechanism was altered, the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and analyzed electrophysiologically. AMT1;1-Q57H was characterized by increased ammonium-induced and reduced methylammonium-induced currents. AMT1;1-Q57H possesses a 100× lower affinity for ammonium (Km) and a 10-fold higher Vmax as compared with the wild type form. To test whether the trans-regulatory mechanism is conserved in archaeal homologs, AfAmt-2 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus was expressed in yeast. The transport function of AfAmt-2 also depends on trans-activation by the C terminus, and mutations in pore-residues corresponding to Q57H of AMT1;1 suppress nonfunctional AfAmt-2 mutants lacking the activating C terminus. Altogether, our data suggest that bacterial and plant AMTs use a conserved allosteric mechanism to control ammonium flux, potentially using a gating mechanism that limits flux to protect against ammonium toxicity.

All organisms depend on an adequate supply of nutrients, especially nitrogen. For microorganisms and plants, which are able to assimilate ammonium, NH4+ represents the sole bioavailable nitrogen form. (Nitrate use requires enzymatic conversion to ammonia.) Plants preferentially take up ammonium; however, overaccumulation of NH4+ is toxic to microorganisms and plants (1Hess D.C. Lu W. Rabinowitz J.D. Botstein D.

Wu B. Jost W. Obrdlik P. El Bakkoury M. Marini A.M. André B. Hamacher T. Boles E. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45603-45610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Quantitation of charge movement and tracer uptake demonstrated that AMT1 transports exclusively the ionic form, i.e. each transported 14C-MeA molecule corresponded to the transfer of a single positive elementary charge across the membrane (16Mayer M. Dynowski M. Ludewig U. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The high affinity and low capacity of AMT1, which is too slow to be classified as a channel, suggests that it rather functions as a transporter, with significant conformational changes limiting its turnover numbers. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the bacterial homologs use a different mechanism, in that they mediate transport of uncharged NH3 (17Khademi S. O'Connell 3rd, J. Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), although this hypothesis has been disputed (18Fong R.N. Kim K.S. Yoshihara C.

Biochemical as well as structural analyses of bacterial and archaeal AMTs revealed a highly stable and conserved trimeric complex (15Ludewig U. Wilken S. Wu B. Jost W. Obrdlik P. El Bakkoury M.

Each monomer is composed of 11 transmembrane helices (TMHs) that form a noncontinuous channel through which the substrate can pass. Highly conserved residues are observed in positions that are likely crucial for function: a tryptophan located in a central extracellular surface cleft is thought to be part of a selectivity filter, discriminating K+ ions and water molecules from NH4+ via a cation-π interaction and H-bonds via neighboring residues. Below this cleft, a pair of phenylalanines is assumed to function as a gate that blocks the entrance of the channel, which, after that point, appears open to the cytoplasmic side. Two histidines on helices V and VI are in H-bonding distance and line the central part of the channel pathway. Similar to the bacterial Na+/leucine and the Na+/arabinose transporters (20Faham S.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17090-17095Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recent findings demonstrate that AMTs can exist in active and inactive states, probably controlled by phosphorylation of residues in the conserved C terminus (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). 7V. Lanquar, D. Loque, F. Hörmann, S. Lalonde, N. von Wiren, and W. B. Frommer, submitted for publication. In the Arabidopsis thaliana AMT1, an allosteric trans-activation is mediated through the interaction of the C termini with cytosolic loops of the neighboring subunits in a trimer (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with a novel regulatory mechanism that can provide for rapid shut-off of transport. This feedback loop may potentially be important for protection against ammonium toxicity by limiting peak output, namely ammonium uptake capacity at high external supply. Analysis of >900 AMT homologs shows that the C terminus is highly conserved from cyanobacteria to fungi and plants, indicating that the regulatory mechanism may be conserved (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A suppressor screen using inactive mutants carrying a mutation in the cytosolic C terminus of AMT1;1 identified mutants that had lost their strict dependence on allosteric trans-activation (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, when expressed in yeast, some of these mutants show increased ammonium transport capacity. Electrophysiological analysis of one of the pore mutants, AMT1;1-Q57H, demonstrates that transport is still electrogenic and that the increased ammonium sensitivity is due to a conversion from a saturable high affinity kinetic profile to low affinity and high capacity uptake kinetics. Mutation of the corresponding glutamine residue (Q53H) also suppresses an inactive mutant of the archaeal Archaeoglobus fulgidus AfAmt-2, demonstrating the conservation of these mechanisms from archaea to higher plants. The DL1 (Δmep1, Δmep2, Δmep3, and Δgap1) yeast strain (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was transformed using LiAc (27Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar) and selected on solid YNB (minimal yeast medium without nitrogen; 233520, Difco) supplemented with 3% glucose and 1 mm arginine. For growth assays, cells were precultured in liquid YNB supplemented with 3% glucose and 0.5 mm arginine until the stationary phase (overnight to 24 h) and diluted 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, and 10−4 in water, and 5 μl of cell suspension from each dilution were spotted on solid YNB, either buffered with 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.2, and supplemented with either NH4Cl or (NH4+)2SO4 for ammonium growth complementation assays or buffered with 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.5, and supplemented with 0.1% proline and 5 mm methylammonium for methylammonium sensitivity assays. Experiments shown in Fig. 6 (A and B) were performed in YNB medium buffered with 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.4, 3% glucose, and 100 mm KCl with varying NH4Cl concentrations. After 3 or 4 days of incubation at 30 °C, cell growth was documented by scanning the plate at 600 dpi in grayscale mode. For [14C]methylammonium and 15N-labeled ammonium uptake, yeast cells were grown in YNB supplemented with 3% glucose and 1 mm l-arginine. Cells were harvested at an A600 of 0.6–0.8, washed, and resuspended in 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 to a final A600 of 8 for [14C]methylammonium uptake assays; or in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, to a final A600 of 13.5 for 15N-ammonium uptake assays. Methylammonium uptake assays were conducted with 100 μm of [14C]-labeled methylammonium (Amersham Biosciences) as described (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For 15N-labeled ammonium uptake assays, 800 μl of cells kept on ice were supplemented with 100 μl of 6% glucose in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, and preincubated for 12 min at 30 °C. To start the reaction, 900 μl of prewarmed (30 °C) solution containing 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, 40 mm ammonium chloride (20 mm 14N-ammonium chloride plus 20 mm 15N-ammonium chloride labeled at 99 atom %; Icon Isotopes) were added (final concentration of 20 mm NH4Cl). Cells were incubated in a shaker at 30 °C for 6 min. Cells were immediately transferred on ice for 20 s and then centrifuged for 20 s to pellet the cells and to discard the tracer solution. Cells were washed 3× in 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, followed by 20 s of centrifugation for each wash. After the last wash, cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Cells were dried at 65 °C for 72 h. For each sample, the complete cell pellet was used for 15N determination by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (12Loqué D. Yuan L. Kojima S. Gojon A. Wirth J. Gazzarrini S. Ishiyama K. Takahashi H. von Wirén N. Plant J. 2006; 48: 522-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For electrophysiological analyses, the cDNAs of AMT1;1 and the mutant AMT1;1-Q57H were cloned into the pOO2 cloning vector (28Ludewig U. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After linearization of the plasmid with BbrP1 (Roche), capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Xenopus laevis oocytes were obtained by surgery, manually dissected, and defolliculated with collagenase (Sigma). Oocytes, stage V and VI, were injected with 50 nl of water or cRNA (36 ng/oocyte). The cells were kept at 16 °C in ND96 medium containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing gentamycin (50 μg/μl) and pyruvate. The electrical activity induced by AMT1;1 or AMT1;1-Q57H was recorded 4–6 days after cRNA injection by two-electrode voltage-clamping, using a Geneclamp 500B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) connected to a Compaq 486 computer through the digital analog converter Digidata 1200A (Molecular Devices). Voltage protocols and data acquisition were controlled by the Clampex and Clampfit programs included in the pClamp 6 software package (Molecular Devices). Borosilicate microelectrodes (P1174, Sigma) were filled with 1 m KCl with a tip resistance of 0.5–3 MΩ. Oocytes were bathed with a standard solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris/Mes, pH 7.0, with the osmolality adjusted to 240–260 mosmol/kg using d-sorbitol; the bath solution was maintained at a constant flow of 5 ml min−1. When the membrane potential read by the voltage and current electrodes was the same and stable for >2 min, experiments were started. For all measurements, oocytes were clamped at their resting membrane potential (between −110 and −120 mV). The currents carried either by AMT1;1 or AMT1;1-Q57H were activated by the inclusion of NH4Cl or different alkali cations in the standard solution. Experiments were performed on several oocytes from different donors for each condition. The data presented are the mean ± S.D. from a number (n) of independent experimental observations. A suppressor screen compensating for a defective cytosolic C terminus (CCT) (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) identified five residues in the pore region (TMH I and III) located within a range of ∼5 Å in the crystal structure. The mutations reactivate the nonfunctional AMT1;1-T460D mutant version of AMT1;1 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1) (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The indispensable domain of ∼20 amino acids of the CCT comprising the intra- and inter-trans-interaction domains are highly conserved throughout the plant/fungal clade of AMTs (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To characterize the properties of the suppressor mutants in detail, all five mutations (supplemental Table S1) were introduced into wild type AMT1;1 with an intact C terminus and expressed in a yeast strain lacking all three AMT homologs (DL1 (Δmep1, Δmep2, Δmep3, and Δgap1)). DL1 is unable to grow on media containing moderate ammonium levels. All five mutants restored growth on low levels of ammonium (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2.Mutation of Q57H or A138P in AMT1;1 increases NH4+ toxicity. Growth assays of DL1 expressing AMT1;1 mutants were performed on YNB with NH4Cl or (NH4)2SO4 and recorded after 3 days. Experiments were repeated at least three times independently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In standard yeast media, wild type yeast tolerates extraordinarily high ammonium levels (at least up to 1 m). Surprisingly, yeast expressing AMT1;1-Q57H or AMT1;1-A138P were sensitive to 20 mm ammonium; an effect that became more severe at higher concentrations (Fig. 2). To test whether toxicity was caused by increased permeability for ammonium or chloride ions, the growth assay was performed using ammonium sulfate (Fig. 2). Ammonium sulfate had a comparable effect as ammonium chloride. The ability to mediate growth on low ammonium levels suggests that ammonium sensitivity is due to an increased uptake capacity for ammonium. Consistent with an increase in ammonium transport capacity, both Q57H and A138P mutants mediated a >2-fold higher 15N-ammonium uptake compared with wild type (supplemental Fig. 1). Because AMT1;1 also transports the ammonium analog MeA, MeA toxicity was tested using growth assays (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, cells expressing the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant showed decreased MeA sensitivity compared with wild type, as did AMT1;1-F60S, whereas cells expressing AMT1;1-A138P were as sensitive as AMT1;1. AMT1;1-F60S mediated the highest MeA tolerance, followed by AMT1;1-P168T, -Q57H, and -A137P; weak tolerance was also observed in the case of AMT1;1-G95D. It thus seems possible to separate the capacity of ammonium and MeA transport by mutation of residues in TMH I–IV. Uptake assays with [14C]MeA demonstrated that AMT1;1-Q57H had reduced MeA uptake capacity (Fig. 3B). Because the selectivity of the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant (in AMT1;1 with a wild type C terminus) was altered and because Rh family homologs of AMTs were shown to transport uncharged ammonia (29Ludewig U. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the AMT1;1-Q57H mutation induces a change from the strict transport of ammonium ions to the transport of ammonia. To test electrogenicity of the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant, currents activated by extracellular ammonium in Xenopus oocytes were measured. The AMT1;1-Q57H mutant was electrogenic, and currents elicited by 1 mm ammonium in the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant were ∼10× larger compared with currents recorded for AMT1;1 (Fig. 4A). Fitting of the currents carried by AMT1;1 to Michaelis-Menten kinetics yielded a Km value for ammonium of 34 μm and a Vmax of 33 nA, (Fig. 4A, n = 13). Currents induced by ammonium in oocytes expressing AMT1;1-Q57H did not saturate within the range of ammonium levels that could be tested. When force fitted to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the calculated Km was 2,232 μm with a Vmax of 365 nA (n = 13). Due to endogenous currents induced by high ammonium in untransfected oocytes (30Burckhardt B.C. Burckhardt G. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 434: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it was not possible to assess activities at NH4+ concentrations higher than 5 mm; thus, it remains open whether or not the mutant behaves as a channel. The currents were specific to ammonium because other monovalent cations including potassium, lithium, rubidium, and sodium did not elicit currents above background (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the pH independence of the currents, which had been observed for AMT1;1 (28Ludewig U. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), is retained for the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant (supplemental Fig. 2). As expected from the yeast experiments (Fig. 3B), MeA elicited significantly lower currents as compared with ammonium in oocytes expressing the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant (Fig. 4C). Application of voltage ramps to oocytes expressing the AMT1;1 or AMT1;1-Q57H exposed to different extracellular ammonium concentrations yielded larger shifts in the reversal potential Er toward more positive potentials with increasing ammonium concentrations, further supporting the notion that AMT1;1-Q57H is more permeable to ammonium (Fig. 5). Associated with the changes in Er, larger inward currents were recorded for AMT1;1-Q57H at all ammonium concentrations (Fig. 5). The results demonstrate that a single nucleotide change in AMT1;1 resulting in a single amino acid change modulates the pore structure resulting in increased selectivity and reduced affinity toward ammonium. The amplitude and nonsaturated currents in AMT1;1-Q57H, together with the significant changes in Er caused by ammonium, suggest that AMT1;1-Q57H operates as a channel. Attempts to record single channel activity from the membrane of AMT1;1-Q57H-injected oocytes have not been successful. The extraordinary conservation of the C-terminal domain between bacteria, fungi, and plants and the structural evidence for an interaction of the C terminus with the loops of the neighboring subunit suggest that the allosteric regulatory mechanism is evolutionary highly conserved (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To test for dominant interactions of subunits in the archaeal homologs, the Archaeoglobus AfAmt-1, -2, and -3 homologs were expressed in the yeast ammonium transport mutant DL1. After 4 days, only AfAmt-2 was able to confer the ability to grow on low ammonium to the yeast strain DL1 (Fig. 6A). To test whether the conserved C terminus of AfAmt-2 is also required for transport function, point mutations and deletions were introduced into the C terminus of AfAmt-2. AfAmt-2-I440* (deletion of the C-terminal 29 amino acids after position 440 in AfAmt-2) lacks the highly conserved part of the C terminus AfAmt-2-G437D carries a mutation leading to exchange of the highly conserved glycine to aspartate (Gly-456 in the Arabidopsis AMT1;1); and AfAmt-2-A441D is equivalent to the Arabidopsis AMT1;1-T460D mutation (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). All three mutants lost their ability to transport ammonium (Fig. 6B). To identify suppressor mutants able to reactivate the AfAmt-2-I440* mutant, a multicopy suppressor screen was performed (similar as in Ref. 25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Twenty-one suppressor mutants were isolated and sequenced (Table 1). All variants carried mutations affecting residue Gln-53 of AfAmt-2 (Q53H, Q53E, and Q53K). Gln-53 in AfAmt-2 corresponds to residue Gln-57 in AMT1;1, and all three suppressor mutations (Q53H, Q53E, and Q53K) obtained are identical to the ones found in the suppressor screen using the defective AMT1;1-T460A (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing AfAmt-2-Q53H-I440* were able to grow on low ammonium concentrations (0.5 and 2 mm) but were sensitive to NH4+ concentrations above 100 mm (Fig. 6C).TABLE 1Suppressor screen in yeast expressing AfAmt-2-I440stop. DL1 expressing AfAmt-2-I440stop was incubated on YNB supplemented with 2 mm NH4Cl at 28 °C for 14 days. Plasmids were isolated from 21 independent suppressors. The data represent the sequencing results of 21 independent AfAmt-2-I440stop suppressors.MutationCodonsNo.Q53HCAT4Q53HCAC7Q53EGAG6Q53KAAG4Total21 Open table in a new tab A careful analysis of AMT1 ammonium transporter mutants had revealed a novel allosteric regulatory mechanism, in which the C-terminal domain (CCT) is responsible for allosteric regulation of the activity of the three pores in the trimeric complex (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When expressed in yeast (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and oocytes (31Neuhäuser B. Dynowski M. Mayer M. Ludewig U. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), plant AMT requires a productive interaction of the subunits via the CCT; otherwise, all three pores of the trimer are closed. Certain mutations in the pore can relieve the complex from inactivation even when the trans-activating C terminus is deleted (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Among the 9 suppressors identified from the AMT1;1-T460A suppressor screen, at least one variant, Q57H, showed significantly higher ammonium transport activity, compared with the wild type, as evidenced by elevated ammonium sensitivity, elevated uptake rates, and increased conductance measured by two-electrode voltage clamping. The kinetics changed from saturable with a Km of 30 μm in AMT1;1 to nonsaturable in case of the mutant AMT1;1-Q57H, characterized by at least 10× higher maximal currents. The finding that a mutation in the pore region leads to dramatically increased conductance suggests that the protein is normally kept in a “restricted state.” The findings here supports the notion that the actual substrate of both AMT1;1 and the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant is NH4+. This is further supported by the pH independence of the mutant transporter even when Vmax is massively increased. It is thus conceivable that AMTs have a gate that is defective in the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant. One may also hypothesize that the mutation leads to a conversion from a transporter to a channel mode. Analysis of the ClC family of chloride transporters/channels had suggested a continuum between transporters and channels (22Miller C. Nguitragool W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An alternative might be that the protein has two gates that need to be coordinated to produce saturable transport and that the coordination between the gates is defective in the AMT1;1-Q57H mutant (32Gouaux E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data presented here show that AMTs can exist in multiple states. For a full understanding of AMT function and regulation, it will be important to obtain crystal structures of the different states as recently achieved for the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT (32Gouaux E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the selectivity of the Q57H mutant also changed with a dramatic increase in the selectivity for ammonium over methylammonium. It would be interesting to test whether the mutations of Phe-215 and Trp-212 in the pore of EcAmt-B, which show reduced methylammonium transport activity lead to increased ammonium conductivity (33Javelle A. Lupo D. Ripoche P. Fulford T. Merrick M. Winkler F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5040-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The extreme conservation of the CCT even in cyanobacteria and archaebacteria has been surprising (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The data shown here demonstrate that the CCT of the Archaeoglobus AfAmt-2 homolog also functions as a trans-activation domain. Interestingly, defects in the C-terminal trans-activation domain are suppressed specifically by mutations leading to Q53H, Q53E, or Q53K. Gln-53 in AfAmt-2 corresponds to Gln-57 in the Arabidopsis AMT1;1. These findings suggest that the allosteric regulatory mechanism originated early in evolution and has been perfectly retained. It thus appears that selective pressure on maintaining the allosteric regulation has persisted and still operates in bacterial fungi and higher plants. So far, we have not been able to identify a transporter lacking the CCT. Possibly, the regulatory function of the CCT is crucial for survival, because even single nucleotide mutations in residues corresponding to the pore, specifically Q57H, Q57E or Q57K, F60S, I136P, A137P, A137S or A137D, or A138P render the transport activity independent of allosteric trans-activation by the C-terminal trans-activation domain; thus, the C terminus should be free to evolve once a mutation leading to the modifications of at least one of the five residues Gln-57, Phe-60, Ile-136, Ala-137, or Ala-138 in the pore has occurred. Alternatively, the C terminus could play a crucial role in linking the transporter to nitrogen regulation, as in the case of the Escherichia coli AMTB, which binds a PII-like protein, GlnK, connecting it to a signaling cascade that controls gene expression (34Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Tremblay P.L. Hallenbeck P.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GlnK binds α-ketoglutarate and ATP/ADP and thus integrates carbon availability and energy status to control ammonium uptake (36Berg J. Hung Y.P. Yellen G. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the only plant PII identified so far localizes to the chloroplast and thus does not appear to be available to interact with the plasma membrane AMTs (37Hsieh M.H.

It will be important to identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of the plant AMTs to determine whether a similar signaling mechanism using a different set of interactors exists in plants, which plays a role in signaling or metabolic integration. Phosphoproteomic studies had shown that the CCT contains an unconventional kinase recognition motif in a surface-exposed loop in the hinge region between intra- and intermolecular interaction domains (25Loqué D. Lalonde S. Looger L.L. von Wirén N. Frommer W.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The conserved residue Thr-460, which is essential for functionality of plant AMTs, was found to be phosphorylated in Arabidopsis cell cultures grown in high ammonium (39Nühse T.S. Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Peck S.C. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Using a phospho-specific antiserum, we detected phosphorylation of AMT1-T460 in Arabidopsis roots by ammonium in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, thus linking extracellular ammonium levels to transport activity.7 Feedback inhibition of ammonium uptake by ammonium could explain the observation that plants pregrown on different levels of ammonium show a negative correlation between the ammonium levels in preculture and the uptake capacity (5Wang M.Y. Glass A. Shaff J.E. Kochian L.V. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To date, crystal structures of the Arabidopsis AMT1;1 and AfAmt-2 proteins are not available; thus, it is not yet possible to define the exact surroundings of the residues identified through suppressor mutants. However, three high-resolution crystal structures of Amt family members (E. coli Amt-B, A. fulgidus Amt-1, and Nitrosomonas europaea Rh50) show striking structural conservation. Amino acid sequence alignments in combination with secondary structure predictions allow tentative localization of the residues in AMT1;1 and AfAmt-2 (supplemental Fig. 3). AMT1;1 shows the highest amino acid sequence identity with AfAmt-1 (36%) and AfAmt-2 (34%) and the lowest with NeRh50 (17 and 13%, respectively). The residue corresponding to Gln-57 (AMT1;1) and Gln-53 (AfAmt-2) is Val-20 of AfAmt-1; Thr-100 corresponds to Ala-138 (AMT1;1). Both residues are located in close proximity of each other in TMH I and III, approximately in the middle of the membrane (supplemental Fig. 4). TMH I and III contribute to the predicted ammonium transport pathway of the pore. Interactions of residues Val-20 and Thr-100 with the rest of the protein are restricted to the neighboring amino acid residues from THM I, II, and III (supplemental Fig. 4). Furthermore, Ala-138 of the Arabidopsis AMT1 is located in the vicinity of the phenylalanine residue Phe-134, which is thought to form a gate for substrate transport (Phe-96 in AfAmt-1). Previous studies on EcAmt-B had shown that double point mutations of these two phenylalanine residues to alanine, despite yielding a visibly open pore, result in reduced MeA transport activity (33Javelle A. Lupo D. Ripoche P. Fulford T. Merrick M. Winkler F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5040-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether the mutations also lead to increased ammonium transport. AMTs appear to be kept in a restricted state that allows for high affinity/low capacity ammonium uptake. Mutations in residues corresponding to the pore region, mainly below the phenylalanine gate, can relieve this “restriction” and allow for high capacity transport. These mutations also overcome the dependence on allosteric trans-activation by the C terminus, thus linking gating to allosteric control, potentially to protect against ammonium toxicity. Crystal structures of AMTs and mutants in different states will be invaluable tools for unraveling the transport mechanism of this important class of transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2162168106,"Apoptotic caspases, such as caspase-7, are stored as inactive protease zymogens, and when activated, lead to a fate-determining switch to induce cell death. We previously discovered small molecule thiol-containing inhibitors that when tethered revealed an allosteric site and trapped a conformation similar to the zymogen form of the enzyme. We noted three structural transitions that the compounds induced: (i) breaking of an interaction between Tyr-223 and Arg-187 in the allosteric site, which prevents proper ordering of the catalytic cysteine; (ii) pinning the L2' loop over the allosteric site, which blocks critical interactions for proper ordering of the substrate-binding groove; and (iii) a hinge-like rotation at Gly-188 positioned after the catalytic Cys-186 and Arg-187. Here we report a systematic mutational analysis of these regions to dissect their functional importance to mediate the allosteric transition induced by these compounds. Mutating the hinge Gly-188 to the restrictive proline causes a massive approximately 6000-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency. Mutations in the Arg-187-Tyr-223 couple have a far less dramatic effect (3-20-fold reductions). Interestingly, although the allosteric couple mutants still allow binding and allosteric inhibition, they partially relieve the mutual exclusivity of binding between inhibitors at the active and allosteric sites. These data highlight a small set of residues critical for mediating the transition from active to inactive zymogen-like states."

The mammalian PKD family consists of three isoforms, PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3; of these PKD1 and PKD2 contain PDZ-binding motifs at their carboxyl termini. Here we show that membrane-localized NHERF scaffold proteins provide a nexus for tightly controlled PKD signaling via a PDZ domain interaction.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The PKD family consists of three members belonging to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase group of serine/threonine protein kinases. Each isoform contains a conserved catalytic core and an amino-terminal regulatory moiety. This regulatory region contains two cysteine-rich (C1) domains and a pleckstrin homology domain that autoinhibits the kinase (2.Rykx A. De Kimpe L. Mikhalap S. Vantus T. Seufferlein T. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The C1 domains are membrane-targeting modules that bind diacylglycerol (DAG) and its functional analogues, phorbol esters, thus recruiting PKD to membranes (3.Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The PKD1 and PKD2 isoforms additionally contain PDZ-binding motifs at their carboxyl termini that can target the kinases to distinct subcellular scaffolds through interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins (4.Sánchez-Ruiloba L. Cabrera-Poch N. Rodríguez-Martínez M. López-Menéndez C. Jean-Mairet R.M. Higuero A.M. Iglesias T. J. Biol.

PKD transduces signals downstream of the second messenger DAG. In addition to membrane recruitment by DAG, activation of PKD requires phosphorylation by novel protein kinase C (PKC) family members at two sites within its catalytic core (5.Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6.Rozengurt E. Rey O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The novel PKCs themselves contain C1 domains and are allosterically activated by DAG-mediated membrane binding; thus, DAG production leads to PKD activation through coincident activation of the novel PKCs and localization of PKD near its upstream kinases. Hence, activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors (such as certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases) results in the production of second messengers including DAG, and this leads to recruitment and activation of the novel PKCs and thus also PKD. PDZ (PSD-95, Discs large, ZO-1) domains are compact, globular structures of ∼90 residues, occurring in one or multiple copies within a protein, that mediate protein-protein interactions (7.Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). These interactions occur via binding to other PDZ domains or, more commonly, by recognition of short amino acid motifs in the carboxyl termini of target proteins commonly terminating in a hydrophobic residue (8.Stiffler M.A. Chen J.R. Grantcharova V.P. Lei Y. Fuchs D. Allen J.E. Zaslavskaia L.A. MacBeath G. Science. 2007; 317: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the case of PKD1 and PKD2, the last four amino acids are VSIL and ISVL, respectively. Here we identify Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF-1) as a PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts with the PDZ-binding motif of both PKD1 and PKD2. NHERF-1 was originally cloned as a critical protein component for the inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 by protein kinase A (9.Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). NHERF-1 is 52% identical to NHERF-2, a family member with which it shares the conserved domain structure of two PDZ domains followed by an ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding region (10.Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Parallel studies demonstrating its ability to strongly interact with ezrin independently identified NHERF-1 as ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (11.Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Via this ERM-binding region, NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 are predominantly localized near the actin cytoskeleton, thus poising them near the plasma membrane where they function as scaffolds. Since these original cloning reports, numerous studies have identified over 30 binding partners of these scaffold proteins including GPCRs, tyrosine kinase receptors, other adaptor proteins, signaling enzymes, and ion channels (12.Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiology. 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Weinman E.J. Hall R.A. Friedman P.A. Liu-Chen L.Y. Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here we identify PKD1 and PKD2 as NHERF-1-interacting proteins. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay to assess molecular proximity, both PKD1 and PKD2 are shown to transiently associate with NHERF-1 following PKD activation. Furthermore, through use of genetically encoded reporters for PKD activity, we show a unique signature of PKD activation at the NHERF scaffold. Specifically, signaling is more tightly regulated at the scaffold than in the cytosol or bulk plasma membrane. Phosphatase activity is higher at NHERF than at the plasma membrane, resulting in a more rapidly reversible PKD response at the scaffold, and following an agonist-evoked response, PKD signaling is prolonged compared with the length of response in the cytosol. Our data identify NHERF-1 as a novel nexus of PKD signaling and raise the possibility that PKD may act as a novel regulator of proteins at the NHERF scaffold.

DNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal (CT) 25 amino acids of PKD1 or PKD2 was ligated into the pGEX-6P-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate an in-frame fusion to GST. DKAR has been described previously (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

All of the CFP and YFP DNA utilized were the monomeric versions harboring the A206K mutations (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The membrane-targeted CFP (MyrPalmCFP) was described previously (15.Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the last 10 amino acids of PHLPP2 (17.Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) was fused in-frame to CFP, DKAR, and δCKAR to create CFP-PDZ, DKAR-PDZ, and δCKAR-PDZ, respectively. FLAG-NHERF-1 was used in overexpression studies and has been described previously (18.Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CFP-NHERF-1 was generated by subcloning NHERF-1 DNA into a plasmid containing monomeric CFP, resulting in an in-frame fusion to the amino terminus of NHERF-1. mCherry-NHERF-1 was generated by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) into a Gateway destination vector for NH2-terminal fusion of monomeric Cherry (mCherry) (19.Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). YFP was ligated to PKD1 and PKD2 to create amino-terminally tagged PKD1 and PKD2 (YFP-PKD1 and YFP-PKD2, respectively). YFP-PKD2ΔPDZ was generated by deleting the last three amino acids of PKD2 within YFP-PKD2 following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Expression of GST, GST-PKD1-CT, and GST-PKD2-CT was induced for 4 h with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli. Pelleted cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, containing 300 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 nm benzamidine, 500 ng ml−1 leupeptin, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme and rocked for 30 min at 4 °C followed by brief bath sonication. The lysate was treated with 100 μg ml−1 DNase and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified from the lysate using the Profinia Protein Purification System according to the manufacturer's specifications (Bio-Rad). The eluted, purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. Membranes containing 96 putative PDZ domains were prepared as described (20.Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 1 mg ml−1 of purified GST, GST-PKD1-CT, or GST-PKD2-CT fusion protein was overlaid onto the array and detected by far Western blotting as described previously (18.Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were plated onto sterilized glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes prior to transfection. Transient transfection of 1 μg of DNA was carried out using Effectene (Qiagen) for MDCK cells and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) for HeLa cells. For translocation experiments, 0.1 μg of MyrPalmCFP or CFP-NHERF-1 DNA was used in transient transfections. The cells were imaged within 24 h following transfection. The cells were washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Cellgro) and imaged in Hanks' balanced salt solution in the dark at room temperature. The cells were stimulated with 200 nm PDBu, 10 μm histamine, 250 nm Gö 6976, or 500 nm Gö 6983 where indicated. CFP, YFP, and FRET images were acquired and analyzed as described (21.Kunkel M.T. Ni Q. Tsien R.Y. Zhang J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5581-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). mCherry was visualized through a 560/25-nm excitation filter, a 593-nm dichroic mirror, and a 629/53-nm emission filter. HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluency in 60-mm dishes and then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 20 nm control or NHERF-1 SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon). 48 h post-transfection the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then treated for the indicated times with 10 μm histamine at room temperature. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 (supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm microcystin) and cleared by a high speed spin. The cleared lysates were analyzed by Western blotting to determine the relative amount of NHERF-1, phosphorylated PKD substrates, and actin. The Western blots were developed using chemiluminescence and quantified using Image J (National Institutes of Health). The last four amino acids of both PKD1 and PKD2 (VSIL and ISVL, respectively) comprise a PDZ-binding motif. To identify PDZ domains with which these kinases could interact, a GST fusion protein of the last 25 residues of either PKD1 or PKD2 was overlaid onto a membrane array spotted with 96 unique PDZ domains (20.Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Binding was detected with GST antibodies. Fig. 1 shows that the PDZ-binding motifs of both PKD1 and PKD2 interact with the first PDZ domain of NHERF-1 (spot B3, NHERF-1 PDZ1). In addition, the PDZ-binding motif of PKD2 bound the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI-3 (spot B2, MAGI-3 PDZ5). No detectable binding was observed when GST alone was overlaid on the array (data not shown). Having identified interactions of the isolated PDZ-binding motifs of PKD1 and PKD2 with NHERF-1, we next addressed whether the full-length proteins could interact in cells. We focused on examining potential cellular associations between the PKD isoforms and NHERF-1 using FRET (Fig. 2A) rather than traditional biochemical approaches, for the following reasons: 1) PDZ domain interactions with PDZ-binding motifs are often weak in nature (22.Chen J.R. Chang B.H. Allen J.E. Stiffler M.A. MacBeath G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and 2) the serines within the PDZ-binding motifs of both PKD1 and PKD2 (VSIL and ISVL of PKD1 and PKD2, respectively) are known to become phosphorylated following PKD activation, which would likely destroy the PDZ-binding motifs and further contribute to the transient nature of PKD/NHERF-1 interactions. Because FRET is measured in real time and only occurs when the fluorophores (CFP and YFP in this instance) are within 10 nm of each other, the use of FRET is ideal for allowing the visualization of transient cellular interactions between proteins (23.Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). CFP-NHERF-1 was co-expressed with either YFP-PKD1 or YFP-PKD2 in MDCK cells, and the change in FRET (plotted as FRET/CFP) was monitored over time following stimulation of the PKD pathway. The data in Fig. 2 (B and C) show that PDBu caused a robust increase in the FRET/CFP ratio for PKD1 and PKD2, revealing translocation of both isoforms to NHERF-1. Phorbol ester-triggered translocation was rapid and transient, peaking within 1 min and then decaying with a half-life of approximately 2 min. This decay of the signal may reflect autophosphorylation at the serine within the PDZ-binding motif of each kinase, because this autophosphorylation event is known to occur with similar kinetics (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6733-6742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FRET between the PKDs and NHERF-1 decreased to levels below the original base line, suggesting that there was some PKD pre-associated with NHERF-1 prior to PDBu treatment. To verify that this association was dependent on the PDZ-binding motif of the kinase, we generated YFP-PKD2 with its PDZ-binding motif deleted (YFP-PKD2ΔPDZ). No significant changes in FRET were observed following PDBu treatment in cells co-expressing YFP-PKD2ΔPDZ and CFP-NHERF-1 (Fig. 2C, open diamonds). Importantly, all YFP kinase proteins translocated to and remained at the plasma membrane over the same time frame in FRET experiments using MyrPalmCFP as the FRET donor (Fig. 2, D and E). We next visualized the co-localization of PKD2 and NHERF-1 in cells by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 2F shows that the CFP-NHERF-1 signal is localized to apical membranes in MDCK cells, as described previously (24.Georgescu M.M. Morales F.C. Molina J.R. Hayashi Y. Curr. Mol. Med. 2008; 8: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and remains relatively stable over the course of the experiment (left column). In contrast, YFP-PKD2 is present in the cytosol prior to PDBu addition (Fig. 2F, middle column, top panel) and is predominantly at membranes bound to PDBu by the end of the experiment (Fig. 2F, middle column, bottom panel). In support of the FRET data, a high degree of co-localization is apparent after 1 min of PDBu treatment, i.e. when maximal FRET is observed in Fig. 2C (Fig. 2F, middle column, middle panel). This co-localization is further revealed by the yellow signal in the merged images on the right column of Fig. 2F. To explore whether the interaction of the PDZ-binding motifs of PKD1 and PKD2 with NHERF coordinates PKD signaling at NHERF scaffolds in cells, we took advantage of a genetically encoded PKD activity reporter, D kinase activity reporter (DKAR) (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6733-6742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), to examine PKD activity at the scaffold. DKAR consists of the FRET pair mCFP (monomeric cyan fluorescent protein) and mYFP (the monomeric version of the yellow fluorescent protein citrine (25.Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar)) flanking an FHA2 phosphothreonine-binding domain and a consensus PKD phosphorylation sequence. Phosphorylation of the substrate sequence triggers an intramolecular clamp with the phosphopeptide-binding domain, leading to a change in FRET (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6733-6742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both PKD1 and PKD2 efficiently phosphorylate DKAR and induce a change in FRET (data not shown). Because it is a genetically encoded reporter, DKAR can be effectively targeted to distinct subcellular compartments by the addition of short targeting sequences (26.Gallegos L.L. Kunkel M.T.

Thus, to poise DKAR at the NHERF scaffold to assess localized PKD activity, we designed a reporter with a PDZ-binding motif that would target to NHERF but not necessarily compete with, and potentially disrupt, the interaction of endogenous PKD1 or PKD2 with NHERF-1. To this end, we chose a distinct PDZ-binding motif from the phosphatase PHLPP2 (17.Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) that interacts with both the first and second PDZ domain of NHERF-1 and both PDZ domains of the interacting NHERF-2 (data not shown). To test whether this PDZ-binding motif (which comprises the sequence DTAL) targets to NHERF-1, we expressed a construct of CFP fused to the carboxyl-terminal 10 residues of PHLPP2 in MDCK cells and imaged its localization. Expression of this CFP-PDZ fusion protein alone revealed diffuse cellular staining (Fig. 3A), consistent with no specific targeting. In contrast, co-expression with mCherry-NHERF-1 (Fig. 3B) revealed significant localization of CFP-PDZ to mCherry-NHERF-1 at apical membranes where the NHERF scaffold localizes (24.Georgescu M.M. Morales F.C. Molina J.R. Hayashi Y. Curr. Mol. Med. 2008; 8: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Having identified a PDZ-binding motif distinct from that of PKD1 or PKD2 that targets to NHERF-1, we fused this motif onto DKAR to generate DKAR-PDZ. MDCK cells overexpressing DKAR or DKAR-PDZ with or without overexpression of NHERF-1 were analyzed following stimulation with the phorbol ester PDBu, and the ratio of cyan to yellow emission (FRET ratio) was monitored. The FRET ratio from DKAR (Fig. 4, open circles) and DKAR-PDZ (Fig. 4, open diamonds) increased to similar levels following PDBu treatment. Overexpression of the untargeted DKAR and NHERF-1 gave a similar response (Fig. 4, filled circles). However, co-expression of DKAR-PDZ and NHERF-1 resulted in a significantly enhanced FRET ratio change following PKD activation with PDBu (Fig. 4, filled diamonds); the amplitude of the FRET change increased 2.5-fold. Interestingly, the fluorescent signal from DKAR-PDZ with NHERF-1 overexpressed showed modest, if any, membrane localization (data not shown); however, the increased PKD activity reported by DKAR-PDZ in cells overexpressing NHERF-1 reveals relocalization of the reporter to the scaffold. Note that it is possible that the PDZ ligand on DKAR-PDZ competes some of the endogenous PKD from NHERF-1; however, given the robust and unique DKAR signature at the NHERF scaffold, it is clear that there is sufficient localized PKD to catalyze readily detectable phosphorylation of the reporter poised at NHERF. If anything, the reporter might under-report the true magnitude of PKD activity at the scaffold. Although DKAR-PDZ is not dramatically relocalized when NHERF-1 is co-expressed, the increased PKD activity observed from the reporter in this context could reflect membrane association, because NHERF-1 is predominantly membrane-associated. To verify that the change in the FRET ratio reflected PKD activity at NHERF-1 as opposed to PKD activity at the plasma membrane, we compared the DKAR signal for reporter scaffolded to NHERF-1 compared with reporter scaffolded to general plasma membrane. Plasma membrane targeting was achieved by the addition of the seven amino-terminal residues derived from Lyn kinase that encode for the myristoylation and palmitoylation of DKAR (MyrPalmDKAR) (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Treatment of MDCK cells co-expressing MyrPalmDKAR and NHERF-1 (Fig. 5A, filled squares) with PDBu resulted in an almost 2-fold reduction in the amplitude of the FRET ratio change compared with MDCK cells co-expressing DKAR-PDZ with NHERF-1 (Fig. 5A, filled diamonds). Interestingly, expression of MyrPalmDKAR alone, in the absence of NHERF-1 overexpression, resulted in a significant increase in DKAR phosphorylation, suggesting that the scaffold sequestered PKD to NHERF-1 and away from MyrPalmDKAR. These data reveal increased PKD activity at NHERF scaffolds relative to activity at the plasma membrane under conditions where the NHERF-1 protein is overexpressed. DKAR phosphorylation is reversible, allowing the reporter to read both PKD activation and deactivation (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6733-6742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To further explore differences in the signature of PKD activity at the NHERF scaffold compared with the plasma membrane, we treated actively signaling cells with the PKD inhibitor Gö 6976 to monitor the rate of DKAR dephosphorylation, in the context of PKD inactivation. Cells expressing DKAR-PDZ with NHERF-1, MyrPalmDKAR with NHERF-1, or MyrPalmDKAR alone were treated with PDBu for 15 min to allow DKAR phosphorylation to plateau, and then cells were treated with the PKD inhibitor. The graph in Fig. 5B shows that inhibition of PKD resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of DKAR-PDZ (filled diamonds) compared with the slow dephosphorylation of MyrPalmDKAR (squares). Thus, the local phosphatase environment around DKAR-PDZ poised at NHERF-1 is relatively high and distinct from the low level of phosphatase activity at the plasma membrane. This distinct response from MyrPalmDKAR indicates that DKAR-PDZ is in fact poised at the NHERF-1 scaffold, and its activity is not simply reflecting PKD signaling at the general plasma membrane. Having established that PKD activity is enriched at NHERF-1 using the potent PKD activator PDBu, we next explored PKD signaling at the scaffold following stimulation of endogenous signaling pathways. Histamine has been shown to activate G protein-coupled receptors in HeLa cells, resulting in the activation of numerous signaling molecules including PKD (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6733-6742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As described previously, the DKAR response to histamine in HeLa cells is rapid and begins to decay within 2 min (14.Kunkel M.T. Toker A. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6733-6742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we expressed DKAR or DKAR-PDZ in HeLa cells with or without NHERF-1 and activated PKD signaling via stimulation of endogenous histamine receptors. The response from DKAR with NHERF-1 or from DKAR-PDZ alone showed a similar transient profile as from DKAR alone (Fig. 6A). However, the FRET response observed from DKAR-PDZ following histamine treatment was significantly different when NHERF-1 was co-expressed; the phosphorylation of DKAR-PDZ was sustained and, additionally, reached a lower initial amplitude than the untargeted reporter (Fig. 6A, filled diamonds). This smaller but prolonged response reflects tight regulation of PKD phosphorylation at NHERF-1 because further PKD stimulation by PDBu did not significantly increase the FRET ratio change, and PKD inhibition by Gö 6976 did not reverse the FRET ratio beyond its base-line value (data not shown). To verify that the response from DKAR-PDZ with NHERF-1 to histamine was a readout of PKD activity at NHERF-1 as opposed to PKD activity at the plasma membrane, we again utilized MyrPalmDKAR and assessed signaling by PKD at plasma membranes. The FRET response from MyrPalmDKAR in HeLa cells treated with histamine displayed strikingly distinct kinetics from DKAR-PDZ at NHERF-1; the rate of phosphorylation was reduced 8-fold from a half-time of approximately 1 min at the scaffold (Fig. 6A, filled diamonds) to a half-time of ∼8 min at the plasma membrane (Fig. 6B, filled squares). In addition, the amplitude of the signal was 3-fold higher for MyrPalmDKAR compared with DKA"
https://openalex.org/W2043168267,"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a pivotal role in modulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, tissue organization and embryonic development. Earlier, we found that the endocytic adaptor disabled-2 (Dab2) could attenuate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by stabilizing Axin and preventing its translocation to the membrane. Recently, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) has been shown to interact with, and dephosphorylate Axin, leading to its destabilization. Here, we show that Dab2 functions upstream of PP1 to block the interaction between Axin and PP1, inhibiting Axin dephosphorylation and thereby stabilizing its expression, ultimately leading to inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin. We show that Dab2 acts as a competitive inhibitor of PP1 by binding to the same C-terminal domain of Axin. Both PP1 and Axin bind to the N-terminus of Dab2 and a Dab2 truncation mutant consisting of the N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain blocks PP1-Axin interactions and inhibits Wnt signaling. We confirm the inhibitory effect of Dab2 on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in zebrafish embryos, showing that its ectopic expression phenocopies Axin overexpression resulting in altered dorsoventral patterning. We conclude that Dab2 stabilizes Axin and attenuates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by preventing PP1 from binding Axin."
https://openalex.org/W1970023736,"Leukemogenesis requires two classes of mutations, one that promotes proliferation and one that blocks differentiation. The erythroleukemia induced by Friend virus is a multistage disease characterized by an early proliferative stage driven by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein, gp55, with Sf-Stk and the EpoR, and a late block to differentiation resulting from retroviral insertion in the Pu.1 locus. We demonstrate here that activation of Stat3 by Sf-Stk in the early stage of disease is essential for the progression of erythroleukemia in the presence of differentiation signals induced by the EpoR, but is dispensable in the late stages of the disease. Furthermore, we identify Pu.1 as a Stat3 target gene in the early stages of erythroleukemia development. Our results support a model whereby the activation of Stat3 in the early stage of disease plays a pivotal role in regulating differentiation through the upregulation of Pu.1, thus inhibiting differentiation and favoring the expansion of infected erythroblasts and enhancing the pool of progenitors available for the acquisition of additional mutations, including insertional activation of Pu.1, resulting in full leukemic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1972726121,"The pH and voltage-regulated Slo3 K(+) channel, a homologue of the Ca(2+)- and voltage-regulated Slo1 K(+) channel, is thought to be primarily expressed in sperm, but the properties of Slo3 studied in heterologous systems differ somewhat from the native sperm KSper pH-regulated current. There is the possibility that critical partners that regulate Slo3 function remain unidentified. The extensive amino acid identity between Slo3 and Slo1 suggests that auxiliary beta subunits regulating Slo1 channels might coassemble with and modulate Slo3 channels. Four distinct beta subunits composing the KCNMB family are known to regulate the function and expression of Slo1 Channels.To examine the ability of the KCNMB family of auxiliary beta subunits to regulate Slo3 function, we co-expressed Slo3 and each beta subunit in heterologous expression systems and investigated the functional consequences by electrophysiological and biochemical analyses. The beta4 subunit produced an 8-10 fold enhancement of Slo3 current expression in Xenopus oocytes and a similar enhancement of Slo3 surface expression as monitored by YFP-tagged Slo3 or biotin labeled Slo3. Neither beta1, beta2, nor beta3 mimicked the ability of beta4 to increase surface expression, although biochemical tests suggested that all four beta subunits are competent to coassemble with Slo3. Fluorescence microscopy from beta4 KO mice, in which an eGFP tag replaced the deleted exon, revealed that beta4 gene promoter is active in spermatocytes. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that beta4 and Slo3 exhibit comparable mRNA abundance in both testes and sperm.These results argue that, for native mouse Slo3 channels, the beta4 subunit must be considered as a potential interaction partner and, furthermore, that KCNMB subunits may have functions unrelated to regulation of the Slo1 alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2007434520,"Background Blood agar is used for the identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of many bacterial pathogens. In the developing world, microbiologists use human blood agar because of the high cost and inhospitable conditions for raising wool sheep or horses to supply blood. Many pathogens either fail to grow entirely or exhibit morphologies and hemolytic patterns on human blood agar that confound colony recognition. Furthermore, human blood can be hazardous to handle due to HIV and hepatitis [1], [2]. This study investigated whether blood from hair sheep, a hardy, low-maintenance variety of sheep adapted for hot climates, was suitable for routine clinical microbiology studies. Methods and Findings Hair sheep blood obtained by jugular venipuncture was anticoagulated by either manual defibrination or collection in human blood bank bags containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose. Trypticase soy 5% blood agar was made from both forms of hair sheep blood and commercial defibrinated wool sheep blood. Growth characteristics, colony morphologies, and hemolytic patterns of selected human pathogens, including several streptococcal species, were evaluated. Specialized identification tests, including CAMP test, reverse CAMP test, and satellite colony formation with Haemophilus influenzae and Abiotrophia defectiva were also performed. Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates prepared from the three blood types were compared in antibiotic susceptibility tests by disk diffusion and E-test. Conclusions The results of all studies showed that blood agar prepared from citrated hair sheep blood is suitable for microbiological tests used in routine identification and susceptibility profiling of human pathogens. The validation of citrated hair sheep blood eliminates the labor-intensive and equipment-requiring process of manual defibrination. Use of hair sheep blood, in lieu of human blood currently used by many developing world laboratories and as an alternative to cost-prohibitive commercial sheep blood, offers the opportunity to dramatically improve the safety and accuracy of laboratory diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria in resource-poor countries."
https://openalex.org/W1980877995,"The ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases and nucleolin are major contributors to malignant transformation. Recently we have found that cell-surface ErbB receptors interact with nucleolin via their cytoplasmic tail. Overexpression of ErbB1 and nucleolin leads to receptor phosphorylation, dimerization and anchorage independent growth.In the present study we explored the regions of nucleolin and ErbB responsible for their interaction. Using mutational analyses, we addressed the structure-function relationship of the interaction between ErbB1 and nucleolin. We identified the ErbB1 nuclear localization domain as nucleolin interacting region. This region is important for nucleolin-associated receptor activation. Notably, though the tyrosine kinase domain is important for nucleolin-associated receptor activation, it is not involved in nucleolin/ErbB interactions. In addition, we demonstrated that the 212 c-terminal portion of nucleolin is imperative for the interaction with ErbB1 and ErbB4. This region of nucleolin is sufficient to induce ErbB1 dimerization, phosphorylation and growth in soft agar.The oncogenic potential of ErbB depends on receptor levels and activation. Nucleolin affects ErbB dimerization and activation leading to enhanced cell growth. The C-terminal region of nucleolin and the ErbB1 NLS-domain mediate this interaction. Moreover, when the C-terminal 212 amino acids region of nucleolin is expressed with ErbB1, it can enhance anchorage independent cell growth. Taken together these results offer new insight into the role of ErbB1 and nucleolin interaction in malignant cells."

Of 21 single-Cys mutants engineered in the background of a functional YgfO devoid of Cys residues (C-less), only four are inactive or have marginal activity (H31C, N93C, E272C, D304C). The 4 residues are conserved throughout the family in TM1 (His-31), TM3 (Asn-93/Ser/Thr), TM8 (Glu-272), and putative TM9a (Asp-304/Asn/Glu). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis in wild-type background showed that H31N and H31Q have high activity and affinity for xanthine but H31Q recognizes novel purine bases and analogues, whereas H31C and H31L have impaired affinity for xanthine and analogues, and H31K or H31R impairs expression in the membrane. N93S and N93A are highly active but more promiscuous for recognition of analogues at the imidazole moiety of substrate, N93D has low activity, N93T has low affinity for xanthine or analogues, and N93Q or N93C is inactive. All mutants replacing Glu-272 or Asp-304, including E272D, E272Q, D304E, and D304N, are inactive, although expressed to high levels in the membrane. Finally, one of the 17 assayable single-Cys mutants, Q258C, was sensitive to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. The findings suggest that polar residues important for the function of YgfO cluster in TMs 1, 3, 8 and 9a."
https://openalex.org/W2045624202,"Background Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine contagious pleuropneumonia, is an important pathogen of swine throughout the world. It must rapidly overcome the innate pulmonary immune defenses of the pig to cause disease. To better understand this process, the objective of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed in a medium that mimics the lung environment early in the infection process. Methods and Principal Findings Since bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) contains innate immune and other components found in the lungs, we examined gene expression of a virulent serovar 1 strain of A. pleuropneumoniae after a 30 min exposure to BALF, using DNA microarrays and real-time PCR. The functional classes of genes found to be up-regulated most often in BALF were those encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism, especially anaerobic metabolism, and in cell envelope, DNA, and protein biosynthesis. Transcription of a number of known virulence genes including apxIVA and the gene for SapF, a protein which is involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides, was also up-regulated in BALF. Seventy-nine percent of the genes that were up-regulated in BALF encoded a known protein product, and of these, 44% had been reported to be either expressed in vivo and/or involved in virulence. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that in early stages of infection, A. pleuropneumoniae may modulate expression of genes involved in anaerobic energy generation and in the synthesis of proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis, as well as established virulence factors. Given that many of these genes are thought to be expressed in vivo or involved in virulence, incubation in BALF appears, at least partially, to simulate in vivo conditions and may provide a useful medium for the discovery of novel vaccine or therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2045857371,"Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 plays a key role in many biological and pathological processes related to cell migration, invasion, and mitogenesis. MMP-2 is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated through either a conformational change or proteolysis of the propeptide. Several activating enzymes for pro-MMP-2 have been proposed, including metalloproteases and serine proteases. The mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation by metalloproteases is well established, and the most studied activation mechanism involves cleavage of the propeptide by membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP). In contrast, serine protease activation has not been thoroughly studied, although studies suggest that MT1-MMP may be involved in activation by thrombin and plasmin. Here, we demonstrate that factor Xa mediates MT1-MMP-independent processing of pro-MMP-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Factor Xa and thrombin directly cleaved the propeptide on the carboxyl terminal sides of the Arg98 and Arg101 residues, whereas plasmin only cleaved the propeptide downstream of Arg101. Moreover, processed MMP-2 showed enzymatic activity that was enhanced by intermolecular autoproteolytic processing at the Asn109-Tyr peptide bond. In addition to its role in activation, factor Xa rapidly degraded MMP-2, thereby restricting excessive MMP-2 activity. Thrombin also degraded MMP-2, but the degradation was reduced greatly under cell-associated conditions, resulting in an increase in processed MMP-2. Overall, factor Xa and thrombin regulate MMP-2 enzymatic activity through its activation and degradation.

However, despite studies suggesting that MT1-MMP is involved in thrombin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2, a detailed mechanism for MMP-2 activation has yet to be elucidated (15.Lafleur M.A. Hollenberg M.D. Atkinson S.J.

Data are presented to demonstrate that factor Xa mediates MT1-MMP-independent processing of pro-MMP-2 by cleavage of specific sites within the propeptide. Furthermore, factor Xa-processed MMP-2 showed enzymatic activity that was enhanced following intermolecular autoproteolytic cleavage. Thrombin also activated pro-MMP-2 through the same cleavage reaction. Interestingly, factor Xa and thrombin were also found to be involved in MMP-2 degradation. However, this activity was reduced greatly in thrombin-treated MMP-2 by the cell surface, which resulted in an increase in processed MMP-2. Human factor Xa, thrombin, and plasmin were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Monoclonal antibodies specific to MMP-2 (sc-13595), TIMP-2 (sc-21735), and rabbit polyclonal MT1-MMP antibody (sc-30074) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-integrin αvβ3 antibody, polyclonal anti-integrin αv, monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GM6001, and human TIMP-2 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10) was from Invitrogen. Type IV collagen, Pefabloc TH, and concanavalin A were purchased from Sigma, and the EnzChek gelatinase/collagenase assay kit was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). siGENOME SMARTpool small interfering RNA against integrin αv was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Recombinant tick anticoagulant protein (rTAP) was kindly provided by Dr. Yangsoo Jang. BLAST programs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information were used to search for expressed sequence tags. Human testis cDNA (Marathon cDNA; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a template to amplify the full-length cDNA for MMP-2 (GenBankTM accession number NM_004530). Oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCTACGATGGAGGCGCTAATGGCC-3′ (start codon underlined) and 5′-TCAGCAGCCTAGCCAGTCGGATTTG-3′ (stop codon underlined) were used for PCR with Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech). The 2-kb PCR product was cloned into TOPO cloning vectors (Invitrogen) and sequenced completely. For the full-length MMP-2 expression plasmid, its open reading frame was digested with EcoRI and then recloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) B vector (Invitrogen) digested with EcoRI. All mutants used for the present study were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Intron Biotechnology). The human MT1-MMP expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Suneel Apte.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were maintained on gelatin-coated plastic dishes in M199 culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml heparin, and 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. The endothelial cells used in all experiments were from passages 3–5. Transfection with plasmids and small interfering RNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). For secreted MMP-2, transfected COS-1 and HEK293F cells were cultured and then transferred to 293 SFM-II medium (Invitrogen). Cell invasion assays were performed using Transwell inserts with 6.5-mm diameter polycarbonate 8-μm microporous membranes (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The filters were coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 7 μg/well. Trypsinized cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum. A 100-μl cell suspension containing 1 × 104 cells in the presence and absence of 1 μm rTAP or 10 μm GM6001 was placed in the upper chamber, and factor Xa was subsequently added. Then 600 μl of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber. After 16 h, any cells remaining on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The lower side of the membrane was fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 10% Giemsa. The cell number was counted using a light microscope. Cells were detached from 6-well plates using phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against integrin αvβ3 at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were washed and further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Chemicon) for 1 h. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using WinMDI software version 2.8 (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). MMP-2 present in the conditioned medium of transfected cells was quantitated using an MMP-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Calbiochem). The conditioned medium was analyzed for proteins with gelatinolytic activity by substrate lysis using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2 mg/ml gelatin. The gels were washed with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h and incubated for 14–20 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm CaCl2. Then the gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged. The soluble portion of the lysate was used for Western blotting, which was performed by separation of reduced or nonreduced samples on SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane and detection of bound antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). MMP-2 was purified from the conditioned medium using gelatin-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). The signal intensity of relevant bands from the zymogram and Western blot was quantitated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To determine the N-terminal sequence of cleaved MMP-2, treated protein was blotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membrane prior to Edman degradation (Tufts University Protein Chemistry Facility, Boston, MA). Substrates were incubated with gelatin-Sepharose-purified rat MMP-2 or conditioned medium containing MMP-2 (20 μg/ml per reaction) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 μg/ml leupeptin at 37 °C for 6 h with collagen IV as substrate (5 μg/reaction) or 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated gelatin, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The digested substrates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or a fluorescence microplate reader set for excitation at 495 nm and emission detection at 515 nm. Data are represented as the mean and S.D. of n experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Factor Xa stimulates mitogenesis and extracellular matrix invasion of human vascular SMCs through activation of pro-MMP-2 (13.Rauch B.H. Bretschneider E. Braun M. Schrör K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation in factor Xa-treated vascular SMC remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the molecular role of factor Xa-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 in SMCs and endothelial cells. Zymography of conditioned medium isolated from factor Xa-treated rat aortic SMCs demonstrated that MMP-2 propeptide processing was induced by factor Xa over time (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether factor Xa catalytic activity or generation of active thrombin is involved, pro-MMP-2 processing was assessed in factor Xa-treated cells incubated with rTAP, a specific factor Xa inhibitor, or Pefablock TH, a thrombin inhibitor. Zymographic and Western blot analysis of the conditioned medium showed that pro-MMP-2 processing was inhibited significantly only in the presence of rTAP (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that enzymatic activity of factor Xa is essential for pro-MMP-2 processing, but the processing is thrombin-independent. We then examined factor Xa-induced extracellular matrix invasion of rat aortic SMCs. In these invasion assays, cells were incubated with factor Xa in the presence and absence of rTAP or GM6001, an MMP inhibitor, for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 1C, factor Xa increased rat aortic SMC invasion significantly across the matrix gel relative to untreated cells. However, treatment with rTAP or GM6001 suppressed this invasion, suggesting that factor Xa-stimulated cell invasion is dependent on the proteolytic activation of pro-MMP-2. Similar to SMCs, pro-MMP-2 was also found to be processed in factor Xa-treated HUVECs, and factor Xa catalytic activity was essential for this processing independent of active thrombin (data not shown). Because MT1-MMP has been suggested to be a major activator of pro-MMP-2 (30.Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J.

Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), mediated the activation of pro-MMP-2 in factor Xa-treated cells. Therefore, we examined the expression levels of MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and integrin αvβ3 in these cells. Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed no difference in MT1-MMP expression between untreated and factor Xa-treated rat aortic SMCs and HUVECs (data not shown). Likewise, TIMP-2 expression was not changed by factor Xa treatment (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis of integrin αvβ3 cell surface expression in HUVECs was also unaffected by factor Xa treatment (data not shown). Expression of integrin αvβ3 could not be examined in rat aortic SMCs, because an antibody to rat integrin αvβ3 was not commercially available. These data suggest that factor Xa processing of pro-MMP-2 is most likely MT1-MMP-independent, since expression of components of MT1-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation was not altered in factor Xa-treated cells. Examination of pro-MMP-2 processing in conditioned medium isolated from factor Xa-treated cells incubated with GM6001 and TIMP-2, metalloprotease inhibitors that abrogate MTI-MMP catalytic activity, further confirmed these results. Zymographic data revealed that pro-MMP-2 processing in rat aortic SMCs and HUVECs was unaffected by these inhibitors (Fig. 2, A and B). The conditioned medium of concanavalin A-treated HT-1080 cells was assessed as a control to demonstrate that MT1-MMP-mediated processing of pro-MMP-2 could be completely inhibited by these metalloprotease inhibitors (Fig. 2C). Activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP involves cleavage of pro-MMP-2 at the Asn66-Leu peptide bond (5.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Thus, to further investigate the role of MT1-MMP in factor Xa-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2, we generated pro-MMP-2 mutants incapable of cleavage by MT1-MMP and/or autolysis, namely N66I/L67V, N109I/Y110F, and N66I/L67V/N109I/Y110F. Transient transfection of these mutant plasmids into COS-1 cells did not affect cleavage, since processed MMP-2 was still detected in the conditioned medium of factor Xa-treated cells (Fig. 2D). To demonstrate the resistance of these mutants to cleavage, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with mutant pro-MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. In particular, N66I/L67V and N66I/L67V/N109I/Y110F were not cleaved by MT1-MMP, and N109I/Y110F did not undergo autoproteolytic processing following MT1-MMP-cleavage (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, fully activated MMP-2 was observed weakly in the conditioned medium of cells co-expressing wild type pro-MMP-2 with MT1-MMP (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data suggest that the processing of pro-MMP-2 by factor Xa occurs in an MT1-MMP-independent manner. Based on the results described above, we postulated that factor Xa-mediated pro-MMP-2 processing may involve direct cleavage of the propeptide by factor Xa. To test this hypothesis, we incubated purified pro-MMP-2 with factor Xa under cell-free conditions. Zymographic analysis showed that factor Xa converted the purified pro-MMP-2 to its processed form (Fig. 3A), demonstrating direct cleavage of the propeptide by factor Xa. Next, the factor Xa cleavage site within pro-MMP-2 was identified by N-terminal sequencing of the cleaved product. The N-terminal sequence of cleaved MMP-2, as determined by Edman degradation, was Cys102-Gly-Asn-Pro-Asp-Val, which lies within the conserved cysteine switch motif (1.Ra H.J. Parks W.C. Matrix Biol. 2007; 26: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg101 to Ala reduced factor Xa-mediated processing of pro-MMP-2 dramatically but did not completely abolish this activity (Fig. 3B). Therefore, further site-directed mutagenesis was performed to substitute Arg98 and Arg98/Arg101 with Ala, generating the pro-MMP-2 R98A and pro-MMP-2 R98A/R101A mutants. Analysis of conditioned medium from COS-1 cell cultures expressing these mutants showed that the pro-MMP-2 R98A/R101A mutant was completely resistant to factor Xa-induced cleavage (Fig. 3B), whereas the pro-MMP-2 R98A mutant was normally processed. These results demonstrate that factor Xa cleaves pro-MMP-2 immediately downstream of Arg98 and Arg101 with a preference for Arg101 (Fig. 3, B and C). Since thrombin has been shown to activate pro-MMP-2 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells through MT1-MMP-dependent and -independent pathways (15.Lafleur M.A. Hollenberg M.D. Atkinson S.J. Knäuper V. Murphy G. Edwards D.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27.Henderson N. Markwick L.J. Elshaw S.R. Freyer A.M. Knox A.J. Johnson S.R. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2007; 292: L1030-L1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we examined whether processing of pro-MMP-2 by thrombin in rat aortic SMCs and HUVECs involved MT1-MMP activity. GM6001 and TIMP-2 did not inhibit processing of the propeptide by thrombin (data not shown), suggesting that thrombin processing can occur independently of MT1-MMP activity. Furthermore, thrombin processing of pro-MMP-2 mutants incapable of MT1-MMP cleavage and/or autolysis was observed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4A). Direct cleavage of purified pro-MMP-2 by thrombin occurred under cell-free conditions, albeit at a lower efficiency (data not shown). The MMP-2 propeptide contains one potential thrombin cleavage site (i.e. Xaa-Pro-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa, where Xaa is a non-acidic residue) (34.Jenny R.J. Mann K.G. Lundblad R.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 31: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which corresponds to the factor Xa cleavage site (Arg98-Lys-Pro-Arg101-Cys). To investigate whether thrombin could cleave pro-MMP-2 within this motif, COS-1 cells expressing the pro-MMP-2 R101A mutant were treated with thrombin. Partial inhibition of thrombin-mediated pro-MMP-2 processing was observed (Fig. 4B). However, mutation of both Arg98 and Arg101 to Ala resulted in a complete loss of processing (Fig. 4B), suggesting that thrombin and factor Xa share MMP-2 cleavage sites. To further verify that pro-MMP-2 is cleaved immediately downstream of Arg98-Lys-Pro-Arg101 by factor Xa and thrombin, a pro-MMP-2 mutant in which a FLAG epitope was inserted on the C-terminal side of Arg98-Lys-Pro-Arg101 was generated (Fig. 4C). In these experiments, anti-FLAG M1 antibody was used to detect processed MMP-2 by Western blotting, since this clone only recognizes proteins with a free N-terminal FLAG tag. The results show that processed MMP-2 was recognized specifically by the M1 antibody (Fig. 4C, bottom), whereas pro-MMP-2 and processed MMP-2 were detected by the anti-MMP-2 antibody (Fig. 4C, top). Since plasmin has also been shown to activate pro-MMP-2 (14.Baramova E.N. Bajou K. Remacle A. L'Hoir C. Krell H.W. Weidle U.H. Noel A. Foidart J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 35.Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we examined whether this enzyme could cleave the same bonds within the propeptide. As shown in Fig. 4D, plasmin processing of the propeptide did not occur in COS-1 cells expressing the pro-MMP-2 R101A mutant, indicating cleavage on the C-terminal side of Arg101. The proteolytic activity of MMP-2 purified from conditioned medium of rat aortic SMCs treated with or without factor Xa using collagen IV as a substrate was assessed. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that factor Xa-processed MMP-2 had greater proteolytic activity than MMP-2 from untreated rat aortic SMC, which exhibited low levels of enzymatic activity (Fig. 5A). Because factor Xa cleaves pro-MMP-2 on the N-terminal side of the Cys102 residue, this amino acid was retained after processing and may be capable of interacting with the catalytic domain zinc ion, keeping MMP-2 in a latent state. To test this, we investigated whether factor Xa-cleaved MMP-2 possessed any proteolytic activity or whether further autoproteolytic processing at the Asn109-Tyr peptide bond (36.Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was required. We compared proteolysis of collagen IV and fluorescein-conjugated gelatin in the conditioned medium of HEK293F cells expressing pro-MMP-2, the pro-MMP-2 E404A mutant, or the pro-MMP-2 N109I/Y110F mutant treated with or without"

To explore the molecular mechanism of c-fos gene induction, we established a defined in vitro transcription system for the c-fos promoter that consists of purified activators (SRF, Elk-1, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, and ATF1), general transcription factors, and RNA polymerase II. In this reconstituted transcription system, activation of c-fos transcription was highly dependent upon coactivators such as PC4 and Mediator, indicating a very weak activation potential of the activators in the context of an unaltered promoter structure. This heightened coactivator dependence, however, allowed us to identify from HeLa nuclear extract a coactivator-like activity termed transcriptional regulator of c-fos (TREF) that enhanced c-fos transcription but not GAL4-VP16-dependent transcription. TREF cooperated with Mediator to enhance c-fos transcription by ∼60-fold over its basal level and, like Mediator, stimulated activator-independent (basal) transcription as well. Further purification of TREF revealed that it consists of at least three distinct components, one of which was purified to near homogeneity and identified as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R. Recombinant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R enhanced transcription from the c-fos promoter and displayed cooperativity with PC4 and Mediator, thus demonstrating its direct transcriptional activity.

The c-fos promoter is one of the very well studied gene promoters and responds in a rapid and transient manner to a myriad of extracellular signals such as growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress (1.Treisman R.

Transcription of a typical protein-coding gene such as c-fos requires general transcription factors (GTFs), including TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, which form the preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on the promoter (5.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complex formation and the following steps of transcription are the ultimate targets of activators, whose activating signals are transduced to GTFs and RNAP II in a process that is poorly understood. This process, nonetheless, has been shown to require another class of cofactors termed coactivators or coregulators that serve as a physical and functional bridge between activators and GTFs (6.Malik S.

More recent studies indicate that another type of coactivator termed Mediator is also involved in c-fos transcription. The Med23 subunit of Mediator, first identified as an E1A-interacting protein (13.Boyer T.G. Martin M.E. Lees E. Ricciardi R.P. Berk A.J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical dissection of mammalian nuclear extracts by several independent groups lead to the purification of mammalian Mediator complexes (6.Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), variously named as NAT (negative regulator of activated transcription), the mouse Mediator complex, TRAP (thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins), SMCC (SRB-MED-containing cofactor), DRIP (vitamin D receptor-interacting proteins), ARC (activator-recruited cofactor), CRSP (cofactor required for Sp1 activation), and PC2 (positive cofactor 2). The identified complexes turned out to be highly related to each other and probably constitute the identical Mediator or its various subcomplexes (6.Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Given the diversity of the employed biochemical systems, it is somewhat surprising that only the requirement of Mediator was eventually revealed. The apparent unity, however, could be due to the use of artificially constructed activators and templates that may alter or even obviate the requirement of some cofactors. Indeed, for producing sufficiently strong signals of transcript, in vitro transcription systems typically utilize a strong activation domain fused to a DNA-binding domain (often the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4) and an artificially constructed model promoter with tandem repeats of activator-binding sites. Because of the intrinsically strong activation potential of the activator and the optimized geometry of activator-binding sites, it is possible that these systems obscure the requirement for some classes of cofactors. To identify a novel cofactor requirement in an unbiased manner, we chose the c-fos promoter as a model and initiated to recapitulate transcription from the naturally configured promoter with only purified components. We employed a defined in vitro transcription system using purified GTFs (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), together with SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1 to analyze transcriptional activation from the c-fos promoter that retains cis-elements in its original configuration. Unlike the GAL4-VP16-based model promoter, activation of the c-fos promoter by SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1 was much more dependent on coactivators such as PC4 and Mediator. This heightened coactivator dependence allowed us to identify from HeLa nuclear extract a novel coactivator-like activity termed transcriptional regulator for c-fos (TREF), which augments activated transcription from the c-fos promoter but not the GAL4-VP16-dependent transcription. Upon further purification, TREF was separated into three activities, one of which was identified as hnRNP R. Recombinant hnRNP R stimulated c-fos transcription and cooperated with PC4 and Mediator, evoking a potent activation (∼100-fold) of the c-fos promoter over its basal level. Because hnRNP R is a presumptive RNA-binding protein and is possibly involved in regulating mRNA stability, our results suggest a potential link between transcription and the subsequent post-transcriptional processes for rapid and transient c-fos induction. cDNAs of human SRF, Elk-1, CREB, ATF1, and hnRNP R were isolated from HeLa first strand cDNA by a PCR-based method. Because the 5′ region of SRF cDNA could not be amplified by PCR because of a high GC content, ∼300 bp of the 5′ region was constructed by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides based on the published SRF DNA sequence. PCR was used to add NdeI and BamHI sites to the N- and C-terminal ends of each cDNA, and when necessary, internal NdeI and BamHI sites were mutated without altering the amino acid sequences. Each cDNA was sequenced in its entirety and then subcloned into a modified baculovirus transfer vector pTOF, which was constructed from its parental plasmid, pVL1392, by mutating the unique NdeI site within the plasmid and adding FLAG-encoding DNA sequence as well as NdeI and BamHI sites. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared by transfection of Sf9 cells with each transfer vector (1.0 μg), linearized baculoviral DNA (0.25 μg), and cellfectin (Invitrogen), and the obtained viruses were plaque-purified and amplified. High Five cells were infected with each amplified baculovirus and cultured at 27 °C for 50 h. The collected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline; resuspended in one packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) containing 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm MG132, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma); and then homogenized mildly in a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic (S100) fraction, and the pellet (crude nuclei) was suspended in one packed cell volume of low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl) and extracted by the addition of one packed cell volume of high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.2 m KCl). The nuclear suspension was fractionated by centrifugation into the nuclear extract and nuclear pellet fractions. FLAG-tagged SRF (F:SRF)-containing S100 fraction was loaded onto HiTrap heparin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with BC(100) containing 0.5 mm PMSF and 1 mm dithiothreitol. BC buffer consists of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and the number in parentheses shows its KCl concentration (in mm). The bound proteins were eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient from 100 to 1000 mm KCl. F:SRF bound to HiTrap heparin was eluted at 300–500 mm KCl. The fractions containing F:SRF were adjusted to 100 mm with BC(0) and loaded onto HiTrap Q (GE Healthcare), and the bound proteins were eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient from 100 to 1000 mm KCl. F:SRF was eluted at 200–300 mm KCl, and the fractions containing F:SRF were loaded onto Mono S. F:SRF bound to Mono S was eluted at 150–250 mm KCl. F:Elk-1 was purified with the same columns as those used for F:SRF (HiTrap heparin, HiTrap Q, and Mono S). F:Elk-1 was eluted at 200–300 mm KCl from HiTrap heparin and was in the flow-through fractions from both HiTrap Q and Mono S. The High Five S100 fraction containing recombinant F:CREB (CREBα isoform) was loaded onto HiTrap SP (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with BC(100) containing 0.5 mm PMSF. F:CREB bound to HiTrap SP was eluted stepwise with BC(700). The eluate was dialyzed against BC(100) containing 0.5 mm PMSF and 0.1% Triton X-100, and F:CREB was further purified with anti-FLAG M2-agarose. The same method was also used for purifying F:ATF1. F:hnRNP R was purified similarly by SP Sepharose and Q Sepharose columns, followed by affinity purification using anti-FLAG M2-agarose. GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as described (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using a FLAG-tagged PC4 expressed in Escherichia coli. The promoter region of the c-fos gene (from −380 to −10) was isolated from human genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-ggccgaattcgcactgcaccctcggtgttg-3′ and 5′-ggccgtcgacggccgcgccgcagccactgcttttataac-3′. After disruption of the EagI site at −121, the c-fos promoter fragment was subcloned between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pUC19, and the G-less cassette from pG5HMC2AT (20.Fukuda A. Nogi Y. Hisatake K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1206-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was fused to the c-fos promoter by using an EagI site introduced at −8. In vitro transcription assays were performed as described (21.Fukuda A. Yamauchi J. Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. Muramatsu M. Hisatake K. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To produce a 3×FLAG-Nut2-expressing cell line, pLNCX2–3×FLAG-Nut2 was introduced into AmphoPack-293 cells by Lipofectin (Invitrogen), and the produced viruses were used to infect HeLa S3 cells, which were then selected in 0.8 mg/ml G418 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). The G418-resistant colony that expressed the highest level of 3×FLAG-Nut2 was expanded for nuclear extract preparation. The nuclear extract was fractionated on a P11 column, and the resulting 0.85 m KCl eluate was adjusted to BC(300) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and mixed with M2-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. After extensive washes with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml 3×FLAG peptide. Fifty ml of HeLa nuclear extract (∼10 mg/ml protein) was adjusted to BC(100) and loaded onto a 50-ml P11 column, and the flow-through fraction was collected as fraction A. The bound proteins were then eluted stepwise in BC(300), BC(500), and BC(850), and the eluates were collected as fractions B, C, and D, respectively. Each fraction was then adjusted to BC(100) by dialysis and loaded onto an appropriate volume (∼10 ml/100 mg of protein) of DE52 column, and the flow-through fraction and the BC(300) eluate were collected. The c-fos promoter contains binding sites for several transcription factors, including SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1. SRF binds the SRE as a dimer and forms a ternary complex with Elk-1, and CREB binds the c-fos AP-1 site (FAP-1) and CRE either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with ATF1 (Fig. 1A). These transcription factors play important roles for c-fos transcription, with each transcription factor differentially regulated by extracellular signals (22.Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The activities of SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1 are enhanced upon phosphorylation by MAPKs or their downstream effector kinases such as the mitogen- and stress-activated kinases and the ribosomal S6 kinases (23.Dunn K.L. Espino P.S. Drobic B. He S. Davie J.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As a first step to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of c-fos transcription in vitro, it was essential to obtain intact SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1. For this purpose, we chose the baculovirus expression system, which can provide post-translational modifications as opposed to the E. coli system, because these transcription factors are subject to multiple post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, and sumoylation that regulate their activity and stability (24.Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Panico M. Marais R. Treisman R.H. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Kelly W.G. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16911-16921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Comerford K.M.

Moreover, to prevent rapid degradation of the expressed proteins, we found that the inclusion of a proteasome inhibitor MG132 during purification was crucial, presumably because of the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated protein degradation (26.Lipford J.R. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the expressed activators were purified through combinations of conventional and affinity columns. Specifically, SRF and Elk-1 were purified by HiTrap heparin, HiTrap Q, and Mono S columns, whereas CREB and ATF1 were purified by a HiTrap SP column and then by anti-FLAG M2 affinity purification. The SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the obtained activators were essentially homogeneous with no apparent degradation (Fig. 1C). The purified transcription factors were also tested for their DNA binding using gel shift (supplemental Fig. S1) and DNase I footprinting assays (supplemental Fig. S2). As expected, SRF and Elk-1 bound specifically to the SRE, and CREB and ATF1 bound to both the FAP-1 and CRE. Elk-1 binding to the SRE was completely dependent upon the presence of SRF. Both CREB and ATF1 bound to the FAP-1 and CRE as either homodimer or heterodimer; however, a heterodimer of CREB and ATF1 appeared to show the strongest binding. Together, the purified recombinant SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1 are intact and retain the binding activity to their cognate cis-elements. Having confirmed the DNA binding activities of recombinant SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1, we then tested their transcriptional activities. First, to reveal the intrinsic activation potential of these cellular activators, we employed an in vitro transcription system reconstituted only with RNAP II and six GTFs (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH). The reconstituted in vitro transcription system was devoid of any known coactivators but capable of supporting activated transcription by GAL4-VP16 (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A c-fos template, pfMC2AT, was constructed by replacing the upstream GAL4-binding sites and the TATA box of pG5HMC2AT with the c-fos promoter region (Fig. 2A). Thus, the pfMC2AT template encompasses from −380 to −10 of the human c-fos gene, including the SRE, FAP-1, CRE, and TATA box, which allows simultaneous binding of seven activators, namely one Elk-1 and two SRFs to the SRE and each CREB/ATF1 heterodimer to the FAP-1 and CRE (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the previous results, the reconstituted transcription system allowed GAL4-VP16 to activate transcription from its cognate template with five GAL4-binding sites (pG5HMC2AT) in the absence of any coactivator, achieving ∼2–3-fold activation at its saturating amount (Fig. 2D) (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The same transcription system, however, failed to activate transcription when one of the c-fos gene activators (SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1) was added individually (Fig. 2B). Moreover, even when various combinations of the activators (SRF/Elk-1, CREB/ATF1, or SRF/Elk-1/CREB/ATF1) were tested, minimal levels of activation were observed (Fig. 2C). At the highest amounts of the four activators, where c-fos transcription increased apparently, basal (i.e. activator-independent) transcription also increased to similar extents, indicating no net effect on activator-dependent transcription under these conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10). Given that a single c-fos promoter binds seven activators (Fig. 1A), with each activator possessing at least one activation domain, it is unlikely that the number of activators or activation domains is insufficient for c-fos promoter activation. Thus, unlike viral activators (e.g. VP16), which can activate transcription in the absence of any coactivator, the tested activators (SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1) alone are insufficient to evoke activated transcription, suggesting a higher degree of dependence on coactivators. As an initial step to explore their coactivator requirement for activating the c-fos promoter, we tested the effect of PC4, a well characterized coactivator that augments in vitro transcription for a wide variety of activators (27.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28.Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We added PC4 to in vitro transcription reactions, in which various combinations of the c-fos activators were examined. Consistent with our earlier study (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), PC4 enhanced GAL4-VP16-dependent transcription from 2.5- to 38-fold, giving rise to additional increase (over 10-fold) in activation (Fig. 3C). Similarly, PC4 enabled the c-fos activators individually (Fig. 3A) or as combinations of SRF/Elk-1, CREB/ATF1, or SRF/Elk-1/CREB/ATF1 (Fig. 3B) to activate transcription by ∼5–9-fold. Thus, SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and AFT1 are indeed capable of activating transcription, although in a markedly PC4-dependent manner. PC4 exerts its coactivator activity by mediating interactions between activators and GTFs such as TFIIA (27.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), TFIIB (29.Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21842-21847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and TFIIH (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Given the ability of PC4 to enhance the transcriptional activities of SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1 (Fig. 3, A–C), we wished to know whether PC4 could interact with these activators. To determine this, we performed GST pull-down assays using GST-fused activators and FLAG-tagged PC4. Fig. 3D shows that PC4 interacted strongly with CREB and Elk-1, moderately with ATF1, and very weakly with SRF. The results indicate that these interactions may, at least in part, provide a mechanistic basis for PC4-enhanced transcriptional activities of SRF, Elk-1, CREB, and ATF1. Numerous in vivo studies have shown that various extracellular stimuli elicit c-fos gene activation that typically reaches well over 100-fold. Thus, even in the presence of PC4, the observed activation of the c-fos promoter in vitro (Fig. 2, A and B) was unremarkable as compared with that generally observed within cells. To further explore the coactivator requirement for the c-fos promoter in an unbiased manner, we fractionated the nuclear extract from rapidly growing HeLa cells into eight fractions (Fig. 4A) and examined their effects on c-fos transcription in vitro. As expected, the D0.3 fraction, which contains TFIID (supplemental Fig. S3), increased both basal and activated transcription (Fig. 4B, lanes 17 and 18), because the amount of TFIID in the current transcription system was set below the saturating amount to reveal the effect of activators (Fig. 4C, lanes 7–10). Furthermore, the D0.1 fraction showed an activity reminiscent of Mediator (Fig. 4B, lanes 15 and 16) (30.Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), indicating that the D0.1 activity is, at least in part, attributable to Mediator, although the presence of additional coactivators cannot be excluded. Intriguingly, the A0.3 fraction, in which no biochemically defined coactivator had been reported, stimulated transcription from the c-fos promoter (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). Although this fraction includes TFIIA (31.Reinberg D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3322-3330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is important for activated transcription in vitro (19.Fukuda A. Nakadai T. Shimada M. Tsukui T. Matsumoto M. Nogi Y. Meisterernst M. Hisatake K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6525-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), further addition of TFIIA did not affect the level of c-fos transcription at all (Fig. 4C, lanes 3–6), thus excluding the possibility that the observed stimulatory effect was due to TFIIA. Collectively, our biochemical analyses identified a novel activity, which we termed TREF, that can stimulate in vitro transcription from the c-fos promoter. We then addressed whether or not TREF was specific to the c-fos promoter. As shown in Fig. 5A, TREF increased both basal transcription (lane 3) and activator-dependent transcription (lane 4) from the c-fos promoter, eliciting a ∼17-fold net increase of transcription from the basal level (compare lanes 1 and 4). However, whereas TREF increased basal transcription from the 5×G promoter, it somewhat diminished GAL4-VP16-dependent transcription from the same promoter (Fig. 5A, lanes 9 and 10). Thus, although TREF enhances transcription through the core promoter as well as the upstream regulatory elements, the stimulatory effect of TREF through the upstream elements appears to have some activator specificity. By contrast, the D0.1 fraction, which principally reflects the activity of Mediator, stimulated both basal and activator-dependent transcription from the c-fos (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6) and 5×G promoters (Fig. 5A, lanes 11 and 12) in a similar manner. Finally, the fully phosphorylated activators and its unphosphorylated (i.e. phosphorylation-defective) mutants displayed essentially indistinguishable response to TREF, indicating that phosphorylation of the activators do not affect the TREF activity (data not shown). Next, we tested the functional cooperativity of TREF and Mediator, a major coactivator component of the D0"
https://openalex.org/W2019555979,"Previous studies have described one nuclear localization signal (NLSI) in p53 and speculated on two additional sites termed NLSII and NLSIII. Drug-resistant KB cells selected with cisplatin or oxaliplatin were found to have increased p53 levels and in oxaliplatin-selected cells, a larger p53 predominantly in the cytoplasm. In oxaliplatin-selected cells a single nucleotide deletion in the sequence-encoding amino acid 382, part of NLSIII, resulted in a frame shift and a 420 amino acid protein (p53(420)). We investigated explanations for the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53(420) while assessing the role, if any, of NLSII and NLSIII in p53 nuclear import. We found that neither NLSII nor NLSIII are essential for p53 nuclear localization. Furthermore, we confirmed p53(420) is able to tetramerize, transactivate a p21 promoter, bind dynein and that the reduced nuclear accumulation is not a consequence of increased p53 nuclear export. However, the association of p53(420) with importin-beta, essential for nuclear import, was significantly impaired. We conclude that despite sequence similarity to consensus NLSs neither NLSII nor NLSIII have roles in p53 nuclear transport. We also identified impaired association with importin as a novel mechanism of p53 cytoplasmic sequestration that impairs nuclear transport rendering cells functionally deficient in p53."
https://openalex.org/W2050401795,"The chicken is capable of adaptive locomotor behavior within hours after hatching, yet little is known of the processes leading to this precocious skill. During the final week of incubation, chick embryos produce distinct repetitive limb movements that until recently had not been investigated. In this study we examined the leg muscle patterns at 3 time points as development of these spontaneous movements unfolds to determine if they exhibit attributes of locomotion reported in hatchlings. We also sought to determine whether the deeply flexed posture and movement constraint imposed by the shell wall modulate the muscle patterns.Synchronized electromyograms for leg muscles, force and video were recorded continuously from embryos while in their naturally flexed posture at embryonic day (E) 15, E18 and E20. We tested for effects of leg posture and constraint by removing shell wall anterior to the foot. Results indicated that by E18, burst onset time distinguished leg muscle synergists from antagonists across a 10-fold range in burst frequencies (1-10 Hz), and knee extensors from ankle extensors in patterns comparable to locomotion at hatching. However, burst durations did not scale with step cycle duration in any of the muscles recorded. Despite substantially larger leg movements after shell removal, the knee extensor was the only muscle to vary its activity, and extensor muscles often failed to participate. To further clarify if the repetitive movements are likely locomotor-related, we examined bilateral coordination of ankle muscles during repetitive movements at E20. In all cases ankle muscles exhibited a bias for left/right alternation.Collectively, the findings lead us to conclude that the repetitive leg movements in late stage embryos are locomotor-related and a fundamental link in the establishment of precocious locomotor skill. The potential importance of differences between embryonic and posthatching locomotion is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004185703,"C-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-binding protein (Cbp) is a transmembrane adaptor protein that localizes exclusively in lipid rafts, where it regulates Src family kinase (SFK) activities through recruitment of Csk. Although SFKs are well known for their involvement in cancer, the function of Cbp in carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported overexpression of Cbp in more than 70% of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specimens and in the majority of tested RCC cell lines. Depletion of Cbp in RCC cells by RNA interference led to remarkable inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice. Strikingly, silencing of Cbp negatively affected the sustaining of Erk1/2 activation but not c-Src activation induced by serum. Besides, the RhoA activity in RCC cells was remarkably impaired when Cbp was knocked down. Overexpression of wild-type Cbp, but not its mutant Cbp/ΔCP lacking C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, significantly enhanced RhoA activation and cell migration of RCC cells. These results provided new insights into the function of Cbp in modulating RhoA activation, by which Cbp might contribute to renal cell carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2038282735,"This study examines the structural features and phylogeny of the alpha subunits of 69 full-length NifD (MoFe subunit), VnfD (VFe subunit), and AnfD (FeFe subunit) sequences.The analyses of this set of sequences included BLAST scores, multiple sequence alignment, examination of patterns of covariant residues, phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the sequences flanking the conserved Cys and His residues that attach the FeMo cofactor to NifD and that are also conserved in the alternative nitrogenases. The results show that NifD nitrogenases fall into two distinct groups. Group I includes NifD sequences from many genera within Bacteria, including all nitrogen-fixing aerobes examined, as well as strict anaerobes and some facultative anaerobes, but no archaeal sequences. In contrast, Group II NifD sequences were limited to a small number of archaeal and bacterial sequences from strict anaerobes. The VnfD and AnfD sequences fall into two separate groups, more closely related to Group II NifD than to Group I NifD. The pattern of perfectly conserved residues, distributed along the full length of the Group I and II NifD, VnfD, and AnfD, confirms unambiguously that these polypeptides are derived from a common ancestral sequence.There is no indication of a relationship between the patterns of covariant residues specific to each of the four groups discussed above that would give indications of an evolutionary pathway leading from one type of nitrogenase to another. Rather the totality of the data, along with the phylogenetic analysis, is consistent with a radiation of Group I and II NifDs, VnfD and AnfD from a common ancestral sequence. All the data presented here strongly support the suggestion made by some earlier investigators that the nitrogenase family had already evolved in the last common ancestor of the Archaea and Bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2170951433,"The bacterial protein-disulfide isomerase DsbC is a homodimeric V-shaped enzyme that consists of a dimerization domain, two alpha-helical linkers, and two opposing thioredoxin fold catalytic domains. The functional significance of the two catalytic domains of DsbC is not well understood yet. We have engineered heterodimer-like DsbC derivatives covalently linked via (Gly(3)-Ser) flexible linkers. We either inactivated one of the catalytic sites (CGYC), or entirely removed one of the catalytic domains while maintaining the putative binding area intact. Variants having a single active catalytic site display significant levels of isomerase activity. Furthermore, mDsbC[H45D]-dim[D53H], a DsbC variant lacking an entire catalytic domain but with an intact dimerization domain, also showed isomerase activity, albeit at lower levels. In addition, the absence of the catalytic domain allowed this protein to catalyze in vivo oxidation. Our results reveal that two catalytic domains in DsbC are not essential for disulfide bond isomerization and that a determining feature in isomerization is the availability of a substrate binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2006881628,"We observed that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha is highly inducible in primary fibroblasts by DNA-damaging agents that induce strand breaks, alkylate and crosslink DNA as well as those that produce bulky DNA lesions. Fibroblasts deficient in C/EBPalpha (C/EBPalpha(-/-)) display an impaired G1 checkpoint as evidenced by an inappropriate entry into the S-phase in response to DNA damage, and these cells also display an enhanced G1/S transition in response to mitogens. The induction of C/EBPalpha by DNA damage in fibroblasts does not require p53. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from ultraviolet B (UVB)- and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-treated fibroblasts showed increased binding of C/EBPbeta to a C/EBP consensus sequence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis also showed increased C/EBPbeta binding to the C/EBPalpha promoter. To determine whether C/EBPbeta has a function in the regulation of C/EBPalpha, we treated C/EBPbeta(-/-) fibroblasts with UVB or MNNG. We observed that C/EBPalpha induction was impaired in both UVB- and MNNG-treated C/EBPbeta(-/-) fibroblasts. Our study shows a novel function for C/EBPbeta in the regulation of C/EBPalpha in response to DNA damage and provides definitive genetic evidence that C/EBPalpha has a critical role in the DNA damage G1 checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W1986866968,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 plays a key role in initiating viral replication and is an important target for developing anti-HIV drugs. Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln269-Arg277) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160gag-pol mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease. The conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of HIV-1 lent further support to this conclusion. The knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design."
