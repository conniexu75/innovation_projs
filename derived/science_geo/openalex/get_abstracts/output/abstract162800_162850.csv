https://openalex.org/W2042676891,"The anti-cancer agent paclitaxel (Taxol) stabilizes microtubules leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. In order to analyse the molecular mechanisms of Taxol-induced cytotoxicity, we studied the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK and p38 as well as the p53 pathways in Taxol-induced apoptosis. The human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 and its derivatives, MCF7/HER-2 and MDD2, were used in the study. We found that Taxol treatment strongly activated ERK, p38 MAP kinase and p53 in MAP kinase MCF7 cells prior to apoptosis. PD98059 or SB203580, specific inhibitors of ERK and p38 kinase activities, significantly decreased apoptosis, leaving the surviving cells arrested in G2/M. These inhibitors did not significantly affect Taxol-induced alterations in the cell cycle regulatory proteins Rb, p53, p21/Waf1 and Cdk-2. In addition, inactivation of p53 did not affect cellular sensitivity to Taxol killing. However, cells with inactivated p53, unlike cells harboring wild type p53, failed to arrest in G2/M after treatment with Taxol and continued to divide or go into apoptosis. Our data show that both ERK and p38 MAP kinase cascades are essential for apoptotic response to Taxol-induced cellular killing and are independent of p53 activity. However, p53 may serve as a survival factor in breast carcinoma cells treated with Taxol by blocking cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle."

This observation challenges the classical two-hit model of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. In order to investigate whether or not CDH1 promoter methylation may function as the second hit we analysed a series of 23 sporadic gastric carcinomas for the presence of CDH1 mutations, CDH1 promoter methylation, LOH and E-cadherin expression. CDH1 mutations were detected in nine of the 16 (56.3%) diffuse gastric carcinomas and in none of the seven intestinal gastric carcinomas. In diffuse gastric carcinomas harboring CDH1 mutations, LOH was observed in a single case. Loss of plasma membrane E-cadherin expression was consistently found in all nine cases with CDH1 mutation, suggesting that tumors inactivated the remaining CDH1 allele via a different mechanism. CDH1 promoter methylation was observed in nine of the 16 (56.3%) diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cases, including six of the nine cases (66.7%) harboring CDH1 mutations. CDH1 promoter methylation was also seen in two (28.6%) intestinal-type cases. Our results show that CDH1 promoter methylation is the second hit in more than half of the sporadic diffuse gastric carcinoma cases harboring CDH1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2074183372,"Upon engagement of the B Cell Receptor (BCR) of WEHI 231 immature B cells, a drop in c-Myc expression is followed by activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p27(Kip1), which induces growth arrest and apoptosis. Here, we report inverse patterns of p27 and c-Myc protein expression follow BCR engagement. We present evidence demonstrating, for the first time, that the p27(Kip1) gene is a target of transcriptional repression by c-Myc. Specifically, the changes in p27 protein levels correlated with changes in p27 mRNA levels, and gene transcription. Induction of p27 promoter activity followed BCR engagement of WEHI 231 cells, and this induction could be repressed upon co-transfection of a c-Myc expression vector. Inhibition of the TATA-less p27 promoter by c-Myc was also observed in Jurkat T cells, vascular smooth muscle, and Hs578T breast cancer cells, extending the observation beyond immune cells. Consistent with a putative Inr element CCAGACC (where +1 is underlined) at the start site of transcription in the p27 promoter, deletion of Myc homology box II reduced the extent of repression. Furthermore, enhanced repression was observed upon transfection of the c-Myc 'super-repressor', with mutation of Phe115 to Leu. The sequences mediating transcriptional activity and c-Myc repression were mapped to bp -20 to +20 of the p27 gene. Finally, binding of Max was shown to facilitate c-Myc binding and repression of p27 promoter activity. Overall, these studies identify the p27 CKI gene as a new target whereby c-Myc can control cell proliferation, survival and neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2087697646,"Entry into mitosis requires activation of the Cdc2 protein kinase by the Cdc25C protein phosphatase. The interactions between Cdc2 and Cdc25C are negatively regulated throughout interphase and in response to G2 checkpoint activation. This is accomplished in part by maintaining the Cdc25 phosphatase in a phosphorylated form that binds 14-3-3 proteins. Here we report that 14-3-3 binding regulates the intracellular trafficking of Cdc25C. Although primarily cytoplasmic, Cdc25C accumulated in the nuclei of leptomycin B (LMB)-treated cells, indicating that Cdc25C is actively exported out of the nucleus. A mutant of Cdc25C that is unable to bind 14-3-3 was partially nuclear in the absence of LMB and its nuclear accumulation was greatly enhanced by LMB-treatment. A nuclear export signal (NES) was identified within the amino terminus of Cdc25C. Although mutation of the NES did not effect 14-3-3 binding, it did cause nuclear accumulation of Cdc25C. These results demonstrate that 14-3-3 binding is dispensable for the nuclear export of Cdc25C. However, complete nuclear accumulation of Cdc25C required loss of both NES function and 14-3-3 binding and this was accomplished both pharmacologically and by mutation. These findings suggest that the nuclear export of Cdc25C is mediated by an intrinsic NES and that 14-3-3 binding negatively regulates nuclear import."

https://openalex.org/W2049413309,"Death associated protein (DAP)-kinase is a 16 kDa calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that carries a death domain at its C-terminus. DAP-kinase functions as a positive mediator of apoptosis that is induced by interferon-γ. Recent studies suggest that DAP-kinase is involved in tumor metastasis and that it can be inactivated by methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the gene in some human tumors. However, little is known about the factors that are associated with the occurrence of DAP-kinase promoter methylation. We investigated both the possible associations of tobacco carcinogen and asbestos exposure with DAP-kinase promoter methylation, and the demographic and clinical factors associated with DAP-kinase promoter methylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One hundred and eighty-five patients diagnosed with NSCLC undergoing surgical resection from June, 1992 through December, 1996 at Massachusetts General Hospital participated in this study. Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP), performed using fresh-frozen tissue, was used to determine the methylation status of the promoter region of the DAP-kinase gene. Forty-seven (25%) of 185 tumors showed DAP-kinase promoter methylation. There was a significant association between methylation and an advanced pathologic stage (P=0.003, Fisher's exact test). Methylation of the DAP-kinase promoter was also associated with an increase in tumor size (P=0.009, Fisher's exact test) and lymph node involvement (P=0.04). No association was found between promoter methylation of DAP-kinase and k-ras or p53 mutation. In addition there was no association with a history of exposure to tobacco or asbestos. Controlling for age, sex, and histology, the odds ratios describing the association of DAP-kinase hypermethylation with stage were 2.70 (1.13–6.45), 3.11 (1.37–7.08) and 7.77 (1.21–50.03) in stages II, III and IV, respectively. Stage I cases with DAP-kinase promoter methylation had worse overall survival, but with the small sample size and limited follow-up this did not reach statistical significance. Our findings suggest that methylation of the promoter region of the DAP-kinase gene is not associated with exposure to tobacco or asbestos. However, they strongly suggest that DAP-kinase may be important in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer from early to late stage disease."

https://openalex.org/W2328214415,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) consists of three subunits, A, B and C. The A and B subunits have regulatory functions while C is the catalytic subunit. PP2A core enzyme is composed of subunits A and C, and the holoenzyme of subunits A, B and C. All subunits exist as multiple isoforms or splice variants. The A subunit exists as two isoforms, Aα and Aβ. Here we report about the properties of eight Aβ mutants, which were found in human lung and colon cancer. These mutants were reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for their ability to bind B and C subunits. Two mutants showed decreased binding of PR72, a member of the B′′ family of B subunits, but normal C subunit binding; two mutants exhibited decreased binding of the C subunit and of B′′/PR72; and one mutant showed increased binding of both the C subunit andB′′/PR72. Of three mutants that behaved like the wild-type Aβ subunit, one is a polymorphic variant and another one is altered outside the binding region for B and C subunits. Importantly, we also found that the wild-type Aα and Aβ isoforms, although 85% identical, are remarkably different in their ability to bind B and C subunits. Our findings may have important implications in regard to the role of PP2A as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2312877617,"Prostate cancer is a major cause of male cancer death. In vitro and in vivo data support a role for 1 alpha,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)) in regulating the growth and differentiation of the normal prostate gland yet prostate cancer cells appear significantly less sensitive to this action. Vitamin D(3) receptor (VDR) content or mutational status do not correlate clearly with the antiproliferative effects of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and therefore it is unclear why prostate cancer cell lines are significantly less sensitive to this action. We hypothesized that the antiproliferative responses of prostate cancer cells to 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) are suppressed by a process involving histone deacetylation. Sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA) are inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Low doses of NaB or TSA (300 microM and 15 nM respectively), which alone were relatively inactive, synergized with 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in liquid and semi-solid agar to inhibit the growth of LNCaP, PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Still greater synergy was observed between vitamin D(3) hexafluoride analogs and either NaB or TSA. The mechanism appeared to involve neither the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21((waf1/cip1)) nor cell cycle arrest, but rather induction of apoptosis. These data suggest that cells dysregulate the normal pro-apoptotic signals of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) during prostate cancer development by a mechanism involving histone deacetylation. Combination therapy with potent vitamin D(3) analogs and clinically approved HDAC inhibitors may overcome this lesion and improve the treatment of both androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2011370737,"The transcription factor E2F1 is a key component of cell cycle that acts to transactivate genes required for S phase entry. Thus, it plays an important role in cellular proliferation, oncogenesis and differentiation. In order to investigate its potential implication in human lung carcinogenesis, we studied E2F1 protein expression by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in a series of 58 human lung tumours of all histological types. We showed that E2F1 product was overexpressed in 92% (24/26) of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and in 50% (5/10) of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) whereas it was undetectable in 90% (10/11) of adenocarcinoma and 82% (9/11) of squamous carcinoma when compared to corresponding normal lung. No amplification was found but an increase in E2F1 mRNA expression was detected in 75% (18/24) of SCLC overexpressing E2F1 product. In these tumours and in contrast with NSCLC, upregulation of E2F1 product was associated with its nuclear accumulation and with overexpression of several of its target-genes. Moreover, E2F1 overexpression in NE lung tumours was significantly associated with a high KI67 index (P<0.0001) as well as a Bcl-2:Bax ratio >1 (P<0.001). Overall, these results demonstrate a distinct pattern of E2F1 expression in human lung tumours and suggest that its deregulation could be involved in the carcinogenesis of SCLC."

https://openalex.org/W2033351371,"DiFi human colon carcinoma cells are stimulated by the transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α)/epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor autocrine loop. Exposure of DiFi cells to monoclonal antibody (mAb) 225, which blocks ligand-induced activation of the EGF receptor, induces G1 arrest and subsequent cell death via apoptosis. We investigated the signal pathways by which basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) modulate mAb 225-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in DiFi cells. Both bFGF and IGF-1 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) pathway in DiFi cells. Additionally, IGF-1 activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway. Both bFGF and IGF-1 inhibited mAb 225-induced apoptosis; however, bFGF provided sustained protection against apoptosis, while the protection by IGF-1 was only temporary. Also, bFGF reversed the mAb 225-induced increase in the p27Kip1 level, inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2) activity, dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and the resultant G1 arrest of the cells. In contrast, IGF-1 did not reverse such effects by mAb 225. The prevention of mAb 225-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in DiFi cells by bFGF was sensitive to the MEK/MAPK inhibitor PD98059 but not to the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002. In contrast, inhibition of apoptosis by IGF-1 in DiFi cells was sensitive only to LY294002 and not to PD98059. These results further our understanding of how mAb 225 induces apoptosis in DiFi cells."
https://openalex.org/W2325177197,"The present study was designed to elucidate the relationship between p53 and ceramide, both of which are involved in apoptotic signaling. Treatment of human glioma cells with etoposide caused apoptosis only in cells expressing functional p53. p53 activation was followed by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion (O2-*) measured by hydroethidium oxidation into ethidium and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) measured by oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) into 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which was accompanied with ceramide generation through the activation of neutral, but not acid, sphingomyelinase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), a selective antioxidant for O2-*, had no effects on p53 expression but inhibited ceramide generation and apoptotic cell death caused by etoposide. However, catalase, a specific antioxidant for H2O2, only weakly inhibited and sodium formate, a hydroxyl radical (* OH) scavenger, unaffected etoposide-induced apoptosis. Like etoposide-induced cell death, treatment of glioma cells with the O2-*-releasing agent, pyrogallol, induced typical apoptosis and ceramide generation even in the presence of catalase. In contrast, human glioma cells lacking functional p53, either due to mutation or the expression of E6 protein of human papillomavirus, were highly resistant to etoposide and exhibited no significant change in the ceramide level. Moreover, expression of functional p53 protein in glioma cells expressing mutant p53 using a temperature-sensitive human p53(Val138) induced ceramide accumulation by the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase which was dependent on the generation of O2-*. Taken together, these results suggest that p53 may modulate ceramide generation by activation of neutral sphingomyelinase through the formation of O2-*, but not its downstream compounds H2O2 or * OH."
https://openalex.org/W1970408491,"The present study explored the role of the cell surface receptor Fas (CD95/APO-1) in apoptosis induced by camptothecin (CPT) in the HT29 colon carcinoma cell line. CPT-induced apoptosis was associated with high molecular weight DNA fragmentation as measured by filter elution. This fragmentation was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk and by cycloheximide, which also prevented proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage. Under such conditions, Fas, Fas ligand, Bax, and p21 expression were increased and Fas recruited the FADD adaptor. Fas expression increase was blocked by cycloheximide but not by z-VAD-fmk, consistent with caspase activation downstream from Fas. Treatment of HT29 cells with FasL or with the CH-11 agonistic anti-Fas antibody potentiated the apoptotic response of cells treated with CPT. The anti-Fas blocking antibody ZB4 and the Fas-ligand inhibitor failed to protect HT29 cells from CPT-induced apoptosis. Such a protection was obtained by transient expression of constructs encoding a dominant-negative mutant of FADD, FADD in an antisense orientation and E8 or MC159 viral proteins that inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis at the level of FADD and procaspase-8, respectively. Together, these data show that topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage-induced apoptosis involves activation of the Fas pathway without detectable Fas-ligand requirement in CPT-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067620159,"Hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1, 2 and 3), consisting of alpha and beta subunits, play an essential role in various responses to hypoxia. Nuclear entry of alpha subunits is a necessary step for the formation of DNA-binding complex with beta subunit, which is constitutively localized in the nucleus. We show here that the nuclear accumulation of HIF2alpha induced by hypoxia is mediated through a novel variant of bipartite-type nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus of the protein, which has an unusual length of spacer sequence between two adjacent basic domains. We further show that when the ubiquitin-proteasome system was deficient or inhibited, HIF2alpha accumulated in the nucleus even under normoxia, also mediated through the bipartite NLS. These findings indicate that the protein stability is critical for the nuclear localization of HIF2alpha and hypoxia is not a necessary factor for the process. Importantly, the NLS of HIF2alpha is also conserved in the other HIF family members, HIF1alpha and HIF3alpha. Mutational analyses proved that the NLS mediating the nuclear localization of HIF1alpha is indeed bipartite-, but not monopartite-type as thought before. Our results suggest that the newly identified NLS is crucial for the functional regulation of HIF family."
https://openalex.org/W2317258824,"The transcription factor E2F-1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of G1/S transition in higher eukaryotes cell cycle. We used a cell line containing an inducible E2F-1 and oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify novel E2F target genes. We show that E2F-1 up-regulates the expression of a number of genes coding for components of the DNA replication machinery. Among them is the gene coding for the 32 Kd subunit of replication protein A (RPA2). Replication protein A is the most abundant single strand DNA binding complex and it is essential for DNA replication. We demonstrate that RPA2 is a novel E2F target gene whose expression can be directly regulated by E2F-1 via E2F binding sites in its promoter. In addition, expression of Topoisomerase IIα and subunit IV of DNA polymerase α is also up-regulated upon E2F-1 induction. Taken together, these results provide novel links between components of the DNA replication machinery and the cell growth regulatory pathway involving the Rb tumor suppressor and E2F."

https://openalex.org/W1964489612,"In a search for molecular markers of progression in prostate cancer by means of differential display, we have identified a new gene, which we have designated PTOV1. Semiquantitative RT–PCR has established that nine out of 11 tumors overexpress PTOV1 at levels significantly higher than benign prostatic hyperplasia or normal prostate tissue. The human PTOV1 protein consists almost entirely of two repeated blocks of homology of 151 and 147 amino acids, joined by a short linker peptide, and is encoded by a 12-exon gene localized in chromosome 19q13.3. A Drosophila melanogaster PTOV1 homolog also contains two tandemly arranged PTOV blocks. A second gene, PTOV2, was identified in humans and Drosophila, coding for proteins with a single PTOV homology block and unrelated amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions. A 1.8-Kb PTOV1 transcript was detected abundantly in normal human brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver, and at low levels in normal prostate. Immunocytochemical analysis and expression of chimeric GFP-PTOV1 proteins in cultured cells showed a predominantly perinuclear localization of PTOV1. In normal prostate tissue and in prostate adenomas, PTOV1 was undetectable or expressed at low levels, whereas nine out of 11 prostate adenocarcinomas showed a strong immunoreactivity, with a focal distribution in areas of carcinoma and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Therefore, PTOV1 is a previously unknown gene, overexpressed in early and late stages of prostate cancer. The PTOV homology block represents a new class of conserved sequence blocks present in human, rodent and fly proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2159435989,"In papillary renal cell carcinomas the TFE3 transcription factor becomes fused to the PSF and NonO pre-mRNA splicing factors and most commonly to a protein of unknown function designated PRCC. In this study we have examined the ability of the resulting PRCC–TFE3 and NonO–TFE3 fusions to activate transcription from the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter. The results show that only fusion to PRCC enhanced transcriptional activation, indicating that the ability to enhance the level of transcription from endogenous TFE3 promoters is not a consistent feature of TFE3 fusions. In investigations of the normal function of PRCC we observed that PRCC expressed as a green fluorescent fusion protein colocalizes within the nucleus with Sm pre-mRNA splicing factors. It was also found that endogenous PRCC is coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies that recognize a variety of pre-mRNA splicing factors including SC35, PRL1 and CDC5. Association with the cellular splicing machinery is therefore, a common feature of the proteins that become fused to TFE3 in papillary renal cell carcinomas."

https://openalex.org/W2005466445,"Telomeres are essential for cell survival and have been implicated in the mitotic control. The telomeric protein Pin2/TRF1 controls telomere elongation and its expression is tightly regulated during cell cycle. We previously reported that overexpression of Pin2/TRF1 affects mitotic progression. However, the role of Pin2/TRF1 at the interface between cell division and cell survival remains to be determined. Here we show that overexpression of Pin2 induced apoptosis in cells containing short telomeres, but not in cells with long telomeres. Furthermore, before entering apoptosis, Pin2-expressing cells first accumulated in mitosis and strongly stained with the mitosis-specific MPM2 antibody. Moreover, Pin2-induced apoptosis is potentiated by arresting cells in mitosis, but suppressed by accumulating cells in G1. In addition, overexpression of Pin2 also resulted in activation of caspase-3, and its proapoptotic activity was significantly reduced by inhibition of caspase-3. These results indicate that up-regulation of Pin2/TRF1 can specifically induce entry into mitosis and apoptosis, likely via a mechanism related to activation of caspase-3. Significantly, we also found that, out of 51 human breast cancer tissues and 10 normal controls examined, protein levels of Pin2/TRF1 in tumors were significantly lower than in normal tissues, as detected by immunoblotting analysis and immunocytochemistry. Since down-regulation of Pin2/TRF1 allows cells to maintain long telomeres, these results suggest that down-regulation of Pin2/TRF1 may be important for cancer cells to extend their proliferative potential."

https://openalex.org/W2317224362,"Cells in culture become competent to replicate in the absence of growth factor after progressing beyond the late G1 restriction point, suggesting that a set of genes expressed during G1 phase is sufficient to trigger completion of the cell cycle. However, this has not been demonstrated in an in vivo system. In this study, we examined whether transfection of genes associated with the G1/S transition could trigger hepatocyte replication. Co-transfection of cyclin E and skp2 synergistically promoted cell cycle progression in cultured primary hepatocytes in the absence of mitogen or in the presence of growth inhibitors. Furthermore, transfection of hepatocytes in vivo with cyclin E and skp2 promoted abundant hepatocyte replication and hyperplasia of the liver. These studies confirm that transfection with a small number of genes can trigger proliferation of quiescent hepatocytes in vivo, and suggest that therapies to enhance liver regeneration by targeting cell cycle control genes may be feasible."

https://openalex.org/W2012556333,"Immune cell-specific adaptor proteins create various combinations of multiprotein complexes and integrate signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus, modulating the specificity and selectivity of intracellular signal transduction. Grap2 is a newly identified adaptor protein specifically expressed in lymphoid tissues. This protein shares 40--50% sequence homology in the SH3 and the SH2 domain with Grb2 and Grap. However, the Grap2 protein has a unique 120-amino acid glutamine- and proline-rich domain between the SH2 and C-terminal SH3 domains. The expression of Grap2 is highly restricted to lymphoid organs and T lymphocytes. In order to understand the role of this specific adaptor protein in immune cell signaling and activation, we searched for the Grap2 interacting protein in T lymphocytes. We found that Grap2 interacted with the hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) in vitro and in Jurkat T cells. The interaction was mediated by the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grap2 with the second proline-rich motif of HPK1. Coexpression of Grap2 with HPK1 not only increased the kinase activity of HPK1 in the cell, but also had an additive effect on HPK1 mediated JNK activation. Furthermore, over expression of Grap2 and HPK1 induced significant transcriptional activation of c-Jun in the JNK signaling pathway and IL-2 gene reporter activity in stimulated Jurkat T cells. Therefore, our data suggest that the hematopoietic specific proteins Grap2 and HPK1 form a signaling complex to mediate the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W351798136,"The natural polyamines -putrescine, spermidine, and spermine- are essential for cell growth and differentiation. Polyamines are involved in several gene regulatory functions, although their mechanism(s) of action has not been elucidated. We investigated the role of polyamines in the function of NF-kappa B and estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), two transcription factors implicated in breast cancer cell proliferation and cell survival, using MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We found that spermine facilitated the binding of ER alpha and NF-kappa B to estrogen response element (ERE)- and NF-kappa B response element (NRE), respectively, and enhanced ER alpha-mediated transcriptional activation in transient transfection experiments. We also found that the association of the co-regulatory protein CBP/p300 with ER alpha and NF-kappa B was increased by spermine treatment of MCF-7 cells. Spermine also increased the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B compared to the control. In contrast, treatment of MCF-7 cells with polyamine analogs, BE-3-4-3 and BE-3-3-3, resulted in transcriptional inhibition of both ERE- and NRE-driven reporter plasmids. In addition, polyamine analogs inhibited the association of ER alpha and NF-kappa B with CBP/p300 and were unable to facilitate nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. APO-BRDU assay demonstrated that polyamine analogs induced apoptosis, with a loss of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These data show a gene regulatory function of polyamines involving transcriptional activation of ER alpha and NF-kappa B, potentially leading to the up-regulation of genes involved in breast cancer cell proliferation. Our results with BE-3-4-3 and BE-3-3-3 suggest that down-regulation of ER alpha- and NF-kappa B-regulated genes is a possible mechanism for the action of polyamine analogs in inducing apoptosis of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089656391,"Accumulating evidence has suggested that cellular production of superoxide acts as an intracellular messenger to regulate gene expression and modulate cellular activities. In this report, we set out to investigate the role of active H-ras-mediated superoxide production on tumor cell malignancy in a SV-40 transformed human lung WI-38 VA-13 cell line. Stable transfection and expression of constitutively active mutant V12-H-ras (V12-H-ras) dramatically increased intracellular production of superoxide. The expression of V12-H-ras significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration and resistance to TNF-α treatment compared to that of parental and vector control cells, while expression of wild type H-ras (WT-H-ras) only had modest effects. Upon scavenging by superoxide dismutase and other molecules that decrease the intracellular level of active H-ras mediated superoxide production, cell proliferation, migration and resistance to TNF-α were significantly reduced. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the activation of membrane NADPH oxidase activity by expression of active H-ras contributed to the intracellular superoxide production. The causal relationship between membrane superoxide production and increased cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to TNF-α by the expression of active H-ras, has provided direct evidence to demonstrate that superoxide acts as an intracellular messenger to cascade ras oncogenic signal relay and to modulate tumor malignant activity."

https://openalex.org/W2329084487,"Here, we report the identification and characterization of a new member of the RalGDS-family, which is widely expressed and interacts strongly and selectively with the GTP-bound forms of M-Ras and p21 Ras. This Ras pathway modulator (RPM), also termed RGL3, exhibited Ras-binding and catalytic domains typical of the RalGDS-family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and was most similar to Rlf (RalGDS-like factor), but was distinguished by a unique proline-rich region with multiple candidate SH3-domain binding sites. RPM/RGL3 resembled AF-6 and Nore1 in interacting strongly with constitutively active M-Ras and p21 Ras. In contrast to Rlf, transiently expressed RPM/RGL3 did not activate an Elk-1-inducible reporter gene alone or in combination with activated p21 Ras, but strongly inhibited induction of this reporter gene by co-expression of activated H-Ras or MEKK-1. This inhibitory effect was independent of the Ras binding domain and required a second signal provided by p21 Ras or MEKK-1, but not Raf-1 or M-Ras. Expression of RPM/RGL3 also strongly inhibited cell growth of fibroblasts transformed by an activated Src Y527F. Thus, RPM/RGL3 is a novel potential effector of both p21 Ras and M-Ras with the novel function of negatively regulating Elk-1-dependent gene induction downstream of p21 Ras or MEKK-1."

Using transient transfections of an osteopontin promoter-reporter construct, we have now identified the active moiety in the metastasis-inducing DNA as the binding site for the T cell factor (Tcf) family of transcription factors and located Tcf-4, β-catenin and E-cadherin in the relevant DNA complex in vitro. The regulatory effects of the metastasis-inducing DNAs are therefore exerted, at least in part, by a CAAAG sequence which can sequester Tcf-4, thereby promoting transcription of the direct effector for metastasis in this system, osteopontin."
https://openalex.org/W2056571940,"Many reports have shown a link between mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and loss of normal cell cycle control, particularly loss of G2 arrest. However almost all of these studies utilized transformed cell lines, and thus the involvement of other genes in this phenotype cannot be excluded. We have examined the effects of cisplatin treatment on primary embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice in which the MMR gene Msh2 had been inactivated (Msh2(-/-)). This analysis determined that both primary Msh2(-/-) and wild type (WT) fibroblasts exhibited an essentially identical G2 arrest following cisplatin treatment. Similarly, we observed a cisplatin-induced G2 arrest in immortalized MMR deficient (Mlh1(-/-) and Pms2(-/-)) and WT MEFs. p53 deficient primary MEFs (p53(-/-)) exhibited both a clear G2 arrest and an increase in cells with a DNA content of 8N in response to cisplatin. When the Msh2 and p53 defects were combined (p53(-/-)/Msh2(-/-)) the G2 arrest was essentially identical to the p53(-/-) fibroblasts. However, the p53(-/-)/Msh2(-/-) fibroblasts demonstrated a further increase in cells with an 8N DNA content, above that seen in the p53(-/-) fibroblasts. These results suggest that loss of MMR on its own is not enough to overcome G2 arrest following exposure to cisplatin but does play a role in preventing polyploidization, or aberrant DNA reduplication, in the absence of functional p53."

https://openalex.org/W2321626944,"The fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (FGF-BP) modulates FGF activity through binding and release from the extracellular matrix. Consequently, the expression of FGF-BP in certain tumor types is a rate-limiting regulator of FGF-mediated angiogenesis. FGF-BP is upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma by treatment with mitogens such as EGF or TPA. In this study, we investigated the regulation of FGF-BP gene expression by serum. Treatment of serum-starved ME-180 cells with fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in a rapid increase in steady-state levels of FGF-BP mRNA and in the rate of FGF-BP gene transcription. Serum induction of FGF-BP mRNA was not mediated through EGF receptor activation but was dependent on PKC, as well as ERK kinase (MEK) and p38 MAP kinase activation. Promoter analysis showed that C/EBP is the main promoter element required for the serum response. Unlike EGF-activation of FGF-BP, transcriptional induction by serum is not significantly regulated through the AP-1 or E-box sites in the promoter. These results illustrate differences between the mechanism of induction in response to serum and EGF."

https://openalex.org/W2334666800,"Line 10T1/2 mouse fibroblast overexpressing the v-Jun oncoprotein were morphologically altered, grew into multilayered foci in culture and formed colonies when suspended in agar. The growth rate of the v-Jun-transformed 10T1/2 cells was not changed significantly from that of the untransformed parental cells, but the saturation density of the transformed cultures exceeded that of normal controls by a factor of 2. mRNA extracted from v-Jun-transformed 10T1/2 cells was analysed for differential gene expression with DNA micro-array technology. One of the targets downregulated by v-Jun was identified as SSeCKS (Src-suppressed C kinase substrate). Re-expression of SSeCKS in v-Jun-transformed fibroblasts reversed the transformed phenotype of the cells. Their ability to form foci was reduced to background levels, the number and size of agar colonies was lowered by a factor of 10 and the saturation density was significantly diminished. However, expression of SSeCKS had little effect on the morphology of v-Jun-transformed 10T1/2 cells. These data suggest that the SSeCKS protein has growth-attenuating properties. Down-regulation of SSeCKS may be essential for Jun-induced transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2092648708,"Chromosomal fusions of the N-terminal region of the Ewings Sarcoma Oncogene (EWS-Activation-Domain, EAD) to the DNA-binding domains of a variety of cellular transcription factors, produce oncogenic proteins (EWS-fusion proteins (EFPs)) that cause a variety of malignancies. The EAD can act as a potent transcriptional activation domain and is required for the oncogenic activity of EFPs. Previous studies demonstrating a physical interaction between the EAD and the human RNA Polymerase II subunit hsRPB7 suggest a crucial role for RPB7 and its partner, RPB4, in EAD function. Homologues of hsRPB4/7 exist in S. cerevisiae, and here we describe an RPB4/7-dependent yeast assay for EAD-mediated trans-activation. Conditional yeast strains lacking RPB4 are defective for trans-activation by a Gal4/EAD fusion protein at the permissive temperature. Introduction of hsRPB4 alone is unable to rescue trans-activation, while a combination of hsRPB4 and hsRPB7 significantly rescues activity. These findings provide the first functional evidence for a direct role of the RPB4/7 complex in EAD-mediated trans-activation. In addition, the yeast assay provides a tractable system for further molecular analysis of EAD and RPB4/7 action."

https://openalex.org/W2330643716,"The Myb transcription factors, c-Myb, A-Myb, and B-Myb, regulate cell differentiation and/or proliferation. To investigate the role of B-Myb in embryogenesis, we introduced an inducible dominant interfering Myb protein (MERT) into embryonic stem (ES) cells, which express B-Myb as an exclusive member of Myb family. Disruption of normal B-Myb function by the conditional activation of MERT caused a drastic morphological alteration of ES cells and G1-S cell cycle arrest. The inhibition of B-Myb function by MERT dissociated tightly packed ES cell colonies into dispersed single cells that subsequently detached from the culture dish. Cell adhesion analyses revealed that suppression of B-Myb function reduced the adhesion with extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin, collagen, and fibronectin. This reduction was presumably due to decreased cell surface expression of β1 integrin. Embryoid body formation was also severely retarded by the activation of MERT. This impairment was attributed to reduced expression of E-cadherin, which functions as a homophilic intercellular adhesion molecule. Simultaneously, blocking B-Myb function did not alter the expression of differentiation markers. Our data indicate that B-Myb plays important roles in regulating cell adhesion and cell cycle progression. These results are well consistent with the recent report on the phenotype of B-Myb null mice and show that the regulation of cell adhesion is an important B-Myb function that has not yet been assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2324912202,"E2F transcription factors are key players in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation in mammalian cells. E2Fs are negatively regulated by members of the retinoblastoma protein family, Rb, p107 and p130. During adenovirus infection, viral proteins are expressed that displace Rb family members from E2Fs and recruit E2F complexes to viral and cellular promoter regions. This recruitment of E2F involves the induction of stable E2F binding to inverted E2F binding sites in the Ad E2a and cellular E2F-1 promoters and induces both viral and cellular gene expression. The cellular p107 tumor suppressor also displays such regulation of E2F DNA binding activity. p107 induces stable E2F-4/DP binding to inverted E2F binding sites in the Ad E2a and cellular E2F-1 promoters. The induction of E2F DNA binding by p107 minimally requires the sequences in p107 that mediate E2F interaction. The related tumor suppressor, p130, also effects this function. p107 levels increase substantially as cells progress through S phase. p107 induction of E2F DNA binding was observed primarily in S phase cells coincident with the increase in p107 protein levels. The results of promoter activity assays directly correlate the induction of E2F DNA binding by p107 with effective transcriptional repression. These results support a model in which p107 and p130 induce the stable binding of E2F complexes to promoters that drive expression of critical regulatory proteins such as E2F-1. Since p107 and p130 bind histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) which repress promoter activity, p107-E2F and p130-E2F would stably recruit repressor complexes to effect efficient promoter repression."
https://openalex.org/W2331147346,"The c-myb gene encodes a transcription factor that is central to hematopoietic cell growth. Phosphorylation of c-Myb by casein kinase 2 (CK2) at serines 11 and 12 has been variously implicated in the regulation of DNA binding. However, it is unclear when c-Myb phosphorylation at serines 11 and 12 occurs during the cell cycle and how this is regulated. We generated specific antisera that recognize phosphoserines 11 and 12 of c-Myb. C-Myb protein levels, extent of CK2 phosphorylation and DNA binding were then monitored following mitogenic stimulus and passage through the cell cycle in normal peripheral T-cells and the T leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM. We found that endogenous c-Myb is constitutively phosphorylated at serines 11 and 12. The amount of phosphorylated c-Myb correlates with DNA binding activity in cycling CEM cells but not upon entry of T-cells into the cell cycle. Exogenous expression of c-Myb with substitutions of serines 11 and 12 with glutamic acid or alanine had no effect on the transactivation of a c-Myb responsive reporter. These data strongly suggest that c-Myb is constitutively phosphorylated on serines 11 and 12 by CK2 or like activity and is not regulated during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2330182218,"Cellular proliferation and survival are modulated by the expression of specific genes. Cytokine response gene 8 (CR8), which was originally cloned as an IL-2-induced gene in human T lymphocytes, encodes a basic helix--loop--helix (bHLH) transcription factor. The CR8 gene product is highly conserved among human, mouse and rat, and contains sequence motifs that distinguish it from other bHLH families. The CR8 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and CR8 gene expression is induced by both growth-promoting as well as growth-inhibitory stimuli. As bHLH proteins have been found to regulate both the G1-S phase cell cycle transition, as well as cellular survival, the effects of CR8 on these processes were investigated. Ectopic CR8 expression in asynchronous U2OS cell cultures reduces the percentage of cells in the cell cycle S phase, and also slows the entry of G1-synchronized cells into S phase. The prolonged G1 interval correlates with impaired elevation of cyclin E protein and prolonged p21 protein expression in G1. CR8 expression also protects U2OS cells from serum-withdrawal induced apoptosis. These results indicate that CR8 is an important modulator of both the G1-S phase cell cycle transition, and cellular survival."
https://openalex.org/W2033094460,"Three monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were generated against p53 DNA-binding core domain. When tested by immunoprecipitation, Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques, Mab 9E4, as well as 7D3 and 6B10 reacted with both wild-type and various mutant p53 proteins. The epitopes recognized by Mabs 7D3, 9E4 and 6B10 were located respectively within the amino acid residues 211-220, 281-290 and 291-300 of human p53 protein. The epitope recognized by 9E4 Mab coincides with helix 2, also called p53 DNA binding helix, which allows the direct contact of the protein with its target DNA sequences. This antibody may be useful to study transcription-dependent and transcription-independent activities of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins."
