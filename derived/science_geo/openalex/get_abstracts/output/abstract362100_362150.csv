https://openalex.org/W2161091841,"Metastatic progression depends on genetic alterations intrinsic to cancer cells as well as the inflammatory microenvironment of advanced tumours. To understand how cancer cells affect the inflammatory microenvironment, we conducted a biochemical screen for macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. Here we show that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) through activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members TLR2 and TLR6. Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of LLC-conditioned medium (LCM) led to identification of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumours including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2 and its co-receptors TLR6 and CD14. By activating TLR2:TLR6 complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. These results explain how advanced cancer cells usurp components of the host innate immune system, including bone-marrow-derived myeloid progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for metastatic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2017971345,"Most pathogens require a relatively long period of development in their mosquito vector before they can be transmitted to a new human host; hence, only older insects are of epidemiological importance. The successful transfer of a life-shortening strain of the inherited bacterial symbiont, Wolbachia , into the major mosquito vector of dengue, Aedes aegypti , halved adult life span under laboratory conditions. The association is stable, and the Wolbachia strain is maternally inherited at high frequency. It is capable of inducing complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, which should facilitate its invasion into natural field populations and its persistence over time. Our data suggest that targeting mosquito age with inherited Wolbachia infections may be a viable strategy to reduce the transmission of pathogens such as dengue viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2040442527,"When students answer an in-class conceptual question individually using clickers, discuss it with their neighbors, and then revote on the same question, the percentage of correct answers typically increases. This outcome could result from gains in understanding during discussion, or simply from peer influence of knowledgeable students on their neighbors. To distinguish between these alternatives in an undergraduate genetics course, we followed the above exercise with a second, similar (isomorphic) question on the same concept that students answered individually. Our results indicate that peer discussion enhances understanding, even when none of the students in a discussion group originally knows the correct answer."

https://openalex.org/W1992810019,"The assembly of nanoparticles into three-dimensional (3D) architectures could allow for greater control of the interactions between these particles or with molecules. DNA tubes are known to form through either self-association of multi-helix DNA bundle structures or closing up of 2D DNA tile lattices. By the attachment of single-stranded DNA to gold nanoparticles, nanotubes of various 3D architectures can form, ranging in shape from stacked rings to single spirals, double spirals, and nested spirals. The nanoparticles are active elements that control the preference for specific tube conformations through size-dependent steric repulsion effects. For example, we can control the tube assembly to favor stacked-ring structures using 10-nanometer gold nanoparticles. Electron tomography revealed a left-handed chirality in the spiral tubes, double-wall tube features, and conformational transitions between tubes."
https://openalex.org/W2036387847,"Reef-building corals are under increasing physiological stress from a changing climate and ocean absorption of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. We investigated 328 colonies of massive Porites corals from 69 reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia. Their skeletal records show that throughout the GBR, calcification has declined by 14.2% since 1990, predominantly because extension (linear growth) has declined by 13.3%. The data suggest that such a severe and sudden decline in calcification is unprecedented in at least the past 400 years. Calcification increases linearly with increasing large-scale sea surface temperature but responds nonlinearly to annual temperature anomalies. The causes of the decline remain unknown; however, this study suggests that increasing temperature stress and a declining saturation state of seawater aragonite may be diminishing the ability of GBR corals to deposit calcium carbonate."

https://openalex.org/W2021067696,"Iridescence, the change in hue of a surface with varying observation angles, is used by insects, birds, fish, and reptiles for species recognition and mate selection. We identified iridescence in flowers of Hibiscus trionum and Tulipa species and demonstrated that iridescence is generated through diffraction gratings that might be widespread among flowering plants. Although iridescence might be expected to increase attractiveness, it might also compromise target identification because the object's appearance will vary depending on the viewer's perspective. We found that bumblebees ( Bombus terrestris ) learn to disentangle flower iridescence from color and correctly identify iridescent flowers despite their continuously changing appearance. This ability is retained in the absence of cues from polarized light or ultraviolet reflectance associated with diffraction gratings."
https://openalex.org/W2157651345,"Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for the evolution of human cooperation. Our behaviour towards other people depends not only on what they have done to us but also on what they have done to others. Indirect reciprocity works through reputation. The standard model of indirect reciprocity offers a binary choice: people can either cooperate or defect. Cooperation implies a cost for the donor and a benefit for the recipient. Defection has no cost and yields no benefit. Currently there is considerable interest in studying the effect of costly (or altruistic) punishment on human behaviour. Punishment implies a cost for the punished person. Costly punishment means that the punisher also pays a cost. It has been suggested that costly punishment between individuals can promote cooperation. Here we study the role of costly punishment in an explicit model of indirect reciprocity. We analyse all social norms, which depend on the action of the donor and the reputation of the recipient. We allow errors in assigning reputation and study gossip as a mechanism for establishing coherence. We characterize all strategies that allow the evolutionary stability of cooperation. Some of those strategies use costly punishment; others do not. We find that punishment strategies typically reduce the average payoff of the population. Consequently, there is only a small parameter region where costly punishment leads to an efficient equilibrium. In most cases the population does better by not using costly punishment. The efficient strategy for indirect reciprocity is to withhold help for defectors rather than punishing them."

https://openalex.org/W2069276966,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy controls the degradation of selective cytosolic proteins and may protect neurons against degeneration. In a neuronal cell line, we found that chaperone-mediated autophagy regulated the activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a transcription factor required for neuronal survival. MEF2D was observed to continuously shuttle to the cytoplasm, interact with the chaperone Hsc70, and undergo degradation. Inhibition of chaperone-mediated autophagy caused accumulation of inactive MEF2D in the cytoplasm. MEF2D levels were increased in the brains of α-synuclein transgenic mice and patients with Parkinson's disease. Wild-type α-synuclein and a Parkinson's disease–associated mutant disrupted the MEF2D-Hsc70 binding and led to neuronal death. Thus, chaperone-mediated autophagy modulates the neuronal survival machinery, and dysregulation of this pathway is associated with Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1977893904,"Because bacteriophages generally parasitize only closely related bacteria, it is assumed that phage-mediated genetic exchange occurs primarily within species. Here we report that staphylococcal pathogenenicity islands, containing superantigen genes, and other mobile elements transferred to Listeria monocytogenes at the same high frequencies as they transfer within Staphylococcus aureus. Several staphylococcal phages transduced L. monocytogenes but could not form plaques. In an experiment modeling phage therapy for bovine mastitis, we observed pathogenicity island transfer between S. aureus and L. monocytogenes in raw milk. Thus, phages may participate in a far more expansive network of genetic information exchange among bacteria of different species than originally thought, with important implications for the evolution of human pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2098194949,"Large-scale testing of educational outcomes benefits already from technological applications that address logistics such as development, administration, and scoring of tests, as well as reporting of results. Innovative applications of technology also provide rich, authentic tasks that challenge the sorts of integrated knowledge, critical thinking, and problem solving seldom well addressed in paper-based tests. Such tasks can be used on both large-scale and classroom-based assessments. Balanced assessment systems can be developed that integrate curriculum-embedded, benchmark, and summative assessments across classroom, district, state, national, and international levels. We discuss here the potential of technology to launch a new era of integrated, learning-centered assessment systems."
https://openalex.org/W1983241545,"Background S1PL is an aldehyde-lyase that irreversibly cleaves sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in the terminal step of sphingolipid catabolism. Because S1P modulates a wide range of physiological processes, its concentration must be tightly regulated within both intracellular and extracellular environments. Methodology In order to better understand the function of S1PL in this regulatory pathway, we assessed the in vivo effects of different levels of S1PL activity using knockout (KO) and humanized mouse models. Principal Findings Our analysis showed that all S1PL-deficient genetic models in this study displayed lymphopenia, with sequestration of mature T cells in the thymus and lymph nodes. In addition to the lymphoid phenotypes, S1PL KO mice (S1PL−/−) also developed myeloid cell hyperplasia and significant lesions in the lung, heart, urinary tract, and bone, and had a markedly reduced life span. The humanized knock-in mice harboring one allele (S1PLH/−) or two alleles (S1PLH/H) of human S1PL expressed less than 10 and 20% of normal S1PL activity, respectively. This partial restoration of S1PL activity was sufficient to fully protect both humanized mouse lines from the lethal non-lymphoid lesions that developed in S1PL−/− mice, but failed to restore normal T-cell development and trafficking. Detailed analysis of T-cell compartments indicated that complete absence of S1PL affected both maturation/development and egress of mature T cells from the thymus, whereas low level S1PL activity affected T-cell egress more than differentiation. Significance These findings demonstrate that lymphocyte trafficking is particularly sensitive to variations in S1PL activity and suggest that there is a window in which partial inhibition of S1PL could produce therapeutic levels of immunosuppression without causing clinically significant S1P-related lesions in non-lymphoid target organs."
https://openalex.org/W2141209723,"The Mott insulating state is a manifestation of strong electron interactions in nominally metallic systems. Using transport spectroscopy, we showed that an energy gap exists in nominally metallic carbon nanotubes and occurs in addition to the band gap in small–band-gap nanotubes, indicating that carbon nanotubes are never metallic. This gap has a magnitude of ∼10 to 100 milli–electron volts and a nanotube radius ( r ) dependence of ∼1/ r , which is in good agreement with predictions for a nanotube Mott insulating state. We also observed neutral excitations within the gap, as predicted for this state. Our results underscore nanotubes' exceptional capabilities for use in studying correlated electron phenomena in one dimension."
https://openalex.org/W2041784109,"We report abundant nanodiamonds in sediments dating to 12.9 ± 0.1 thousand calendar years before the present at multiple locations across North America. Selected area electron diffraction patterns reveal two diamond allotropes in this boundary layer but not above or below that interval. Cubic diamonds form under high temperature-pressure regimes, and n-diamonds also require extraordinary conditions, well outside the range of Earth's typical surficial processes but common to cosmic impacts. N-diamond concentrations range from ≈10 to 3700 parts per billion by weight, comparable to amounts found in known impact layers. These diamonds provide strong evidence for Earth's collision with a rare swarm of carbonaceous chondrites or comets at the onset of the Younger Dryas cool interval, producing multiple airbursts and possible surface impacts, with severe repercussions for plants, animals, and humans in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2093019166,"Bacterial endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide elicits inflammatory responses and also elevates circulating levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) and impairs insulin sensitivity. Serum FFA elevation in acute endotoxemia has long been thought to be due to endotoxin dysregulating lipid disposal and counterregulatory hormones and cytokines. Here, we investigated the direct lipolysis effect of endotoxin in rodents and in isolated primary adipocytes. Endotoxin increases lipolysis in vivo in adipose tissues, elevates circulating FFA level, induces insulin resistance in rats, and directly stimulates chronic lipolysis in vitro in adipocytes. The lipolytic action of endotoxin is mediated via its lipid A moiety and is blocked by anti-endotoxin peptides. Neither adipocytokine secretion nor nuclear factor-κB activation is involved in endotoxin-induced lipolysis. Different from catecholamine, endotoxin stimulates lipolysis without elevating cAMP production and activating protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Instead, endotoxin induces phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. Upon inhibition of ERK1/2 but not JNK and p38 MAPK, endotoxin-stimulated lipolysis ceases. Endotoxin causes perilipin down-regulation and phosphorylation and increases the activity and protein levels of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase but does not induce hormone-sensitive lipase translocation to intracellular lipid droplets. In TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4)-deficient mice and adipocytes, endotoxin fails to increase in vivo and in vitro lipolysis. These findings suggest that endotoxin stimulates lipolysis via TLR4 and ERK1/2 signaling in adipocytes.

However, the cellular basis for endotoxin-mediated metabolic changes, particularly for the elevated level of circulating FFA, is incompletely understood. Triglyceride hydrolysis (lipolysis) in adipocytes produces glycerol and FFA. Due to the lack of glycerol kinase in normal adipose cells (8Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Matthews C.K. van Holde K.E. Matthews C.K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. Benjamin-Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1996: 819-859Google Scholar), glycerol cannot be reutilized for triglyceride resynthesis, but in company with FFA, it is released to the plasma. Regulation of circulating FFA concentrations depends mainly on the lipolysis of adipocytes in response to various hormones. Catecholamines stimulate lipolysis via elevating cellular cAMP level and activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (10Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1765-1776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they seem not to be the only lipolytic stimulators that account for elevated level of serum FFA. For example, adrenergic or interleukin-1 receptor antagonists and TNF-α-neutralizing antibodies cannot sufficiently prevent increases in serum levels of FFA and triglycerides in endotoxemic rats (6Feingold K.R. Staprans I. Memon R.A. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Doerrler W. Dinarello C.A. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1765-1776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nonogaki K. Moser A.H.

Early studies showed that hormone-stimulated lipolysis may be enhanced in adipocytes isolated from LPS-injected rats (14Spitzer J.A. Deaciuc I.V. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Spitzer J.A. Fish R.E. Circ. Shock. 1986; 18: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar) or in adipocytes briefly exposed to endotoxin (16Hikawyj-Yevich I. Spitzer J.A. J. Surg. Res. 1977; 23: 106-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); in addition, LPS seemed to elevate lipolysis in the fragments of adipose tissues around lymph nodes of guinea pigs (17Pond C.M. Mattacks C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2219-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations imply that endotoxin could directly act on adipose tissues to modulate lipolysis. Nevertheless, other studies showed that short term (2-h) stimulation with LPS could not induce lipolysis in pig adipocytes (18Ajuwon K.M. Spurlock M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R608-R611Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and incubation with a conditioned medium of LPS-stimulated macrophages increased lipolysis, but the effect was thought to result from LPS-elevated TNF-α secretion in the medium (19Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, the direct effect of LPS in adipose lipolysis and its association with an elevated level of serum FFAs in endotoxemia remain unclear. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanism of LPS-induced FFA elevation, this study was designed to investigate the in vivo and in vitro lipolytic actions of LPS in primary adipocytes and adipose tissues in rodents. LPS directly stimulated chronic lipolysis, which did not rely on elevation of cellular cAMP level and activation of PKA, PKC, or nuclear factor-κB (NFκB). Instead, LPS-stimulated lipolysis was mediated by TLR4 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling and was involved in down-regulation and phosphorylation of perilipins and increased activity and protein levels of HSL and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). In TLR4-deficient adipocytes and mice, LPS failed to activate lipolysis and was unable to elevate serum FFA level. These findings reveal a novel pathway of LPS stimulating lipolysis via TLR4 and ERK1/2 signaling and increasing FFA efflux from adipocytes to the bloodstream, thus elevating systemic FFA levels and thereby impairing insulin sensitivity in acute endotoxemia or Gram-negative bacterial infection. Materials—LPS from Escherichia coli serotype O55:B5 and O127:B8, detoxified LPS from E. coli O127: B8, diphosphoryl lipid A derived from E. coli F583 (Rd mutant), and phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Sigma. LPS from Salmonella Minnesota rough mutant strain 595 was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Antibodies against rat perilipin and HSL were generous gifts from Dr. Londos at the United States National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Animals—The animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University Health Science Center. C3H/HeJ mouse is a TRL4 mutant because of a point mutation within the coding region of the Tlr4 gene, whereas the C3H/HeN substrain mouse is TLR4 normal (20Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) and served as the control. The C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice were from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-220 g) were injected intravenously with LPS or saline and sacrificed at 12 h after administration. The blood samples were collected for bioassays with the use of commercial kits. Subsequently, epididymal fat tissues were isolated and used for lipolysis assay. Isolation and Culture of Primary Adipocytes—Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of normal or injected Sprague-Dawley rats (150-180 g) and C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice according to our laboratory method (21He J.

The minced fat pads were digested in Krebs-Ringer solution containing 0.75 mg/ml type I collagenase, 200 nm adenosine, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% defatted bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 40 min at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking at 100 cycles/min, adipocytes were filtered through a nylon mesh and washed three times with warmed phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 nm adenosine. Adipocytes floating on the top of the tube were packed by centrifuging at 200 × g for 3 min. The packed cell volume of adipocytes was determined (21He J. Jiang H. Tansey J.T. Tang C. Pu S. Xu G.

Briefly, 50 μl of culture medium was mixed with 120 μl of isooctane and 80 μl of cupric acetate-pyridine and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at room temperature. The upper organic phase (80 μl) was mixed with 180 μl of the color development reagent, and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured. Glycerol Assay—Glycerol content in culture medium served as an index of lipolysis and was determined at the absorption at 490 nm (13Zu L. Jiang H. He J. Xu C. Pu S. Liu M. Xu G. Mol.

Lipolysis data were expressed as μmol of glycerol or FFA/ml of packed cell volume of adipocytes. Immunoblotting—Adipocytes were packed and lysed in sample buffer containing 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride (23Xu G. Sztalryd C. Londos C.

After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the lysate was collected, and the protein content was determined with use of a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Applygen Technologies, Beijing, China). For immunoblot detection of phosphorylated perilipin, a low bis concentration polyacrylamide gel (10% acrylamide and 0.07% N,N-methylene-bisacrylamide) was used, which provides better resolution of proteins in the 60-70-kDa range (21He J. Jiang H. Tansey J.T. Tang C. Pu S. Xu G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis and transferring, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with nonfat milk and immunoblotted with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed with the use of enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Applygen Technologies, Beijing, China). If required, the blots were stripped and reprobed. Densitometric analysis of protein bands involved the use of NIHImage software. cAMP Radioimmunoassay—According to our previous method (13Zu L. Jiang H. He J. Xu C. Pu S. Liu M. Xu G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), adipocytes (20 μl) were lysed in 150 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. After vortexing and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, 90 μl of cytosol fraction was mixed with 30 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were incubated on ice for 5 min, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used for cAMP assay according to the protocol of the commercial 125I-radioimmunoassay kit (Isotope Laboratory of Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China). Cellular cAMP concentration was expressed as pmol of cAMP/mg of proteins. Lipase Activity of [3H]Triolein Hydrolysis—150 μl of packed adipocytes or 150 mg of minced adipose tissues was homogenized in 150 μl of cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cytosol fraction (150 μl) was added to the reaction consisting of triolein, [3H]triolein, and arabic gum. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, when the adipose lipases hydrolyze emulsified [3H]triolein to produce [3H]oleic acid. The released [3H]oleic acid was partitioned in methanol/chloroform/heptane solvent and separated to a potassium carbonate-boric acid buffer (25Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) then quantified by a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactive quantification represented lipase activity and was normalized to mg of tissue protein or ml of PVC of adipocytes. Differentiation of Rat Preadipocytes and Immunostaining of HSL—Preadipocytes were isolated from rat epididymal fat pads and differentiated into adipocytes for 3 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 33 μm biotin, and 200 pm triiodothyronine, as we previously described (21He J. Jiang H. Tansey J.T. Tang C. Pu S. Xu G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Jiang H. He J. Pu S. Tang C. Xu G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The differentiated adipocytes (day 5) were stimulated with LPS. Immunostaining of HSL was performed according to our prior method The cells were fixed and immunostained with rabbit anti-sera against HSL and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (22Jiang H.

Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance Tukey's test or Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In Vivo and in Vitro Lipolytic Effects of LPS—We first investigated the effect of LPS on adipose lipolysis and its relation with circulating lipids alteration in rats. The rats were ad libitum fed (n = 5) or fasted (n = 5) for 8 h and then injected intravenously with saline or LPS (E. coli O127:B8, 100 μg/kg body weight) and were sacrificed 12 h after injection. The serum concentrations of triglycerides and total cholesterols were increased in fasted rats but were decreased in ad libitum-fed rats treated with LPS. LPS treatment elevated the serum concentrations of FFA and glycerol slightly in fasted rats but markedly in fed rats (Fig. 1A). After a 60-min incubation, the rate of glycerol release was increased in epididymal adipose tissues isolated only from LPS-treated rats but not from saline-injected rats (Fig. 1B), indicating that LPS increased lipolysis in vivo in adipose tissues. Next, we determined whether LPS directly stimulates lipolysis ex vivo in adipose tissues and in primary adipocytes isolated from normal rats. Epididymal adipose tissue pieces stimulated by 1 μg/ml LPS showed a slight increase of glycerol release at 6 h but a significant 2-fold increase at 24 h (Fig. 1C). Primary rat adipocytes were incubated for 24 h with LPS; LPS at 0.1 μg/ml readily increased glycerol release and, at 1-10 μg/ml, significantly elevated lipolysis, which revealed that LPS directly stimulated lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). LPS at >10 μg/ml impaired adipocyte viability, as indicated by leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from adipocytes (data not shown). LPS at 1 μg/ml induced glycerol and FFA release at 6-8 h, with gradual acceleration at 16 and 24 h (Fig. 1, E and F), which suggested that LPS stimulated chronic lipolysis in a time-dependent manner. LPS-stimulated Lipolysis Depends on Its Lipid A Moiety and Is Specifically Blocked by Anti-endotoxin Peptides—Since lipid A is the active moiety that ensures the biological effects of LPS (1Miller S.I. Ernst R.K. Bader M.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 2Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), we examined whether the lipid A fraction is crucial for LPS-stimulated lipolysis. Primary adipocytes were stimulated with three different species of LPS: from the Salmonella minnesota rough mutant strain 595 and from E. coli serotype O55:B5 and O127:B8. These LPS species stimulated glycerol release to a similar magnitude (Fig. 2A). In contrast, detoxified LPS (E. coli O127:B8) devoid of the active lipid A part failed to increase glycerol and FFA release, whereas diphosphoryl lipid A (E. coli F583) alone sufficiently stimulated robust lipolysis similar to that with LPS-induced lipolysis (Fig. 2, B and C). Polymyxin B (Sigma) is a peptide antibiotic that can bind and neutralize LPS (26Bhor V.M. Thomas C.J. Surolia N. Surolia A. Mol. Biosyst. 2005; 1: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BNEP (Hybio Engineering Co., Shenzhen, China) is a synthetic endotoxin-neutralizing peptide consisting of the 148-161 amino acids of bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (27Jiang Z. Hong Z. Guo W. Xiaoyun G. Gengfa L. Yongning L. Guangxia X. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2004; 4: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of the lipolytic action of LPS, adipocytes were preincubated for 1 h with polymyxin B or BNEP and then stimulated for 24 h with LPS or TNF-α. Polymyxin B at 500 units/ml attenuated LPS-induced glycerol release by 71%, and at 1,000 units/ml, it completely blocked the lipolysis (Fig. 2D). Similarly, BNEP efficiently abrogated the lipolysis response to LPS but did not affect TNF-α-induced lipolysis (Fig. 2E). Adipocytokine or NFκB Activation Is Not Involved in LPS-stimulated Lipolysis—An early study showed that the conditioned medium of LPS-stimulated macrophages increased lipolysis, but this effect may have resulted from increased TNF-α secretion from LPS-stimulated microphages (19Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the cytokine secretion from adipocytes accounts for LPS-stimulated lipolysis. The conditioned medium and parallel control medium were collected after primary adipocytes were incubated for 24 h with or without 100 ng/ml LPS, and glycerol accumulation was monitored (Fig. 3A). Fresh primary adipocytes were then incubated for 24 h in the conditioned and control media in the presence or absence of BNEP to neutralize the original LPS residues. Then the media were removed, and the adipocytes were incubated for another 60 min in the fresh medium. In the conditioned medium with LPS, glycerol release was elevated by 44%, but this effect was completely abolished when the original LPS in the conditioned medium was neutralized by BNEP (Fig. 3B), which suggests that adipocytokine production of LPS-stimulated adipocytes was not sufficient to induce detectable lipolysis. The parallel control medium without LPS did not affect lipolysis (Fig. 3B). Since NFκB activation modulates TNF-α-induced lipolysis (28Laurencikiene J. van Harmelen V. Arvidsson Nordstrom E. Dicker A. Blomqvist L. Naslund E. Langin D. Arner P. Ryden M. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we examined whether NFκB signaling participates in LPS-stimulated lipolysis. Immunoblot analysis showed that the addition of 1 μg/ml LPS slightly promoted phosphorylation of IκB kinase α/β (Ikkα/β) and inhibitory IκB α (IκBα), two upstream kinases responsible for NFκB activation (Fig. 3C). Adipocytes were pretreated for 1 h with the NFκB inhibitors, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), or SN50, and incubated for 24 h with 1 μg/ml LPS. PDTC at 1, 10, or 100 μm did not inhibit glycerol (Fig. 3D) and FFA (Fig. 3E) release from LPS-stimulated adipocytes. Similarly, SN50 at 10, 50, or 100 μg/ml did not suppress LPS-induced glycerol release (Fig. 3F). These data indicate that NFκB signaling did not mediate LPS-induced lipolysis. cAMP/PKA and PKC Are Not Involved in Regulation of LPS-stimulated Lipolysis—Intracellular elevated cAMP level and PKA activation regulate lipolysis stimulation of catecholamines or TNF-α (10Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Zu L. Jiang H. He J. Xu C. Pu S. Liu M. Xu G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); PKC also modulates lipolysis (29Fricke K. Heitland A. Maronde E. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4940-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Gorin E. Tai L.R. Honeyman T.W. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We examined whether these signaling pathways mediate LPS-stimulated lipolysis. Radioimmunoassay data showed that incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for 24 h did not increase adipocyte cAMP production, whereas short term (30-min) stimulation with the lipolytic agent isoproterenol significantly elevated cellular cAMP content (Fig. 4A). PKA activation was analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against a specific motif (RRX(S/T)) of PKA phosphosubstrate (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA). Isoproterenol quickly increased PKA phosphosubstrate level (Fig. 4B), but stimulation with 1 μg/ml LPS for 0.5, 2, 6, or 24 h did not increase PKA phosphosubstrate level (Fig. 4C). The PKA inhibitor H89 blocked isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol release but failed to inhibit the lipolysis response to LPS (Fig. 4, D and E) or lipid A (Fig. 4F). Inhibition of PKC with 50 nm chelerythrine chloride or 5 μm Ro-31-8220 did not suppress glycerol release stimulated by LPS (Fig. 4E) or lipid A (Fig. 4F); by contrast, the addition of Ro-31-8220 sufficiently attenuated the lipolysis response to an PKC activator, 1.5 μm phorbol myristate acetate (Fig. 4G), as a positive control). ERK1/2 Activation Mediates Lipolysis Stimulation by LPS and Lipid A—ERK1/2 activation is another important event during lipolysis. Immunoblot results showed that the addition of 1 μg/ml LPS in adipocytes caused a rapid phosphorylation of Raf-1, an upstream serine/threonine kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (Fig. 5A). Subsequently, LPS increased the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (ERK1/2 MAPK kinase) and ERK1/2 (Fig. 5, A and B). By contrast, LP"
https://openalex.org/W1969296052,"Self-gravity plays a decisive role in the final stages of star formation, where dense cores (size approximately 0.1 parsecs) inside molecular clouds collapse to form star-plus-disk systems. But self-gravity's role at earlier times (and on larger length scales, such as approximately 1 parsec) is unclear; some molecular cloud simulations that do not include self-gravity suggest that 'turbulent fragmentation' alone is sufficient to create a mass distribution of dense cores that resembles, and sets, the stellar initial mass function. Here we report a 'dendrogram' (hierarchical tree-diagram) analysis that reveals that self-gravity plays a significant role over the full range of possible scales traced by (13)CO observations in the L1448 molecular cloud, but not everywhere in the observed region. In particular, more than 90 per cent of the compact 'pre-stellar cores' traced by peaks of dust emission are projected on the sky within one of the dendrogram's self-gravitating 'leaves'. As these peaks mark the locations of already-forming stars, or of those probably about to form, a self-gravitating cocoon seems a critical condition for their existence. Turbulent fragmentation simulations without self-gravity-even of unmagnetized isothermal material-can yield mass and velocity power spectra very similar to what is observed in clouds like L1448. But a dendrogram of such a simulation shows that nearly all the gas in it (much more than in the observations) appears to be self-gravitating. A potentially significant role for gravity in 'non-self-gravitating' simulations suggests inconsistency in simulation assumptions and output, and that it is necessary to include self-gravity in any realistic simulation of the star-formation process on subparsec scales."
https://openalex.org/W2069678913,"The nuclear receptor vitamin D receptor (VDR) is known to associate with three vitamin D response element (VDREs)-containing regions within the CDKN1A (p21) gene region. Here we show in MDA-MB453 breast cancer cells that the natural VDR ligand 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) causes cyclical transcription factor binding and chromatin looping of distal VDREs to the transcription start site (TSS) of the p21 gene, leading to cyclical accumulation of the p21 mRNA. At the chromatin level, association of the mediator protein MED1 precedes both the peaks of VDR binding to VDREs and phosphorylated RNA polymerase (p-Pol II) to the TSS. The loss of co-repressor NCoR1-histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 complex and inhibitory chromatin looping from VDREs to the TSS are also initial events followed by increased acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 at the TSS prior to initiation of transcription. Simultaneous to VDR and p-Pol II peaks, chromatin loops between VDREs and the TSS are formed, and the lysine demethylase LSD1 and the histone acetyltransferase CBP are enriched in both regions. This is followed by a moderate peak in p21 transcript accumulation, repeated in cycles of 45-60 min. The transcript accumulation pattern is disturbed by siRNA inhibition of the mediator protein MED1, LSD1, NCoR1, or various HDACs, whereas CBP appears unnecessary for the response. Inhibition of MED1, HDAC4, or LSD1 by siRNA also attenuates ligand-induced chromatin looping. In conclusion, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) regulates p21 transcription by inducing cyclical chromatin looping that depends on both histone deacetylation and demethylation."

This is especially true of dietary restriction, which is implemented in many different ways among laboratories. Principal Findings In this study, we have examined the effect of laboratory stock maintenance, genotype differences and microbial infection on the ability of dietary restriction (DR) to extend life in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. None of these factors block the DR effect. Conclusions These data lend support to the idea that nutrient restriction genuinely extends lifespan in flies, and that any mechanistic discoveries made with this model are of potential relevance to the determinants of lifespan in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2064217368,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is crucial in numerous cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. TGF-β signaling is transduced by intracellular Smad proteins that are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2) prevents TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein signaling by interacting with Smads and inducing their ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Here we identified Pin1, a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase, as a novel protein binding Smads. Pin1 interacted with Smad2 and Smad3 but not Smad4; this interaction was enhanced by the phosphorylation of (S/T)P motifs in the Smad linker region. (S/T)P motif phosphorylation also enhanced the interaction of Smad2/3 with Smurf2. Pin1 reduced Smad2/3 protein levels in a manner dependent on its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Knockdown of Pin1 increased the protein levels of endogenous Smad2/3. In addition, Pin1 both enhanced the interaction of Smurf2 with Smads and enhanced Smad ubiquitination.

After TGF-β binding, the TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) phosphorylates the TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I), which in turn phosphorylates the TGF-β-specific receptor-regulated Smads Smad2 and Smad3 at C-terminal SXS motifs. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 form a complex with Smad4, a common partner Smad. This complex translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of target genes in cooperation with transcriptional activators and/or repressors. Smad proteins possess a conserved N-terminal Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain and a C-terminal MH2 domain connected by a linker region. The MH1 domain binds DNA, whereas the MH2 domain is important for receptor binding, nuclear import, and transcription (5Shi Y. Massague J.

Smurf1, which was originally identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose WW domain interacts with the PY motif in the linker region of Smad1 and Smad5, induces degradation of Smads (19Zhu H. Kavsak P.

Therefore, phosphorylation of the linker region of receptor-regulated Smads is crucial in the regulation of TGF-β family signaling. The molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad linker regions exerts these effects remains unclear. Here we identified Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), as a novel binding partner for Smad2/3. Pin1 interacted with phosphorylated (S/T)P (p(S/T)P) motifs in the linker regions of Smad2 and Smad3. This interaction inhibited TGF-β signaling by down-regulating Smad2/3 protein levels via the induction of Smurf2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Our findings revealed that Pin1 participates in the complex regulation of the Smad2/3 linker region; thus, altered expression of Pin1 in cancer cells may adversely affect TGF-β signaling.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Pin1 knock-out mice (Pin1–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)) have been described previously (21Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Constructs and Chemicals-Wild-type human Pin1 (Pin1WT) as well as the R68A/R69A (Pin1RA) and W34A (Pin1WA) Pin1 mutant constructs have been described previously (22Akiyama H. Shin R.W. Uchida C. Kitamoto T. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A catalytically inactive C113A mutant of Pin1 (Pin1CA) and various human Smad2 and Smad3 mutants were generated by point mutagenesis. Wild-type human Smad2, wild-type and deletion mutants of human Smad3, wild-type Smad4, wild-type and CA mutant Smurf2, ubiquitin, and constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (c.a.TβR-I) cDNAs have been described previously (23Nishihara A.

Saikawa K. Nakanuma Y. Yokota T. Asashima M. Koide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TGF-β3 was acquired from Novartis (East Hanover, NJ). EGF was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), whereas Juglone was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Antibodies-Anti-Smurf2 antiserum was previously described (26Fukunaga E. Inoue Y. Komiya S. Horiguchi K. Goto K. Saitoh M. Miyazawa K. Koinuma D. Hanyu A. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35660-35667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We also utilized commercially available antibodies against Myc (9E10; BD Biosciences), FLAG (M2) (Sigma-Aldrich), HA (InvivoGen; San Diego, CA), Pin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), Smad2/3 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and α-tubulin (DM1A) (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA Interference and Oligonucleotides-Stealth small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specific for Pin1, Pin1-1 (sense, 5′-CGGCAACAGCAGCAGUGGUGGCAAA-3′), and Pin1-2 (sense, 5′-GCCCUGGAGCUGAUCAACGGCUACA-3′) were purchased from Invitrogen. siRNAs were transfected into 293T or MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. GST Pull-down Assay-We subcloned Pin1 and derived mutants into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Bucking-hamshire, England). Following expression in Escherichia coli DH5α, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). COS7 cells were transfected with tagged Smad2, -3, or -4 wild-type and mutant constructs. After 24 h, cells were lysed in 1% IGEPAL CA630 in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of GST-Pin1 wild-type or mutant proteins or GST alone for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Ubiquitination Assay-We transfected cDNAs into cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. After 24 h, cells were lysed in 1% IGEPAL CA630 in lysis buffer and incubated with antibodies for 1.5–16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads for 30 min and analyzed by immunoblotting. Endogenous proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad2/3 antibody, which had been preincubated for 6 h with Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). To assess ubiquitination, 293T cells were preincubated with 2.5 μm lactacystin (Wako, Osaka, Japan) 24 h prior to cell harvest to inhibit proteasomal degradation. Quantification of Immunoblotting Data-We used the Multi Gauge version 3.0 software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for quantification of immunoblotting data. All quantification data were obtained from raw image data acquired by LAS-3000 mini luminoimage analyzer. Luciferase Assay-Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated combinations of promoter-reporter constructs and expression plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to a constant quantity using empty vector. After 24–48 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI). pGL4.75-SV40-hRluc (Promega) was used for normalization. (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc2 was generated from (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (27Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar) by replacing the plasmid backbone of pGL3 (Promega) with that of pGL4 (Promega). Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR-Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described previously (28Hayashi M. Maeda S. Aburatani H. Kitamura K. Miyoshi H. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 565-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, we extracted total RNA from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) with oligo(dT). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Invitrogen) on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following PCR primers: human fibronectin1 (sense, 5′-GAGCCATGTGTCTTACCATT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGTATTTCTGGTCCTGCTCA-3′), human Smad7 (sense, 5′-CCTTAGCCGACTCTGCGAACTA-3′; antisense, 5′-CCAGATAATTCGTTCCCCCTGT-3′), and mouse connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (sense, 5′-AAGTAAGGGACACGAACTCA-3′; antisense, 5′-ATAGTTCCTCCCACGGTAGT-3′). A dissociation curve consisting of a single peak confirmed the specificity of detected signals. In each experiment, all samples were run in duplicate. Values were normalized to those obtained for either human HPRT1 (sense, 5′-TTTGCTTTCCTTGGTCAGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTTGCGACCTTGACCATCT-3′) or mouse HPRT1 (sense, 5′-CTGGTTAAGCAGTACAGCCCCA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT-3′). Statistical Analysis-The results of the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR experiments and quantifications of immunoblotting were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using the Tukey-Kramer method. Pin1 Interacts with Smad2 and Smad3 but Not Smad4-We previously reported the identification of several Smad2-binding proteins, such as JunB and c-Ski, by yeast-two-hybrid screening of a human cDNA library with full-length Smad2 as bait (29Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This screen also determined that Pin1, a PPIase, interacted with Smad2 (data not shown). To confirm the interaction between Pin1 and Smad proteins, we incubated GST-Pin1 with lysates from COS7 cells transfected with Myc6-epitope-tagged Smad2 (Myc6-Smad2), Myc6-Smad3, or Myc6-Smad4. GST pull-down served to isolate Pin1; we then assayed for associated Smads by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody. GST-Pin1 bound Smad2 and Smad3 but not Smad4 (Fig. 1A); this interaction was potentiated by co-expression of constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (c.a.TβR-I). To determine the site of Pin1 binding to Smad3, we generated various deletion mutants of FLAG-epitope-tagged Smad3 (FLAG-Smad3). In a GST pull-down assay, Pin1 interacted with full-length and the linker + MH2 domain Smad3 but not with the MH2 or MH1 + linker domains of Smad3 (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that both the linker and the MH2 domains of Smad3 are important for the Pin1-Smad3 interaction. Pin1 specifically binds the p(S/T)P motifs of substrates through its WW domain (30Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar); there are four conserved (S/T)P motifs in the linker regions of Smad2 and Smad3. These four (S/T)P motifs are phosphorylated by MAPKs (10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 12Matsuura I. Wang G. He D. Liu F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12546-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TGF-β stimulation induces phosphorylation of both the C terminus and the linker region via MAPKs activation (7Javelaud D. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5742-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We confirmed an increase in the phosphorylation of these (S/T)P motifs in the Smad2 and Smad3 linker regions following ectopic expression of constitutively active Ras (RasG12V) or c.a.TβR-I (supplemental Fig. S2). Ectopic expression of RasG12V and c.a.TβR-I also synergistically enhanced the interaction of Pin1 with Smad2/3 (supplemental Fig. S3). To determine the contribution of these p(S/T)P motifs to the Smad3-Pin1 interaction, we mutated the Smad3 (S/T)P motifs and examined the interaction of these mutants with Pin1. Single and double point mutants (Smad3T179A, S204A/S208A, S213A) both exhibited reduced binding activity (Fig. 1B). A mutant lacking all four (S/T)P motifs (Smad3–4A) failed to interact with GST-Pin1 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the four p(S/T)P motifs in the Smad3 linker region are essential for the interaction of Pin1 with Smad3. We next tested whether Pin1 binds Smad3 in vivo. Myc6-Smad3 and either FLAG-tagged wild-type Pin1 (FLAG-Pin1WT) or a FLAG-tagged PPIase mutant of Pin1 (FLAG-Pin1CA) were co-transfected into COS7 cells with RasG12V and c.a.TβR-I. We detected the interaction of Smad3 and Pin1 by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. FLAG-Pin1CA and, to a lesser extent, FLAG-Pin1WT interacted with Smad3 in vivo (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the endogenous interaction of Pin1 with Smad2/3 in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1D). Pin1 Reduces Smad3 Protein Levels in a Manner Dependent on Its PPIase Activity-The phosphorylation-dependent interactions of Pin1 cause conformational changes in substrates that typically affect stability and function of substrate proteins (31Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T. Ivaldi G. Hahn W.C. Stukenberg P.T. Shenolikar S. Uchida T. Counter C.M. Nevins J.R. Means A.R. Sears R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 32Yeh S.E. Means A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We thus examined the effect of Pin1 on Smad2/3 protein levels. We performed experiments in the presence of c.a.TβR-I because it enhanced the effect of Pin1 on the Smad3 steady-state level (supplemental Fig. S4). Co-expression of Pin1WT decreased Smad3 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of Pin1 mutant lacking the WW domain (Pin1WA), which failed to bind to Smads (supplemental Fig. S5), did not affect Smad3 protein levels (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using Smad2 (supplemental Fig. S6). Pin1 thus appeared to cause down-regulation of Smad2/3 proteins through physical interaction. We also found that knockdown of Pin1 resulted in increase of endogenous Smad2/3 proteins in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2B), human embryo kidney 293 (supplemental Fig. S7A), and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 (supplemental Fig. S7B) cells. Notably, a PPIase mutant of Pin1 (Pin1CA) with lower enzymatic activity (supplemental Fig. S5) decreased Smad3 protein level less efficiently than Pin1WT (Fig. 2A). Consistently, Juglone, a Pin1 inhibitor, abrogated the Pin1-mediated decreases in Smad3 protein levels (Fig. 2C), although Juglone may have some nonspecific effects other than inhibition of PPIase activity. These results indicate that Pin1 decreases Smad2/3 protein levels in a manner dependent on PPIase activity. Pin1 Enhances the Interaction of Smad2/3 with Smurf2 and Induces Smurf2-mediated Ubiquitination-MAPKs inhibit BMP signaling by phosphorylating the linker region of Smad1 to induce Smurf1-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Smad1 (20Sapkota G. Alarcon C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Smad linker phosphorylation on the interaction of Smurf2 with Smad2 and Smad3. Because Smurf2WT, but not Smurf2CA, a catalytic inactive mutant of Smurf2, induced degradation of Smad2 and Smad3 (supplemental Fig. S8), we performed the experiment using Smurf2CA. Co-expression of either RasG12V or c.a.TβR-I enhanced interaction of FLAG-Smurf2CA with Myc6-Smad2 and Myc6-Smad3 (Fig. 3A). Binding enhancement seemed to result from linker phosphorylation as Myc6-Smad2/3–4A failed to bind to FLAG-Smurf2CA even in the presence of both RasG12V and c.a.TβR-I. We confirmed the endogenous interaction of Smad2/3 with Smurf2 in the presence of TGF-β and EGF (Fig. 3B). The Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination of Myc6-Smad2/3–4A was profoundly reduced (data not shown). Thus, linker phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was required for Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination. We examined the effect of Pin1 on the interaction of Smurf2 with Smad2/3 in MEFs. MEFs deficient in Pin1 (Pin1–/– MEFs) and Pin1–/– MEFs infected with a Pin1-encoding adenovirus (21Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Smad2/3 antibody. Restoration of Pin1 expression in Pin1–/– MEFs enhanced the interaction of Smurf2 with Smad2/3 in the presence of exogenous TGF-β and EGF (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Smad linker region enhances the interaction of Smurf2 with Smad2/3. We examined the effect of Pin1 on Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination of Smad3 in 293T cells expressing abundant Pin1 (data not shown). We transfected Myc6-Smad3, FLAG-ubiquitin (Fig. 3D, FLAG-Ub), and HA-Smurf2 into 293T cells with or without an siRNA specific for Pin1. Smad3 ubiquitination was detected by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody. Pin1 knockdown reduced the ubiquitination of Smad3 induced by Smurf2 in vivo (Fig. 3D), suggesting that endogenous Pin1 enhances the ubiquitination of Smad3 by Smurf2. Pin1 Negatively Regulates TGF-β Signaling-We examined the effect of Pin1 on TGF-β-induced transcription and gene expression. Overexpression of Pin1 suppressed c.a.TβR-I-induced transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). siRNA-mediated Pin1 knockdown enhanced TGF-β-induced reporter gene transcription (Fig. 4B) and up-regulated TGF-β-induced mRNA expression of several target genes, including fibronectin1 (Fig. 4C) and Smad7 (Fig. 4D), in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, TGF-β induced mRNA for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a TGF-β-induced cytokine, in Pin1–/– MEFs, and adenoviral Pin1 expression decreased the effect of TGF-β on CTGF production (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that Pin1 enhanced the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of Smad2/3 induced by Smurf2 that down-regulates TGF-β signaling. Pin1 is a member of parvulin family of PPIases that specifically recognizes p(S/T)P motifs. The enzymes catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of bound peptide at a site preceding proline (30Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 33Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Our observations thus suggest that Pin1 induces conformational change in the linker regions of Smad2/3 through binding to the phosphorylated (S/T)P motifs, which likely enables Smurf2 to interact with Smad2/3 via the PY motif and cause their degradation. The phosphorylation of (S/T)P motifs by proline-directed kinases is a major regulatory mechanism for the control of various cellular processes. Pin1 serves as a post-phosphorylation regulatory factor in multiple signaling pathways. It has been reported that Smurf1 negatively regulates BMP signaling through ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Smad1/5. Smurf1 binds to Smad1 via PY motif, and the interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation of (S/T)P motifs (20Sapkota G. Alarcon C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the study, Sapkota et al. (20Sapkota G. Alarcon C. Spagnoli F.M. Brivanlou A.H. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) suggested that phosphorylation of (S/T)P motifs enables Smurf1 binding by unmasking the PY motif or by providing additional Smurf1 docking sites that cooperate with the PY motif. In the present study, we suggest that phosphorylation of (S/T)P motifs facilitates binding of Smads to Pin1 and conformational change in Smads by Pin1, and the conformational change induces interaction of Smads with Smurfs. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of other mechanisms by which Pin1 regulates TGF-β signaling, down-regulation of Smad proteins would be one of the major mechanisms of inhibition of TGF-β signaling by Pin1. Pin1 is overexpressed in many cancer tissues. Such overexpression often correlates with increases in cyclin D1 and β-catenin (34Bao L. Kimzey A. Sauter G. Sowadski J.M. Lu K.P. Wang D. Am. J.

On the other hand, dysregulation of TGF-β signaling is often observed in cancers.

The reasons policy-makers support these programs are based on economic arguments, equity concerns, and widespread interest in education reform. Studies of laptop programs in schools report that they increase students' engagement in school, improve technology skills, and have positive effects on students' writing. However, evidence of the effectiveness of large-scale laptop programs in other learning domains is scarce. Research in many nations suggests that laptop programs will be most successful as part of balanced, comprehensive initiatives that address changes in education goals, curricula, teacher training, and assessment."

During the Neoproterozoic, severe “snowball” glaciations would have had an extreme impact on the biosphere and the atmosphere. Here, we report that sulfate extracted from carbonate lenses within a Neoproterozoic glacial diamictite suite from Svalbard, with an age of ∼635 million years ago, falls well outside the currently known natural range of triple oxygen isotope compositions and indicates that the atmosphere had either an exceptionally high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration or an utterly unfamiliar oxygen cycle during deposition of the diamictites."

https://openalex.org/W2066636585,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes polypeptide chains bearing a signal sequence as they emerge from the ribosome, and then binds its membrane-associated receptor (SR), thereby delivering the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells. SRP RNA catalytically accelerates the interaction of SRP and SR, which stimulates their guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activities, leading to dissociation of the complex. We found that although the catalytic activity of SRP RNA appeared to be constitutive, SRP RNA accelerated complex formation only when SRP was bound to a signal sequence. This crucial control step was obscured because a detergent commonly included in the reaction buffer acted as a signal peptide mimic. Thus, SRP RNA is a molecular switch that renders the SRP-SR GTPase engine responsive to signal peptide recruitment, coupling GTP hydrolysis to productive protein targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1969073576,"Daily nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis to HIV-exposed infants significantly reduces breast-milk HIV transmission. We assessed NVP-resistance in Indian infants enrolled in the ""six-week extended-dose nevirapine"" (SWEN) trial who received single-dose NVP (SD-NVP) or SWEN for prevention of breast-milk HIV transmission but who also acquired subtype C HIV infection during the first year of life.Standard population sequencing and cloning for viral subpopulations present at > or =5% frequency were used to determine HIV genotypes from 94% of the 79 infected Indian infants studied. Timing of infection was defined based on when an infant's blood sample first tested positive for HIV DNA. SWEN-exposed infants diagnosed with HIV by six weeks of age had a significantly higher prevalence of NVP-resistance than those who received SD-NVP, by both standard population sequencing (92% of 12 vs. 38% of 29; p = 0.002) and low frequency clonal analysis (92% of 12 vs. 59% of 29; p = 0.06). Likelihood of infection with NVP-resistant HIV through breast-milk among infants infected after age six weeks was substantial, but prevalence of NVP-resistance did not differ among SWEN or SD-NVP exposed infants by standard population sequencing (15% of 13 vs. 15% of 20; p = 1.00) and clonal analysis (31% of 13 vs. 40% of 20; p = 0.72). Types of NVP-resistance mutations and patterns of persistence at one year of age were similar between the two groups. NVP-resistance mutations did differ by timing of HIV infection; the Y181C variant was predominant among infants diagnosed in the first six weeks of life, compared to Y188C/H during late breast-milk transmission.Use of SWEN to prevent breast-milk HIV transmission carries a high likelihood of resistance if infection occurs in the first six weeks of life. Moreover, there was a continued risk of transmission of NVP-resistant HIV through breastfeeding during the first year of life, but did not differ between SD-NVP and SWEN groups. As with SD-NVP, the value of preventing HIV infection in a large number of infants should be considered alongside the high risk of resistance associated with extended NVP prophylaxis.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00061321."
https://openalex.org/W2013160672,"Epithelial cells expressing calprotectin, a heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins, are more resistant to bacterial invasion. To determine structural motifs that affect resistance to bacterial invasion, mutations were constructed in S100A9 targeting the calcium-binding loops I and II (E36Q, E78Q, E36Q,E78Q) and the C terminus (S100A9(1-99) and S100A9(1-112)), which contains putative antimicrobial zinc-binding and phosphorylation sites. The S100A8 and mutated S100A9 encoding plasmids were transfected into calprotectin-negative KB carcinoma cells. All transfected cells (except KB-sham) expressed 27E10-reactive heterodimers. In bacterial invasion assays with Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium), cell lines expressing S100A8 in complex with S100A9E36Q, S100A9E78Q, S100A9(1-99), or S100A9(1-112) mutants or the S100A9(1-114) (full-length) calprotectin resisted bacterial invasion better than KB-sham. When compared with KB-S100A8/A9(1-114), cells expressing truncated S100A9(1-99) or S100A9(1-112) with S100A8 also showed increased resistance to bacterial invasion. In contrast, glutamic acid residues 36 and 78 in calcium-binding loops I and II promote resistance in epithelial cells, because cells expressing S100A9E36Q,E78Q with S100A8 were unable to resist bacterial invasion. Mutations in S100A9 E36Q, E78Q were predicted to cause loss of the calcium-induced positive face in calprotectin, reducing interactions with microtubules and appearing to be crucial for keratinocyte resistance to bacterial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2033365688,"Mitochondrial respiratory enzymes play a central role in energy production in aerobic organisms. They differentiated from the α-proteobacteria-derived ancestors by adding noncatalytic subunits. An exception is Complex II (succinate: ubiquinone reductase), which is composed of four α-proteobacteria-derived catalytic subunits (SDH1-SDH4). Complex II often plays a pivotal role in adaptation of parasites in host organisms and would be a potential target for new drugs. We purified Complex II from the parasitic protist Trypanosoma cruzi and obtained the unexpected result that it consists of six hydrophilic (SDH1, SDH2N, SDH2C, and SDH5-SDH7) and six hydrophobic (SDH3, SDH4, and SDH8-SDH11) nucleus-encoded subunits. Orthologous genes for each subunit were identified in Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major. Notably, the iron-sulfur subunit was heterodimeric; SDH2N and SDH2C contain the plant-type ferredoxin domain in the N-terminal half and the bacterial ferredoxin domain in the C-terminal half, respectively. Catalytic subunits (SDH1, SDH2N plus SDH2C, SDH3, and SDH4) contain all key residues for binding of dicarboxylates and quinones, but the enzyme showed the lower affinity for both substrates and inhibitors than mammalian enzymes. In addition, the enzyme binds protoheme IX, but SDH3 lacks a ligand histidine. These unusual features are unique in the Trypanosomatida and make their Complex II a target for new chemotherapeutic agents. Mitochondrial respiratory enzymes play a central role in energy production in aerobic organisms. They differentiated from the α-proteobacteria-derived ancestors by adding noncatalytic subunits. An exception is Complex II (succinate: ubiquinone reductase), which is composed of four α-proteobacteria-derived catalytic subunits (SDH1-SDH4). Complex II often plays a pivotal role in adaptation of parasites in host organisms and would be a potential target for new drugs. We purified Complex II from the parasitic protist Trypanosoma cruzi and obtained the unexpected result that it consists of six hydrophilic (SDH1, SDH2N, SDH2C, and SDH5-SDH7) and six hydrophobic (SDH3, SDH4, and SDH8-SDH11) nucleus-encoded subunits. Orthologous genes for each subunit were identified in Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major. Notably, the iron-sulfur subunit was heterodimeric; SDH2N and SDH2C contain the plant-type ferredoxin domain in the N-terminal half and the bacterial ferredoxin domain in the C-terminal half, respectively. Catalytic subunits (SDH1, SDH2N plus SDH2C, SDH3, and SDH4) contain all key residues for binding of dicarboxylates and quinones, but the enzyme showed the lower affinity for both substrates and inhibitors than mammalian enzymes. In addition, the enzyme binds protoheme IX, but SDH3 lacks a ligand histidine. These unusual features are unique in the Trypanosomatida and make their Complex II a target for new chemotherapeutic agents. The parasitic protist Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a public health threat in Central and South America. These parasites are normally transmitted by reduviid bugs via the vector feces after a bug bite and also via transfusion of infected blood. About 16-18 million people are infected, and 100 million are at risk, but there are no definitive chemotherapeutic treatments available (1World Health Organization (2007) Report of the First Meeting of WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Neglected Tropical Diseases, pp. 1-26, Geneva, SwitzerlandGoogle Scholar).

A flavoprotein subunit (SDH1, Fp) and an iron-sulfur subunit (SDH2, Ip) form a soluble heterodimer, which then binds to a membrane anchor heterodimer, SDH3 (CybL) and SDH4 (CybS). SDH1 contains a covalently bound FAD and catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. SDH2 transfers electrons to ubiquinone via the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the N-terminal plant-type ferredoxin domain (IpN) and the [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters in the C-terminal bacterial ferredoxin domain (IpC).

Parasites grown to 6-8 × 107 cells/ml were washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.225 m sucrose, 20 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). Cells were disrupted by grinding with silicon carbide (Carborundum 440 mesh; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in the presence of a minimum volume of buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, and EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The resultant cell paste was resuspended in buffer B and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and 1000 × g for 15 min to remove silicon carbide and nuclear fraction, respectively. The mitochondrial fraction was recovered upon centrifugation of the last supernatant at 10,000 × g for 15 min, washed three times in buffer B, and resuspended to a protein concentration of ∼30 mg/ml and kept at -80 °C until use. Isolation of Complex II-All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Mitochondrial fraction (∼300 mg of protein from 10 liters culture) was brought to 70 ml with buffer C (10 mm KPi, pH 7.5), 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium malonate, EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) (2 tablets/50 ml), 1% (w/v) sucrose monolaurate SM-1200 (SML) (Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods Co., Tokyo, Japan)). The mixture was stirred for 30 min and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded at 1 ml/min onto a Source 15 Q column (1.6 inner diameter × 10 cm; GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.1% SML. After washing with 5 volumes of the same buffer, proteins were eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 150 mm at 2 ml/min. Active fractions were concentrated to ∼250 μl by ultrafiltration with Amicon Ultra-4 (molecular weight cutoff 100,000, Millipore) and subjected to gel filtration FPLC with a Superdex 200-pg 10/300 GL column (1 cm inner diameter × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) at 0.25 ml/min in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium malonate, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% SML.

Phase Partitioning of Mitochondrial Fraction with Triton X-114-Phase partitioning by Triton X-114 was performed as described previously (21Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. A total of 2-3 mg of mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium malonate, Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) (2 tablets/50 ml), protease inhibitors mixture for mammalian cell and tissue extracts (Sigma) (10 μl/ml), and 2% (v/v) Triton X-114. The mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice and kept at -30 °C overnight. After thawing, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min to separate the aqueous and detergentrich phases. The aqueous phase was brought to 2% (v/v) Triton X-114, whereas the detergent-rich fraction was brought to 1 ml with the above buffer. After incubation on ice for 10 min, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and phases separated as before. This wash step was repeated three times. Finally, the samples were dialyzed and concentrated by Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore) in the presence of 50 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm aminocaproic acid, 0.05% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SML, pH 7, and kept at -80 °C until use. Enzyme Assay-Decylubiquinone-mediated succinate-2,4 dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) reductase activity was measured at 25 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCN, 0.1 mm antimycin A (Sigma), and 0.1% SML with 63 μm decylubiquinone (Sigma) plus 60 μm DCIP. After 2 min of incubation, reduction of DCIP (∈600 = 21 mm-1 cm-1) was measured in the presence of 10 mm succinate. SQR activity was determined with 40 μm ubiquinone-2 (Q2) (Sigma, ∈278 = 12.3 mm-1 cm-1). Kinetic analysis was done with KaleidaGraph version 4.0 (Synergy Software). Miscellaneous-High resolution clear native electrophoresis (hrCNE) (22Wittig I. Karas M. Schagger H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1215-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) was performed with 4-16% Novex gels (Invitrogen) using 0.02% dodecylmaltoside and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate for the cathode buffer additives, and the Complex II band was visualized by the activity staining (23Sabar M.

Tricine-PAGE analysis was done with Novex 10-20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen), and proteins bands were sequentially stained by Sypro ruby (Invitrogen) and silver. During purification the succinate-decylubiquinone-DCIP reductase activity was monitored in a microplate spectrophotometer (Benchmark Plus, Bio-Rad). Kinetics and UV-visible absorption spectra were determined at room temperature with a V-660 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Protoheme IX and protein concentrations were determined by pyridine hemochromogen method (24Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and the micro BCA method (Pierce), respectively. Sequence alignment was done with ClustalX 2.0 (25Larkin M.A. Blackshields G.

Isolation of T. cruzi Complex II-To determine the molecular organization of T. cruzi Complex II, we purified this enzyme from epimastigote mitochondria by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography using the nonionic detergent sucrose monolaurate (Table 1). Decylubiquinone-mediated succinate: DCIP reductase activity was eluted as a single peak at each step and co-eluted with proteins and b-type cytochrome(s) at the second Superdex 200 chromatography (Fig. 2). Specific activity was increased 34-fold to 2.9 units/mg proteins, and the yield was ∼2%. A hrCNE of the pure protein identified T. cruzi Complex II as an ∼550-kDa complex (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3), which is 4-fold larger than bovine and yeast Complex II (130 kDa) and potato Complex II (150 kDa) (26Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 27Millar A.H. Eubel H. Jansch L. Kruft V. Heazlewood J.L. Braun H.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 56: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Upon phase partitioning of the mitochondrial fraction with Triton X-114, the Complex II of T. cruzi was found only in the detergent-rich fraction (data not shown). Analysis of the detergent-rich fraction by hrCNE showed the Complex II as a single band at the same position as the pure enzyme (∼550 kDa) (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4). These results indicated that the purified Complex II was obtained in its intact form. Interestingly, second dimensional analysis of both the purified Complex II and the detergent-rich fraction from phase partitioning with Triton X-114 with SDH activity showed that T. cruzi Complex II is composed of 12 subunits (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). The same subunit composition was obtained by immunoaffinity purification of the partially purified enzyme (data not shown). The apparent molecular weight of the subunits ranges from 7.3 to 63 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). Assuming the presence of equimolar amounts of subunits, a total molecular mass of Complex II would be 286.5 kDa, indicating that T. cruzi Complex II is a homodimer.TABLE 1Purification of complex II from T. cruzi mitochondriaStepProteinSuccinate:DCIP reductaseYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldMitochondria314270.0851001.0SML extract141220.16831.9Source 15Q7.87.60.972812Superdex 200 (1st)1.31.41.095.313Superdex 200 (2nd)0.150.432.871.634 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Electrophoresis analysis of T. cruzi Complex II.

All subunits, except SDH1-1, are trypanosomatid-specific and structurally unrelated to plant-specific soluble subunits (AtSDH5-AtSDH8, 5-18 kDa) (27Millar A.H. Eubel H. Jansch L. Kruft V.

All genes (except SDH6 with four copies) are present as two copies, which are assigned to either Esmeraldo or non-Esmeraldo haplotype (haploid genotype) in T. cruzi subgroup IIe. In contrast, only one copy each of the orthologues is present in T. brucei, Leishmania major, Leishmania infantum, and Leishmania brasiliensis (supplemental Table S1). N-terminal sequence analysis of SDH3 and SDH7 showed that yields of two isoforms are similar (i.e. SDH3-1:SDH3-2 = 63:37, and SDH7-1:SDH7-2 = 54:46), indicating that isoforms are expressed from each haplotype. Because truncated isoforms for SDH1 and SDH5 in the Esmeraldo haplotype (see below) are not assembled into the 12-subunit complex and SDH2N and SDH9 isoforms have the identical sequence, 512 (= 14 × 41 × 2(12-5)) kinds of heterogeneity may exist in the T. cruzi Complex II monomer (Table 2).TABLE 2Identification of genes encoding subunits for T. cruzi complex IISubunitaAlleles were named as SDH3-1 (XP_809410) and SDH3-2 (XP_810064) in the order of the accession numbers, except for SDH5.Sequence confirmedbThese are N-terminal sequences except for SDH2N and SDH8, where the N-terminal residues were blocked.Accession number or RefSeq ID at NCBI (haplotype,cHomozygous alleles located in a merged assembly of Esmeraldo (E) and non-Esmeraldo (NE) homologous sequences whose different copies were merged genes during the genome assembly are indicated by “merged.” Haplotypes for gene with more than two copies in the genome that does not belong to a merged region are not assigned (NA).

https://openalex.org/W2066150004,"The actin cytoskeleton serves as a barrier that protects mammalian cells from environmental pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Several components of antimicrobial signaling pathways have been shown to associate directly with the actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the cytoskeleton may also serve as a platform for immune-associated molecules. Here we report that retinoic acid-induced gene-I (RIG-I), an important viral RNA recognition molecule, is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and localizes predominantly to actin-enriched membrane ruffles in non-polarized epithelial cells. Subcellular localization and fractionation experiments revealed that the association between RIG-I and the actin cytoskeleton was mediated by its N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which were necessary and sufficient to induce cytoskeletal association. We also show that RIG-I plays a role in cellular migration, as ectopic expression of RIG-I enhanced cellular migration in a wound healing assay and depletion of endogenous RIG-I significantly reduced wound healing. We further show that in both cultured intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and human colon and small intestine biopsies, RIG-I is enriched at apico-lateral cell junctions and colocalizes with markers of the tight junction. Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in polarized IEC led to the rapid relocalization of RIG-I and to the induction of type I interferon signaling. These data provide evidence that RIG-I is associated with the actin cytoskeleton in non-polarized epithelial cells and with the junctional complex in polarized IECs and human intestine and colon biopsies and may point to a physiological role for RIG-I in the regulation of cellular migration.

The actin cytoskeleton is not only a fundamental component of cellular homeostasis, but in many ways also serves as the first line of host defense against an invading pathogen. Cortical actin filaments directly below the cell membrane form a complex network that provides a barrier to the penetration of viral and bacterial pathogens. This network must therefore be modulated for a pathogen to gain entry into the cell cytoplasm, most commonly via endocytic vesicles. It is therefore not surprising that many pathogens have evolved highly varied strategies to dissolve or modulate the cortical actin meshwork to facilitate cell entry and/or trafficking (1Gouin E. Welch M.D. Cossart P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Marsh M. Helenius A. Cell. 2006; 124: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Thus, the actin cytoskeleton would be ideally suited to act as a platform for immune-associated molecules to sense an invading pathogen and mount an immediate response to promote an antimicrobial state. Consistent with this, previous studies have shown that several components of the inflammatory pathway interact either directly or indirectly with the actin cytoskeleton. The Gram-positive and -negative bacterial recognition molecule nucleotide oligimerization domain 2 (NOD2) 2The abbreviations used are: NOD2, nucleotide oligimerization domain-2; CARDs, caspase activation and recruitment domains; cytoD, cytochalasin D; IFN, interferon; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor-3; MDA5, melanoma differentiation associated gene 5; IEC, intestinal epithelial cells; NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; RIG-I, retinoic acid induced gene-I; TJ, tight junction; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EGFP, epidermal growth factor protein. associates with the actin cytoskeleton (3Legrand-Poels S.

Moreover, the proinflammatory caspase caspase-11 directly interacts with the actin interacting protein (Aip1) to promote actin depolymerization mediated by cofilin (5Li J. Brieher W.M. Scimone M.L. Kang S.J. Zhu H. Yin H. von Andrian U.H. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and its activity is regulated by interaction with Flightless-1, a component of actin remodeling (6Li J. Yin H.L. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB has also been shown to interact with actin filaments, suggesting its activity may also be regulated via this association (7Are A.F. Galkin V.E. Pospelova T.V. Pinaev G.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that components of the inflammatory response tightly associate with the actin cytoskeleton and that this association may regulate inflammatory signal activation. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by the use of actin depolymerizing agents (such as cytochalasin D (cytoD)) activates NFκB signaling in monocytes (8Kustermans G. El Benna J. Piette J. Legrand-Poels S. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), human embryonic kidney (3Legrand-Poels S. Kustermans G. Bex F. Kremmer E. Kufer T.A. Piette J. J.

Physiol. 2004; 200: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Activation of NFκB often correlates with the induction of an inflammatory state, indicating that inflammatory signals are generated in response to dramatic alterations in actin cytoskeletal architecture. Taken together, these findings support a model of inflammatory signaling in response to perturbations of the actin cytoskeleton, possibly due to the activation of actin-associated inflammatory components. The innate immune system responds to essential functional components of microorganisms, which are thus broadly expressed within classes of pathogens (10Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Two functionally related intracellular viral recognition molecules recognize cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA that is produced as a replication intermediate in the life cycle of many RNA viruses. Retinoic acid-induced gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) binding to double-stranded RNA initiates signaling events resulting in translocation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF)-3 and -7 into the nucleus and subsequent induction of type I IFNs, a key component of antiviral host defense (11Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 12Tamura T. Yanai H. Savitsky D. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 535-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). RIG-I and MDA5 each contain two N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) and a C-terminal DEXD/H-box RNA helicase domain. The C-terminal domain serves as a regulatory repressor domain that masks the exposure of the CARDs to prevent downstream signaling in the absence of stimulus. Upon RNA binding, structural changes release this domain leading to exposure of the CARD domains and in the induction of downstream antiviral signals. It remains unclear if either RIG-I or MDA5 serve functions beyond that of the antimicrobial response. Deletion of RIG-I in mice leads to the development of a colitis-like phenotype characterized by severe inflammation of the colon mucosa (13Wang Y. Zhang H.X. Sun Y.P. Liu Z.X. Liu X.S. Wang L. Lu S.Y. Kong H. Liu Q.L. Li X.H. Lu Z.Y. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Bao S.S. Dai W. Wang Z.G.

Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar)). RIG-I has also been implicated as a negative regulator of granulocytic differentiation in mice (15Zhang N.N. Shen S.H. Jiang L.J. Zhang W. Zhang H.X. Sun Y.P. Li X.Y. Huang Q.H. Ge B.X. Chen S.J.

These studies would suggest that RIG-I may serve an essential role beyond that of viral RNA recognition and may actively participate in some aspect of development and/or mucosal signaling. However, the precise nature of this role remains undefined. In this study, we show that RIG-I is concentrated at sites of actin-rich membrane ruffles in non-polarized and polarized epithelial cells and plays a role in cell migration. We further show that RIG-I is enriched at apico-lateral cell junctions of both cultured IECs and human colon biopsies where it colocalizes with markers of the apical tight junction (TJ) complex. The localization of RIG-I to lamellipodia and its association with the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by CARD-dependent interactions, as these domains are both necessary and sufficient to promote membrane ruffle association. Our results show that in addition to serving an important role in innate immune signaling, RIG-I is closely associated with the actin cytoskeleton and may participate in the regulation of cellular motility and migration. Cells-Caco-2 cells were cultured as described (16Coyne C.B. Voelker T. Pichla S.L. Bergelson J.M. J. Biol.

Pathog. 2001; 30: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). HEK293 and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For all studies, cells were plated in collagen-coated 8-well culture slides (Nunc) or collagen-coated culture dishes. All cells were grown for a minimum of 24 (HEK293, U2OS) or 48 (Caco-2) h prior to study. Cells were screened for mycoplasma using a PCR-based mycoplasma test (Takara Bio USA, Madison, WI) to prevent abnormalities in cellular morphology, transfection, and growth. Plasmids, siRNAs, and Transfections-All cDNAs were purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The complete open reading frame of RIG-I was isolated by PCR and cloned into the EGFP-C2 expression vectors (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) by insertion into XhoI and HindIII sites. EGFP-RIG-I-CARDs and EGFP-RIG-I-ΔCARDs constructs were constructed similarly. All constructs were verified by sequencing. A pool of four siRNAs (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool®) against RIG-I was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of Caco-2 cells with plasmids was performed using the Nucleofector System (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid transfections of HEK293 and U2OS cells were performed using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). siRNA transfections were performed with HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following transfection, cells were plated as described above and cultured for 24-48 h later. Transfection efficiencies with plasmids (as determined by EGFP expression) were 75-90 (Caco-2), 90-100 (HEK293), and 75-100% (U2OS) and transfection with Cy5-labeled siRNA was 95-100% (HEK293). Antibodies-Monoclonal antibody against ZO-1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Goat polyclonal antibodies specific for RIG-I (C-15 and L-15), and -MDA5 (C-16) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against GFP (FL, B-2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sc-25778), vimentin (sc-73258), and IRF3 (FL-425) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Calpain-2 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Endogenous RIG-I staining was confirmed with two goat polyclonal antibodies targeting unique epitopes of RIG-I: either the C terminus (C-15) or an internal region (L-15) not containing the CARDs (supplemental Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of these antibodies, we performed Western blot analysis of overexpressed EGFP-fused RIG-I full-length, ΔCARDs, or CARDs. As expected, both antibodies recognized full-length and ΔCARDs RIG-I but were incapable of recognizing only the CARDs of RIG-I (which does not contain the epitope for either antibody) (supplemental Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence Microscopy-Cultures were washed and fixed with either 4% paraformaldehyde or with ice-cold methanol/acetone (3:1). Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were captured with an inverted IX51 Olympus microscope equipped with a cooled monochrome DP30 CCD camera, and controlled by Olympus Slidebook 4.2 advanced imaging software (Olympus, Melville, NY) or a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Exton, PA). The scale bar in the figures is 10 μm. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Immunohistochemical Staining-Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded small intestine and colon biopsies were obtained under a protocol approved by The University of Chicago Institutional Review Board. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were reviewed by a surgical pathologist and only biopsies deemed normal were used in this study. Adjacent, unstained sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed. Antigen retrieval was carried out by heating sections in citrate buffer (pH 6) in a microwave oven. After quenching of endogenous peroxidase by incubation with 3% H2O2 in methanol, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in 5% nonfat milk and tissue sections were incubated with goat anti-RIG-I antibody (C-15, 4 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After washing, sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulin (R&D Microsystems), washed, developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted. Live Cell Imaging-Live cell imaging was performed on Caco-2 cells transfected with EGFP-RIG-I and grown on collagen-coated glass bottom 35-mm dishes (Wilco Imaging, San Diego, CA). Dishes containing transfected cells were transferred to a heated and CO2-controlled DH-35i microincubation system (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) positioned over an inverted IX51 Olympus microscope equipped with a cooled monochrome DP30 CCD camera, and controlled by Olympus Slidebook 4.2 advanced imaging software (Olympus). Images were captured using an Olympus UPlanApo 0.85 NA ×40 objective. Images were captured every 10 s prior to and following the addition of cytochalasin D (8 μm) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for a total of 30 min. Reporter Gene Assays-Activation of IFNβ or NFκB promoters were measured by reporter assay. Caco-2 cells were transfected in 24-well plates (as described above) with p-125 Luc (IFNβ) or NFκB reporter plasmid together with the indicated plasmids. Luciferase activity was measured by the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activity of firefly was normalized to that of Renilla, and relative activation was determined. All experiments were performed in triplicate and conducted a minimum of three times. Cellular Fractionation-Caco-2, HEK293, or U2OS cells were cultured in collagen-coated 100-mm tissue culture dishes and subjected to subcellular fractionation using the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytosolic, membrane/organelle, nuclear, and cytoskeletal fractions were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described below. Immunoblot Analysis-Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate), and insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysates (30-50 mg) were loaded onto 4-20% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin, probed with the indicated antibodies, and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechology), and SuperSignal West Pico or West Dura chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce Biotechnology). In Vitro Wound Healing Assay-Assays were performed essentially as described (18McNeil P.L. Clarke M.F. Miyake K. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; : 12.4.1-12.4.14Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells transfected with EGFP-RIG-I, EGFP-CARDs, EGFP-ΔCARD, or EGFP-C2 vectors or with control or RIG-I siRNAs were seeded for 36 h on collagen-coated 12-well culture dishes. Wounds were induced by scratching the cell monolayer with a sterile 200-μl pipette tip. Images were captured by phase-contrast microscopy immediately following wound induction (0 h), and at 12 and 24 h post-scratching. A single wound was induced per experiment. To quantify cellular migration across the width of the wound, the length of 40 individual lines (in μm) throughout the wound were measured at each time point (from three individual wells per experiment). Data are presented as the percent of wound closure from 0 h (time of wound induction) to 12 and 24 h post-wounding. Statistical Analysis-Data are presented as mean ± S.D. A one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons were used to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05). Data are representative of experiments performed at least three times. RIG-I Localizes to Membrane Ruffles in Non-polarized Epithelial Cells-RIG-I has been described as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral infections (11Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, few studies have investigated the precise cellular localization of RIG-I. To determine the subcellular distribution of endogenous RIG-I in non-polarized epithelia, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy in human embryonic kidney HEK293 and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. We found that in both HEK293 and U2OS cells, endogenous RIG-I localized extensively to membrane ruffles where it colocalized with F-actin (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, the RIG-I-related molecule MDA5 was strictly localized to the cytoplasm and exhibited no significant colocalization with F-actin (supplemental Fig. S2A). (This staining was specific for MDA5 as transfection of cells with MDA5 siRNA significantly reduced the level of MDA5 detected by immunofluorescence (not shown).) RIG-I also localized to areas of actin-rich membrane extensions of other non-polarized cells types such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells (not shown). Endogenous RIG-I staining was confirmed with two goat polyclonal antibodies targeting unique epitopes of RIG-I: either the C terminus (C-15) or an internal region (L-15) not containing the CARDs (for detailed characterization, see supplemental Fig. S1A). To further analyze the subcellular distribution of RIG-I, we performed cell fractionation based on detergent extraction. Immunoblot analysis of cellular fractions revealed that endogenous RIG-I was present in both the cytosolic and detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions (Fig. 1C), although the proportion of RIG-I in the cytoskeletal fraction was greater. Coupled with our localization studies, these findings confirmed that RIG-I associates with the actin cytoskeleton. Membrane ruffles (or lamellipodia) are composed of a network of branched actin filaments and are localized to the mobile end of cells. The Rho family of small GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) are pivotal components of actin cytoskeletal regulation and when activated, signal to a variety of downstream effector molecules that govern cellular movements. In particular, Rac mediates the formation of focal complex structures associated with lamellipodia/membrane ruffles. RIG-I localization to membrane ruffles was dependent on Rac GTPase activity, as treatment of cells with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of Rac (NSC23766) inhibited the formation of ruffles and led to the relocalization of RIG-I to the cell periphery (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce the formation of ruffles, RIG-I concentration in lamellipodia was enhanced (Fig. 2B). To confirm the specificity of the association between RIG-I and membrane ruffles, we constructed RIG-I fused to EGFP at its N terminus. We found that overexpressed EGFP-RIG-I also displayed enhanced localization to membrane ruffles in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D), which was abolished upon treatment of cells with NSC23766 (not shown). Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). In contrast, an EGFP control exhibited no association with membrane ruffles (Fig. 3B, top row). In addition to the association between EGFP-RIG-I and membrane ruffles, we also observed extensive colocalization between overexpressed EGFP-RIG-I and actin filaments directly below the cells surface (Fig. 1E, top). Similar to our findings with endogenous RIG-I, we found that overexpressed EGFP-RIG-I also fractionated in detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions, with additional accumulation in both the cytosolic and membrane/organelle fractions (Fig. 1F). The CARDs of RIG-I Are Necessary and Sufficient to Promote Lamellipodia Localization-RIG-I contains two N-terminal CARDs and a C-terminal DEXD/H-box RNA helicase domain. Many pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory molecules contain CARDs, which serve to not only mediate specific interactions that promote signaling, but also promote homotypic and heterotypic protein interactions. The CARDs of RIG-I are involved in homophilic CARD-CARD interactions with a downstream adaptor molecule, mitochondrial antiviral signaling (also known as VISA/IPS-1/Cardif) that activates NFκB and IRF3 to regulate type I interferon production (19Kawai T.

The CARDs of other CARD-containing proteins have been shown to mediate actin cytoskeletal association, both NOD2 and caspase-11 interact with components of the actin cytoskeleton through CARD interactions (3Legrand-Poels S. Kustermans G. Bex F. Kremmer E. Kufer T.A. Piette J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Li J. Brieher W.M. Scimone M.L. Kang S.J. Zhu H. Yin H. von Andrian U.H. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine which domain of RIG-I was involved in its association with the actin cytoskeleton, we constructed EGFP-tagged constructs of RIG-I lacking both CARDs (RIG-I ΔCARDs) or containing the CARDs alone (RIG-I CARDs) and determined their extent of cytoskeletal association by subcellular localization and fractionation studies (Fig. 3A). Confocal microcopy studies revealed that whereas ectopically expressed EGFP-RIG-I localized extensively to membrane ruffles in U2OS cells, control EGFP did not exhibit significant ruffle association (Fig. 3B). In contrast to full-length EGFP-RIG-I, we found that EGFP-ΔCARDs exhibited no ruffle association, indicating that the CARDs of RIG-I are necessary to confer actin cytoskeletal association (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, we found that EGFP-CARDs exhibited extensively lamellipodia association (Fig. 3B). We also found that Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein-tagged CARDs colocalized with EGFP-RIG-I to sites of membrane ruffles when coexpressed in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S2C). In biochemical fractionation experiments performed in HEK293 cells transfected with EGFP-tagged RIG-I constructs, we found that EGFP-ΔCARDs did not fractionate in the cytoskeletal fraction and instead resided specifically in the cytosolic and to some extent membrane/organelle fractions (Fig. 3C). In contrast, both full-length EGFP-RIG-I and EGFP-CARDs associated heavily with the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 3C). These results show that the CARDs of RIG-I are both necessary and sufficient to confer cytoskeletal association. RIG-I Plays a Role in Cellular Migration-The pronounced association between RIG-I and actin-enriched membrane ruffles led us to investigate whether RIG-I may play a role in the regulation of cell migration, a process that involves both the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments in lamellipodia. The in vitro wound healing assay is one of the earliest and most widely used means by which to measure cell migration and is based upon the healing of wounds in vivo (18McNeil P.L. Clarke M.F. Miyake K. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; : 12.4.1-12.4.14Google Scholar). Using this method, we found that overexpression of EGFP-RIG-I led to an enhancement of cellular migration in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). Concomitantly, inhibition of RIG-I expression by siRNA transfection led to a modest decrease in cellular migration (Fig. 4B). Because we found that deletion of the CARDs of RIG-I abolished ruffle association (Fig. 3, B and C), we determined if the CARDs of RIG-I were involved in the enhancement of cellular migration upon EGFP-RIG-I overexpression. To do this, we expressed EGFP-ΔCARDs and determined the effects of this overexpression on cellular migration in a wound healing assay. In contrast to our findings with ectopic EGFP-RIG-I expression, we found that overexpression of EGFP-ΔCARDs did not enhance cellular migration (Fig. 4A), indicating that the CARDs or RIG-I are necessary to induce cellular migration. RIG-I Is Associated with Membrane Ruffles in Non-confluent Caco-2 Cells-The CARD-containing bacterial recognition receptor NOD2 has been shown to localize membrane ruffles in HEK293 cells (3Legrand-Poels S. Kustermans G. Bex F. Kremmer E. Kufer T.A. Piette J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and to cellular junctions in polarized intestinal epithelial cells (4McDonald C. Chen F.F. Ollendorff V. Ogura Y.

Our data indicate that RIG-I shares a striking pattern of membrane ruffle localization with NOD2 in HEK293 cells. Because of this, we determined the localization of RIG-I in monolayers of Caco-2 cells, a cell line derived from a human colorectal carcinoma that differentiates under standard culture conditions. We found that in subconfluent Caco-2 cells, RIG-I was predominantly associated with F-actin at membrane ruffles along the cell periphery and exhibited no association with other actin-rich structures (such as stress fibers or filipodia (Fig. 5A)). Additionally, overexpressed EGFP-RIG-I also exhibit"

https://openalex.org/W2071126653,"Plants are unique among eukaryotes in having five multi-subunit nuclear RNA polymerases: the ubiquitous RNA polymerases I, II and III plus two plant-specific activities, nuclear RNA polymerases IV and V (previously known as Polymerases IVa and IVb). Pol IV and Pol V are not required for viability but play non-redundant roles in small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated pathways, including a pathway that silences retrotransposons and endogenous repeats via siRNA-directed DNA methylation. RNA polymerase activity has not been demonstrated for Polymerases IV or V in vitro, making it unclear whether they are catalytically active enzymes. Their largest and second-largest subunit sequences have diverged considerably from Pol I, II and III in the vicinity of the catalytic center, yet retain the invariant Metal A and Metal B amino acid motifs that bind magnesium ions essential for RNA polymerization. By using site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with in vivo functional assays, we show that the Metal A and Metal B motifs of Polymerases IV and V are essential for siRNA production, siRNA-directed DNA methylation, retrotransposon silencing, and the punctate nuclear localization patterns typical of both polymerases. Collectively, these data show that the minimal core sequences of polymerase active sites, the Metal A and B sites, are essential for Pol IV and Pol V biological functions, implying that both are catalytically active."

The C-subunit folds into a conserved bi-lobal core flanked by N- and C-terminal tails. We report here characterization of a C-tail loss-of-function mutant, CF327A, and a related suppressor mutant, CF327A/K285P. Phe-327 is the only residue outside the kinase core that binds to the adenine ring of ATP, whereas Lys-285 is ∼45 Å away and lies in an AGC kinase-specific insert. The two mutations were previously identified from a yeast genetic screen, where the F327A mutation was unable to complement cell growth but mutation of K285P in the same allele rescued cell viability. We show that CF327A exhibits significant reduction in catalytic efficiency, which likely explains the observed loss-of-function phenotype. Interestingly, the additional K285P mutation does not restore kinase activity but reduces the inhibitory interaction of the double mutant with RII subunits. The additional K285P mutation, thus, helps to keep a low but uninhibited PKA activity that is sufficient for cell viability. The crystal structure of CF327A/K285P further reveals that recruitment of Phe-327 to the ATP binding pocket not only contributes to the hydrophobic pocket, as previously thought, but also recruits its flanking C-tail region to the kinase core, thereby concertedly positioning the glycine-rich loop and ATP for phosphoryl transfer. The study exemplifies two different ways for regulating cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity through non-conserved residues and sheds light on the structural and functional diversity of the kinase family.

Cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 3The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; C-subunit, the catalytic subunit of PKA; R-subunit, the regulatory subunit of PKA; A domain, cAMP binding domain A of the R-subunit; B domain, cAMP binding domain B of the R-subunit; IP20, a commonly used inhibitory peptide for PKA that consists of residue 5–24 of protein kinase inhibitor (PKI); AGC, protein kinase A, kinase G and kinase C; AST, active-site tether; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine); MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. is involved in a wide range of cellular functions such as metabolism, transport, cell cycle, and gene regulation. The PKA tetrameric holoenzyme is comprised of two catalytic (C) subunits that possess kinase activity and two inhibitory regulatory (R) subunits that each have two tandem cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding domains (1Johnson D.A. Akamine P. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Taylor S.S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2243-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the absence of cAMP, the R-subunit binds to the C-subunit and blocks substrate access so as to inhibit kinase activity. Binding of cAMP to the R-subunits releases the inhibitory interactions and unleashes the C-subunit, allowing it to perform substrate phosphorylation. The R-subunit in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Bcy1p (2Cannon J.F. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2653-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As the first kinase structure solved in 1991 (3Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 4Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-h. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar), PKA C-subunit has been a paradigm of protein kinases and is best studied in terms of its structure-function relationship and kinetic properties (5Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The conserved kinase core (residues 40–300) of the C-subunit folds into an N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) with the ATP binding site formed in between. The N-lobe is comprised of a twisted β sheet formed by five β-strands and two helices (αB and αC). One of the structural features in the N-lobe is the glycine-rich loop between the β1 and β2 strands. This loop senses nucleotide binding in the active site and exhibits different conformations. The C-lobe is mainly helical (αd-αI) with highly conserved αE and αF helices forming a hydrophobic core. The two lobes are connected by the linker region (residues 120–127). The non-conserved PKA-specific N (residues 1–39) and C termini (residues 301–350) each wrap around the kinase core and interact with both lobes (Fig. 1A). The C-subunit has been crystallized in an apo conformation (6Akamine P. Madhusudan Wu J. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the structures have been categorized into open and closed conformations of the active site cleft based on the relative positions of N and the C lobes. The relative movement of the two lobes is essential for catalysis (12Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the C-tail is a hallmark of the AGC subfamily of kinases (PKA, PKG, PKC family) that provides intramolecular regulation of the kinase (13Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Kannan et al. (13Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) defined three sites conserved in AGC kinases that tether the C-tail to the kinase core: the N-lobe tether, the active-site tether (AST), and the C-lobe tether. The N-lobe tether docks the very C terminus FXXF motif (single amino acid code, X represents any amino acid) to a hydrophobic pocket above the αC helix in the N-lobe. This interaction has been shown to be conserved in the AGC kinases and plays an important role in regulating kinase activity (14Biondi R.M. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The C-lobe tether links the beginning of the C-tail (300–318) to the αE-helix and the β8 strand in the C lobe, the αC-β4 loop in the N-lobe, and the linker connecting the two lobes. The AST is the most dynamic part of the C-tail. In the apo structure when no nucleotide is bound, the tail loses contact at the AST site, causing most of the residues in this region to become disordered (Fig. 1A). An important feature of the AST is the interaction of Phe-327 with the ATP binding pocket (13Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), where Phe-327 contributes to closing the hydrophobic pocket for the adenine moiety of ATP (Fig. 1B). Many efforts have focused on the development of drug-like inhibitors targeting the ATP binding pockets of protein kinases. It has proved challenging due to the conserved features of the site. Kennedy et al. (16Kennedy E.J. Ghosh G. Pillus L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1084-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) developed a yeast genetic screen to further elucidate the function of ATP site residues and their connections to other parts of the molecule. The PKA C-subunits in S. cerevisiae are encoded by three TPK genes (TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3). PKA activity is essential for cell survival, and a nonviable phenotype was observed in a tpk-null strain (17Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, the mammalian C-subunit can replace the yeast counterparts to maintain cell viability(18Zoller M.J. Yonemoto W. Taylor S.S. Johnson K.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 4E. J. Kennedy, J. Yang, L. Pillus, S. S. Taylor, and G. Ghosh, submitted for publication. Utilizing this property, Ala mutants of eight residues that form the adenosine binding pocket (Leu-49, Val-57, Val-104, Met-120, Tyr-122, Leu-173, Thr-183, and Phe-327, Fig. 1B) were each introduced into a tpk-null strain to determine whether these mutants could maintain viability. 4E. J. Kennedy, J. Yang, L. Pillus, S. S. Taylor, and G. Ghosh, submitted for publication. Of the mutants tested, only the F327A mutant and L173A mutant failed to do so. Random mutations were then introduced to the same mutant gene harboring either the F327A or L173A mutation, and these mutagenic libraries were screened for suppression of the non-viable phenotype. Several suppressors were identified. Although some of these suppressor mutations were located near the ATP binding site, the majority were distal to the ATP pocket. One such suppressor for the F327A phenotype acquired an additional K285P mutation. 4E. J. Kennedy, J. Yang, L. Pillus, S. S. Taylor, and G. Ghosh, submitted for publication. Lys-285 is localized in the loop connecting the αH- and αI-helix (αH-αI Loop, Leu-272-Val-288, Fig. 1A) at the end of the C-lobe of the kinase, 45 Å away from the ATP pocket (Fig. 1A). This loop is part of a recently identified long-range network that connects the catalytic loop and peripheral sites on the C-lobe, including the αG-helix that contributes directly to interactions with the R-subunit (19Yang J.

Bioinformatics analysis also highlighted a five-residue insert (AGC-specific insert, Fig. 1A) within this region (Gly-282-Gly-286) that is specific to the AGC subfamily of kinases. Although they all have the insert, the sequence is different for each AGC kinase (13Kannan N. Haste N. Taylor S.S. Neuwald A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1272-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To provide a biochemical explanation of why F327A, a residue that lies outside the conserved kinase core, failed to maintain cell growth and why an additional distal site mutation of K285P rescued cell viability and, hence, to understand the function of these two uniquely located sites, we purified the mutants, compared their enzymatic properties, and solved the crystal structure of CF327A/K285P. We showed that the catalytic efficiency of F327A was reduced by ∼50-fold, and this might explain why it failed to maintain cell growth. Structural analysis further suggested that Phe-327 plays a key role in ATP binding as well as in further engaging its flanking C-tail region to interact with the kinase core to correctly orient the glycine-rich loop and ATP for catalysis. On the other hand, K285P had no effect on kinetic properties, but it affected the inhibitory interaction with the R-subunit mechanism. Our data showed that additional K285P mutation rendered the double mutant CF327A/K285P a low PKA kinase activity that was not inhibited by Bcy1p, which appeared to be sufficient for cell growth. This provided a mechanism for suppression of the F327A phenotype by a distal site mutation K285P. Materials-Inhibitory peptide IP20 (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD, residues 5–24 from the heat stable PKA inhibitor PKI) was synthesized on a Milligen peptide synthesizer and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Pre-packed Mono S 10/10 ion exchange column and Superdex 75 gel filtration column were purchased from GE Health. Crystallization reagents 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, Bicine, glycerol, and ammonium acetate were obtained from Fluka. Phosphocellulose paper p81 was from Whatman. Radioisotope labeled [γ-32P]ATP was from GE Healthcare. Other reagents were from Qiagen, Invitrogen, and Sigma-Aldrich. Purification of Yeast and Mammalian R-subunit-Recombinant yeast (Bcy1p) and mammalian (RII) R-subunits were cloned into a pRSET vector at the NdeI site to remove the polyhistidine tag. Each contained the two cAMP binding domains A and B and the inhibitory sequence without the N-terminal dimerization domain. Specifically, they were yeast Bcy1p (136–416) and rat RIIβ (108–402). Proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity using cAMP-agarose affinity resin. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 1 m pepstatin A, 1 μm leupeptin, 30 μm each of Nα-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and Nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK)). Isobutylmethylxanthine, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor was also included to protect cAMP on the resin from being degraded by cellular PDEs. After passing through a French press at 1000 p.s.i., the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Approximately 50 ml of cell lysate supernatant (from 2 to 6 liters of culture) was either batch-wise incubated with 2–5 ml of cAMP-agarose resin for 1 h at 4 °C or passed through a 5-ml prepacked cAMP-agarose column at 1 ml/min through a Profinia affinity purification system (Bio-Rad). The resin was washed with 700 mm NaCl in lysis buffer. The protein was eluted with 6 ml of 25 mm cGMP prepared in above lysis buffer, with pH adjusted to 5.5 to ensure efficient elution. Eluted protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column for further purification. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol plus 5 mm benzamidine. Protein was eluted with the same buffer. This step further purified the protein to homogeneity and efficiently removed the cGMP molecules from the cyclic nucleotide binding sites of the R-subunit. Eluted protein was stored either at 4 or -20 °C in 25% glycerol. Purification of C-subunit Mutants-C-subunit mutations of F327A, K285P, or the double mutant were introduced to the murine PKA Cα subunit in pRSET vector using the QuikChange kit by Stratagene (Agilent Technologies). All three mutants and the wild type protein were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cell and purified to homogeneity on P11 resin followed by cation exchange chromatography on pre-packed Mono S 10/10 column (GE Healthcare), as described previously (22Yang J. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression of mutant protein CK285P was similar as that of the wild type protein. Both CF327A and CF327A/K285P were coexpressed with a 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) kinase-expressing vector pGEX-PDK1 to ensure phosphorylation of Thr-197. Crystallization of CF327A/K285P-For crystallization, CF327A/K285P from a Mono S column was further purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column and eluted with 50 mm Bicine, 200 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, with 2 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was concentrated to ∼ 5 mg/ml and mixed with MgCl2, ATP, and IP20 at a molar ratio of 1:10:10:10 before setting up the crystallization trials. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion was used; each drop consisted of 1 μl of the protein mixture and 1 μl of well solution. Crystals appeared after 1–2 weeks at 4 °C at conditions of 8∼12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Data Collection and Refinement-A 2.5 Å data set was collected at the x-ray crystallography facility at University of California, San Diego equipped with Rigaku FR rotating anode generators. Data collection was performed under a liquid nitrogen stream. The cryo-protectant consisted of 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 15% glycerol, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The data set was processed and scaled using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Vol. 276.

The initial structure of CF327A/K285P was solved by molecular replacement using Crystallography and NMR System (CNS 1.1) (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Previous structures with the open (C-subunit E230Q mutant, PDB ID 1SYK) or the closed conformation (ternary complex of Y204A mutant, PDB ID 1RDQ) were tested as the searching model, with the latter structure producing a better solution. This model was refined to an R-factor of 21.2% and Rfree of 26.5%. The final model included one molecule of C-subunit from residues 14–350 (the N-terminal 13 residues were disordered), one molecule of IP20, one molecule of ADP, and 24 water molecules. As assessed by Procheck (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), 84.4% of the main chain φ-Ψ torsion angles were in the most favored region in the Ramachandran plot, with none falling in the non-allowed regions. Kinetic Assays-Kinetic analysis of the wild type and mutant C-subunits were performed by radioisotope [γ-32P]ATP labeling using LRRASLG (Kemptide) as substrate. To measure the Km for ATP, Kemptide was maintained at a fixed concentration of 0.5–1.0 mm, and the concentration of ATP was varied from 2 μm to 1 mm. To determine the Km for Kemptide, the ATP concentration was fixed at 0.5 mm, and the Kemptide concentration was varied from 2 μm to 1 mm. Reactions were carried out in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5–2 nm C-subunit, and varied concentrations of either ATP or Kemptide at 30 °C for 15 min. Reactions were quenched with 30% acetic acid. Specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was in the range of 500–2000 cpm/pmol. An ascending chromatography on phosphocellulose p81 paper (Whatman) was used to separate unreacted [γ-32P]ATP from the protein-bound radioactivity as described previously (26Prowse C.N. Deal M.S. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40817-40823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of the quenched reaction mix was spotted on pre-marked spaces on a 20 × 20 cm square sheet of p81 paper. The whole p81 sheet was then placed into a chromatography development tank containing 20 mm phosphoric acid, pH 2–2.5, where peptides or proteins did not migrate, but the unreacted [γ-32P]ATP moved upward. After separation, the spot areas were cut out, dried, and put into scintillation vials for radioactivity detection by Cerenkov counting on a Beckman LS 6000SC liquid scintillation system. Inhibition Assay by the R-subunit-Inhibition of the wild type or mutant C-subunits by Bcy1p or RII subunit was carried out under similar conditions as above. Either wild type or mutant C-subunit was incubated with varying concentrations of the R-subunit for 30 min at 30 °C. A mixture of Kemptide, ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP was then added to start the reaction. Final concentrations were 1–2 nm C-subunit, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5–1 mm Kemptide, and each R-subunit ranging from 2 μm to 1 mm. Similarly as described above, the reaction was quenched by 30% acetic acid, and phosphate incorporation into Kemptide was quantified. Curve fitting and IC50 calculations were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Residues forming the hydrophobic binding pocket for the adenine ring in PKA are shown in Fig. 1B. Phe-327 is unique in several ways. It is the only residue that lies outside the conserved core and the only one that exhibits large conformational changes in the presence and absence of the nucleotide (5Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the yeast genetic screen study by Kennedy et al.4 eight adenine binding residues were mutated to Ala and assessed for their ability to maintain cellular viability in a tpk-null strain. The F327A mutant was one of only two mutants that could not maintain cellular viability.4 We purified the CF327A mutant to homogeneity and assessed its kinetic properties. Kinetic data for the wild type enzyme in this study were comparable with previous studies (27Grant B.D. Tsigelny I. Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1316-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with a kcat of 20/s and Km for ATP and Kemptide of 20 and 11 μm, respectively. Compared with the wild type enzyme, CF327A had a similar kcat, but the Km for ATP and Kemptide increased 10- and 60-fold, respectively, reflecting a ∼50-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (Table 2). Decrease of enzymatic activity of the mutant is consistent with the loss-of-function phenotype seen in the yeast viability screen, as PKA activity is required for cell growth.TABLE 2Kinetic analysis of C-subunit mutantsKmKempkcatKmATPkcat/KmKempμms–1μmWild type C11 ± 120 ± 220 ± 31.8CF327A696262490.04CK285P10 ± 121 ± 321 ± 32.1CF327AK285P1206 ± 5125 ± 5181 ± 310.02 Open table in a new tab The genetic screen showed that although CF327A mutant failed to maintain cell viability in the tpk-null strain, the additional, distal suppressor mutation K285P restored cell growth.4 We then looked at the effect of the K285P mutation by itself and in the double mutant. CK285P had similar kinetic parameters as the wild type enzyme, with a kcat of 20.9/s, and the Km for ATP and Kemptide of 21.2 μm and 10.0 μm, respectively (Table 2). CF327A/K285P had a kcat comparable with the wild type, and the Km for ATP or Kemptide was 10- or 100-fold higher, respectively, than that of the wild type enzyme. Its kinetic properties were similar to that of CF327A. Thus, the K285P mutation did not alter kinetic properties of the enzyme, and it did not restore the reduced catalytic efficiency caused by the initial F327A mutation (Table 2). The above data suggested that the rescue of cell growth by additional K285P mutation was not due to a direct restoration of the kinase activity. This led us to the examination of the inhibitory interaction of the mutants with the R-subunits. We found that whereas the wild type C-subunit was readily inhibited by the yeast R-subunit Bcy1p with an IC50 of 4 nm, both mutations caused significant reductions in their inhibitions by Bcy1p. Although the concentration of Bcy1p required for 50% inhibition of CF327A was ∼ 300 nm, CK285P was only inhibited by ∼15% at a concentration of Bcy1p up to 1 μm. The double mutant CF327A/K285P responded similarly to Bcy1p as the CK285P (Fig. 2A). In yeast cells the concentration of Bcy1p might be high enough to cause significant inhibition of the F327A mutant but left the double mutant much less inhibited. Thus, although the catalytic activity of CF327A/K285P was not restored, the K285P mutation appeared to release the double mutant from inhibition by the Bcy1p, leading to constitutively low yet uninhibited PKA activity that may be sufficient to sustain viability in the tpk-null strain. It, thus, appeared that although both Phe-327 and Lys-285 contributed significantly to Bcy1p interaction, the K285P mutation profoundly disrupted this interaction. To test whether the same effect would apply for the mammalian R-subunits, we examined the inhibition profile of the mutants by the mammalian RII subunit, the isoform that shares most similarity with Bcy1p. RII subunit inhibited the wild type C-subunit with an IC50 at 3.6 nm. Both CF327A and CK285P mutants were inhibited by RII with an IC50 of ∼16 nm. Notably, the concentration of RII for 50% inhibition of CF327A/K285P was ∼500 nm, which was more than just an additive effect from the single mutations (Fig. 2B), suggesting a possible synergistic correlation between the two sites. To obtain structural insights into the effects caused by the mutations, the CF327A/K285P mutant protein was crystallized. The structure was solved at a resolution of 2.5 Å as a complex with ADP and the inhibitory peptide IP20 (Table 1). The overall structure was comparable with that of the wild type protein (Fig. 3A, left); the root-mean-square distance was 0.56 Å when compared with the whole molecule with a similar ternary complex of wild type C-subunit with ADP and SP20 (A21S mutant of IP20) (PDB ID 1JBP) (9Madhusudan Trafny E.A. Xuong N.H. Adams J.A. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, as indicated in Fig. 3B (orange arrows), three major differences were observed; 1) the C-tail moved away from and had fewer contacts with the core, 2) the glycine-rich loop moved away from the nucleotide, and 3) ADP, especially the ribose and phosphate moieties, shifted from their canonical positions in the active site and made no contacts with the glycine-rich loop. The K285P site also exhibited a modest shift in its main chain position (Fig. 3A). Reduced Interaction of the C-tail with the Kinase Core- When in the apo-form where no ligands or substrates bind, the C-subunit assumed an open conformation where Phe-327 and the adjacent C-tail region were often disordered and not interacting with the kinase core. In the ternary complex the enzyme always assumed a closed conformation, where the C-tail anchored to the kinase core. Although as a ternary complex, the C-tail of CF327A/K285P assumed an intermediate conformation between the open and closed states. As seen in Fig. 3A, the C-tail detached itself from the core at the Phe/Ala-327 site. The most significant displacement occurred near residues Asn-326 and Phe/Ala-327, w"

Although PHAPI possesses multiple biochemical activities, the molecular basis for its tumor-suppressive function has remained obscure. Recently we identified PHAPI as an apoptotic enhancer that stimulates apoptosome-mediated caspase activation. In this study, we defined the structural requirement for its activity to stimulate caspase activation using a series of truncation mutants of PHAPI. Further, utilizing these mutants, we provide evidence to support the model that the apoptotic activity of PHAPI is required for its tumor-suppressive capability. Consistently, pp32R1, a close homolog of PHAPI and yet an oncoprotein, is not able to stimulate caspase activation. A highly discrete region between these two proteins localizes to an essential caspase activation motif of PHAPI. Additionally, PHAPI is predominantly a nuclear protein, and it can translocate to the cytoplasm during apoptosis. Disruption of the nuclear localization signal of PHAPI caused a modest decrease of its tumor-suppressive function, indicating that nuclear localization of PHAPI contributes to, but is not essential for, tumor suppression.

Apoptosis plays a crucial role in multiple physiological events, and its deregulation can lead to various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmune disorders (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12874) Google Scholar, 2Horvitz H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1701s-1706sPubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is executed by a family of proteases known as caspases (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 4Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). In mammals, a major caspase activation pathway is the mitochondrial cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation pathway, also known as the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (5Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). In this pathway, a variety of apoptotic stimuli induce release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, a process controlled by the Bcl-2 family members (6Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 7Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The released cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, the essential mediator of the pathway, and triggers its nucleotide binding/exchanging activity (9Jiang X. Wang X. J. Biol.

A. 2005; 102: 17545-17550Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the activated Apaf-1 protein forms a multimeric protein complex called the apoptosome, which in turn recruits and activates the initiator caspase, caspase-9. The active apoptosome-caspase-9 holoenzyme (9Jiang X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31199-31203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 11Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) then cleaves and activates the effector caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-7, and therefore causes apoptotic cell death. The cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation pathway is under precise regulation. For example, in the upstream of mitochondria, there are both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that dictate mitochondrial cytochrome c release (6Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 7Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Adams J.M.

In the downstream of mitochondria, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins negatively regulate apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activity (12Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van Dongen J.L.

Further, nucleotide binding/exchanging of Apaf-1, a key biochemical event of the pathway, is also closely regulated. Recently, we found that the Apaf-1-dependent caspase activation can be enhanced by PHAPI (putative HLA-associated protein-I, also known as pp32) (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Biochemically, PHAPI along with cellular apoptosis susceptibility and the heat shock protein HSP70, function as the nucleotide exchange factor for Apaf-1, a mechanism reminiscent of G protein regulation (21Kim H.E. Jiang X. Du F. Wang X. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PHAPI is predominantly a nuclear protein (22Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and can translocate to the cytoplasm during apoptosis, a process involving the RNA-binding protein HuR (23Mazroui R. Di Marco S.

Therefore, subcellular translocation of PHAPI provides an additional regulatory mechanism for PHAPI-stimulated caspase activation. In addition to its activity to promote apoptosis, PHAPI has been shown to possess other biochemical activities, including inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 3The abbreviations used are: PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; pp32R1, pp32-related-1; NLDM, nuclear localization defective mutant of PHAPI; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; PRP, PHAPI recombinant protein with residues 140–163 swapped with the correspondent residues of pp32R1. and histone acetyltransferase (HAT), both crucial regulators for various physiological processes (24Li M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PHAPI can also interact with Ataxin-1, a protein mutated in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type I (26Matilla A. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Isobe T. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of PHAPI in this type of neurodegeneration. The multiple biochemical activities of PHAPI suggest that this protein is involved in diverse biological events. To date, the most defined biological function of PHAPI is its role as a tumor suppressor. PHAPI expression appears to be greatly decreased during pancreatic cancer progression (27Brody J.R. Witkiewicz A. Williams T.K. Kadkol S.S. Cozzitorto J. Durkan B. Pasternack G.R. Yeo C.J. Mod. Pathol. 2007; 20: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a study of human non-small cell lung cancer, PHAPI expression level correlated with improved outcome following chemotherapy (28Hoffarth S. Zitzer A. Wiewrodt R. Hahnel P.S. Beyer V. Kreft A. Biesterfeld S. Schuler M. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Functionally, overexpression of PHAPI can inhibit oncogene-induced tumorigenesis (22Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E. Yu J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2153-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, PHAPI has a close homolog known as pp32R1 (pp32-related-1), which is an oncoprotein instead of a tumor suppressor (29Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S. Mahmoud M.A. Rebel J.M. Pasternack G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20053-20055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Kadkol S.S. Brody J.R. Pevsner J. Bai J. Pasternack G.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The expression of pp32R1 is switched on in certain human cancers with diminished PHAPI expression (31Kadkol S.S. Brody J.R. Pevsner J. Bai J. Pasternack G.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 32Kadkol S.S. El Naga G.A. Brody J.R. Bai J. Gusev Y. Dooley W.C. Pasternack G.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 68: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The biochemical activity of PHAPI responsible for its tumor-suppressive function has not been defined. Although both PP2A and HAT have been implicated in cancer development, whether PHAPI is able to suppress tumorigenesis via inhibiting these two enzymes is not clear. On the other hand, the apoptosis-accelerating activity of PHAPI provides a plausible explanation for its tumor-suppressive role, which is consistent with recent studies showing that in human breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, PHAPI expression level correlates with the sensitivity of cancer cells to Apaf-1-mediated apoptosis (28Hoffarth S.

Margolis S.S. Marks J.R. Deshmukh M. Kornbluth S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To directly examine this possibility, we determined the structural requirement for the apoptotic activity of PHAPI and provided strong evidence to support the model that the apoptotic activity of PHAPI is required for its tumor-suppressive function. Subcloning and Recombinant Protein Generation-Full-length PHAPI was cloned into pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen) as described previously (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding for individual deletion mutants of PHAPI were generated by PCR and subsequently cloned into BamHI/SalI sites of pET-28a(+) (Novagen) for expression of recombinant proteins. The nuclear localization defective mutant of PHAPI (NLDM) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (residues 236–239, KRKR mutated to KLER). All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant PHAPI and mutants were expressed as His6-tagged proteins in BL21(DE3) strain and purified using nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by Q-Sepharose chromatography. The purified proteins were dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and stored at -80 °C in small aliquots. PCR cloning was performed to generate plasmids for mammalian expression of differentially tagged PHAPI, including pFLAG-CMV-PHAPI (using BglII/SalI sites), pCDNA3.1-hygro-HA-PHAPI (BamHI/SalI), pCMV5-myc-PHAPI (BglII/SalI), and pEGFP-C1-PHAPI (BglII/SalI). To generate pWZL-hygro-PHAPI and its mutants for retroviral infection, the coding sequences were cut out by BamHI/SalI from the corresponding pcDNA3.1-hygro-HA constructs and then inserted into pWZL-hygro through the same sites. All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Assay for PHAPI-stimulated Caspase Activity-The activity of PHAPI and its mutants to stimulate caspase activation was measured as described previously (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This assay requires a Q-chromatographic fraction of HeLa cell extracts (HeLa S-100) that we named Q30. To prepare Q30, 10 ml of HeLa S-100 (∼60 mg of total protein) was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. After sample loading, the column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer A. Subsequently, the column was eluted with Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl, and the eluted protein peak (Q30, ∼4 ml) was collected. The Q30 fraction was stored at -80 °C in small aliquots. The in vitro assay for the apoptotic function of PHAPI and its truncation mutants was conducted in a 20-μl Buffer A system containing 3 μl of Q30, 100 nm cytochrome c, 10 μm dATP, 100 μm DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin substrate (Calbiochem), and 500 nm recombinant PHAPI or its truncation mutants as indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C using a Xfluor4 spectrometry reader (TECAN, Inc.), and generation of fluorescent signal (relative fluorescent units) as a result of cleavage of DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin by caspase-3, was measured automatically every 10 min at wavelengths of 360/465 nm (excitation/emission). Alternatively, caspase-3 activity can also be detected using the in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled caspase-3 as the substrate in a 60-min reaction. Light Scattering Analysis-Molar mass of purified Recombinant PHAPI was determined by static multiangle light scattering. Protein was injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 gel filtration column equilibrated in Buffer A. The chromatography system was coupled to a three-angle light scattering detector (mini-DAWN EOS) and refractive index detector (Optilab DSP, Wyatt Technology). The data were collected every 0.5 s at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Data analysis was carried out using the ASTRA program (Wyatt Technology), yielding the molar mass and mass distribution (polydispersity) of the sample. Coimmunoprecipitation-HeLa cells were grown in 60-mm plates and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. As indicated, plasmids encoding Myc-tagged PHAPI, FLAG-tagged PHAPI, or vector controls (1 μg each) were transiently transfected into HeLa cells with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-and-thaw in Buffer L (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein-A-agarose coupled with 9E10 anti-Myc antibody for overnight. The immunoprecipitates and corresponding inputs were analyzed by Western blot against Myc, FLAG, and histone antibodies as indicated. PHAPI Translocation upon Stress Treatment-HeLa cells were grown in 60-mm plates and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. One microgram of plasmid encoding GFP-conjugated PHAPI wild-type (WT), GFP-conjugated PHAPI NLDM mutant, or GFP alone was transiently transfected into HeLa cells with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h of transfection, the cellular localization of the GFP proteins was detected by fluorescent microscopy. To test PHAPI translocation upon stress treatment, the HeLa cells expressing GFP-PHAPI (WT) were treated either with 0.25 μm staurosporine (Sigma) or 0.25 J/cm2 of UV light using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene). Pictures were taken at the indicated time points. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay-Retroviruses were generated using pBABE-puro-Ras, pBABE-puro vector, pWZL-hygro-Myc, pWZL-hygro vector, pWZL-hygro-PHAPI, and its mutants as indicated. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (cultured for three passages after isolation from mice) were plated in 10-cm plates (2 × 105/plate). After overnight incubation, they were infected by three rounds of infection (4 h for each round) with indicated retroviruses. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were allowed to grow for 3 days in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B. After recovering from drug selection for 12 h in antibiotics-free medium, viral-infected cells were trypsinized and plated for soft agar colony-formation assay. For each assay, 5 × 105 viral-infected cells were plated with soft agar medium to individual wells in 6-well plates. The plates were incubated for 2 weeks, and phase-contrast microscopic pictures were taken for each sample using a digital camera coupled to a microscope to show colony formation. Quantification and standard deviation were obtained from results of three independent experiments. Suspension Cell Culture and Measurement of Cellular Apoptosis-One million of each infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts as used in the soft agar colony formation assay were suspended in 2 ml of suspension medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% of bovine serum albumin and 0.5% of methyl cellulose), and then seeded into the Ultra Low Cluster 6-Well Plate (Corning Inc.) and incubated in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Under this condition, cells are under suspension and anchorage-independent condition. Plates were periodically agitated to avoid cell aggregation. After 8 h of incubation, cells were harvested and lysed into Buffer A containing 140 mm additional KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. Caspase-3 activity in the cell extracts were measured to monitor suspension-triggered apoptosis in the cells expressing PHAPI or its individual mutants. The assay was conducted using 20 μg of individual cell extracts and 100 μm DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin substrate (Calbiochem) in 20-μl Buffer A containing 140 mm additional KCl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C using a Xfluor4 spectrometry reader (TECAN, Inc.), and generation of fluorescent signal (relative fluorescent units) as a result of cleavage of DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin by caspase-3, was measured automatically every 10 min at wave-lengths of 360/465 nm (excitation/emission). Domain Analysis of PHAPI-We previously identified PHAPI/pp32 as a regulatory component of the mitochondria-mediated caspase activation pathway (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). PHAPI functions to enhance the activity of the apoptosome complex to activate caspase-9. However, PHAPI does not have any recognizable motif that can directly link to apoptosis. Therefore, to further understand the role of PHAPI in apoptosis, we sought to determine the domain structures of PHAPI required for its activity to stimulate caspase activation. PHAPI contains a short N-terminal fragment followed by four leucine-rich repeats (LRR1 to LRR4), and a short linker region (M region) connecting LRR4 to the highly negatively charged C terminus (Fig. 1A). We expressed and purified recombinant full-length PHAPI protein and a series of mutants with individual regions of the protein truncated (Fig. 1, A and B). Subsequently, we examined the activity of these recombinant proteins in stimulating Apaf-1/cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation. To do so, we used a chromatographic fraction (Q30) from HeLa cell cytosolic extracts and several other defined factors to reconstitute the caspase activation process (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The Q30 fraction contains procaspase-9, procaspase-3, Apaf-1, and other required protein factors for the apoptotic activity of PHAPI (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 21Kim H.E. Jiang X. Du F. Wang X. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 239-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Caspase activation was triggered by addition of 100 nm purified cytochrome c and 10 μm nucleotide dATP and was measured by using cleavage of either a [35S]methionine-labeled procaspase-3 (Fig. 1C) or a fluorogenic peptide substrate of caspase-3 (Fig. 1D) as the readout. Based on both functional assays (Fig. 1, C and D), we found that there are two regions of PHAPI protein essential for its apoptotic activity. One is the acidic C-terminal fragment, and the other is the short M region immediately franking the C-terminal tail. LRR3 and LRR4 also appear to contribute to the apoptotic activity of PHAPI, because deletion of these two LRRs caused a modest but reproducible decrease of caspase activation measured by both assays (Fig. 1, C and D). Importantly, a truncated protein containing only the M region and the C-terminal tail of PHAPI, the two essential regions for the apoptotic activity of PHAPI, is sufficient to support the in vitro caspase stimulation activity of PHAPI (Fig. 1E). PHAPI but Not pp32R1 Can Stimulate Caspase Activation-PHAPI has a close homologous protein, pp32R1 (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, instead of being a tumor suppressor like PHAPI, pp32R1 is an oncogene (29Brody J.R. Kadkol S.S. Mahmoud M.A. Rebel J.M. Pasternack G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20053-20055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Kadkol S.S. Brody J.R. Pevsner J. Bai J. Pasternack G.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We generated purified recombinant pp32R1 and examined its effect on Apaf-1-mediated caspase activation (Fig. 2B). Contrary to PHAPI, pp32R1 does not possess such apoptotic activity. This result, combined with the fact that PHAPI is a tumor suppressor, whereas pp32R1 is an oncoprotein, strongly suggests that the apoptotic activity and the tumor-suppressive capability of PHAPI have a causal relationship. Mechanistically, why is pp32R1 not able to stimulate caspase activation albeit being highly homologous to PHAPI? We reason that such functional difference might be related to the most diverse region of these two proteins, correlating to residues 140–163 of PHAPI (Fig. 2A). These residues are within the M region of PHAPI, which is essential for its apoptotic activity. To test this possibility, we generated a mutant form of PHAPI recombinant protein in which residues 140–163 were swapped with the correspondent residues of pp32R1 (we named this mutant as PRP, Fig. 2C). As expected, the PRP mutant of PHAPI indeed showed a much decreased activity to enhance caspase activation (Fig. 2D). Because pp32R1 is so similar to PHAPI but instead possesses oncogenic function, is it possible that pp32R1 promotes tumorigenesis by competing for the functional partner of PHAPI and thereby inhibiting its apoptotic activity? This turns out to not be the case, because in our in vitro caspase assay, neither pp32R1 nor the inactive PHAPI deletion mutants, ΔM and ΔC, can inhibit the activity of the full-length PHAPI to stimulate caspase activation (Fig. 3). There is another potential mechanism that might explain the oncogenic function of pp32R1. It was reported that PHAPI is a homo-trimeric protein based on its behavior in gel-filtration chromatography (34Ulitzur N. Rancano C. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30577-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We also observed that both native PHAPI purified from HeLa cell extracts and recombinant PHAPI were resolved in early fractions of gel-filtration chromatography, suggesting a large complex formed by homo-oligomerization (data not shown). If indeed PHAPI is a homo-trimer in cells and the homo-trimerization is required for its apoptotic activity, then one possibility for pp32R1 to abrogate this activity is to form inactive hetero-oligomers with PHAPI in cells. This potential activity would evade detection by our in vitro assay, because we used purified, recombinant PHAPI, which presumably was a stable homo-trimer before mixing with pp32R1. However, gel-filtration chromatography alone is not sufficient to determine whether PHAPI is an oligomer or not, because, in addition to molecular weight, other parameters such as the shape of a protein will also affect its gel-filtration chromatographic behavior. Therefore, we performed additional experiments to examine this possibility. Firstly, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiment to examine whether differentially tagged PHAPI can interact with each other when co-transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, Myc-tagged PHAPI and FLAG-tagged PHAPI failed to interact with each other, whereas Myc-tagged PHAPI did co-precipitate endogenous histone, a previously reported interacting partner of PHAPI (25Seo S.B. Macfarlan T. McNamara P. Hong R. Mukai Y. Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This result argues against the possibility that PHAPI can form a homo-oligomer in cells. More conclusively, we measured the molecular mass of purified recombinant PHAPI by light scattering technique coupled with gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 4B), the result (29.2 kDa) indicates that active PHAPI is a monomeric protein. Light scattering analysis also indicates that pp32R1 is a monomeric protein (data not shown). Therefore, our results suggest that pp32R1 exerts its oncogenic function through a mechanism not directly related to the apoptotic function of PHAPI. The Apoptotic Activity of PHAPI Contributes to Its Tumor-suppressive Function-PHAPI has been shown to be a tumor suppressor, but the underlying molecular basis was not determined. Our previous finding that PHAPI can enhance Apaf-1-mediated caspase activation provided a potential mechanistic explanation (20Jiang X. Kim H.E. Shu H. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Kofron J. Donnelly J. Burns D. Ng S.C. Rosenberg S. Wang X. Science. 2003; 299: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The fact that the closely related pp32R1 is an oncoprotein and has no effect on caspase activation (Fig. 2) further supports this model. In addition, it was reported recently that, in certain human cancers, expression levels of PHAPI correlated with sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis (28Hoffarth S. Zitzer A. Wiewrodt R. Hahnel P.S. Beyer V. Kreft A. Biesterfeld S. Schuler M. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Schafer Z.T. Parrish A.B. Wright K.M. Margolis S.S. Marks J.R. Deshmukh M. Kornbluth S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All these data are consistent with the possibility that the apoptotic activity of PHAPI is required for its tumor-suppressive function. To further test this hypothesis, we performed a soft agar colony formation assay to measure the tumor-suppressive function of a panel of PHAPI mutants with apoptotic activity defined in Fig. 1. With such an assay, we can determine whether the apoptotic activity of PHAPI"

ERdj5 is a novel ER chaperone that regulates the ER-associated degradation of misfolded proteins through its associations with EDEM and the ER stress sensor BiP. To investigate whether ERdj5 can regulate ER stress signaling pathways, we exposed neuroblastoma cells overexpressing ERdj5 to ER stress inducers. ERdj5 promoted apoptosis in tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and bortezomib-treated cells. To provide further evidence that ERdj5 induces ER stress-regulated apoptosis, we targeted Bcl-2 to ER of ERdj5-overexpressing cells. Targeting the Bcl-2 to ER prevented the apoptosis induced by ER stress inducers but not by non-ER stress apoptotic stimuli, suggesting induction of ER stress-regulated apoptosis by ERdj5. ERdj5 enhanced apoptosis by abolishing the ER stress-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and the subsequent translational repression. ERdj5 was found to inhibit the eIF2α phosphorylation under ER stress through inactivating the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase. The compromised integrated stress response observed in ERdj5-overexpressing ER-stressed cells due to repressed eIF2α phosphorylation correlated with impaired neuroblastoma cell resistance under ER stress. These results demonstrate that ERdj5 decreases neuroblastoma cell survival by down-regulating the UPR, raising the possibility that this protein could be a target for anti-tumor approaches.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The UPR relieves ER stress by inducing protein folding and degradation pathways and inhibiting protein synthesis (1Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Upon ER stress, dissociation of the ER chaperone GRP78/BiP from the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activates PERK. Once activated, PERK phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α, leading to inhibition of general protein translation (3Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). In addition to attenuating global protein synthesis, eIF2α phosphorylation promotes a stress-induced gene expression program. During the integrated stress response (ISR), specific mRNAs escape the translational repression, and the synthesis of transcription factors, such as ATF4, activates genes (CHOP and BiP) that promote stress resistance and cell survival (4Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 5Lu P.D. Jousse C. Marciniak S.J. Zhang Y. Novoa I. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Harding H.P.

ATF4 controls also the expression of GADD34, a subunit of the PP1-holophosphatase complex that dephosphorylates eIF2α promoting recovery from the translational inhibition during the UPR (7Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Activation of the UPR can result in restoration of ER homeostasis; however, both persistent ER stress and failure of the adaptive response initiate ER-dependent apoptotic cascades (8Szegezdi E. Logue S.E. Gorman A.M. Samali A. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Although the UPR protects the cells from normal variations that occur in the cellular environment, pathological conditions, including cancer, can also activate the response (9Fels D.R. Koumenis C. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 11Moenner M.

The ER stress chaperones GRP78/BiP and GRP94 are induced at different stages of tumor progression, and the X box-binding protein (XBP1), the major transcriptional regulator of the IRE1 arm of the UPR, is essential for tumor growth under hypoxic conditions (8Szegezdi E.

Convincing evidence that the UPR is required for tumorigenesis comes from studies where BiP-/-, PERK-/-, and XBP1-knockdown cells formed tumors in mice that were smaller and grew significantly more slowly compared with those from wild type cells, directly implicating BiP, PERK, and XBP1 in tumor growth in vivo (13Koong A.C.

Several groups are now screening for drugs that target the UPR. Both PERK and IRE1 are obvious candidates, because as kinases they are viable drug targets (17Garber K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Drugs such as bortezomib (Velcade) kill tumor cells in vitro by causing ER stress while inhibiting part of the UPR (18Nawrocki S.T. Carew J.S. Dunner Jr., K. Boise L.H. Chiao P.J. Huang P. Abbruzzese J.L. McConkey D.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11510-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Activation of the UPR alters chemosensitivity, conferring cellular resistance, or conversely works synergistically with anticancer agents, such as etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and melphalan (19Mann M.J. Hendershot L.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2006; 5: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ER contains several proteins endowed with oxidoreductase activity that catalyze formation, isomerization, and reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins that are undergoing folding and quality control (20Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, ERdj5 is a recently identified, ER-resident molecule that features a unique combination of domains, including a dnaj, a protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI)-like, and a thioredoxin domain. Either full-length ERdj5 or its dnaj domain alone have been shown to bind BiP in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner (21Cunnea P.M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Bertoli G. Simmen T. Damdimopoulos A.E. Hermann S.

ERdj5 has recently been reported to have reductase activity, cleave the disulfide bonds of misfolded proteins, and accelerate their ER-associated degradation through its physical and functional associations with EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing mannosidase-like protein) and BiP (22Ushioda R. Hoseki J. Araki K. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Nagata K. Science. 2008; 321: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As in the case of the heat shock proteins Hsp70, Hsp27, and BiP as well as in the other members of the thioredoxin system that are overexpressed in many cancers, ERdj5 exhibits elevated expression levels in tumor tissue from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, suggesting a role for this protein in the ER stress response in tumors (23Cunnea P.

The aim of this study was to examine whether ERdj5, through regulating the UPR, could alter cancer cell resistance to ER stress. We show that ERdj5 decreases neuroblastoma cell survival by inducing ER stress-regulated apoptosis. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines-Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A stable SH-SY5Y cell line overexpressing ERdj5 was established after stably transfecting SH-SY5Y cells with the recombinant pIRESneo-ERdj5 expression vector. In addition, a double-transfected SH-SY5Y cell line was established after stably transfecting the ERdj5-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells with the recombinant pIRESpuro-Bcl-2cb5 expression vector. The ER-targeted Bcl-2 expression plasmid (pIRESpuro-Bcl-2cb5) contains the full-length human Bcl-2 cDNA with a deletion at the C-terminal 658–720 base pairs (corresponding to amino acids 210–239) ligated with the ER-targeting signal sequence of human cytochrome b5. Furthermore, the full-length human ERdj5 cDNA as well as the cDNA encoding the fragment of ERdj5 that corresponds to the dnaj domain together with the ER targeting signal and the ER retention sequence KDEL were subcloned into pLenti6/V5 vector. Stable SH-SY5Y cell lines expressing the full-length ERdj5 as well as the dnaj domain of ERdj5 were established after transfecting the cells with pLenti6/V5 recombinant plasmids and selecting the transfected cells with blasticidin. Treatments and Quantification of Apoptosis by FACS Analysis-Cells were grown in medium with or without the ER stress inducers tunicamycin and thapsigargin, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib that induces ER stress, the translational inhibitor cycloheximide, and the genotoxic agents doxorubicin and etoposide for 24 and 48 h. Cells were collected, washed with PBS, fixed with ethanol, and incubated with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Flow cytometric analysis of stained cells was done with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Levels-Cells were left untreated or were treated with 250 nm thapsigargin for 3 h. Cells were collected, washed in PBS, and incubated with 1 μm calcium green-1 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Stained cells were analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. Survival Assays-Cells were plated at a density of 7.5 × 103 cells/well/6-well plate. 24 h later, the culture medium was replaced with a medium containing thapsigargin. 30 h later, cells were imaged in the same dishes containing PBS using a ×10 objective in a Zeiss Axiovert S 100 microscope equipped with Zeiss AxioCam MRC camera. For the colony outgrowth assay, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well/6-well plate and treated with 150 nm thapsigargin for 24 h. Cells were switched to regular medium and after 12 days were fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3:1, v/v) prior to staining with Giemsa (Sigma). Immunoblotting and Translation Assays-For analysis of ATF4, GADD34, CHOP, BiP, eIF2α, and phosphorylated eIF2α by immunoblotting, 7.5 × 105 cells were plated onto 6-well plates 24 h prior to treatment. Cells were then washed with PBS, scraped in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100) including protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μl/ml phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1; Sigma). The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the following antibodies: anti-eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling); anti-PERK, anti-phosphorylated PERK, anti-CADD34, CHOP/GADD153, and ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-BiP/GRP78 (Transduction Laboratories); and anti-actin-β (Sigma). The ERdj5 antibody used in this study was produced as described previously (23Cunnea P. Fernandes A.P. Capitanio A. Eken S. Spyrou G. Bjornstedt M. Int. J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 2007; 20: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In summary, two peptides sequences of 14 amino acids were selected from within the ERdj5 human sequence (positions 102–116 (APVKYHGDRSKESLVC and 640–654, FYERAKRNFQEEQIN) for peptide synthesis and immunization. Serum was affinity-purified against both peptides. The proteins were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To measure protein synthesis, cells were plated on 6-well plates, allowed to attach for 24 h, washed with PBS, and placed in cysteine- and methionine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with thapsigargin for the indicated times and labeled for 15 min with 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine in the same medium. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested, and lysed in 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer. Proteins were separated in a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography to visualize radiolabeled proteins. Immunochistochemistry-Cells were placed on 12-mm glass coverslips 24 h prior to transfection. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized in PBST (0.1% Tween 20). Coverslips were blocked in PBST containing 5% goat serum for 1 h and then exposed to mouse anti-Bcl-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing with PBST, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Slides were mounted in FluorSave (Calbiochem) and analyzed with a Leica ASMDW microscope equipped with a Leica DM IRE2 camera. ERdj5 Induces ER Stress-mediated Apoptosis-We previously demonstrated that ERdj5 exhibits ATP-dependent binding to the master regulator of the UPR BiP and that ERdj5 mRNA levels are induced upon ER stress (21Cunnea P.M. Miranda-Vizuete A. Bertoli G. Simmen T. Damdimopoulos A.E. Hermann S. Leinonen S. Huikko M.P. Gustafsson J.A. Sitia R. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1059-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether ERdj5 could affect ER stress signaling pathways. For this purpose, we tested whether ERdj5 could induce apoptosis in response to ER stress in neuroblastoma cells. We stably overexpressed ERdj5 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by using the pIRESneo vector system (Fig. 1A). These cells as well as cells carrying the empty pIRESneo vector were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin and the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, two pharmacological activators of ER stress. ERdj5 overexpression induced apoptosis in response to ER stress, as determined by sub-G1 fraction detected by FACS analysis (Fig. 1B). Apoptosis was also induced by ERdj5 overexpression when the cells were treated with the selective and potent inhibitor of the proteasome and the clinically used agent bortezomib (Velcade) (Fig. 1C) (27Richardson P.G. Anderson K.C. Clin. Adv. Hematol. Oncol. 2003; 1: 596-600PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of translation with cycloheximide reduced the tunicamycin-induced apoptotic cell death observed in ERdj5-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells, indicating that ERdj5 may induce apoptosis by regulating protein synthesis (Fig. 1D). Under persistent ER stress, the proapoptotic proteins Bak/Bax undergo conformational alteration in the ER membrane, permitting Ca2+ efflux into the cytosol (28Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels activate the calcium-dependent protease m-Calpain, which subsequently induces procaspase-12-regulated apoptosis (8Szegezdi E. Logue S.E. Gorman A.M. Samali A. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration observed in thapsigargin-treated ERdj5-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2) correlated with the ERdj5-induced apoptosis under ER stress (Fig. 1B). To provide further evidence that ERdj5 induces ER stress-regulated apoptosis, we targeted Bcl-2 to ER in ERdj5-overexpressing neuroblastoma cells by stably overexpressing Bcl-2 containing the ER-targeting signal sequence of cytochrome b5 (Bcl-2cb5). These cells as well as ERdj5-overexpressing cells carrying an empty pIRESpuro vector were treated with tunicamycin and thapsigargin and the non-ER genotoxic stressors doxorubicin and etoposide. In SH-SY5Y cells doubly transfected with Bcl-2cb5 and ERdj5, Bcl-2cb5 showed ER localization, as determined by a subcellular localization pattern similar to that of the DsRed fluorescent protein containing the ER targeting sequence of calreticulin and the ER retention sequence KDEL (Fig. 3, A and B). Apoptosis was induced to a similar extent in both Bcl-2cb5-overexpressing cells and the cells carrying the empty vector after treatment with the non-ER stressors doxorubicin and etoposide (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, expression of Bcl-2cb5 reduced the levels of apoptosis induced by the ER stress inducers tunicamycin and thapsigargin in the ERdj5-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of ERdj5 induces ER stress-regulated apoptosis.FIGURE 2ERdj5 increases intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to ER stress. ERdj5-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells (ERdj5) and cells carrying the empty pIRES vector (pIRES) were left untreated (UT) or were treated with 250 nm thapsigargin (Tg) for 3 h.

Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Based on our cycloheximide results, which suggested that ERdj5 can regulate protein synthesis, we hypothesized that ERdj5 promotes apoptosis by inhibiting the ER stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and the subsequent translational repression. To test this hypothesis, ERdj5-overexpressing and control SH-SY5Y cells were continuously exposed to 250 nm thapsigargin. At various time points thereafter, the rate of protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of radiolabeled methionine and cysteine into newly synthesized proteins. eIF2α phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with an monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of the protein. In control cells, thapsigargin treatment induced a profound but transient suppression of new protein synthesis and eIF2α phosphorylation that was maximal between 0.5 and 1 h. Protein synthesis was derepressed, and eIF2α phosphorylation was partially decreased later in the course of the stress response (Fig. 5, A and B). At this later phase during the translational recovery, translation of the major ER stress-inducible chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 was induced. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing transient eIF2α phosphorylation and translation repression in ER-stressed cells (6Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In contrast, in thapsigargin-treated ERdj5-overexpressing cells, protein synthesis was slightly repressed during the first 1 h while at the same time eIF2α phosphorylation increased to a lesser extent compared with the control cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Translation of the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 followed a similar time-dependent pattern. ERdj5 Inhibits the ER Stress-induced PERK Phosphorylation-PERK is the endoplasmic reticulum kinase that phosphorylates eIF2α in response to various stimuli that induce ER stress, including treatment of cells with thapsigargin (42Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ERdj5 abolishes the ER stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation through inactivating PERK. Activation of this kinase involves autophosphorylation, which results in a shift in the apparent molecular weight on a polyacrylamide gel (3Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar, 42Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). We continuously exposed ERdj5-overexpressing and control SH-SY5Y cells to 250 nm thapsigargin. At different times after the addition of thapsigargin, we analyzed PERK phosphorylation by immunoblotting. In particular, the shift in the molecular weight was monitored using an anti-PERK antibody. The levels of the phosphorylated PERK were additionally detected with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of the protein. As shown in Fig. 5C, under thapsigargin treatment, PERK exhibits partially slightly slower electrophoretic mobility due to phosphorylation in control cells but not in ERdj5-overexpressing cells. In agreement with the retarded electrophoretic mobility in control cells, the levels of phosphorylated PERK detected with the specific anti-phospho-PERK antibody at 0.5 and 1 h were higher in thapsigargin-treated control (pIRES) compared with ERdj5-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C). This is consistent with the increased eIF2α phosphorylation levels at the same time points in the thapsigargin-treated control compared with ERdj5-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that ERdj5 is highly likely to attenuate the ER stress-induced eIF2α phosphorylation and translational repression through retaining PERK in a dephosphorylated, inactive form. ERdj5 Down-regulates the Integrated Stress Response- eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser-51 triggers expression of stress-induced genes, such as transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP as well as GADD34. GADD34, by regulating the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, is responsible for the recovery from the translational repression at a later stage of the stress response (6Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Jungreis R. Harding H.P. Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of ERdj5 impaired the eIF2α phosphorylation in stressed cells, we examined whether increased ERdj5 levels also impacted on the expression of downstream UPR target genes. Western blot analysis showed a block in the accumulation of the ER stress-inducible proteins ATF4, CHOP, BiP, and GADD34 in thapsigargin-treated ERdj5-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6A). Since ATF4, BIP, and GADD34 have been shown to impart stress resistance (4Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 5Lu P.D. Jousse C.

Ron D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we compared the ability of control and ERdj5-overexpressing cells to survive exposure to the ER stress inducer thapsigargin in both colony and cell growth assays (Fig. 6, B and C). Thapsigargin-treated ERdj5-overexpressing cells exhibited decreased survival compared with the cells carrying the empty vector, consistent with the data from the FACS analysis, where ERdj5 overexpression was shown to induce apoptosis in response to ER stress. These results indicate that ERdj5 may induce neuroblastoma cell death by down-regulating basic ISR components. ERdj5 Inhibits ER Stress-induced eIF2α Phosphorylation and Increases Apoptosis by Utilizing Its dnaj Domain-ERdj5 has been shown to feature a dnaj, a PDI-like, and a thioredoxin domain.

In addition to the unprecedented number of DNA molecules, the genome is also unusual in that it contains both circular and linear DNA molecules, present in roughly equal numbers (12 and 10, respectively). Linear DNA molecules are rarely found in bacteria, and those in B. burgdorferi are terminated by covalently closed hairpin ends (18Barbour A.G. Garon C.F. Science. 1987; 237: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Hinnebusch J. Barbour A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7233-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These hairpin “telomeres” offer a unique solution to the end-replication problem (20Watson J.D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as described below. Replication of the linear DNA molecules in Borrelia species (Fig. 1A) occurs via bidirectional replication from a central origin (21Beaurepaire C. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Picardeau M. Le Dantec C. Vincent V. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Copying of the DNA on each side of the linear molecule results in the formation of a dimer junction or replicated telomere (L′L and RR′) in the replicative intermediate. These regions are subsequently processed in a DNA breakage and reunion reaction referred to as telomere resolution (23Chaconas G. Stewart P.E. Tilly K. Bono J.L. Rosa P.

However, the precise sequence at the hairpin turnaround has remained unconfirmed because of the use of a single strand-specific nuclease in the cloning process and the possibility of nucleotide loss prior to the ligation step. The sequencing of B. burgdorferi telomeres has revealed three telomere types based upon the presence, absence, or position of the box 1 and 2 region (25Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Tourand Y. Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Huang W.M.

The box 3-5 region appears to be invariant in position in all telomeres studied to date with the qualification that the position of the telomere ends (excepting lp17) remains tentative. The position of DNA cleavage is also invariant and occurs between positions 3 and 4 from the axis of symmetry in three different replicated telomere substrates (24Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol.

In this study we report the sequence of the full complement (excepting lp5) of telomeres from B. burgdorferi strain B31 and describe their similarities, differences, and the ability to serve as substrates in telomere resolution. Surprisingly, a 160-fold range in the in vitro activity of the telomeres was observed, including three telomeres with no detectable in vitro activity, although these telomeres were shown to be active in vivo. B. burgdorferi Strains and Growth Conditions-B. burgdorferi strains used in this study were cultivated in liquid BSK-II + RS (BSK-II medium (39Barbour A.G. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1984; 57: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 6% rabbit serum (Cedarlane Laboratories)) and incubated in 1.5% CO2 at 35 °C. B31-A is a high passage noninfectious clone of B31 (40Bono J.L. Elias A.F. Kupko III, J.J. Stevenson B. Tilly K. Rosa P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas B31-5A4 and 5A10 are infectious and noninfectious clones, respectively, derived from B31 (12Purser J.E. Norris S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13865-13870Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Direct Sequencing of Telomeres-B. burgdorferi plasmid DNA was prepared from 200-ml cultures using a Qiagen plasmid midi kit. Prior to lysis, bacterial pellets were washed with 20 ml of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, + 50 mm NaCl. For a single sequencing reaction, 2.3 μg of B. burgdorferi plasmid DNA was treated with 4 units of mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) in a 50-μl reaction using the manufacturer’s buffer conditions and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Reactions were immediately purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. Sequencing was performed by the University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Facility using the following genomic sequencing conditions: 1-2 μg of template DNA, 30 pmol of PAGE purified primer (see Table 1), 4 μl of Terminator Ready Reaction Mix (Big Dye version 3.1, from ABI), 4 μl of Big Dye Terminator Sequencing Buffer, and 1 μl of ThermoFidelase (Fidelity Systems Inc.) in a total volume of 20 μl. Cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min at 96 °C, followed by 80 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 40 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 60 °C for either 1.5 or 4 min, depending upon read length.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for direct sequencing of telomeresTelomerePrimerSequence, 5′ to 3′CoordinatesaThe coordinates used here are those of the complete plasmid sequences, including the hairpin telomeres.

Open table in a new tab Sequencing of lp28-4R-A unique primer could not be found for the lp28-4 right end, because of sequence homology to the right end of lp56 and lp36. To circumvent this difficulty, the right end of lp36 was removed by targeted deletion (21Beaurepaire C. Chaconas G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Chaconas G. Stewart P.E. Tilly K. Bono J.L. Rosa P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in a strain lacking lp56 (B. burgdorferi 5A10 (12Purser J.E. Norris S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13865-13870Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar)). Briefly, a region of lp36 from 33,033 to 34,430 bp was PCR-amplified from B. burgdorferi plasmid DNA using primers B1260 (5′cctcataaagtattgtctggc3′) and B1261 (5′cttgtatcttcccatgatagc3′). The PCR product was then blunt end-cloned into pJET1.2 to produce pYT128. This construct was then digested with NcoI and XhoI and directionally cloned into NcoI/XhoI-digested pGCL47-4 to generate pYT129. This construct was used to transform B. burgdorferi 5A10 to delete the right end of lp36 by telomere resolution of the inserted replicated telomere. Plasmid DNA from this lp36 right end minus derivative of strain 5A10 was then mung bean nuclease-treated and used as template DNA for DNA sequencing as described above. Construction of Replicated Telomere Plasmids-Each telomere resolution substrate was constructed from a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides (see Table 2), corresponding to the elucidated sequence of each B. burgdorferi telomere. Each oligonucleotide pair was phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated. The ligation was subsequently digested with BamHI and then ligated to BamHI-cut pKK81, as described previously (23Chaconas G. Stewart P.E. Tilly K. Bono J.L. Rosa P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ligations were precipitated and used to transform an Escherichia coli sbc mutant strain. Plasmid DNA from this strain was prepared from 50-ml cultures according to the GeneElute HP plasmid midiprep protocol (Sigma) or from 5-ml cultures using the Qiagen miniprep protocol. The replicated telomere inserts were sequenced after plasmid preparation to confirm the integrity of the constructs, and subsequently used in both in vitro and in vivo telomere resolution assays, as described below.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides (Oligo) used for replicated telomere plasmid substrate construction in E. coliTelomerePlasmidOligo 1Oligo 2Oligo 1 sequenceOligo 2 sequenceStrainChromLpYT92OGCB253OGCB254gatcctttttatactattaaattatatttataaatataatttaatagtataaaaagGCE1708ChromRpYT94OGCB287OGCB288gatccattctatactaattaaaaattatatatataatttttaattagtatagaatgGCE1710lp17LpYT1OGCB17OGCB18gatccactctatactaataaaaaattatatatataattttttattagtatagagtgGCE203lp17RaTelomere sequences for lp17R and lp56R are identical and therefore represented by the same replicated telomere plasmid construct, pYT95.pYT95OGCB289OGCB290gatccactttgtactaaataaatattatatatataatatttatttagtacaaagtgGCE1711lp21LbTelomere sequences for lp21L and lp28-4L are identical and therefore represented by the same replicated telomere plasmid construct, pYT96.pYT96OGCB291OGCB292gatccactctatactaataaaaaattatatatataattttttattagtatagagtgGCE1712lp21RpYT97OGCB293OGCB294gatccgctttatactaaaaaaaactaatttaaattagttttttttagtataaagcgGCE1713lp25LpYT91OGCB285OGCB286gatcctaactatactatttaaaaatttatatataaatttttaaatagtatagttagGCE1707lp25RpYT105OGCB309OGCB310gatcctctctatactaataaaaaaatatttaaatatttttttattagtatagagagGCE1721lp28-1LpYT98OGCB295OGCB296gatcctatctatactaattaaaaattatatatataatttttaattagtatagatagGCE1714lp28-1RpYT93OGCB255OGCB256gatcctatatatactaaaagataataaatatatttattatcttttagtatatatagGCE1709lp28-2LpYT109OGCB317OGCB318gatcctatttatactaattaataataaattaatttattattaattagtataaatagGCE1725lp28-2RpYT102OGCB303OGCB304gatcctttctatactaattaataattgtatatacaattattaattagtatagaaagGCE1718lp28-3LpYT104OGCB307OGCB308gatccactctatactaataaaaaattatatatataattttttattagtatagagtgGCE1720lp28-3RpYT103OGCB305OGCB306gatccaatttatactaagtaataataatatatattattattacttagtataaattgGCE1719lp28-4LbTelomere sequences for lp21L and lp28-4L are identical and therefore represented by the same replicated telomere plasmid construct, pYT96.pYT96OGCB291OGCB292gatccactctatactaataaaaaattatatatataattttttattagtatagagtgGCE1712lp28-4RpYT139OGCB356OGCB357gatcctcattatactaaaagataataaattaatttattatcttttagtataatgagGCE1753lp36LpYT90OGCB283OGCB284gatcctatttatactaattaataataaattaatttattattaattagtataaatagGCE1706lp36RpYT107OGCB313OGCB314gatcctcattatactaaaagataataaatatatttattatcttttagtataatgagGCE1723lp38LpYT131OGCB339OGCB340gatcctttttatactaaaaaattgtaaattaatttacaattttttagtataaaaagGCE1747lp38RpYT100OGCB299OGCB300gatccctattatactaaaagataataaattaatttattatcttttagtataataggGCE1716lp54LpYT134OGCB345OGCB346gatccttagtatactaatagattatcttcatgaagataatctattagtatactaagGCE1750lp54RpYT132OGCB341OGCB342gatccttagtatactaataaactcttattataataagagtttattagtatactaagGCE1748lp56LpYT99OGCB297OGCB298gatccgcattatactaaaagataataaattaatttattatcttttagtataatgcgGCE1715lp56RaTelomere sequences for lp17R and lp56R are identical and therefore represented by the same replicated telomere plasmid construct, pYT95.pYT95OGCB289OGCB290gatccactttgtactaaataaatattatatatataatatttatttagtacaaagtgGCE1711lp17L + 1pYT9OGCB33OGCB34gatccactctatactaataaaaaattatattaatataattttttattagtatagagtgGCE257lp17L − 1pYT17OGCB49OGCB50gatccactctatactaataaaaaattatatataattttttattagtatagagtgGCE300lp25L + 1pYT117OGCB333OGCB334gatcctaactatactatttaaaaatttatatatataaatttttaaatagtatagttagGCE1733lp25L − 1pYT118OGCB335OGCB336gatcctaactatactatttaaaaatttatataaatttttaaatagtatagttagGCE1734lp25R + 1pYT113OGCB325OGCB326gatcctctctatactaataaaaaaatattttaaaatatttttttattagtatagagagGCE1729lp25R − 1pYT114OGCB327OGCB328gatcctctctatactaataaaaaaatattaatatttttttattagtatagagagGCE1730lp28-1R + 1pYT111OGCB321OGCB322gatcctatatatactaaaagataataaatatatatttattatcttttagtatatatagGCE1727lp28-1R − 1pYT112OGCB323OGCB324gatcctatatatactaaaagataataaatatttattatcttttagtatatatagGCE1728lp56L + 1pYT115OGCB329OGCB330gatccgcattatactaaaagataataaatttaaatttattatcttttagtataatgcgGCE1731lp56L − 1pYT116OGCB331OGCB332gatccgcattatactaaaagataataaatatttattatcttttagtataatgcgGCE1732a Telomere sequences for lp17R and lp56R are identical and therefore represented by the same replicated telomere plasmid construct, pYT95.b Telomere sequences for lp21L and lp28-4L are identical and therefore represented by the same replicated telomere plasmid construct, pYT96. Open table in a new tab In Vitro Telomere Resolution Reaction Conditions-B. burgdorferi ResT was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (24Kobryn K. Chaconas G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Telomere resolution reactions contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm spermidine, and 5-10 μg/ml PstI-linearized substrate DNA. Time course reactions contained 200 nm ResT and were incubated at 30 °C with 20-μl aliquots removed at the time intervals indicated in the figures. Reactions were performed in duplicate or triplicate and stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.2-0.5%. Samples were resolved on 20-cm 0.8-1% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer at 80-100 V for 2 h. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and fluorescence of DNA bands was quantified using AlphaInnotech software. The percentage of telomere resolution was determined by dividing the fluorescence of the reaction products by the total fluorescence (products plus substrate). In Vivo Telomere Resolution Assay-Plasmid constructs (50 μg) carrying the telomeres to be tested (see Fig. 6) were used to transform electrocompetent B. burgdorferi B31-A, as reported previously (23Chaconas G. Stewart P.E. Tilly K. Bono J.L. Rosa P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The electroporated cells were resuspended in 1 ml of BSK-II + RS and then transferred to 9 ml of BSK-II + RS. Following a 24-h recovery at 35 °C, the 10-ml culture was added to 100 ml of BSK-II + RS supplemented with 200 μg/ml kanamycin and then distributed into 96-well plates in 250-μl aliquots. Plates were incubated at 35 °C for 10 days, at which time yellow wells containing live B. burgdorferi were diluted 1 to 100 in 200 μl of BSK-II + RS and grown to mid-log phase. Diluted cultures were screened for the kanamycin resistance gene in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using 1 μl of BSK-II culture and 30 pmol of each primer (B70, CATATGAGCCATATTCAACGGGAAACG; B71, AAAGCCGTTTCTGTAATGAAGGAG) in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 15 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. Total reactions were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels in TAE buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Plasmid DNA from kanamycin-positive B. burgdorferi clones was prepared and analyzed by field inversion gel electrophoresis. Using an MJ Research PPI-200 programmable power inverter, ∼250 ng of plasmid DNA was separated on a 0.65% Seakem agarose gel at 80 V for 40 min, followed by 21 h with Program 0 and buffer recirculation. Direct Genomic Sequencing of the B. burgdorferi Telomeres-To sequence the telomeres of B. burgdorferi, we utilized the previously sequenced B31 strain (1Casjens S. Palmer N. Van Vugt R. Huang W.H.

This allowed for design of sequencing primers for the telomeric regions based upon an adjacent previously reported sequence. Our sequencing approach is shown in Fig. 2A. Total plasmid DNA was first treated with mung bean nuclease to open the hairpin ends. The DNA was subsequently used directly as a template in sequencing reactions using genomic sequencing conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The use of Thermofidelase, a thermostable topoisomerase (Fidelity Systems, Inc.), was essential for the generation of high quality sequence in the genomic sequencing reactions and greatly increased read quality and length. Fig. 2B shows primary data for the telomeres of lp17, lp21R, and lp21L. The hairpin ends of lp17 are the only B. burgdorferi telomeres that have been sequenced in their entirety by chemical sequencing (19Hinnebusch J. Barbour A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7233-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The sequence generated by our genomic sequencing approach corresponds to the previously reported lp17 sequence. At the end of the sequence the addition of two nontemplated A residues followed by the termination of sequence output was observed. The middle panel of Fig. 2B shows the sequence output for lp21R, a telomere also previously sequenced (37Huang W.M. Robertson M. Aron J. Casjens S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4134-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Again, there were nontemplated residues followed by a cessation in sequence output. At the end of the lp21R telomere, we observed the addition of nontemplated A residues at both the last nucleotide and at the position beyond. The sequence we obtained was identical to that previously reported by mung bean nuclease treatment followed by cloning and sequencing (37Huang W.M. Robertson M. Aron J. Casjens S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4134-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reason for the presence of a mixed read (A and T) for the terminal nucleotide probably results from mung bean cleavage to remove the terminal nucleotide from some hairpins, followed by addition of a nontemplated A at this position. Based upon our observation of the addition of nontemplated A residues beyond and sometimes at the termina"
https://openalex.org/W2053960803,"Background Fibronectin-null cells assemble soluble fibronectin shortly after adherence to a substrate coated with intact fibronectin but not when adherent to the cell-binding domain of fibronectin (modules 7F3-10F3). Interactions of adherent cells with regions of adsorbed fibronectin other than modules 7F3-10F3, therefore, are required for early display of the cell surface sites that initiate and direct fibronectin assembly. Methodology/Principal Findings To identify these regions, coatings of proteolytically derived or recombinant pieces of fibronectin containing modules in addition to 7F3-10F3 were tested for effects on fibronectin assembly by adherent fibronectin-null fibroblasts. Pieces as large as one comprising modules 2F3-14F3, which include the heparin-binding and cell adhesion domains, were not effective in supporting fibronectin assembly. Addition of module 1F3 or the C-terminal modules to modules 2F3-14F3 resulted in some activity, and addition of both 1F3 and the C-terminal modules resulted in a construct, 1F3-C, that best mimicked the activity of a coating of intact fibronectin. Constructs 1F3-C V0, 1F3-C V64, and 1F3-C Δ(V15F310F1) were all able to support fibronectin assembly, suggesting that 1F3 through 11F1 and/or 12F1 were important for activity. Coatings in which the active parts of 1F3-C were present in different proteins were much less active than intact 1F3-C. Conclusions These results suggest that 1F3 acts together with C-terminal modules to induce display of fibronectin assembly sites on adherent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2052016639,"Growth hormone (GH) pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Surprisingly, this occurred without significant effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transporter (GLUT) 4 translocation or fusion with the plasma membrane. In parallel, the inhibitory actions of chronic GH pretreatment also impaired insulin-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase bound to insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 but not to IRS-1. In addition, insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by GH pretreatment. In contrast, overexpression of IRS-2 or expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant prevented the GH-induced insulin resistance of glucose uptake. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated IRS-2 knockdown also inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt activation and glucose uptake without affecting GLUT4 translocation and plasma membrane fusion. Together, these data support a model in which chronic GH stimulation inhibits insulin-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through a specific interaction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase bound to IRS-2. This inhibition leads to suppression of Akt activation coupled to glucose transport activity but not translocation or plasma membrane fusion of GLUT4.

Insulin is the major anabolic hormone whose action plays pivotal roles in tissue development, growth, and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Insulin regulates glucose metabolism at several levels, reducing hepatic glucose production and increasing the rate of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform GLUT4 5The abbreviations used are: GLUT, glucose transporter; GH, growth hormone; PI, phosphatidylinositol; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PIP3, phosphoinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; NC, nonrelevant control; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and is known to be responsible for the glucose uptake into these tissues (1Bryant N.J.

Thus, glucose uptake through GLUT4 plays a central role in the regulation of postprandial glucose clearance from the plasma. Dysfunction in the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake results in states of insulin resistance that plays a major role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin binding to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor on the plasma membrane of target cells activates its intrinsic cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase activity (4Gronborg M. Wulff B.S.

The activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) and Shc (6Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M.

It is well known that these two pathways are directly linked to specific downstream biological responses that account for several of the known actions of insulin. In particular, the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway is a well established requirement for insulin-induced glucose uptake in adipose and muscle tissue (10Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L.

Activated PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol and generates phosphoinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 production recruits Akt kinase to the plasma membrane, where Akt is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, resulting in activation of the Akt kinase (17Galetic I. Andjelkovic M.

Growth hormone (GH) is well known to possess bioactivities regulating both growth and metabolism. In various tissues, GH is known to mediate anti-insulin effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Insulin resistance is often observed in acromegalic patients, and GH administration to GH-deficient patients has been observed to increase the incidence of diabetes mellitus (20Beck P. Schalch D.S. Parker M.L. Kipnis D.M. Daughaday W.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1965; 66: 366-379PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cerasi E. Luft R. Lancet. 1964; 2: 769-771Abstract PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Yuen K.

Recently, we have reported that the GH transgenic rat, in which human GH was highly expressed, showed an insulin-resistant phenotype in both muscle and adipose tissues (23Cho Y. Ariga M. Uchijima Y.

Similarly, chronic GH treatment in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes was also found to impair insulin-induced glucose uptake (24Takano A. Haruta T. Iwata M. Usui I. Uno T. Kawahara J. Ueno E. Sasaoka T. Kobayashi M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate that chronic GH treatment can result in insulin-resistant glucose uptake in vitro as well as in vivo. Thus, this study was undertaken to evaluate the molecular mechanism of GH-induced impairment of insulin-dependent glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here we showed that chronic GH pretreatment inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake without affecting GLUT4 translocation, through the reduction of IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity.

Cell Culture of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes-Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were purchased from the American Type Tissue Culture repository. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 controlled atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (27Elmendorf J.S.

Briefly, confluent cultures were incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 4 days, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin for an additional 2 days. The medium was then changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were used for experiments at 6–10 days after inducing differentiation, when more than 90% of cells displayed an adipocyte phenotype. Electroporation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes-Transient transfection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was described previously (26Hakuno F. Kurihara S. Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37747-37758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were detached from the tissue culture plates by trypsin buffer (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS) and electroporated with a total of 100 μg of plasmid or 1 nmol of siRNA using the Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 0.15 kV and 0.95 microfarad. Measurement of Glucose Uptake-3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of insulin in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose containing 10 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H]glucose was added, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm d-glucose. Cells were lysed with 0.05 n NaOH containing 0.1% SDS, and radioactivity taken up by the cells was measured by liquid scintillation counter. Subcellular Fractionation-3T3-L1 adipocytes were scraped and homogenized in HES buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) with 20 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet obtained from this spin was layered onto 1.12 m sucrose in HES buffer and centrifuged at 101,000 × g for 70 min. This yielded a white fluffy band at the interface, plasma membrane fraction. The plasma membrane fraction was resuspended in HES buffer and pelleted at 48,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in Tris/Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Protein and Isolation of Biotinylated Protein-3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with or without GH were stimulated with insulin. Cells were washed with icecold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-LC (succinimidyl-6-[biotinamido]hexanoate) biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the plates three times with 15 mm glycine in ice-cold PBS. The cells were then collected and solubilized with Tris/Triton lysis buffer. For isolating biotinylated protein, whole cell lysates were mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma), and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The streptavidin-agarose beads were spun down and washed three times with lysis buffer, once with NaCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), once with 10% Tris/Triton lysis buffer in distilled water, and once with lysis buffer containing 0.1% in SDS.

Immunofluorescence and GLUT4-myc-GFP Translocation Assay-3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with or without siRNA along with pGlut4-myc-green fluorescent protein (GFP). Two days after electroporation, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with or without 100 nm GH followed by insulin treatment. Cells were fixed without permeabilization and immunostained with anti-Myc antibody. Cells were imaged using confocal fluorescence microscopy (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). To detect GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface, we quantified the ratio of Myc-rimed cells to GFP-transfected cells. Analyses of Insulin Signals-3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 2 h in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were treated with or without 100 nm GH followed by treatment with 0.1 nm insulin. Cells were harvested by Tris/Triton lysis buffer. After centrifugation of the homogenates at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatant was collected as whole cell lysates. The whole cell lysates were subjected to protein assay using protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). One mg of whole cell lysates was used for immunoprecipitation with indicated antibodies. Precipitants were separated by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. PI 3-Kinase Activity Assay-PI 3-kinase activity assay was carried out as described before (31Nedachi T. Akahori M. Ariga M. Sakamoto H. Suzuki N. Umesaki K. Hakuno F. Takahashi S.I. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2429-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 2 h in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by pretreatment with or without 100 nm GH for 24 h. Cells were treated with or without 0.1 nm insulin for 10 min. Cells were lysed by Tris/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate). One mg of whole cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody or anti-IRS-2 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with Tris/Nonidet P-40 buffer, LiCl buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm LiCl), distilled water, and TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and finally resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA). Kinase reaction was initiated by incubation of immunocomplex in reaction buffer with 20 mm [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi/mmol), 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg/μl phosphatidylinositol at 25 °C for 25 min. Reaction was stopped by adding chloroform/methanol/HCl (10:20:1). A lipid product was extracted, spotted onto silica gel plate, and developed with chloroform/methanol/NH4OH/water (43:38:6:6). 32P radioactivity incorporated into phosphatidylinositol was measured by autoradiography as PI 3-kinase activity. Adenovirus Preparation and Infection to 3T3-L1 Cells-The recombinant adenoviruses, Ade-myr-Akt (constitutive active form of Akt) and Ade-LacZ (LacZ) were prepared described before (32Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Funaki M. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Onishi Y. Ono H. Fujishiro M. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus to express IRS-2 was constructed as described before (33Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Adenoviruses were amplified in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with adenovirus by incubating cells with 100 multiplicities of infection of adenovirus. Cells were used for experiments after 48 h of infection. Statistical Analysis-Statistical analyses of data were performed by two-way or three-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher’s PSLD post-hoc test using StatView software (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). The results shown are the mean ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chronic GH Pretreatment Inhibits Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes-It has been reported that chronic GH pretreatment inhibits insulin-dependent glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes (24Takano A. Haruta T. Iwata M. Usui I. Uno T. Kawahara J. Ueno E. Sasaoka T. Kobayashi M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To confirm these data, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with various concentrations of GH for 24 h and subsequently subjected to an acute (15 min) stimulation with 0.1 nm insulin. In the absence of GH pretreatment, insulin stimulation resulted in a robust increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 1A). However, pretreatment with GH inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a GH concentration-dependent manner. As expected, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake occurred in an insulin concentration-dependent manner in the absence of GH pretreatment (Fig. 1B). GH inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at low insulin concentrations, but at higher concentrations (10–100 nm insulin) the full extent of glucose uptake was achieved. These data demonstrate that GH pretreatment results in an insulin-dependent decrease in sensitivity (concentration) but not responsiveness (maximum effect). We next examined the time dependence of GH pretreatment on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 1C). GH pretreatment for up to 48 h had no significant effect on basal glucose uptake. However, after 18 h of GH pretreatment, the extent of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly reduced. The GH reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake continued to decrease with longer GH pretreatment, and by 48 h glucose uptake was completely refractory to insulin stimulation. In comparison, the effect of GH was also slowly reversible in that following 24 h of GH pretreatment, wash out of GH resulted in a time-dependent recovery of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that GH pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes results in a reversible, time-, and concentration-dependent inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Chronic GH Pretreatment Does Not Affect Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Translocation to Plasma Membrane-Two facilitative glucose transporters are expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the GLUT1 isoform primarily contributing to basal glucose uptake and GLUT4 to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (2Ducluzeau P.H. Fletcher L.M. Vidal H. Laville M. Tavare J.M. Diabetes Metab. 2002; 28: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar, 34Scheepers A. Joost H.G. Schurmann A. JPEN J. Parenter. Enteral. Nutr. 2004; 28: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The cellular expression levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 were unaffected by chronic GH treatment (Fig. 2A). Insulin stimulation increases glucose uptake by the translocation of the GLUT4 isoform from intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane (35Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As expected, biochemical isolation of a plasma membrane-enriched fraction demonstrated the increased appearance of the GLUT4 protein following insulin stimulation (Fig. 2B, 1st and 2nd lanes). Surprisingly however, chronic GH pretreatment had no significant effect on the extent of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 appearance in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 2B, 3rd and 4th lanes). To determine whether GH pretreatment altered the fusion (exofacial exposure) of the GLUT4 protein with the plasma membrane, intact adipocytes were incubated with NHS-LC biotin to label plasma membrane proteins with biotin. Precipitation of cell lysates with streptavidin-agarose beads demonstrated an insulin-stimulated increase in the amount of exofacial labeled GLUT4 (Fig. 2C, 1st and 2nd lanes). Similar to the translocation assay, insulin was fully capable of inducing the plasma membrane fusion (exofacial exposure) of GLUT4 in cells chronically pretreated with GH (Fig. 2C, 3rd and 4th lanes). As controls, there was a reciprocal decrease in the amount of GLUT4 presence in the supernatant following streptavidin-agarose precipitation (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). Moreover, there was no precipitation of the GLUT4 protein by streptavidin-agarose beads without NHS-LC biotin labeling (Fig. 2C, 5th to 8th lanes). These data from three experiments are quantified in Fig. 2C, bar graphs of the lower panel. To morphologically confirm these biochemical findings, we next expressed the GLUT4 protein harboring an exofacial Myc epitope tag. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with myc-GLUT4-GFP-expressing plasmids, and the cell exofacial exposure of the Myc epitope was determined following various treatments by confocal fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 2D). Insulin stimulation increased the amount of the exofacial exposure of the Myc epitope, and this was again unaffected by chronic GH pretreatment. The inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by GH pretreatment with normal GLUT4 translocation and plasma membrane fusion could have arisen from a reduction in hexokinase activity that phosphorylates 2-deoxyglucose to generate the product 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate. To exclude this possibility, insulin-induced glucose uptake was measured in the cells with various concentrations of glucose. Fig. 2E shows that the GH-induced inhibition of glucose uptake was independent of glucose concentration, suggesting that glucose metabolism was not inhibited by GH pretreatment. Taken together, these data indicate that chronic GH pretreatment did not affect insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation or exofacial exposure (fusion) with the plasma membrane but that the reduction in glucose uptake primarily reflects changes in glucose transport activity. Chronic GH Pretreatment Inhibits Insulin-dependent Activation of PI 3-Kinase Bound to IRS-2 and Akt Phosphorylation-GH binding to the GH receptor activates the JAK tyrosine kinase pathway that can also signal through IRS tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the effect of chronic GH pretreatment on insulin signaling pathways, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with 100 nm GH for 24 h followed by stimulation with 0.1 nm insulin, and the activation of signal target molecules in response to insulin stimulation was assessed. We confirmed that GH pretreatment induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which is known to reflect tyrosine kinase activation, was not changed by GH pretreatment (Fig. 3A). Insulin-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was slightly enhanced by GH pretreatment (Fig. 3B). However, GH stimulation itself increased both IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. The amount of the p85 PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 was also enhanced by GH treatment, which reflected enhancement of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was also enhanced by GH pretreatment (Fig. 3C, left panel). Surprisingly, IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity was suppressed by GH treatment even though the amount of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-2 was enhanced (Fig. 3C, right panel). IRS-dependent activation of the PI 3-kinase generates the production of PIP3 that is necessary for the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 and Thr-308, resulting in the activation of Akt kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 3D, Akt phosphorylation was also inhibited by chronic GH pretreatment and that inhibition correlated with the suppression of IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity. IRS-2 Mediates the GH Inhibition of Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake-Data presented in Fig. 3 suggest that IRS-2 coupling to Akt activation may be the target of GH that is responsible for the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. As observed previously, GH pretreatment suppressed insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in LacZ adenovirus-infected cells (Fig. 4A, left panel). In contrast, overexpression of IRS-2 by adenovirus infection completely protected against the inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation by GH pretreatment (Fig. 4A, right panel). The restoration of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation by IRS-2 overexpression occurred concomitant with the recovery of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the GH-pretreated cells (Fig. 4B). In parallel, expression of a constitutively active Akt mutant (myr-Akt) resulted in the basal increase in glucose uptake that was no longer insulin-sensitive (Fig. 4C). Importantly, myr-Akt expression completely protected the cells from the GH inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. If IRS-2-dependent regulation of Akt activation is the site of GH-induced insulin resistance, then reduction of IRS-2 levels should mimic the effect of GH pretreatment. To test this hypothesis, we reduced IRS-1 or IRS-2 protein levels by RNA interference-mediated gene silencing (Fig. 5). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with an IRS-1- or IRS-2-specific siRNA that resulted in a marked reduction in targeted IRS protein levels without any significant effect on the other IRS protein level (Fig. 5A). IRS-1 knockdown had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated Akt activation, GLUT4 translocation, or glucose uptake (Fig. 5, A–C). On the other hand, in IRS-2 knockdown cells, there was a reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Although GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane in response to insulin was not inhibited by IRS-2 knockdown (Fig. 5B), insulin-induced glucose uptake was significantly inhibited by the reduction in IRS-2 protein levels similar to that observed for chronic GH pretreatment (Fig. 5C). In this study, we have observed that chronic GH pretreatment does not impair insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane, yet results in a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Recently, several studies have also observed an apparent uncoupling of GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. For example, in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells, high leptin levels reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake despite normal GLUT4 translocation (36Sweeney G. Keen J. Somwar R. Konrad D. Garg R. Klip A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4806-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nelson et al. (37Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggested that, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, high glucose levels impaired GLUT4 intrinsic activity. Smith et al. (38Smith R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Shah N. Smith J.A. Jarett L. Arch. Biochem.

PBP10, a rhodamine B-labeled 10-amino-acid peptide, which binds to phosphoinositides, itself induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, without any increase in glucose uptake (39Funaki M. Randhawa P. Janmey P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7567-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Taken together with these reports, our data indicate that GLUT4 translocation and fusion with the plasma membrane are not sufficient to enhance glucose uptake per se but that additional activation steps are required. Thus, by comparing glucose uptake with GLUT4 translocation, we have successfully separated GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake into GLUT4 translocation step and activation step. Previously, we have reported that adipose and muscle tissue isolated from human GH transgenic rat display insulin resistance and proposed that this resulted from an impairment of GLUT4 activation in vivo (23Cho Y. Ariga M. Uchijima Y. Kimura K. Rho J.Y. Furuhata Y. Hakuno F. Yamanouchi K. Nishihara M. Takahashi S. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 5374-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine the potential mechanism(s), we determined the effect of GH pretreatment in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The current data demonstrate that chronic GH pretreatment impaired insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase bound to IRS-2, but not to IRS-1, leading to inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake without affecting GLUT4 translocation. IRS-2 overexpression or myr-Akt expression restored GH-induced impairment of insulin-dependent glucose uptake. In addition, IRS-2 knockdown showed similar phenotype to chronic GH pretreatment. These data revealed that chronic GH pretreatment reduced IRS-2-PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway, and this reduction was the reason why glucose uptake was impaired in GH-pretreated cells. Consistent with this interpretation, IRS-1 knockdown did not affect insulin-induced glucose uptake, suggesting that it is possible that PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1 or IRS-2 facilitates different roles in glucose uptake. Similarly, studies using siRNA-mediated gene silencing revealed different functions for IRS-1 and IRS-2 in L6 myotube cells (40Huang C. Thirone A.C. Huang X. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19426-19435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have reported that IRS-1 and IRS-2 showed different localization in COS-7 cells (41Kabuta T. Hakuno F. Asano T. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6846-6851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not functionally identical and therefore could result in differential spatial localization of PI 3-kinase. Analyses of insulin signal activation revealed that chronic GH treatment impaired IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity even though the amount of PI 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit bound to IRS-2 was enhanced. There are several alternative hypotheses that might account for the suppression of IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity despite a physical increase in the amount of PI 3-kinase binding. First, some proteins, which bind to IRS-2, but not to IRS-1, in a GH-dependent manner, inhibited PI 3-kinase activation. It is well known that several proteins, including PTEN, that have phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity antagonize the PI 3-kinase activity. These proteins could be candidates for GH-induced IRS-2-associated protein. Alternatively, chronic GH treatment induced post-translational modification of IRS-2 and not IRS-1 leading to the inability of IRS-2 to activate PI 3-kinase. Recently, we reported that IRS-associated protein, 53BP2S, impaired GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (26Hakuno F. Kurihara S. Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37747-37758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus proteins that bind to IRS might modulate the insulin signals through inhibition of IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Surprisingly, chronic GH pretreatment or IRS-2 knockdown impaired insulin-induced activation of Akt but did not affect GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane. It is well established that insulin results in a robust activation of Akt that is in larger excess than required for GLUT4 translocation (42Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33119-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18318-18326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that a low level of Akt activation is sufficient for GLUT4 translocation, whereas greater Akt activity is required for activation of glucose uptake. In addition, it is also possible that appropriate subcellular localization of Akt activation is required to engage substrate required for GLUT4 activation. Previously, we reported that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are localized differently and thus altering the balance of Akt association with these docking proteins by chronic GH treatment could result in different substrate accessibilities. This disturbance would then account for the inability of activated Akt to phosphorylate Akt substrates essential for GLUT4 activation. Preliminary data suggest that chronic GH pretreatment suppressed insulin-stimulated Akt activation and substrate phosphorylation in the plasma membrane fraction with relatively normal Akt activation in the low density microsome fraction, in which GLUT4 vesicle is enriched. 6T. Ogata, K. Kasahara, F. Hakuno, and S.-I. Takahashi, unpublished data. Identification of plasma membrane Akt substrates, whose phosphorylation is suppressed by chronic GH pretreatment, is one approach that may resolve the potential differential signaling pathways of IRS-1- and IRS-2-mediated Akt activation. Although additional studies will be required to resolve these issues, our data clearly demonstrate that chronic GH pretreatment of adipocytes impairs GLUT4 glucose transport activity without affecting translocation to the plasma membrane. In addition, chronic GH pretreatment inhibits IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase leading to an impairment of GLUT4 transport activity on the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2086928230,"Studies of the ecology and evolution of avian nesting behavior have been limited by the difficulty and expense of sampling nest attendance behavior across entire days or throughout a substantial portion of the nestling period. Direct observation of nesting birds using human observers and most automated devices requires sub-sampling of the nestling period, which does not allow for the quantification of the duration of chick-feeding by parents within a day, and may also inadequately capture temporal variation in the rate at which chicks are fed. Here I describe an inexpensive device, the Automated Perch Recorder (APR) system, which collects accurate, long-term data on hourly rates of nest visitation, the duration of a pair's workday, and the total number of visits the pair makes to their nest across the entire period for which it is deployed. I also describe methods for verifying the accuracy of the system in the field, and several examples of how these data can be used to explore the causes of variation in and tradeoffs between the rate at which birds feed their chicks and the total length of time birds spend feeding chicks in a day."
https://openalex.org/W2028925508,"p53 is an important tumor suppressor regulating the cell cycle at multiple stages in higher vertebrates. The p53 gene is frequently deleted or mutated in human cancers, resulting in loss of p53 activity. This leads to centrosome amplification, aneuploidy, and tumorigenesis, three phenotypes also observed after overexpression of the oncogenic kinase Aurora A. Accordingly, recent studies have focused on the relationship between these two proteins. p53 and Aurora A have been reported to interact in mammalian cells, but the function of this interaction remains unclear. We recently reported that Xenopus p53 can inhibit Aurora A activity in vitro but only in the absence of TPX2. Here we investigate the interplay between Xenopus Aurora A, TPX2, and p53 and show that newly synthesized TPX2 is required for nearly all Aurora A activation and for full p53 synthesis and phosphorylation in vivo during oocyte maturation. In vitro, phosphorylation mediated by Aurora A targets serines 129 and 190 within the DNA binding domain of p53. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down studies indicate that the interaction occurs via the p53 transactivation domain and the Aurora A catalytic domain around the T-loop. Our studies suggest that targeting of TPX2 might be an effective strategy for specifically inhibiting the phosphorylation of Aurora A substrates, including p53."
https://openalex.org/W2020799468,"The human cytomegalovirus proteins US2 and US11 have co-opted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control to facilitate the destruction of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains. The class I heavy chains are dislocated from the ER to the cytosol, where they are deglycosylated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. We examined the role of TRAM1 (translocating chain-associated membrane protein-1) in the dislocation of class I molecules using US2- and US11-expressing cells. TRAM1 is an ER protein initially characterized for its role in processing nascent polypeptides. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that TRAM1 can complex with the wild type US2 and US11 proteins as well as deglycosylated and polyubiquitinated class I degradation intermediates. In studies using US2- and US11-TRAM1 knockdown cells, we observed an increase in levels of class I heavy chains. Strikingly, increased levels of glycosylated heavy chains were observed in TRAM1 knockdown cells when compared with control cells in a pulse-chase experiment. In fact, US11-mediated class I dislocation was more sensitive to the lack of TRAM1 than US2. These results provide further evidence that these viral proteins may utilize distinct complexes to facilitate class I dislocation. For example, US11-mediated class I heavy chain degradation requires Derlin-1 and SEL1L, whereas signal peptide peptidase is critical for US2-induced class I destabilization. In addition, TRAM1 can complex with the dislocation factors Derlin-1 and signal peptide peptidase.

More specifically, the HCMV US2 and US11 gene products alone can target the ER-localized major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains for extraction across the ER membrane by a process referred to as dislocation or retrograde translocation. The N-linked glycan is then removed upon exposure to the cytosol by N-glycanase (3Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), followed by proteasomal destruction (4Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L.

The HCMV US2 and US11 proteins utilize the ER quality control process to eliminate class I heavy cells in a similar manner as misfolded or damaged ER proteins (e.g. genetic mutants of α1-antitrypsin (6Qu D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (7Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar)) are targeted for degradation (8Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Hence, analysis of US2- and US11-mediated destruction of class I heavy chains provides an excellent system to delineate viral protein function as well as the ER quality control process. ER and cytosolic proteins are required for US2- and US11-mediated dislocation/degradation of class I heavy chains. Some of these proteins have also been identified in the processing of aberrant ER polypeptides. The ER chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, and BiP have been implicated in US2-mediated class I destruction (9Oresic K. Tortorella D. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 1122-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as well as in the removal of some misfolded ER proteins (10Romisch K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination machinery also participates in the extraction of class I heavy chains as ubiquitinated heavy chains are observed prior to dislocation (11Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For misfolded ER degradation substrates, ubiquitin conjugation enzymes (e.g. Ubc6p and Ubc7p/Cue1p) and ubiquitin ligases Hrd1p/Der3p, Doa10p, and Ubc1p have been implicated in the dislocation reaction (8Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ER membrane protein Derlin-1 along with SEL1L are involved in US11-mediated class I heavy chain degradation (13Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L.

Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ubiquitinated substrates are dislocated by the AAA-ATPase complex composed of p97-Ufd1-Npl4 (17Bays N.W. Hampton R.Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R366-R371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) while docked to the ER through its interaction with VIMP (14Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) followed by proteasome destruction. The inhibition of the proteasome causes the accumulation of deglycosylated class I heavy chain intermediate in US2 and US11 cells, allowing the dislocation and degradation reactions to be studied as separate processes (4Wiertz E.J.

Despite the identification of some cellular proteins that assist US2- and US11-mediated class I dislocation, the dislocation pore and accessory factors that mediate the efficient extraction of class I through the bilayer have yet to be completely defined. The current study explores the role of TRAM1 (translocating chain-associated membrane protein-1) in US2- and US11-mediated class I dislocation. TRAM1 is an ER-resident multispanning membrane protein that can mediate the lateral movement of select signal peptides and transmembrane segments from the translocon into the membrane bilayer (18Rapoport T.A. Goder V. Heinrich S.U. Matlack K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 568-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a property that makes it uniquely qualified to participate in the dislocation of a membrane protein. TRAM1 has been cross-linked to signal peptides as well as transmembrane domains of nascent polypeptides during the early stages of protein processing (19High S. Andersen S.S. Gorlich D. Hartmann E.

Interestingly, unlike the Sec61 complex and the signal recognition particle receptor, TRAM1 is not essential for the translocation of all membrane proteins into the ER (20Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hence, TRAM1 may utilize its ability to engage hydrophobic domains to assist in the efficient dislocation of membrane proteins. In fact, association and TRAM1 knockdown studies demonstrate that TRAM1 participates in US2- and US11-mediated dislocation of class I heavy chains. Collectively, our data suggest for the first time that TRAM1 plays a role in the dislocation of a membrane glycoprotein.

In short, each sample was assayed in triplicate, and the -fold change values and control changes for each gene were calculated using the median threshold cycle.

TRAM1HA Is Stably Expressed in U373 Cells—The ability of TRAM1 to mediate the lateral movement of transmembrane domains between aqueous and hydrophobic environments suggests that it may participate in the US2- and US11-induced extraction of class I heavy chains from the membrane bilayer to the cytosol. To address this hypothesis, we generated a TRAM1 construct that contained the hemagglutinin epitope tag (AYPYDVPDYA) at its amino terminus (TRAM1HA) that allows for the efficient recovery and detection of the TRAM1 protein. U373 (control), US2, and US11 cell lines that stably express TRAM1HA (U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA) were generated by retrovirus transduction. TRAM1HA was recovered exclusively from U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, and 6) and not from U373, US2, and US11 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, and 5). These results confirm the expression of TRAM1 and the specific recovery of the polypeptide. The localization of TRAM1HA to the ER was examined by its acquisition of an N-linked glycan. TRAM1HA molecules recovered from U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA cells were subjected to endoglycosidase H treatment followed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Endoglycosidase H is a bacterial enzyme that cleaves high mannose containing N-linked glycans from ER-resident polypeptides generating a faster migrating species (35Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Faster migrating TRAM1HA polypeptides were observed from U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA cells upon treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 4, and 6) compared with nontreated samples (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). The difference in the relative molecular weight of the two species (∼3-4 kDa) confirms that TRAM1HA acquires a single N-linked glycan, a result consistent with published data (36Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition, TRAM1HA continues to interact with the Sec61β subunit of the translocon under mild lysis conditions (Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that the chimeric TRAM1HA molecule acts similarly to its endogenous counterpart and can be utilized to identify possible protein complexes between TRAM1 with viral gene products, as well as class I heavy chains. TRAM1HA Complexes with Wild Type HCMV US2 and US11—The association of HCMV US2 and US11 with cellular factors SPP and Derlin-1 was an important finding implicating these cellular proteins in the dislocation/degradation of class I heavy chains (13Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 16Loureiro J. Lilley B.N. Spooner E. Noriega V. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following this line of experiments, our initial studies examined whether TRAM1HA can complex with the viral proteins US2 and US11 (Fig. 2A) to propose a role for TRAM1 in the destruction of class I molecules. TRAM1HA was recovered from U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA cells lysed either in Nonidet P-40 or CHAPS. Unlike Nonidet P-40, CHAPS is a mild detergent that can preserve transient interactions among membrane proteins. The anti-HA precipitates and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. TRAM1HA molecules were recovered under all lysis conditions (data not shown). Both US2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5) and US11 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6) co-precipitated with TRAM1HA independent of lysis conditions. Together, these findings suggest a complex exists between viral proteins and TRAM1HA. To confirm the specificity of the wild type US2 and US11 interaction with TRAM1, we examined the association of TRAM1HA with US2 (US2/CD4) (26Noriega V.M. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4031-4043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and US11 (US11Q192L) (37Lilley B.N. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) mutants that do not target class I for destruction. TRAM1HA was recovered from US2/CD4TRAM1-HA and US11Q192L-TRAM1-HA cells lysed in either CHAPS or Nonidet P-40 buffer mix and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. As expected, TRAM1HA polypeptides were recovered from US2/CD4TRAM1-HA (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4) and US11Q192L-TRAM1-HA cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-4) independent of lysis conditions. The anti-US2 or anti-US11 immunoblots revealed that the viral molecules co-precipitated with TRAM1HA only from cells lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 10). These results demonstrate that only a transient interaction exists between the mutant US2 and US11 molecules with TRAM1HA. In contrast, wild type US2 and US11 continue to complex with TRAM1HA in both Nonidet P-40 and CHAPS lysis buffer. The specific interaction of US2 and US11 with TRAM1 implies that the viral gene products recruit TRAM1 to participate in class I dislocation. Deglycosylated Class I Heavy Chain Intermediates Associate with TRAM1—An interaction between TRAM1 and class I polypeptides would strongly support the involvement of TRAM1 in class I heavy chain dislocation. Class I molecules can exist as glycosylated ER-resident species or deglycosylated intermediates in proteasome inhibitor-treated US2 and US11 cells (38Tortorella D. Story C.M. Huppa J.B. Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The observation of a deglycosylated class I molecule is indicative of the dislocation of the class I luminal domain into the cytosol. Therefore, experimental conditions were established to stabilize significant amounts of both glycosylated and deglycosylated class I heavy chains. US2 cells treated with different concentrations of proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS for up to 16 h were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). In cells treated with ZL3VS, both glycosylated (HC(+)CHO) and deglycosylated heavy chain intermediates (HC(-)CHO) were observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 2-6), a result consistent with published data (11Furman M.H.

Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We observed decreased levels of class I molecules in cells treated with inhibitor for 16 h (Fig. 3A, lane 6), possibly due to the potential toxic effects of proteasome inhibition. Similar results were observed from US11 cells. 3K. Oresic, C. L. Ng, and D. Tortorella, unpublished observations. We optimized conditions of proteasome inhibition (ZL3VS, 2.5 μm for 14 h; Figs. 3 and 4 and Fig. S3) that fulfilled our criteria for levels of glycosylated and deglycosylated heavy chains and were not detrimental to cellular metabolism (Fig. S2). Hence, subsequent proteasome inhibitor experiments utilized these conditions.FIGURE 4TRAM1 complexes with a membrane bound class I intermediate. U373 and U373TRAM1-HA cells (A) and US2TRAM1-HA and US11TRAM1-HA cells (B) treated with or without proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS (2.5 μm, 14 h) were subjected to subcellular fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The total cell lysates, 100,000 × g pellet, 100,000 × g supernatant, and anti-HA immunoprecipitates (IP) from the 100,000 × g pellet were subjected to anti-calnexin (A and B, lanes 1-12), anti-heavy chain (A and B, lanes 13-24), anti-GFP (A, lanes 25-36), and anti-HA (A, lanes 37-48; B, lanes 25-36) immunoblots. Calnexin, class I heavy chains (HC, HC(+)CHO, and HC(-)CHO), TRAM1HA, immunoglobulin light chain (IgG LC), and molecular weight standards are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly examine whether class I molecules complex with TRAM1HA, we performed an immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiment using U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA cells treated with or without proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3, B and C) lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to exclude transient interactions. Total cell lysates were used as a reference for the migration pattern of TRAM1HA and glycosylated and deglycosylated class I heavy chains (Fig. 3, B (lanes 5-7 and 12-14) and C (lanes 5-8 and 13-16)). Similar amounts of TRAM1HA polypeptides were recovered from U373TRAM1-HA, US2TRAM1-HA, and US11TRAM1-HA cells (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1-4), independent of ZL3VS treatment. As expected, glycosylated and deglycosylated class I heavy chains accumulated in proteasome inhibitor treated US2TRAM1-HA (Fig. 3B, lane 14) and US11TRAM1-HA (Fig. 3C, lane 16) cells. Strikingly, deglycosylated class I intermediate exclusively co-precipitated with TRAM1HA from ZL3VS-treated US2TRAM1-HA (Fig. 3B, lane 11) and US11TRAM1-HA (Fig. 3C, lane 12) cells and not the glycosylated heavy chain from U373TRAM1-HA and US2TRAM1-HA (Fig. 3B, lanes 8-11) or US11TRAM1-HA (Fig. 3C, lanes 9-11) cells. The specific interaction of TRAM1 with the class I deglycosylated intermediate suggests that TRAM1 probably participates in both US2- and US11-mediated class I dislocation. To further verify the complex between TRAM1 and the heavy chain intermediate, we showed that endogenous TRAM1 recovered from proteasome inhibitor-treated US2 and US11 cells associated with deglycosylated class I molecules (Fig. S3). The specificity of the TRAM1-class I interaction was demonstrated by the lack of association between TRAM1HA and the ER membrane protein calnexin or the cytosolic protein GAPDH (Fig. S4). Collectively, the experiments that revealed the association of TRAM with dislocated deglycosylated intermediates support a model in which TRAM1 plays a role in the latter step of US2- and US11-mediated class I heavy chain dislocation. TRAM1HA Complexes with Membrane-associated Class I Intermediate—To examine whether the class I deglycosylated intermediate that interacts with TRAM1 is tightly associated with the ER membrane, we performed an association experiment using ER-containing microsomes. Subcellular fractionation conditions were initially established using U373 and U373TRAM1-HA cells treated with or without proteasome inhibitor. The homogenized cells were subjected to differential centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”), in which the nuclear material and cell debris were removed at 15,000 × g, whereas the ER-containing microsomes were collected in the 100,000 × g pellet. The total cell lysates, 100,000 × g pellet, 100,000 × g supernatant, and anti-HA precipitates from the 100,000 × g pellet were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The membrane proteins calnexin and class I heavy chains were localized to the 100,000 × g pellet (Fig. 4A, lanes 4-6 and 16-18), whereas the cytosolic GFP molecule used to select for transductants fractionated exclusively with the 100,000 × g supernatant (Fig. 4A, lanes 35 and 36). The specificity of the anti-HA immunoprecipitates was verified due to"
https://openalex.org/W2039116895,"PQBP1 is a causative gene for X-linked mental retardation (MR) whose patients frequently show lean body. C. elegans has a strictly conserved homologue gene of PQBP1, T21D12.3.We generated Venus-transgenic and T21D12.3-mutant nematodes to analyze developmental expression patterns and in vivo functions of the nematode PQBP1 homologue protein (pqbp-1.1). During development, pqbp-1.1 is expressed from cell proliferation stage to larva stage. In larva, intestinal cells show the highest expression of pqbp-1.1, while it decreases in adult worms. The mutants of pqbp-1.1 show a decrease of the lipid content in intestinal cells. Especially, incorporation of fatty acid into triglyceride is impaired. ShRNA-mediated repression of PQBP1 also leads to reduction of lipid content in mammalian primary white adipocytes. CONCLUSION/ SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that pqbp-1.1 is involved in lipid metabolism of intestinal cells. Dysfunction of lipid metabolism might underlie lean body, one of the most frequent symptoms associating with PQBP1-linked MR patients."
https://openalex.org/W2095235244,"The combined deletion of 1p and 19q chromosomal arms is frequent in oligodendrogliomas (OD) and has recently been shown to be mediated by an unbalanced t(1;19) translocation. Recent studies of 1p/19q co-deleted OD suggest that the NOTCH2 gene is implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation and may be involved in this rearrangement. The objective of the present study was to analyze the NOTCH2 locus either as a chromosomal translocation locus that may be altered by the 1p/19q recurrent rearrangement or as a gene that may be inactivated by a two hit process. We performed an array-CGH analysis of 15 ODs presenting 1p/19q co-deletion using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray spanning 1p and 19q pericentromeric regions with 377 bp average probe spacing. We showed that the 1p deletion extends to the centromere of chromosome 1 and includes the entire NOTCH2 gene. No internal rearrangement of this gene was observed. This strongly suggests that the t(1;19) translocation does not lead to an abnormal NOTCH2 structure. The analysis of the entire NOTCH2 coding sequence was performed in four cases and did not reveal any mutation therefore indicating that NOTCH2 does not harbor genetic characteristics of a tumor suppressor gene. Finally, the detailed analysis of chromosome 19 pericentromeric region led to the identification of two breakpoint clusters at 19p12 and 19q11-12. Interestingly, these two regions share a large stretch of homology. Together with previous observations of similarities between chromosome 1 and 19 alphoid sequences, this suggests that the t(1;19) translocation arises from complex intra and interchromosomal rearrangements.This is the first comprehensive deletion mapping by high density oligo-array of the 1p/19q co-deletion in oligodendroglioma tumors using a methodological approach superior to others previously applied. As such this paper provides clear evidence that the NOTCH2 gene is not physically rearranged by t(1;19) translocation of oligodendroglioma tumors."

Additionally, aging impaired the ability of polyclonal T cells to induce acute allograft rejection.

https://openalex.org/W2008486185,"The high morphological resemblance between branching corals and trees, can lead to comparative studies on pattern formation traits, best exemplified in plants and in some cnidarians. Here, 81 branches of similar size of the hermatypic coral Stylophora pistillata were lopped of three different genets, their skeletons marked with alizarin red-S, and divided haphazardly into three morphometric treatment groups: (I) upright position; (II) horizontal position, intact tip; and (III) horizontal position, cut tip. After 1 y of in-situ growth, the 45 surviving ramets were brought to the laboratory, their tissues removed and their architectures analyzed by 22 morphological parameters (MPs). We found that within 1 y, isolated branches developed into small coral colonies by growing new branches from all branch termini, in all directions. No architectural dissimilarity was assigned among the three studied genets of treatment I colonies. However, a major architectural disparity between treatment I colonies and colonies of treatments II and III was documented as the development of mirror structures from both sides of treatments II and III settings as compared to tip-borne architectures in treatment I colonies. We did not observe apical dominance since fragments grew equally from all branch sides without documented dominant polarity along branch axis. In treatment II colonies, no MP for new branches originating either from tips or from branch bases differed significantly. In treatment III colonies, growth from the cut tip areas was significantly lower compared to the base, again, suggesting lack of apical dominance in this species. Changes in branch polarity revealed genet associated plasticity, which in one of the studied genets, led to enhanced growth. Different genets exhibited canalization flexibility of growth patterns towards either lateral growth, or branch axis extension (skeletal weight and not porosity was measured). This study revealed that colony astogeny in S. pistillata is a regulated process expressed through programmed events and not directly related to simple energy trade-off principles or to environmental conditions, and that branch polarity and apical dominance do not dictate colony astogeny. Therefore, plasticity and astogenic disparities encompass a diversity of genetic (fixed and flexible) induced responses."

https://openalex.org/W2040316306,"Background Integrase (IN) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) catalyzes the integration of viral DNA into host cellular DNA. We identified a bi-helix motif (residues 149–186) in the crystal structure of the catalytic core (CC) of the IN-Phe185Lys variant that consists of the α4 and α5 helices connected by a 3 to 5-residue turn. The motif is embedded in a large array of interactions that stabilize the monomer and the dimer. Principal Findings We describe the conformational and binding properties of the corresponding synthetic peptide. This displays features of the protein motif structure thanks to the mutual intramolecular interactions of the α4 and α5 helices that maintain the fold. The main properties are the binding to: 1- the processing-attachment site at the LTR (long terminal repeat) ends of virus DNA with a Kd (dissociation constant) in the sub-micromolar range; 2- the whole IN enzyme; and 3- the IN binding domain (IBD) but not the IBD-Asp366Asn variant of LEDGF (lens epidermal derived growth factor) lacking the essential Asp366 residue. In our motif, in contrast to the conventional HTH (helix-turn-helix), it is the N terminal helix (α4) which has the role of DNA recognition helix, while the C terminal helix (α5) would rather contribute to the motif stabilization by interactions with the α4 helix. Conclusion The motif, termed HTHi (i, for inverted) emerges as a central piece of the IN structure and function. It could therefore represent an attractive target in the search for inhibitors working at the DNA-IN, IN-IN and IN-LEDGF interfaces."
