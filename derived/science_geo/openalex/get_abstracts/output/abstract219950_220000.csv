https://openalex.org/W2022037801,"Although most higher plants establish a symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, symbiotic nitrogen fixation with rhizobia is a salient feature of legumes. Despite this host range difference, mycorrhizal and rhizobial invasion shares a common plant-specified genetic programme controlling the early host interaction. One feature distinguishing legumes is their ability to perceive rhizobial-specific signal molecules. We describe here two LysM-type serine/threonine receptor kinase genes, NFR1 and NFR5, enabling the model legume Lotus japonicus to recognize its bacterial microsymbiont Mesorhizobium loti. The extracellular domains of the two transmembrane kinases resemble LysM domains of peptidoglycan- and chitin-binding proteins, suggesting that they may be involved directly in perception of the rhizobial lipochitin-oligosaccharide signal. We show that NFR1 and NFR5 are required for the earliest physiological and cellular responses to this lipochitin-oligosaccharide signal, and demonstrate their role in the mechanism establishing susceptibility of the legume root for bacterial infection."

https://openalex.org/W2110483280,"The mouse mutant mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) exhibits muscle wasting, neurodegeneration, involution of the spleen and thymus, and death by 40 days of age. Degeneration of striatal neurons, with astrogliosis and microglia activation, begins at around 3 weeks of age, and other neurons are affected at later stages. Here we have identified the mnd2 mutation as the missense mutation Ser276Cys in the protease domain of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial serine protease Omi (also known as HtrA2 or Prss25). Protease activity of Omi is greatly reduced in tissues of mnd2 mice but is restored in mice rescued by a bacterial artificial chromosome transgene containing the wild-type Omi gene. Deletion of the PDZ domain partially restores protease activity to the inactive recombinant Omi protein carrying the Ser276Cys mutation, suggesting that the mutation impairs substrate access or binding to the active site pocket. Loss of Omi protease activity increases the susceptibility of mitochondria to induction of the permeability transition, and increases the sensitivity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to stress-induced cell death. The neurodegeneration and juvenile lethality in mnd2 mice result from this defect in mitochondrial Omi protease."

https://openalex.org/W2046064200,"Atopic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, are caused by both environmental and genetic factors. Here we show that infection by hepatitis A virus (HAV) may protect individuals from atopy if they carry a particular variant of the gene that encodes TIM-1 (also known as HAVcr-1) — the cell-surface receptor used by HAV to infect human cells1. Exposure to HAV is associated with poor hygiene, large family size and attendance at day-care centres, all factors that are also inversely associated with atopy2,3,4,5,6. Our discovery indicates that interaction between HAV and TIM-1 genotype may contribute to the aetiology of atopic diseases, and provides a mechanism to account for the hygiene hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094597562,"PINCH-1 is a widely expressed focal adhesion protein that forms a ternary complex with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and CH-ILKBP/actopaxin/α-parvin (abbreviated as α-parvin herein). We have used RNA interference, a powerful approach of reverse genetics, to investigate the functions of PINCH-1 and ILK in human cells. We report here the following. First, PINCH-1 and ILK, but not α-parvin, are essential for prompt cell spreading and motility. Second, PINCH-1 and ILK, like α-parvin, are crucial for cell survival. Third, PINCH-1 and ILK are required for optimal activating phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, an important signaling intermediate of the survival pathway. Whereas depletion of ILK reduced Ser473 phosphorylation but not Thr308 phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, depletion of PINCH-1 reduced both the Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of PKB/Akt. Fourth, PINCH-1 and ILK function in the survival pathway not only upstream but also downstream (or in parallel) of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. Fifth, PINCH-1, ILK and to a less extent α-parvin are mutually dependent in maintenance of their protein, but not mRNA, levels. The coordinated down-regulation of PINCH-1, ILK, and α-parvin proteins is mediated at least in part by proteasomes. Finally, increased expression of PINCH-2, an ILK-binding protein that is structurally related to PINCH-1, prevented the down-regulation of ILK and α-parvin induced by the loss of PINCH-1 but failed to restore the survival signaling or cell shape modulation.

Mammalian cell ECM adhesions (e.g. focal adhesions) are complex structures consisting of at least several dozens of structurally and functionally diverse proteins (6Burridge K.

Defining the functions of the cell-ECM adhesion proteins, therefore, is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian cell shape modulation, motility, survival, and other processes involving cell-ECM adhesions.PINCH is a family of proteins consisting of a tandem array of five LIM domains, structures that are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions (8Michelsen J.W.

Studies in mammalian cells using dominant negative mutants of PINCH, ILK, and parvin that inhibit the PINCH-ILK or the ILK-parvin interactions have provided biochemical and cell biological evidence suggesting that the interactions between PINCH, ILK, parvin, and/or other related proteins are important for cell adhesion, spreading, motility, and extracellular matrix assembly (20Tu Y.

Toward this goal, we have used RNA interference (RNAi), a powerful approach of reverse genetics (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 33Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3485) Google Scholar, 34Hudson D.F. Morrison C. Ruchaud S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 281-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), to suppress the expression of PINCH-1 and ILK in human cells and investigated the functional consequences. Our results demonstrate that PINCH-1 and ILK are indispensable for proper control of cell shape change, motility, and survival. Furthermore, they reveal a novel function of PINCH proteins in regulation of the protein levels of ILK and α-parvin and suggest that PINCH-1 is an obligate partner of ILK in proper control of cell behavior.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Other Reagents—Rabbit antibodies against AKT, phospho-Akt(Ser473) and phospho-Akt(Thr308) were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (mAb) (clone 349) was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). IGF-1, fetal bovine serum and cell culture media were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).RNA Interference—The sequences of PINCH-1 and ILK siRNA were selected based on a previously described method (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The targeted sequences (sense sequence) that we found effectively mediate the silencing of the expression of PINCH-1 and ILK are 5′- AAGGUGAUGUGGUCUCUGCUC-3′ (PINCH-1) and 5′-AAGGACACAUUCUGGAAGGGG-3′ (ILK), respectively. The sequence of siRNA that targets α-parvin was as previously described (35Fukuda T. Guo L. Shi X. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 21-nucleotide synthetic siRNA duplex was prepared by Dharmacon Research. Hela cells were transfected with the PINCH-1 siRNA, the ILK siRNA, the α-parvin siRNA, or a 21-nucleotide irrelevant RNA duplex as a control using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). In some experiments, caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (100 μm) and/or proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) (10 μm) were/was added into the culture medium 4-7 h after siRNA transfection. The cells were analyzed 48 h after siRNA transfection by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-PINCH antibodies, mouse anti-actin, anti-ILK (clone 65.1), anti-α-parvin (clone 3B5), anti-FLAG (M5), or anti-paxillin (clone 349) mAbs as specified in each experiment.Reverse Transcription PCR—RNA was isolated from cells (as specified in each experiment) using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription PCR was carried out using equal amounts (5 μg) of the isolated RNA and First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kits (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (18Zhang Y. Chen K. Guo L. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38328-38338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primer sets utilized are: (1) 5′-GCACTAGTGAATTCATGGCCAACGCCCTGGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTTATTTCCTTCCTAAGGTCTCAGC-3′(PINCH-1), (2) 5′-AGTCAAGCTTTCTACCATGGACGACATTTTCACTCA-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTGTCCTGCATCTTCTC-3′(ILK), and (3) 5′-TCGAATTCAATGGCCACCTCCCCGCAGAA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCTAGATCACTCCACGTTACGGTACTT-3′ (α-parvin).Cell Spreading—Cells (as specified in each experiment) were plated in Opti-MEM I serum free medium (Invitrogen) in fibronectin (10 μg/ml)-coated 96-well plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2-95% air atmosphere and the cell morphology was observed under an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope and recorded with a digital camera. Unspread cells were defined as round cells while spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes as described (20Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol.

The percentage of cells adopting spread morphology was quantified by analyzing at least 300 cells from four randomly selected fields (>80 cells/field).Cell Motility—Cell motility assay was performed as previously described (38Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Wu C. Fields A.J. Kapteijn B.A. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 821-829PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the undersurfaces of 8-mm pore diameter Transwell® motility chamber (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells (2 × 104) that were suspended in 0.1 ml of DMEM containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added to the upper chamber of the TranswellR motility chambers and incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2-95% air atmosphere for 18 h. Following incubation, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed. The membranes were fixed with 2% formalin, and the cells on the undersurface were stained with Gill's III hematoxylin. The cells from five randomly selected microscopic fields were counted, and cell motility was expressed as the number of the cells/mm2 of the microscopic fields + S.D.DNA Constructs and Transfection—The DNA construct (pUSEamp(+)/myr-Akt1) encoding myristoylated Akt was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The pFLAG-PINCH-2 expression vector encoding FLAG-PINCH-2 was previously described (18Zhang Y. Chen K. Guo L. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38328-38338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hela cells were transfected with pUSEamp(+)/myr-Akt1 (and pUSEamp(+) vector lacking Akt sequence as a control) or pFLAG-PINCH-2 (and pFLAG vector lacking PINCH-2 sequence as a control) using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). One day after DNA transfection, the cells were transfected with siRNA (as specified in each experiment) using Oligofectamine. The cells were analyzed 2 days after siRNA transfection by Western blotting with antibodies as specified in each experiment.IGF-1 Stimulation—Cells were transfected with the PINCH siRNA, the ILK siRNA or the control RNA as described above. One day after siRNA transfection, the siRNA transfectants and control cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for 18-24 h and then stimulated with DMEM containing 2 ng/ml IGF-1. At the end of stimulation, cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and analyzed by Western blotting.Apoptosis—Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Apoptosis was analyzed 48 h after RNA transfection using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 assays. In some experiments, Z-VAD (100 μm) was added into the culture medium 4 h after siRNA transfections. The TUNEL assay was performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science). The caspase-3 activities were measured using a colorimetric caspase-3 assay kit from Calbiochem.RESULTSRNAi Depletion of PINCH-1—To evaluate the functions of PINCH-1 in human cells, we transfected Hela cells with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets PINCH-1, an irrelevant small RNA as a negative control, and an α-parvin siRNA that we have previously shown effectively suppressed the expression of α-parvin (35Fukuda T. Guo L. Shi X. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transfection of the cells with the PINCH-1-specific siRNA resulted in a near total loss of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Depletion of PINCH-1 drastically reduced the level of ILK (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2) but did not alter the level of paxillin (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 1 and 2) or actin (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The level of α-parvin in the PINCH-1-deficient cells was modestly lower than that of the control cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2) but is substantially higher than cells that were transfected with the α-parvin siRNA (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 3). Conversely, depletion of α-parvin modestly reduced the levels of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3) and ILK (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the PINCH-1 siRNA effectively suppresses the expression of PINCH-1 without globally altering protein expression. Furthermore, they reveal that the cellular level of ILK, and to a less extend that of α-parvin, are regulated by PINCH-1.Functional Consequences of PINCH-1 Depletion—We next analyzed the functional consequences of the siRNA-mediated depletion of PINCH-1 on cell behavior. Previous studies using dominant negative forms of PINCH-1, α-parvin, or β-parvin have implicated important roles of PINCH (26Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol.

To test whether PINCH-1 or α-parvin is required for cell spreading, we plated the PINCH-1 siRNA transfectants, the α-parvin transfectants and the control transfectants on fibronectin-coated surface. As expected, a majority of the control cells began to spread within 30 min of plating (Fig. 2, C and G). By marked contrast, most of the PINCH-1-deficient cells remained round at the same time point (Fig. 2, A and G). The cell-spreading defect induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 was obvious even after prolonged incubation (2 h) (Fig. 2B) when the control cells adapted full spread morphology (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, depletion of α-parvin did no inhibit cell spreading (Fig. 2, E and F). In fact, a higher percentage of the α-parvin-deficient cells adapted spread morphology at 30 min of plating comparing to that of the control cells (Fig. 2G). Thus, PINCH-1, but not α-parvin, is required for prompt cell spreading.Fig. 2PINCH-1 is indispensable for proper control of cell spreading and motility.A-G, cell spreading. The PINCH-1 siRNA (A and B), the control RNA (C and D), and the α-parvin siRNA (E and F) transfectants were allowed to spread on fibronectin-coated plates for 30 min (A, C, and E) or 2 h (B, D, and F).

To do this, we plated the PINCH-1-deficient cells and the control cells in TranswellR motility chambers in which the undersurfaces of the membranes were pre-coated with fibronectin. As expected, the control cells migrated through the pores of the membrane within 18 h of plating (Fig. 2, I and J). By contrast, the PINCH-1-deficient cells were unable to migrate through the pores of the membrane under the identical condition (Fig. 2, H and J), suggesting that PINCH-1 is indispensable for normal cell motility.We have recently found that α-parvin is crucial for protecting cells from apoptosis (35Fukuda T. Guo L. Shi X. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was not known, however, whether PINCH-1 is involved in cell survival. To test this, we transfected Hela cells with the PINCH-1 siRNA and the control RNA, respectively, and analyzed the effect on apoptosis. The results showed that depletion of PINCH-1, like that of α-parvin (35Fukuda T. Guo L. Shi X. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), resulted in a significant increase of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3A) and TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that PINCH-1 is required for protection of cells from apoptosis. Consistent with the activation of caspase-3 induced by the depletion of PINCH-1, treatment of the cells with Z-VAD, a potent caspase inhibitor, completely blocked apoptosis induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that PINCH-1 functions in apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner.Fig. 3Depletion of PINCH-1 induces apoptosis.A, the activities of caspase-3 in PINCH-1-deficient cells and the control transfectants were quantified.

Apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy. C, the percentages of TUNEL-positive cells in PINCH-1-deficient cells, the control transfectants, the PINCH-1-deficient cells treated with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (100 μm), and the control transfectants treated with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (100 μm) were calculated by counting at least 800 cells from five randomly selected fields. Data represent means + S.D. D, PINCH-1 is required for optimal activating phosphorylation of PKB/Akt. The PINCH-1 siRNA transfectants (lanes 1 and 2) and the control RNA transfectants (lanes 3 and 4) were serum-starved (lanes 1 and 3) and stimulated with 2 ng/ml IGF-1 (lanes 2 and 4) for 10 min. The cell lysates (25 μg/lane) were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing phospho-Akt(Ser473), phospho-Akt(Thr308), Akt, and actin, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PKB/Akt is a signaling intermediate that is crucial for transmission of extracellular survival signals to downstream effectors including caspases (for recent reviews, see Refs. 40Cantley L.C.

Upon stimulation with extracellular survival factors (e.g. IGF-1), PKB/Akt is phosphorylated at Ser473 near the C terminus and Thr308 in the activation loop (43Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar), which leads to full activation of PKB/Akt and phosphorylation of a number downstream apoptosis mediators, resulting in protection of cells from apoptosis. Stimulation of control cells with IGF-1, as expected, induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig. 3D, lane 4). Depletion of PINCH-1 reduced (albeit did not eliminate) the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at Ser473 and Thr308 (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that PINCH-1 is involved in the regulation of the activating phosphorylation of PKB/Akt.RNAi Depletion of ILK—We next sought to suppress the expression of ILK, which we have previously shown to form a ternary complex with PINCH-1 and α-parvin in mammalian cells (20Tu Y.

To do this, we transfected Hela cells with the ILK-specific siRNA, and the PINCH-1 siRNA and an irrelevant small RNA as controls, respectively.

Here we show that PDZK1 controls in a tissue-specific and post-transcriptional fashion the expression of SR-BI in vivo. SR-BI protein expression in PDZK1 knock-out (KO) mice was reduced by 95% in the liver, 50% in the proximal intestine, and not affected in steroidogenic organs (adrenal, ovary, and testis). Thus, PDZK1 joins a growing list of adaptors that control tissue-specific activity of cell surface receptors. Hepatic expression of SR-BII, a minor splice variant with an alternative C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, was not affected in PDZK1 KO mice, suggesting that binding of PDZK1 to SR-BI is required for controlling hepatic SR-BI expression. The loss of hepatic SR-BI was the likely cause of the elevation in plasma total and HDL cholesterol and the increase in HDL particle size in PDZK1 KO mice, phenotypes similar to those observed in SR-BI KO mice. PDZK1 KO mice differed from SR-BI KO mice in that the ratio of unesterified to total plasma cholesterol was normal, females were fertile, and cholesteryl ester stores in steroidogenic organs were essentially unaffected. These differences may be due to nearly normal extrahepatic expression of SR-BI in PDZK1 KO mice. The PDZK1-dependent regulation of hepatic SR-BI and, thus, lipoprotein metabolism supports the proposal that this adaptor may represent a new target for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disease.

Cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind directly to cell surface receptors or to receptor-associated proteins play crucial roles in regulating various biological processes including signal transduction, adhesion, membrane trafficking, and cellular transport (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). They usually consist of evolutionarily shuffled combinations of modular protein interaction domains such as src-homology (SH2, SH3), phosphotyrosine binding, and PDZ domains that recognize short peptide or phosphopeptide epitopes (e.g. PDZ domains usually bind to the C-terminal 3–4 residues of interacting proteins) (2Hung A. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). These adaptors help link one or more integral membranes and otherwise non-membranous proteins into functional complexes (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). For example, PDZK1, a four PDZ domain-containing protein whose expression is increased in a significant number of human kidney, colon, lung, and breast carcinomas, interacts with a number of membrane-associated transporter proteins, including cMOAT/MRP2 (3Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H.M. Lab.

The multiple PDZ domains in PDZK1 may mediate its simultaneous interaction with several target proteins and, thus, permit it to orchestrate complex biological functions by acting as a scaffolding protein (9Kocher O.

Recently the phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing adaptor ARH (product of the defective gene in autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (10Zuliani G. Arca M. Signore A. Bader G. Fazio S.

In mice and humans, ARH deficiency causes loss of hepatic LDL receptor endocytic activity and, consequently, hypercholesterolemia (13Wilund K. Yi M. Campagna F. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Ho Y. Garcia J. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3019-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cell type-specific requirement for ARH suggests that the activities of other adaptors can substitute for that of ARH in some cells (e.g. fibroblasts), that these alternative adaptors are not expressed in or do not function effectively in ARH-sensitive cells (e.g. hepatocytes and/or lymphocytes), or that ARH plays some as yet undefined critical and dominant roles in controlling the endocytosis of LDL receptor in ARH-sensitive but not ARH-insensitive cells. These observations also raise the possibility that other adaptor proteins might control the function of other cell surface receptors in a similarly tissue-specific fashion. Manipulation of the activities of such adaptors might provide new insights into receptor physiology (e.g. new approach for tissue-specific knock-out/knockdown of receptor activity) and possibly attractive targets for pharmaceutical intervention in related disease processes (e.g. atherosclerosis) (12Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Here we have used recently described homozygous null PDZK1 knock-out (KO) mice (14Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to show that PDZK1 controls, in a tissue-specific, post-transcriptional fashion, the expression of the HDL receptor SR-BI and HDL metabolism. In PDZK1 KO mice SR-BI expression was dramatically reduced in the liver, mildly decreased in the proximal intestine, and not affected in the steroidogenic organs (adrenal, ovary, and testis). The loss of hepatic SR-BI expression in these mice is the likely cause of the elevation in total plasma cholesterol levels (14Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the presence of abnormally large HDL particles, as in the case for SR-BI knock-out mice (15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), wild-type mice in which hepatic SR-BI protein expression is abolished by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α agonist ciprofibrate (16Mardones P.

Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H.M. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28528-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, PDZK1 KO mice differ from SR-BI KO mice in a number of ways. First, in contrast to the presence of excess unesterified cholesterol in the plasma of SR-BI KO mice (42Braun A. Zhang S. Miettinen H. Ebrahim S. Holm T. Vasile E. Post M.J. Yoerger D. Picard M. Krieger J. Andrews N. Simons M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7283-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the unesterified-to-total cholesterol ratio was normal in PDZK1 KO mice. Second, the steroidogenic tissues of PDZK1 KO mice appeared to contain normal cholesteryl ester stores, presumably because these tissues expressed normal amounts of SR-BI protein. Finally, female PDZK1 KO mice, but not SR-BI KO females, are fertile (14Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Thus, PDZK1 joins ARH in what is likely to be a growing family of adaptors that control the tissue-specific expression and activity of cell surface receptors. Our findings also indicate that PDZK1 plays a key role in the control of HDL metabolism through its interaction with SR-BI in the liver and suggest that PDZK1 KO mice might be useful surrogates for mice with liver-specific (e.g. cre/lox) ablation of SR-BI expression for the analysis of the role of hepatic SR-BI expression in lipoprotein metabolism. Animals—PDZK1 knock-out and wild-type mice (129SvEv background) were maintained on a normal chow diet (14Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and were ∼6–12 weeks old at the time of the experiments. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center guidelines. Immunoblot Analysis, Immunoperoxidase, and Oil Red O Studies— Antibodies against SR-BI, SR-BII, and actin were purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) and Sigma or prepared as previously described (19Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 20Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Anti-apolipoprotein E (apoE) antiserum was a gift from R. L. Raffai and K. H. Weisgraber (University of California San Francisco, CA), and antiserum against apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) was purchased from Biodesign (Saco, ME). Karen Kozarsky (GlaxoSmithKline) provided the KKB-1 antibody that recognizes the extracellular domains of both SR-BI and SR-BII. For immunoblot analysis protein extracts (50 μg/lane) were fractionated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated with appropriate antisera and subsequently with an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1/10,000 (Invitrogen). Bound antibodies were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reaction and Super Signal West Pico Luminal reagents (Pierce). To quantitate the relative amounts of SR-BI in tissues, tissue lysates were serially diluted and subjected to electrophoresis/immunoblotting, and the relative intensities of the signals were compared by visual examination. For immunoperoxidase studies tissues were fixed for 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and then transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were then frozen in OCT compound (Miles Diagnostics, Elkhart, IN) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Immunoperoxidase studies were performed on 5-μm fixed-frozen tissue sections using primary antibodies against SR-BI. Normal rabbit IgG were used as negative controls. The sections were then incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG using a 1/200 dilution (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and subsequently treated with the Vectastain ABC reagents (Vector) and diaminobenzidine (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oil Red O and hematoxylin stainings were performed on 5-μm unfixed frozen tissue sections as previously described (21Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation—Tissues were surgically removed from PDZK1 knock-out and wild-type mice, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C until use. Frozen tissue samples were simultaneously disrupted and homogenized for up to 60 s using a Polytron (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland) in lysis buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) containing 145 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were homogenized further, and total RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system and TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each reaction contained 1× reverse transcription buffer, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm each dNTP, 2.5 μm random hexamer, 0.4 μl of RNase inhibitor, 1.25 units of multiscribe reverse transcriptase, 0.1 μg of total RNA, and RNase-free distilled H2O to a total volume of 10 μl per reaction. Reverse transcription reaction cycle parameters were as follows: 10 min at 25 °C, 30 min at 48 °C, and 5 min at 95 °C. SYBR Green Real-time Quantitative PCR—Oligonucleotide primers were designed using Primer Express software version 1.5 based on gene sequences obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base. All reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were carried out in duplicate in a 50-μl reaction volume containing reverse-transcribed cDNAs, 25 μl of 2× SYBR Green Master Mix, and each forward and reverse primer at a concentration of 50 nm. Conditions for all SYBR Green PCR reactions were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data were gathered and analyzed using the SDS 1.9 software on a G4 Power Macintosh computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). Results were normalized with respect to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Threshold cycle (Ct) values were exported into a Microsoft Excel worksheet for calculation of gene expression according to the ΔΔCt method (Applied Biosystems). Levels of gene expression in knockout mice were represented with respect to those of wild-type animals as knock-out/wild-type ratios. Plasma Cholesterol and Lipoprotein Analysis—Plasma was collected from PDZK1 knock-out and wild-type mice after a 4-h fast. Total cholesterol, unesterified (“free”) cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids were measured using kits from Wako (Richmond, VA). Plasma was fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography, and the cholesterol and apolipoprotein compositions of the fractions were determined by enzymatic kit and immunoblotting, respectively (15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as the means ± S.E. Statistically significant differences were determined by pairwise comparisons of each value from knock-out mice with wild-type controls by using unpaired Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant for differences between experimental groups. We have previously reported that PDZK1 KO mice exhibit an ∼1.8-fold elevation in plasma total cholesterol concentration (14Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and others have suggested that PDZK1 interactions with SR-BI in the liver may play an important role in controlling SR-BI expression and function and, thus, HDL metabolism (7Ikemoto M.

Because the loss of SR-BI expression in SR-BI KO mice results in an ∼2-fold elevation in plasma cholesterol (15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that the increased plasma cholesterol in PDZK1 KO mice might have been due to reduced hepatic SR-BI protein levels in these mice. We therefore used immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses to measure SR-BI protein expression in PDZK1 KO mice. The immunoblot analysis of SR-BI expression (Fig. 1 and data not shown) demonstrates that there was an ∼95% reduction in SR-BI protein expression in the livers of PDZK1 KO mice relative to wild-type controls. In contrast, there was only a modest reduction (50%) in the much lower expression levels of SR-BI protein in the small intestine and no detectable change in the adrenal gland, which exhibits especially high SR-BI levels (19Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). The results of immunoblotting were supported by immunohistochemical (immunoperoxidase) analysis of SR-BI expression (Fig. 2) in the liver (hepatocytes), small intestine (epithelial cells), adrenal gland (cortex), testis (Leydig cells), and ovary (stroma and corpus luteum) in control wild-type (left) and PDZK1 KO (right) mice. The cell type and intracellular patterns of SR-BI expression in these organs were similar to those reported previously (19Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 22Landschulz K.T. Pathak R. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

The intensity of SR-BI staining in PDZK1 KO mice relative to wild-type mice was markedly reduced in liver, moderately reduced in small intestinal mucosa, and not changed in adrenal cortex, ovary, or testis. The ∼50% reduction in SR-BI protein expression in the small intestine (Fig. 1) was apparently due to a homogenous decrease in all SR-BI-expressing epithelial cells of the mucosa (Fig. 2) rather than to varying extents of altered SR-BI expression in different subtypes of cells within this organ.Fig. 2Immunohistochemical analysis of SR-BI expression in tissues from wild-type and PDZK1 knock-out mice. Immunoperoxidase staining of liver, small intestine, adrenal, testis, and ovary harvested from wild-type (WT; left) and PDZK1 KO (right) mice was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note the typical staining pattern of SR-BI in hepatocytes, small intestinal mucosa, adrenal cortex, testicular Leydig cells, ovarian corpus luteum, and stroma. The intensity of staining was markedly reduced in liver, moderately reduced in the epithelial cells of the small intestine, and not changed in the adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries of PDZK1 knock-out compared with wild-type mice.

When we visualized the neutral lipid stores in the adrenals by staining tissue sections with the dye Oil Red O we saw essentially no differences in staining between the wild-type and PDZK1 KO samples (Fig. 3). Thus, in steroidogenic tissues, in which PDZK1 expression is low (7Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) and SR-BI expression is normally high (19Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar), SR-BI protein was expressed in normal amounts and distribution and apparently functioned properly in providing substrate for cholesteryl ester storage even in the absence of a functional PDZK1 gene. The expression of SR-BI in the liver is generally thought to be responsible for SR-BI marked influence on the structure and abundance of HDL in murine plasma (15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In homozygous null SR-BI KO relative to wild-type mice, HDL cholesterol levels and the sizes of HDL particles are increased based on gel filtration chromatography analysis. The abnormally large HDL particles in SR-BI KO mice also carry increased amounts of apoE (15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Thus, if the loss of hepatic SR-BI protein expression in PDZK1 KO mice is responsible for their hypercholesterolemia, we would expect that the plasma lipoprotein profiles in these mutant mice might in some ways resemble the abnormal lipoproteins found in SR-BI KO mice. Table I shows the lipid composition of plasma from wild-type and PDZK1 KO male and female mice. The effects of the mutation on the plasma lipids of males and females were generally similar, and the pooled results will be considered below. As previously reported (14Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the PDZK1 KO mice were hypercholesterolemic. The total plasma cholesterol was ∼1.7-fold higher in the PDZK1 KO mice; the fold increases in unesterified and esterified cholesterol were 1.9 and 1.6, respectively. The increases in plasma cholesterol were accompanied by increases in phospholipids and triglycerides. To further assess the structures of the lipoproteins, plasma samples from individual mice were size-fractionated by Sepharose 4B fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography. The lipoprotein total cholesterol profiles of representative animals are shown in Fig. 4A.Table IEffects of disruption of the PDZK1 gene on plasma lipid concentrationsGenderGenotypeTCap < 0.001 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.UCbp < 0.001 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.UC/TCTGPLcp < 0.01 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.Sample sizemg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlMalesWT91 ± 722 ± 10.24 ± 0.0132 ± 7164 ± 9n = 7PDZK1 KO144 ± 838 ± 20.27 ± 0.0136 ± 5212 ± 12n = 6FemalesWT78 ± 418 ± 10.23 ± 0.0116 ± 1131 ± 6n = 8PDZK1 KO139 ± 634 ± 10.24 ± 0.00425 ± 3dp < 0.01 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.188 ± 5n = 8M + FWT84 ± 419 ± 10.23 ± 0.0124 ± 4146 ± 7n = 15PDZK1 KO141 ± 536 ± 10.25 ± 0.0130 ± 3198 ± 6n = 14a p < 0.001 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.b p < 0.001 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.c p < 0.01 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.d p < 0.01 vs. the corresponding wild-type group.

Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The main protein component of HDL, apoA-I, was found in this HDL peak (Fig. 4B, upper panels). Some apoE was found in this peak, but the majority of it was associated with larger particles (lower fraction numbers). In the PDZK1 KO mice (Fig. 4B, lower panels), the peak of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I was shifted to the left, indicating that the HDL particles were larger in the mutant mice. There was also more apoE in the PDZK1 KO plasma distributed into bigger particles within the large HDL- and IDL/LDL-size ranges. The changes in the shape of the lipoprotein profile of the PDZK1 KO mice compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 4A) were similar to those seen in SR-BI KO mice (15Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) and in wild-type mice in which hepatic SR-BI protein expression was abolished by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α agonist ciprofibrate (16Mardones P. Pilon A. Bouly M. Duran D. Nishimoto T. Arai H. Kozarsky K.F. Altoyo M. Miquel J. Luc G. Clavey V. Staels B. Rigotti A. J. Biol.

Therefore, we conclude that the loss of hepatic SR-BI protein expression is the most likely cause of the hypercholesterolemia in PDZK1 KO mice. We observed two striking unanticipated differences between PDZK1 KO and SR-BI KO mice. In wild-type mice on a mixed C57/Bl6:129 genetic background, the unesterified to total cholesterol ratio is about 0.26–0.31, whereas that for SR-BI KO mice is about 0.5 (24Braun A. Trigatti B.L.

Some resistance mutations can also suppress resistance caused by other resistance mutations. We report the molecular mechanisms by which a virus resistant to lamivudine with the M184V reverse transcriptase mutation shows increased susceptibility to tenofovir and can suppress the effects of the tenofovir resistance mutation K65R. Additionally, we report how the decreased viral replication capacity of resistant viruses is directly linked to their decreased ability to use natural nucleotide substrates and that combination of the K65R and M184V resistance mutations leads to greater decreases in viral replication capacity. All together, these results define at the molecular level how nucleoside-resistant viruses can be driven to reduced viral fitness.

Nucleoside analogue drugs are core constituents of antiretroviral regimens to control HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type I; NRTI, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; RT, reverse transcriptase; 3TC, 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′thiacythidine; 3TC-TP, 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′thiacythidine 5′-triphosphate; tenofovir-PP, tenofovir diphosphate; dNTP, 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate; ddNTP, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate; Inorganic pyrophosphate, PPi; kpol, burst rate. infection (1.De Clercq E. J. Clin. Virol. 2001; 22: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Once activated to the 5′-triphosphate state in the infected cell, they target the viral reverse transcriptase (RT), a specialized DNA polymerase encoded by the viral pol gene. In the clinic, however, treatment failures can occur that result in the development of drug-resistant virus. Both the high adaptive capacity of HIV-1 and the incomplete suppression of viral replication are responsible for the selection of drug-resistant viruses (2.Menendez-Arias L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3.Miller V. Larder B.A. Antivir. Ther. 2001; 6: 25-44PubMed Google Scholar). Controlling the appearance and spread of drug-resistant viruses requires novel drugs of increased potency that do not readily elicit resistance, and that are active against resistant viruses. The potency of a nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) as an inhibitor of viral replication depends on several factors. First, the NRTI must be activated to the 5′-triphosphate state by cellular kinases. Second, the analogue 5′-triphosphate must be an efficient substrate for RT that competes significantly at its cellular concentration with its natural dNTP counterpart to terminate viral DNA chain extension. Third, it is increasingly apparent that stability of the analogue-terminated DNA and inefficient excision by RT are key factors in sustained inhibition. Viral drug resistance has been shown to involve the second and third steps listed above (4.Selmi B. Deval J. Boretto J. Canard B. Antiviral Therapy. 2003; 8: 143-154PubMed Google Scholar). There is intense ongoing research aimed at elucidating resistance mechanisms at the molecular level. In most cases, the corresponding substituted RT (referred to as mutant, mutated, or resistant therein) has altered biochemical properties accounting for viral resistance. At present, two classes of resistance mechanisms for NRTIs have been characterized. The first class involves an increased discrimination of the nucleotide analogue 5′-triphosphate at the RT active site relative to the natural substrate dNTP. Discrimination can be achieved either through selective decreased binding of the 5′-triphosphate analogue (reflected by an increase in the binding equilibrium constant Kd), or at the catalytic step of incorporation of the analogue 5′-monophosphate into viral DNA (reflected by a decrease of kpol value, the catalytic constant of incorporation of the nucleotide analogue into DNA). Lamivudine (3TC) and 2′-3′ dideoxynucleosides (ddNs, e.g. ddI and ddC) typically select resistance mutations conferring increased discrimination properties to the resistant RT (5.Krebs R. Immendorfer U. Thrall S.H. Wohrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10292-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6.Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The other class of resistance mechanisms involves repair of the analogue-terminated DNA chain. In this mechanism, the resistant RT exhibits enhanced repair (also named excision or unblocking) of the analogue monophosphate-terminated DNA chain. The repair reaction utilizes pyrophosphate (PPi) or a nucleoside 5′-triphosphate (NTP) as a co-substrate to unblock the analogue 5′-monophosphate terminated DNA chain in a reaction chemically similar to pyrophosphorolysis, the reversal of the polymerization reaction (8.Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 9.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Zidovudine (AZT) or stavudine (d4T) can select for RT mutations such as M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219(Q/E/N/R) that act by this repair mechanism. As a group, these mutations are referred to as thymidine analogue-associated mutations or TAMs (10.Larder B. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. CSHL Press, 1992: 205-222Google Scholar, 11.Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar). As a result of acquiring drug resistance, drug-resistant viruses often have a replicative disadvantage relative to wild-type viruses in the absence of drug (12.Quinones-Mateu M.E. Arts E.J. Drug. Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence showing that some of these replication-impaired (or unfit) viruses might be less pathogenic and better controlled than wild-type viruses (13.Sufka S.A. Ferrari G. Gryszowka V.E. Wrin T. Fiscus S.A. Tomaras G.D. Staats H.F. Patel D.D. Sempowski G.D. Hellmann N.S. Weinhold K.J. Hicks C.B. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, some NRTIs such as 3TC and AZT (14.Gotte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15.Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) select mutant RTs that have antagonistic resistance mutations where resistance to 3TC decreases resistance to AZT. Treatment combining AZT with 3TC leads to a more sustained efficacy than treatment with either alone, although virus resistant to both drugs will eventually evolve without adequate viral load suppression. Consequently, it is possible that certain combinations of drugs might deliberately lead to a genetically defined virus with altered fitness and a resistance profile such that the virus remains fully or partially susceptible to drugs in the current or next regimen. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is an orally bioavailable form of tenofovir that has shown potent and durable efficacy in phase III clinical trials (16.Schooley R.T. Ruane P. Myers R.A. Beall G. Lampiris H. Berger D. Chen S.S. Miller M.D. Isaacson E. Cheng A.K. Aids. 2002; 16: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Tenofovir is an acyclic nucleotide phosphonate analogue of AMP that is active on RT in its diphosphate form (tenofovir-PP). The RT mutation K65R appears to be the only mutation selected for by tenofovir in vitro and in vivo, and results in low level resistance to tenofovir (17.Wainberg M.A. Miller M.D. Quan Y. Salomon H.

Miller M.D. Aids. 2002; 16: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This resistance is partially to fully suppressed when present in combination with the 3TC/emtricitabine (FTC)-resistance mutation M184V (17.Wainberg M.A. Miller M.D. Quan Y. Salomon H. Mulato A.S. Lamy P.D. Margot N.A. Anton K.E. Cherrington J.M. Antivir. Ther. 1999; 4: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Margot N.A. Isaacson E. McGowan I. Cheng A.K. Schooley R.T.

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3437-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on RT resistance mutations acting through discrimination of the nucleotide analogue relative to its natural counterpart, specifically K65R, M184V, and the multidrug-resistant Q151M complex mutations, and their effects on drug susceptibility, RT enzymatic function, and viral replication capacity. We give a mechanistic basis for the reduced resistance, as well as the impaired viral and enzymatic fitness of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase containing both K65R and M184V mutations. Phenotypic Assays of Drug Susceptibility—Phenotypic data for tenofovir, zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and abacavir were obtained for patient-derived recombinant viruses present in the Virco library using the Antivirogram assay (Virco Central Virological Laboratory, Mechelen, Belgium). The antiretroviral histories of patients from whom these viruses were obtained are unknown. Viruses were chosen based on their RT genotype of M184V alone (n = 10), K65R alone (n = 5), K65R in combination with M184V (n = 5), and the combination of Q151M, V75I, F77L, and F116Y (n = 5). Assay of Viral Replication Capacity—Replication capacity was measured using a single cycle virus growth assay as previously described with patient-derived recombinant viruses present in the ViroLogic library (ViroLogic, S. San Francisco, CA) (19.White K.L. Margot N.A. Wrin T. Petropoulos C.J. Miller M.D. Naeger L.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3437-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20.Deeks S.G. Wrin T. Liegler T. Hoh R. Hayden M. Barbour J.D. Hellmann N.S. Petropoulos C.J. McCune J.M. Hellerstein M.K. Grant R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The antiretroviral histories of patients from whom these viruses were obtained are unknown. Viruses were chosen that contained no NRTI-associated or protease inhibitor (PI)-associated resistance mutations (wild-type, n = 1307), K65R alone (n = 17), M184V alone (n = 291), K65R plus M184V (n = 12), or Q151M complex plus M184V (n = 8), all in the absence of thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) or PI-associated resistance mutations. None of the samples contained mixtures at positions 65, 151, or 184. Briefly, a retroviral vector was constructed using the NL4-3 infectious molecular clone of HIV-1. The vector contains a luciferase expression cassette replacing the HIV-1 envelope (21.Petropoulos C.J. Parkin N.T. Limoli K.L. Lie Y.S. Wrin T. Huang W. Tian H. Smith D. Winslow G.A. Capon D.J. Whitcomb J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). NL4-3 protease and RT sequences were replaced with corresponding patient-derived sequences. Recombinant virus stocks were generated by co-transfecting 293 cells with retroviral vector DNA pools and an expression vector that produces the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope protein. After normalization, the amount of luciferase activity in cells infected with recombinant pseudotyped virus was used as a direct measure of replication capacity, i.e. the ability of the virus to complete a single cycle of viral replication. Relative replication capacity was assessed by comparing the amount of luciferase activity produced by mutant recombinant viruses to the amount of luciferase activity produced by the control NL4-3 virus and adjusted to reflect the difference between NL4-3 and the average replication capacity of wild-type (drug-sensitive) clinical isolates. HIV-RT Plasmid Constructions, Enzyme Preparations, and Re-agents—The wild-type RT bacterial expression gene construct p66RTB was used to obtain K65R, M184V, K65R/M184V, and Q151M RT as described (22.Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant RTs were co-expressed with HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli in order to obtain p66/p51 heterodimers, which were later purified using affinity chromatography. All enzymes were quantitated by active-site titration before biochemical studies. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, MA). γ-32P-labeled adenosine 5′-triphosphate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Pre-steady State Kinetics of Single Nucleotide Incorporation Into DNA—Pre-steady state kinetics were performed using dATP, dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, tenofovir-PP and 3TC-TP in conjunction with wild-type, K65R, M184V, K65R/M184V, and Q151M RT. Rapid quench experiments were performed with a Kintek instrument Model RQF-3 using reaction times ranging from 10 ms to 30 s. All indicated concentrations are final. The primer DNA/DNA oligonucleotides used for the rapid reaction were a 5′-labeled 21-mer primer (5′-ATA CTT TAA CCA TAT GTA TCC-3′) annealed to a 31-mer template 31T-RT (5′-TTT TTT TTT AGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dTTP, a 31A-RT (5′-AAA AAA AAA TGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dATP/tenofovir-PP, a 31C-RT (5′-TTT TTT TTT GGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dCTP/3TC-TP and 31G-RT (5′-TTT TTT TTT CGG ATA CAT ATG GTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dGTP. For natural nucleotides, the reaction was performed by mixing a solution containing 50 nm (active sites) of HIV-1 RT bound to 100 nm of primer/template in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), and a variable concentration of dNTP in 6 mm MgCl2. Reactions involving 3TC-TP and tenofovir-PP were conducted with excess concentrations of enzyme (200 nm) over primer/template duplex (100 nm). These conditions were chosen to eliminate the influence of the enzyme turnover rate (kss) that interferes in the measurements of low incorporation rates. The products of reactions were analyzed using sequencing gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide, 8 m urea in Tris borate/EDTA buffer), and quantified using photo-stimulated plates and FujiImager. The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst equation shown in Equation 1, (P)=A·(1-exp(-(kapp·t))+kss·t(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of the burst, kapp is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and kss is the enzyme turnover rate, i.e. the kinetic constant of the steady-state linear phase. The dependence of kapp on dNTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic Equation 2, kapp=kpol·[dNTP](Kd+[dNTP])(Eq. 2) where Kd and kpol are the equilibrium constant and the catalytic rate constant of the dNTP for RT, respectively. Kd and kpol were determined from curve-fitting using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, PA).

Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). We extracted amino acids surrounding the catalytic DNA polymerase domain within a radius of 25 Å. This model of HIV-RT included the residues of both p66 and p51 domain, DNA template/primer, two catalytic magnesium ions, and dTTP. Close attention was given for both magnesium ions, because they have a key role in positioning the incoming dNTP or NRTI and in catalysis. In order to prepare the closed RT-DNA-dTTP complex (26.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), the authors used a ddGTP primer terminus positioned at the so-called “Priming site” (P site). We replaced ddGTP by dGTP and interactions of its 3′-OH with Mg2+ were optimized. In the crystal structure, both magnesium ions were complexed only with residues Asp-185, Asp-110, and Val-111. By a conformational analysis, we optimized the complexation process of both Mg2+. The complexation process of Mg2+, with the incoming nucleotide via its triphosphate chain and residues Asp-110, Val-111, and Asp-185, was found to be the same as in the crystal structure of the ternary complex made of RT-DNA-dTTP. The complexation of the second Mg2+ was optimized. Positions of Asp-186 and Asp-110 side chains were optimized in order to obtain a better complexation process. This second Mg2+ was complexed with Asp-186 (Oδ1 carboxylate side chain), Asp-185 (Oδ2 carboxylate side chain), and 3′-OH dGTP primer terminus. All minimizations were conducted with Linux RedHat 7.3 workstations, on a 2.0 GHz bi-Xeon Pentium° 4 processor. Hydrogen atoms were added to the enzyme, DNA duplex and dTTP within the Biopolymer module of GenMol. Hydrogen positions were then optimized. The construction of the nucleotide triphosphate was based on x-ray conformation of dTTP present in the ternary complex RT-DNA-dTTP. All-Atom charges were computed with GenMol for RT-DNA, both Mg2+, dATP and tenofovir-PP (24.Pepe G. Siri D. Stud. Phys. Theor. Chem. 1990; 71: 93-101Google Scholar, 25.Pepe G. Seres B. Laporte D. Del Re C. J. Theor. Biol. 1985; 115: 571-593Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The substituted RT structures were obtained by changing selected amino acid (M184V). The adenine at the position 5 of the template was mutated to the counterpart of the incoming nucleotide dATP and tenofovir-PP (A to T). The conformation of 5th template nucleotide and the side chain of selected amino acid were minimized within the Biopolymer module of GenMol, using a conformational analysis method. Finally, the incoming dATP or tenofovir-PP were docked into the DNA-polymerase active site from the positioning of dTTP present in the x-ray structure ternary complex (nucleoside binding site, N site). The resulting ternary complexes were optimized using GenMol All-Atom force field. The interplay between suppressive mutations and viral fitness bears potential to increase the efficacy of antiretroviral drug regimens. The aim of our study was to determine the potential for tenofovir in such a strategy. We investigated the mechanism of drug resistance to tenofovir by its most relevant mutation K65R in order to identify which drug would be best combined with tenofovir in terms of resistance suppression, as well as resistance mutations that would maximize the alteration of viral replication capacity. HIV-1 Genotypes Associated with Reduced Susceptibility to Tenofovir—Table I shows antiviral susceptibilities determined using the Virco Antivirogram for patient-derived samples. Patient samples were selected that contained M184V alone, K65R alone, K65R plus M184V, or the Q151M substitution with additional resistance mutations including V75I, F77L, and F116Y in all cases (Q151M complex). When compared with the wild-type, viruses containing M184V demonstrated high level susceptibility changes to 3TC (>50-fold) and no significant changes for all other nucleosides and tenofovir. Viruses containing K65R showed decreased susceptibility for 3TC, tenofovir, ddI, and abacavir (2.0-7.7-fold), but were not significantly changed for AZT and d4T (1.1- and 1.6-fold, respectively). The K65R and M184V double mutants showed high-level susceptibility changes for lamivudine (>50-fold) and further decreased susceptibility for ddI and abacavir (2.5- and 7.6-fold, respectively). For tenofovir, AZT, and d4T, however, the susceptibility values for the K65R + M184V double mutant were improved relative to K65R alone (1.7-, 0.7- and 1.0-fold relative to wild-type, respectively). The Q151M complex viruses showed high-level resistance to all NRTIs (>11-fold), except to lamivudine and tenofovir, where the susceptibility changes were minimal compared with wild-type (2.1- and 1.8-fold, respectively). In summary for tenofovir, full in vitro activity against M184V was maintained. Low level phenotypic changes were demonstrated for the K65R mutant viruses, and this was partially reversed when M184V was also present. These results with patient-derived HIV isolates parallel two published studies with site-directed recombinant viruses that showed significantly increased tenofovir susceptibility for viruses with K65R plus M184V relative to K65R alone (17.Wainberg M.A. Miller M.D. Quan Y.

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in resistance and suppression of resistance, the incorporation of the active metabolite of tenofovir, tenofovir-PP, by RTs carrying these mutations was investigated using pre-steady state kinetics.Table ISummary of tenofovir and nucleoside analogue susceptibilitiesMean fold decrease in susceptibility from wild-type (range)aFold change versus wild-type control using the Virco Antivirogram assay with tenofovir, zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and abacavirResistance groupNTenofovirAZT3TCddId4TAbacavirK65R52.7bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (1.8-3.8)1.1 (0.7-1.9)7.7bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (1.1-15.6)2.0bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (0.9-3.2)1.6 (1.0-2.0)2.9bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (2.3-3.5)M184V100.7 (0.3-1.3)0.9 (0.2-1.5)>50bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (>50)1.0 (0.3-2.4)1.4 (0.4-2.8)1.3 (0.9-2.4)K65R + M184V51.7 (0.4-3.5)0.7 (0.4-1.1)>50bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (>50)2.5bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (1.8-2.9)1.0 (0.4-1.7)7.6bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (2.3-14.3)Q151M complex51.8bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (1.1-3.0)43bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (9.6-85)2.1bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (1.3-2.6)13bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (6.4-31)20bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (6.1-57)11bStatistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) (3.0-24)a Fold change versus wild-type control using the Virco Antivirogram assay with tenofovir, zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and abacavirb Statistically significant decrease in susceptibility as compared to a panel of 10 viruses with wild-type HIV sequence (p < 0.01, Student's t test) Open table in a new tab Mechanisms of RT-mediated Tenofovir-PP Resistance—A nucleotide analogue 5′-triphosphate is characterized by its efficiency of incorporation (kpol/Kd) into DNA as compared with that of its natural counterpart. For a given RT, comparing kpol/Kd values between a natural dNTP and its corresponding analogue is a convenient manner to evaluate selectivity for (or discrimination of) the analogue. Comparing selectivity between RTs defines in vitro resistance (or susceptibility) at the enzymatic level. The results are presented in Table II and Fig. 1. K65R was found to be the most tenofovir-PP resistant RT, in accordance with the fact that this is the only tenofovir-selected mutation that has been shown to develop in vitro and in tenofovir-treated patients to date (17.Wainberg M.A. Miller M.D. Quan Y.

This mutation is known to occur at low frequency during regimens making use of dideoxynucleosides (ddC and ddI) as well as for abacavir. The molecular mechanism of resistance to ddNs by K65R is known in great detail: ddNTPs bind to K65R RT with the same affinity as dNTPs, but their incorporation rate is decreased selectively, accounting for resistance (6.Selmi B.

The sulfogroup on tyrosine is labile and is released from peptides under normal mass spectrometric conditions. Thus, special approaches must be considered in order to identify this modification. By using a combination of mass spectrometry studies operating in negative and positive ion mode, tyrosine sulfation could be identified. In positive mode, the peptides normally appeared non-sulfated, whereas in negative mode a mixture of sulfated and non-sulfated species was observed. A combination of peptides released by different proteinases was used to obtain details on the locations of sulfate groups. Multiple tyrosine sulfates were observed in the N-terminal region of fibromodulin (up to 9 sites), osteoadherin (up to 6 sites), and lumican (2 sites). Osteoadherin contains two additional sulfated tyrosine residues close to its C terminus. We also identified an error in the published sequence of bovine fibromodulin, resulting in the replacement of Thr37 by Tyr37-Gly38, thus increasing its homology with its human counterpart.

Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification found on many secreted and membrane-bound proteins. As much as 1% of all tyrosine residues of the total protein in an organism can be sulfated, making this the most common post-translational modification of this residue (1.Huttner W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been reported to contain sulfated tyrosines (2.Niehrs C. Beisswanger R. Huttner W.B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Sulfation is suggested to occur at tyrosines located in close proximity to acidic residues (3.Bundgaard J.R. Vuust J.

Each enzyme may have a different substrate specificity and act on a different subset of target proteins. Tyrosine sulfation of chemokine receptor CCR-5 by TPST-1 and TPST-2 follows a discrete pattern and temporal sequence (4.Seibert C. Cadene M. Sanfiz A. Chait B.T. Sakmar T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In addition, although the fertility of (–/–) males and females is normal, they have significantly smaller litters because of fetal death between 8.5 and 15.5 days postcoitum. Regulation of tyrosine sulfation in vivo by enzymatic sulfate removal is still largely unknown. However, human arylsulfatase A and B reside in the lysosome where they are thought to participate in the degradation of tyrosine sulfated proteins (6.Parenti G. Meroni G. Ballabio A. Curr. Opin.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry (MS) has previously been used for detection of tyrosine-sulfated peptides in a number of applications. An early report describes a singly sulfated peptide (factor VIII light chain) using matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS in positive and negative ion modes (34.Talbo G. Roepstorff P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 201-204Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The sulfated species was more prominent in the negative ion mode. In another publication, a comparison of a sulfated or phosphorylated peptide of cholecystokinin-8 with identical sequences was studied using MALDI-TOF MS, illustrating the difference in lability of the different modifications in negative ion mode using linear or reflector detectors (35.Talbo G. Mann M. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry V. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 105-113Google Scholar). Loss of the phosphate group was difficult to observe in the reflector mode, whereas loss of sulfate was prominent. In linear mode the sulfopeptide was observed intact. In addition, the phosphotyrosine immonium ion of m/z 216.043 can be used to search for tyrosine phosphorylations using a quadrupole-TOF (Q-TOF) instrument, and in the same experiment MS-MS can be used to determine the phosphorylation site (36.Steen H. Kuster B. Fernandez M. Pandey A. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This is not the case for tyrosine sulfation sites, because the sulfate group is much more labile than the peptide bonds, which are broken upon a MS-MS experiment. Multiply sulfated peptides (containing 2 and 3 sulfates, respectively) of cionin and cholecystokinin-associated nonapeptides were studied using secondary ion mass spectrometry (37.Yagami T. Kitagawa K. Futaki S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these experiments, ladders of up to three sulfates were obtained in negative ion mode. Tyrosine sulfation and phosphorylations have also been reported in the extracellular bone sialoprotein (38.Zaia J. Boynton R. Heinegård D. Barry F.

Multiple phosphorylations were observed in the negative ion mode, but in contrast only singly sulfated peptides were detected. The tyrosine sulfate residues in antihemophilic recombinant factor VIII have been reported using triple quadrupole-MS in positive ion mode (39.Severs J.C. Carnine M. Eguizabal H. Mock K.K. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A neutral loss of 40 Da (m/z = 2) was used to identify sulfated peptides; only ions that lose this specific mass pass through both Q1 and Q3. The doubly charged species was observed to have the most intense signal with up to three sulfates observed within a single peptide. The sulfation pattern of recombinant human B-domain deleted factor VIII with 6 well documented sulfation sites was also studied using Q-TOF MS (40.Nemeth-Cawley J.F. Rouse J.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Seven peptides with single and multiple +80 modifications were isolated and analyzed for their post-translational modifications. Q-TOF MS-MS in positive mode was used together with in-source dissociation (MS3). Each sulfated peptide lost all SO3 before backbone fragmentation occurred. Also, in this case a maximum of 3 tyrosine sulfates were detected within a peptide. In the present work we have studied a class of extracellular matrix proteins, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, that contain a large number of potential tyrosine sulfation sites clustered together at either terminal. These proteins are present in cartilage, where they bind other matrix constituents, particularly collagen, and stabilize the fibrillar network that constitutes the framework of the tissue. The study includes the use of different mass spectrometric techniques for identification and characterization of tyrosine sulfates in these proteins. Proteins were isolated as described previously (41.Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 42.Axelsson I. Heinegård D.

Human osteoadherin was expressed in human kidney cells, EBNA-293 (Invitrogen) by transfection with a pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) with the transcription cytomegalovirus promoter included. 2V. Tillgren, L. Camper, and D. Heinegård, manuscript in preparation. Purity of the proteins used in this report was determined by SDS-PAGE. Purified bovine fibromodulin, 400–600 μg, was dissolved in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 30 μl of 500 μg/ml LysC was added followed by incubation for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 1 mg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone or Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. N-Linked oligosaccharides were removed by the addition of 5 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) and incubation for 16 h at 37 °C. Before loading onto a MiniQ SMART column (Amersham Biosciences), 1500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 6 m urea (buffer A for anion exchange chromatography) was added. A gradient of 0–600 mm NaCl in the buffer over 20 column volumes was used to elute bound peptides. The column was regenerated with 2 ml of NaOH following each run. Fractions deemed by Western blot and MALDI analysis to contain the N-terminal peptide were pooled and loaded onto a Sephasil C8 mini reversed-phase chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound material was eluted with a gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile in 20 column volumes. The resulting peak was dried and stored at –20 °C. This N-terminal peptide was used for all experiments involving fibromodulin in this work. Sample Preparation for MALDI-TOF MS—Coomassie-stained bands of human lumican and osteoadherin were excised and washed extensively using 40% acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3. Gel pieces were then dried in a SpeedVac concentrator before digestion overnight at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by addition of 2 μl 2% trifluoroacetic acid, which also extracted the peptides from the gel. After a 1-h extraction at room temperature, peptides were purified from the digestion buffer using miniaturized C18 reversed-phase tips (Ziptips™, Millipore). Purified peptides were eluted directly onto the sample target. The matrix, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, was used on an Anchorchip™ target (Bruker Daltonics), which confines the sample to a smaller area, thereby increasing the sensitivity (45.Schuerenberg M. Luebbert C. Eickhoff H. Kalkum M. Lehrach H. Nordhoff E. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 3436-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Bovine fibromodulin and lumican were digested in solution. The tryptic digest of bovine lumican was further purified by C8 reversed-phase chromatography as described previously for bovine fibromodulin. The fibromodulin samples for electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS were cleaned on Ziptips™ before analysis using off-line nano-electrospray MS. Enzymatic and Chemical Treatments—Digestions with sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science), endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako), Asp-N (Roche Applied Science), and chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) were generally performed in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at pH 7.8. Enzymatic digestions of hirudin fragment-(54–65) (Sigma) and lumican peptide (fraction from a reversed-phase separation) using arylsulfatase (Roche Applied Science) and sulfatase (Sigma; type IV (S8504), Type VI (S1629), Type H1 (S9626), and type H2 (S9751)) were performed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, using 40–200 milliunits of enzyme with or without a protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Digestions were also performed using different buffers including 50 mm NH4HCO3 at pH 7.8, 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, and 100 mm, 250 mm, 0.5 m and 1 m NH4CH3COOH at pH 6.0. For dephosphorylation, peptides were incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (1 unit, MBI Fermentas) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min at 37 °C. The tyrosine-phosphorylated control peptide CRDSNpYISKGS, from platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor, was a generous gift from U. Engstrüm and U. Hellman (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). The tryptic serine-phosphorylated peptide from α-S1-casein (Sigma), VPQLEIVPNpSAEER, was used as a reference. Chemical treatments for desulfation of tyrosine sulfates were performed by acid hydrolysis using 1 m HCl at 99 °C for 0,1, or 5 min (46.Ecarot-Charrier B. Bouchard F. Delloye C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20049-20053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were then cooled to room temperature and immediately cleaned up on Ziptips™ before application onto the MALDI target. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric studies were performed using a Bruker Scout 384 Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The instrument was used in the positive or negative ion mode with delayed extraction and an acceleration voltage of 20–26 kV. Peptide samples were analyzed by collecting 50–150 single-shot spectra for improved signal-to-noise ratio. Some data were obtained using ESI ion-trap mass spectrometers (Esquire 3000+ (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and LCQ Deca XP+ (Thermofinnigan, London, UK)). The purity of the protein preparations used in this work, as tested by SDS-PAGE, is depicted in Fig. 1. Post-translational modifications made the protein bands appear heterogeneous on the gel. These modifications include various oligosaccharide chains as well as tyrosine sulfation. The sulfate group that modifies tyrosine is easily lost when exposed to low pH, high temperature, or energetic collisions such as those used in mass spectrometers. Today, MALDI-TOF MS instruments commonly have both linear and reflector detector capabilities and can be operated in both the positive and negative ion mode. These different options facilitate the studies of tyrosine-sulfated peptides. In the linear mode, fragments that form in the flight tube, post-source decay (PSD), are not separated and hence are detected as if they were still intact. This simplifies the spectral interpretation because only the fragments formed inside the ion source, in-source decay (ISD), would be observed as different from the intact fragments. This observation is typical for sulfated peptides as illustrated in Fig. 2 using peptide Thr19-Arg36 from bovine lumican as a model. The mass spectra were acquired in the linear positive (top) and negative ion modes (middle), respectively. In the positive mode only the non-sulfated peptide was observed (peak a) because of in-source fragmentation loss of SO3, whereas in the negative ion mode both one and two sulfate adducts were seen (peaks b and c). This is the general behavior of sulfated peptides with MALDI-TOF MS. In reflector mode the picture becomes somewhat more complex because PSD fragments and ISD fragments were observed in the same spectrum. As before, the peptide was detected in both the positive and negative ion mode. The spectrum in the positive ion mode again resulted in detection of the non-sulfated species alone (not shown). However, the negative ion mode spectrum (Fig. 2, bottom) appears more complex with three additional peaks (d, e, and f). These peaks correspond to the metastable PSD fragment with losses of SO3 (∼69 Da). The mass difference of the PSD fragment was not equal to 80 Da because the calibration step was omitted in order to separate the ISD and PSD fragments within the same spectrum. The generated spectrum displayed a mixture of ISD (peaks a and b) and PSD fragments (peaks d–f) due to loss of the labile SO3 group. Because sulfated peptides behaved as nonsulfated species in the positive ion mode, sequence confirmation could be performed using conventional PSD experiments, as illustrated with the N-terminal fibromodulin peptide in Fig. 3. The fragments were matched to the theoretical sequence.Fig. 3PSD spectrum of a singly sulfated peptide in positive mode obtained after in-gel digestion with chymotrypsin. Switching to the negative mode identifies the tyrosine sulfation site, whereas the PSD spectrum in the positive mode confirms the identity as the N-terminal peptide of bovine fibromodulin, pQsYEEDSHWWF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization and Identification of Tyrosine Sulfation in LRR Class II Proteins—To locate the position of individual tyrosine sulfates, a number of enzyme digestions were performed. The strategy for bovine fibromodulin is shown schematically in Fig. 4, where the intact protein is illustrated together with the N-terminal digestion products of endoproteinase Lys-C, trypsin, and Asp-N. The trypsin and Asp-N digestions were performed using the purified large N-terminal fragment from Lys-C (amino acids 19–98). The positive and negative ion spectra from the Asp-N digest are shown in Fig. 5. In a single spectrum we were able to detect 7 different peptides with varying degrees of tyrosine sulfation. The number of tyrosine sulfates detected in each peptide varied between 0 and 2. Detailed information on all detected sulfotyrosine peptides is listed in Table I. Some sites are more constantly sulfated than others, e.g. Tyr38 is invariably modified because several peptides containing only this single sulfotyrosine were detected. However, three sulfopeptides in this digest (m/z = 2608, 2997, and 3633 Da) did not match the theoretical sequence. Additionally, the sulfated species detected could be a heterogeneous mixture of different sulfation states or a fully sulfated species that readily fragments.Fig. 5MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of an Asp-N digest of bovine fibromodulin using positive (+) and negative (–) ion mode. The tyrosine-sulfated species are clearly seen; each sulfate is annotated with a small circle as +80 adducts in the negative mode. In this spectrum 7 different peptides are detected with 1 or 2 tyrosine sulfates each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IPeptides from LRR class II proteins that have been detected containing at least one post-translational modification in the form of tyrosine sulfationPeptide sequencem/zNo. of sYMS/enzymeProteinAmino acidspQsYEEDSHWWFQFLR1953.860-1MALDI/trypsinFM_bov19-32NQQSTYDDPYDPYPYEPYEPYPYGGEEGPAYAYGSPPQPEPR4844.066-8aMS analysis made at the demonstration lab of Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany.ESI-IT/trypsinFM_bov33-74pQsYEEDSHWW1262.470-1MALDI/CTFM_bov19-27pQsYEEDSHWWF1409.540-1MALDI/CTFM_bov19-28DPYPYEPY1043.440-1MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov42-50DSHWWFQFLRNQQSTsY2142.980-1MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov23-38EDSHWWFQFLRNQQSTsY2272.020-1MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov22-38EEDSHWWFQFLRNQQSTsY2401.060-1MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov21-38pQYEEDSHWWFQFLRNQQSTY2675.160-1MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov19-38EPsYPsYGGEEGPAsYAsYGSPPQ PEPR2608.160-4bMS analysis made at the demonstration lab of Thermofinnigan, London, UK.ESI-IT/Asp-NFM_bov51-74EPYPYGGEEGPAYAYGSPPQPEPR2608.160-2MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov51-74EPYEPYPYGGEEGPAYAYGSPPQPEPR2997.320-2MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov48-74DPYDPYEPYEPYPYGGEEGPAYAYGSPPQPEPR3632.580-2MALDI/Asp-NFM_bov42-74pQYEEDSHWWFQFLRNQQSTYDDPYDPYPYEPYEPYPYGGE EGPAYAYGSPPQPEPRDCPQECDCPPNFPTAMYCDNRNLK9529.941-7cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/Lys-CFM_bov19-98PYDPYPYEPYEPYPYGGEEGPAYAYGSPPQPEPRDCPQECDC PPNFPTAMYCDNRNLK6271.640-4cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/LysC + HCOOHFM_bov43-98PYPYEPYEPYPYGGEEGPAYAYGSPPQPEPRDCPQECDCPPN FPTAMYCDNRNLK6646.790-4cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/LysC + HCOOHFM_bov46-98pQYEDDPHWWFHYLR1974.860-1MALDI/trypsinFM_hum19-33pQsYEDDPHWW1258.480-1MALDI/CTFM_hum19-27pQsYEDDPHWWFH1542.610-1MALDI/CTFM_hum19-29EPsYPsYGV824.380-2MALDI/Asp-NFM_hum51-57DPYPYETY1047.430-1MALDI/Asp-NFM_hum43-50DPYPYETYEPYPYGV1852.790-1MALDI-Asp-NFM_hum43-57DDPHWWFHYLRSQQSTYY2429.070-2MALDI/Asp-NFM_hum22-39APQLHHHHHHDLYDDDDKLQYETYQWDEDYDQEPDDDYQT GFPFRQNVDYGVPFHQYTLGCVSECFCPTNFPSSMYCDNRK10033.220-6dRecombinant human protein from EBNA cells containing a His tag.MALDI/LysCOSAD_hum1-81TQVFRRFPDDDDESEDHDDPDNAHESPEQEGAEGHFDLH sYsYENQE5361.720-2cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/lys-COSAD_hum376-420DDDDKLQYETYQW1718.720-1MALDI/CTOSAD_hum14-26DKLQYETYQW1373.640-1MALDI/CTOSAD_hum17-26DLHsYsYENQE1210.500-1MALDI/Asp-NOSAD_hum412-420DDsYQTGFPFRQNV1586.720-1cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/Asp-NOSAD_hum17-29DDDsYQTGFPFRQNV1701.750-1cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/Asp-NOSAD_hum16-29DYGVPFHQYTLGCVS1742.780-1cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/Asp-NOSAD_hum30-44DQEPDDDsYQTGFPFRQNV2170.930-1cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/Asp-NOSAD_hum12-29DYGVPFHQYTLGCVSTNFPSSMYC3523.420-1cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/Asp-NOSAD_hum30-58TYPDYYEYYDFPQALYGR2324.050-2cAcid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.MALDI/trypsinLUM_bov19-36TYPDYYEYYDFPQALY2110.900-1MALDI/CTLUM_bov19-34TYPDYYEYYDFPQAL1947.830-1MALDI/CTLUM_bov19-33pQYYDYDFPLSIY1569.680-1MALDI/CTLUM_hum19-30pQYYDYDFPLSIYGQSSPNCAPECNCPESYPSAMYCDE4232.60-2MALDI/Glu-CLUM_hum19-55a MS analysis made at the demonstration lab of Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany.b MS analysis made at the demonstration lab of Thermofinnigan, London, UK.c Acid treatment was performed, confirming the presence of tyrosine sulfation.d Recombinant human protein from EBNA cells containing a His tag.

https://openalex.org/W1986430836,"Ras proteins control signaling pathways that are key regulators of several aspects of normal cell growth and malignant transformation. BRAF, which encodes a RAF family member in the downstream pathway of RAS, is somatically mutated in a number of human cancers. The activating mutation of BRAF is known to play a role in tumor development. As there have been no data on the BRAF mutation in stomach cancer, we analysed the genomic DNAs from 319 stomach carcinomas for the detection of somatic mutations of BRAF. Overall, we detected BRAF mutations in seven stomach carcinomas (2.2%). Five of the seven BRAF mutations involved Val 599, the previously identified hotspot, but the substituted amino acid (V599 M) was different from the most common BRAF mutation (V599E). The remaining two mutations involved a conserved amino acid (D593G). One tumor had both BRAF and KRAS mutations. This is the first report on BRAF mutation in stomach cancer, and the data indicate that BRAF is occasionally mutated in stomach cancer, and suggest that alterations of RAS pathway both by RAS and BRAF mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of stomach cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2052301777,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells. While many previous studies have been performed in cell culture, the delivery and efficiency of TRAIL variants in vivo is less well established. Using dual substrate/reporter bioluminescence imaging (Fluc: firefly luciferase-luciferin and Rluc: Renilla luciferase-coelenterazine), we tested the efficacy of TRAIL using replication-deficient herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 amplicon vectors in gliomas. The cDNA for complete TRAIL and the extracellular domain of TRAIL (aa 114-281) were cloned into HSV amplicons and packaged into helper virus-free vectors. Both forms of TRAIL induced similar degrees of apoptosis in human glioma cells (Gli36) in culture within 24 h of infection with TRAIL amplicon vectors. Growth of tumors stably transfected with Fluc (Gli36fluc+) was readily monitored in vivo by bioluminescence imaging following luciferin administration. HSV amplicon vectors bearing the genes for TRAIL and Rluc injected directly into Gli36fluc(+)-expressing subcutaneous gliomas revealed peak Rluc activity 36 h after intratumoral injection as determined by coelenterazine injection followed by imaging. TRAIL-treated gliomas regressed in size over a period of 4 weeks as compared to the mock-injected gliomas. These results show the efficacy of vector delivered TRAIL in treating tumors in vivo and offer a unique way to monitor both gene delivery and efficacy of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in tumors in vivo in real time by dual enzyme substrate (Rluc/Fluc) imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2058454645,"Hypersensitive cell death is an important defense reaction of plants to pathogen infection and is accompanied by lipid peroxidation processes. These may occur non-enzymatically by the action of reactive oxygen species or may be catalyzed by enzymes such as α-dioxygenases, lipoxygenases, or peroxidases. Correlative data showing increases in 9-lipoxygenase products in hyper-sensitively reacting cells have so far suggested that a large part of lipid peroxidation is mediated by a specific set of 9-lipoxygenases. To address the significance of 9-lipoxygenases for this type of pathogen response in potato, RNA interference constructs of a specific pathogen-induced potato 9-lipoxygenase were transferred to potato plants. Significantly reduced 9-lipoxygenase transcript levels were observed in transgenic plants after pathogen treatment. In addition, 9-lipoxygenase activity was hardly detectable, and levels of 9-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins were reduced up to 12-fold after pathogen infection. In contrast to wild type plants, high levels of non-enzymatically as well as 13-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins were present in 9-lipoxygenase-deficient plants. From this we conclude that during the normal hypersensitive response in potato, lipid peroxidation may occur as a controlled and directed process that is facilitated by the action of a specific 9-lipoxygenase. If 9-lipoxygenase-mediated formation of hydroperoxides is repressed, autoxidative lipid peroxidation processes and 13-lipoxygenase-mediated oxylipins synthesis become prominent.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 485-493PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that LOXs function in plant defense by contributing to pathogen growth inhibition. On the other hand, oxylipins of both the 9- and the 13-LOX pathway have been identified as signal molecules that activate defense responses. JA, its biosynthetic precursor OPDA, and their derivatives are well studied signaling compounds in the response of the plant to wounding (12Wasternack C. Hause B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 165-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Leon J. Rojo E. Sanchez-Serrano J.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas 13-HOT is able to induce PR gene expression in barley (14Weichert H. Stenzel I. Berndt E. Wasternack C. Feussner I. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the products of the LOX reaction, 9- and 13-HPOD, as well as the corresponding hydroxides, 9- and 13-HOD, induce cell death in protoplasts (15Maccarrone M. Hilbers M. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J. Finazzi Agro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 16Knight V.I. Wang H. Lincoln J.E. Lulai E.C. Gilchrist D.G. Bostock R.M. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2001; 59: 277-286Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In solanaceous plants, oxylipins derived from the 9-LOX pathway are of importance for pathogen defense. Thus, pathogen-induced 9-LOX transcript accumulation was reported in a number of plants, for example in tobacco after infection with Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae (17Rancé I. Fournier J. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6554-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and in potato infected by Phytophthora infestans (18Fidantsef A.L. Bostock R.M. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 102: 257-271Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Kolomiets M.V. Chen H. Gladon R.J. Braun E.J. Hannapel D.J.

Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The pathogen-induced accumulation of the 9-LOX products in potato cells (21Göbel C. Feussner I. Schmidt A. Scheel D. Sanchez-Serrano J. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6267-6273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and plants (11Weber H. Chetelat A. Caldelari D. Farmer E.E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 485-493PubMed Google Scholar, 20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggests a role of these compounds for defense responses. More importantly, a functional analysis of the elicitor-induced 9-LOX of tobacco revealed its crucial role for the establishment of resistance (17Rancé I. Fournier J. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6554-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, how 9-LOXs exert their effect in the response to pathogens and, in particular, which of the 9-LOX-derived products are of importance have not been clarified yet. Here we set out to functionally analyze the role of 9-LOXs for the response of potato to pathogen attack. After identification of the pathogen-induced 9-LOX isoform in our system, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to down-regulate its expression. Transgenic plants have a significant reduction in pathogen-induced 9-LOX activity, and the accumulation of enzymatically produced oxylipins was strongly reduced, but lipid peroxides of autoxidative origin increased. Cell death, however, is not significantly affected suggesting that potato plants can undergo hypersensitive cell death irrespective of the origin of lipid hydroperoxides. RNA Analyses and Generation of 9-LOX cDNA Fragments by RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from pathogen-infected potato plants and subjected to Northern analyses as described (20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was carried out using DNase-treated RNA with SuperScript™II RNase H– Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Subsequent PCR was performed using the primers 5′-ACAAACAGGCAACTAAGTGTGCTTCACC-3′ and 5′-GCGATTTGGGAGGTAACCTGCATAAGG-3′ under standard conditions. Cloning of RNAi Constructs—A β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene cloned in a pUC19 vector was partially deleted at the EcoRV site by cutting the plasmid with EcoRV and SmaI and subsequent re-ligation. The 374-bp POTLX-3-specific fragment was amplified from RNA of pathogen-infected plants via RT-PCR using the primers 5′-TATGTTGCAGTGAATGACTCG-3′ and 5′-GGATAGTCTTGAATTAGCAAG-3′ with sequences for SstI restriction sites at each end. After cloning of the RT-PCR product into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), the fragment was inserted into an SstI site at the 3′-end of the truncated GUS gene upstream of the nopaline synthase polyadenylation signal. The 374-bp POTLX-3-specific fragment was then amplified from the pCR2.1 clone using primers with BamHI and PstI-KpnI sites at either end. This fragment was inserted upstream of the truncated GUS gene via BamHI/PstI in inverse orientation to the SstI fragment. The RNAi construct was inserted into a binary vector carrying the 35STX promoter (22Gatz C. Frohberg C. Wendenburg R. Plant J. 1992; 2: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar) as a KpnI-EcoRI fragment, and the resulting plasmid was transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101. Potato plants were transformed with recombinant agrobacteria, and transgenic plants were regenerated as described (23Feltkamp D. Baumann E. Schmalenbach W. Masterson R. Rosahl S. Plant Sci. 1995; 109: 57-65Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Infection of Plants and Analysis of Defense Responses—Potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Désirée) were grown as sterile plants in a phytochamber with 16 h of light (200 microeinsteins) at 22 °C. After transfer to soil, plants were kept in a phytochamber with 16 h of light (200 microeinsteins), 18 °C, and 60% humidity for 4 weeks. Lower leaves were infiltrated with a suspension of Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola at a concentration of 108 colony-forming units/ml in 10 mm MgCl2 or, as a control, 10 mm MgCl2 solution, and the infiltrated leaves were used for subsequent analyses. For P. infestans infections, the lower leaves were inoculated by pipetting 10–20 droplets of 10 μl of a P. infestans zoospore suspension in water (2 × 105 zoospores/ml) onto the abaxial leaf surface and keeping the plants at 100% humidity for the duration of the experiment. As controls, water was pipetted onto the leaves. Cell death was determined by staining whole leaves with trypan blue as described (24Koch E. Slusarenko A. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide formation was visualized by staining with diaminobenzidine as described (25Thordal-Christensen H. Zhang Z.G. Wei Y.D. Collinge D.B. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1187-1194Crossref Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Determination of LOX Activity and LOX Products—LOX activity was determined using crude protein extracts from plants as described (20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Determination of hydroxy and hydroperoxy fatty acids as well as divinyl ethers was performed by HPLC-based and GC-based analyses. About 0.5 g of frozen leaf tissue was added to 10 ml of extraction medium (isohexane/isopropyl alcohol, 3:2 (v/v) with 0.0025% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene) and immediately homogenized with an Ultra Turrax under a stream of argon on ice for 30 s. As an internal standard, (6Z,9Z,11E,13S)-13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid and heptadecanoic acid were added. The extract was centrifuged at 4,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The clear upper phase was collected, and the pellet was extracted three times with 3 ml each of extraction medium. To the combined organic phases, a 6.7% (w/v) solution of potassium sulfate was added to a volume of 47 ml. After vigorous shaking, the upper hexanerich layer was removed. The upper organic phase containing the oxylipins and fatty acids was dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 200 μl of methanol. For the analysis of fatty acids, 10 μl of an EDAC solution (1 mg of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/10 μl of methanol) and 370 μl of methanol were added to 20 μl of the methanol solution and incubated for 2 h. After adding 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were extracted twice each with 1 ml of hexane. The combined organic phases were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The FAMEs were redissolved in 10 μl of acetonitrile and analyzed using a gas chromatograph/flame ionization detector (GC/FID). Analysis of oxylipins was carried out by HPLC on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system coupled to a diode array detector. Prior to analysis, the solvent was removed, and the sample was reconstituted in 50 μl of methanol/water/acetic acid (85:15:0.1, v/v). At first, oxylipins were purified on reversed phase-HPLC. This was carried out on a ET250/2 Nucleosil 120–5 C18 column (Macherey-Nagel, 2.1 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (85: 15:0.1, v/v), and a flow rate of 0.18 ml min–1. Straight phase-HPLC of the hydro(pero)xy derivatives of linoleic and linolenic acid was carried out on a Zorbax Rx-SIL column (Agilent, 2.1 × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100:1: 0.1, v/v) and a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1. The absorbance at 234 nm was recorded indicating the conjugated double bond. Chiral phase-HPLC of the hydro(pero)xy fatty acids was carried out on a Chiralcel OD-H column (Daicel, 2.1 × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100:5:0.1, v/v) and a flow rate of 0.1 ml min–1. Absorbance at 234 nm was monitored. Reversed phase-HPLC of the divinyl ethers was carried out on a ET250/2 Nucleosil 120–5 C18 column (Macherey-Nagel, 2.1 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (90:10:0.1, v/v) and a flow rate of 0.18 ml min–1. The absorbance at 250 nm was recorded indicating a conjugated diene system in conjugation with an ether bond of the fatty acids. For the analysis of esterified oxylipins and fatty acids, triricinoleate and triheptadecanoate were used as internal standards, and the extraction was performed as described above. After removing of the solvent, 333 μl of a mixture of toluene and methanol (1:1, v/v) and 167 μl of 0.5 mm sodium methoxide were added. After incubation for 20 min, 0.5 ml of 1 m NaCl and 50 μl of HCl (37%, v/v) were added, and the FAMEs and oxidized derivatives were extracted twice each with 0.75 ml of hexane. The combined organic phases were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and dissolved in 200 μl of methanol. 20 μl of this solution was dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 10 μl of acetonitrile for the analysis of the FAMEs by GC/FID-based analysis. The methyl esters of the oxylipins were determined by HPLC according to the analysis of the free oxylipins. For determination of JA and OPDA, a GC/mass spectrometry-based analysis was used as described (20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Identification of POTLX3 as the Pathogen-induced 9-LOX in Potato—To reduce the pathogen-induced expression of 9-LOXs in potato by RNAi, we first determined which of the 9-LOX genes are specifically expressed in response to pathogen infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the 9-LOX family in solanaceous plants revealed that 9-LOXs can be divided into two subfamilies, the group of classical 9-LOX cDNAs first described in potato tubers and another group containing the pathogen-induced 9-LOXs (7Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). By using cDNAs of both groups as probes, pathogen-induced accumulation of 9-LOX transcripts in potato has been reported (18Fidantsef A.L. Bostock R.M. Physiol. Plant. 1998; 102: 257-271Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Kolomiets M.V. Chen H. Gladon R.J. Braun E.J. Hannapel D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, based on the high sequence similarity of these cDNAs, cross-hybridization might conceal which of these genes are specifically expressed after pathogen attack. Therefore, RNA from plants infected with P. infestans was reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR using primers designed to amplify a 582-bp fragment from all 9-LOX genes reported in the data base. The mixture of PCR products was digested with either BglII or ClaI, enzymes that cut specifically in fragments derived from POTLX-3 mRNA (19Kolomiets M.V. Chen H. Gladon R.J. Braun E.J. Hannapel D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or from tuber-specific 9-LOX mRNA (26Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Royo J. Vancanneyt G. Perez A.G. Sanz C. Störmann K. Rosahl S. Sanchez-Serrano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21012-21019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), respectively. Subsequently, the restriction fragments were separated on agarose gels (Fig. 1). Starting 1 day after infection with P. infestans, cDNA fragments digestable by BglII but not by ClaI were present, indicating that the majority of 9-LOX-derived cDNA fragments were derived from POTLX-3 transcripts. The portion of cDNA fragments that was not digestable by BglII decreased and was not detectable after 5 days. Thus, POTLX-3 transcripts represent the majority of pathogen-inducible 9-LOX transcripts. Moreover, our results show that transcripts encoding the tuber-specific 9-LOXs, whose cDNA fragments should have been cut by ClaI, cannot be detected in either untreated or pathogen-infected leaves by this method. Interestingly, in cDNA derived from leaves of uninfected plants, neither BglII nor ClaI was able to cut the mixture of PCR fragments, indicating that mRNA encoding a so far unidentified 9-LOX isoform had been amplified in the RT-PCR. This LOX cDNA fragment (StLOX1–4 was subcloned and sequenced (data not shown). Highest sequence similarity was found to a toxin-induced tomato LOX (97%, GenBank™ accession number AY008278) and to the elicitor-induced 9-LOX from tobacco (90%, 28). StLOX1–4 shared less than 85% homology at the nucleotide level with LOX isoforms from tubers. Generation of RNA Interference Constructs and Plant Transformation—The RNAi technique was chosen to decrease the level of pathogen-induced 9-LOX transcripts in potato. RNAi constructs were generated using a 374-bp fragment of POTLX-3 that was cloned in antisense orientation in front of and in sense orientation behind a truncated GUS gene. The fragment was designed to be as specific for POTLX-3 as possible, and it had 87% homology at the nucleotide level to other 9-LOX genes. This 9-LOX-RNAi construct was transferred to a binary vector behind the 35STX promoter. Potato plants were transformed with the 9-LOX-RNAi construct as well as with the empty vector. Regenerated plants were first analyzed for the presence of the transgene by subjecting their DNA to Southern analyses (data not shown). Eleven plants containing the 9-LOX-RNAi construct were chosen for further analyses. Loss of Pathogen-induced 9-LOX Transcript Accumulation and 9-LOX Activity in Transgenic RNAi Plants—To analyze whether expression of the RNAi construct efficiently interfered with 9-LOX transcript accumulation, potato plants were infiltrated with P. syringae pv. maculicola or infected with P. infestans. RNA analyses revealed that in none of the transgenic plants were 9-LOX transcripts detectable after bacterial infiltration (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in untransformed potato plants as well as empty vector plants, significant levels of 9-LOX transcripts accumulated in response to pathogen infection. Similarly, transgenic plants were unable to accumulate 9-LOX transcripts in response to infection with P. infestans (Fig. 2B). Because 9-LOX-derived oxylipins accumulate in potato leaves in response to infiltration with P. syringae pv. maculicola earlier and to higher levels than after infection with P. infestans (20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), bacterial infiltration was chosen to analyze alterations in LOX enzyme activity and the oxylipin pattern of transgenic RNAi plants. Four of the transgenic RNAi plants (R4, R6, R8, and R9) were compared with transgenic lines containing only the empty vector and untransformed wild type potato plants. Compared with control plants, 9-LOX activity was significantly reduced in RNAi plants after infiltration of P. syringae pv. maculicola (Fig. 3). Two of the RNAi plants, R4 and R6, had nearly undetectable levels of 9-LOX activity, whereas RNAi plants R8 and R9 showed residual enzyme activity. 13-LOX activity did not differ significantly between control and transgenic plants and, overall, was 20-fold lower than 9-LOX activity (data not shown). Alterations in the Oxylipin Pattern after Pathogen Treatment—Oxylipin profiling was performed to detect changes in lipid peroxidation during the hypersensitive response in plants with reduced 9-LOX activity. In general, levels of esterified oxylipins in membranes were 5–10-fold higher than those of the free oxylipins. Interestingly, the levels of esterified oxylipins in the 9-LOX-RNAi plants were strongly reduced and increased to lower levels in response to bacterial infiltration compared with wild type plants. However, except for 13-HO(D/T), the esterified oxylipins were derived from autoxidative processes in both wild type and 9-LOX-RNAi plants (data not shown). Because there were no 9-LOX-produced esterified oxylipins, our analysis of the role of 9-LOXs for pathogen defense concentrated on alterations in free oxylipin levels. These were determined 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after infiltration of P. syringae pv. maculicola. Fig. 4 shows combined data for 9-LOX-derived oxylipins measured in plants R4 and R6, plants R8 and R9, as well as empty vector containing and wild type plants. Consistent with the decrease in 9-LOX activity, oxylipins derived from the 9-LOX pathway accumulated to significantly lower levels in RNAi transgenic plants. In general, 9-LOX-derived oxylipins originating from LnA were more affected in RNAi plants than those derived from LA. The products of the 9-LOX reaction, 9-HPOD and 9-HPOT, were significantly reduced particularly at early time points. 9-HOD and 9-HOT levels 24 hours post-infiltration were 20 and 10%, respectively, of the wild type levels in the plants R4/R6. Interestingly, 9-HOT and 9-HOD accumulating in wild type plants in response to bacterial infiltration consisted of 98% S-enantiomers (Table I), whereas the lower ratio of S/R-enantiomers in the transgenic plants is indicative of a non-enzymatic origin of 9-HOD and 9-HOT. Divinyl ether levels were also significantly reduced in the plants R4/R6 with the strongest reduction in 9-LOX activity but were similar in plants R8/R9 and the control plants.Table IPercentage of S-enantiomers of oxylipins detected in transgenic 9-LOX-RNAi and in control plants 24 h after infiltration of P. syringae pv. maculicolaR4 and R6R8 and R9Empty vector and wild type9-HOD62 ± 777 ± 1698 ± 19-HOT72 ± 392 ± 198 ± 113-HOD71 ± 675 ± 377 ± 613-HOT73 ± 469 ± 772 ± 716-HOT65 ± 1769 ± 562 ± 2212-HOT35 ± 433 ± 435 ± 4 Open table in a new tab The loss of 9-LOX activity in the transgenic plants correlated with increased levels of 13-LOX products and non-enzymatically produced oxylipins (Fig. 5). In both R4/R6 and R8/R9 plants, JA and its biosynthetic precursor, OPDA, are present at higher amounts. 13-HOD and 13-HOT also accumulated to higher levels in the transgenic plants; however, the presence of about 73% S-enantiomers (Table I) indicates an enzymatic as well as a non-enzymatic origin for 13-HOD and 13-HOT for both transgenic and wild type plants. In addition, higher levels of 16- and 12-HOT, compounds that are indicative of autoxidative processes (29Berger S. Weichert H. Porzel A. Wasternack C. Kuhn H. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), are observed in plants with reduced 9-LOX activity. Thus, oxylipin profiling revealed that in transgenic plants with severely reduced 9-LOX activity accumulation of enzymatically produced 9-LOX-derived oxylipins was remarkably reduced, but they contain significantly increased levels of oxylipins derived from 13-LOX activity and from autoxidative lipid peroxidation. Pathogen-induced Cell Death Is Not Altered in 9-LOX-RNAi Plants—Despite the block in the 9-LOX pathway and despite the decreased levels of 9-LOX-derived oxylipins, there was no difference in the degree, timing, and phenotype of cell death formation upon bacterial infiltration under our experimental conditions (Fig. 6). In addition to the phenotypic evaluation, trypan blue staining did not reveal differences in the extent of cell death after pathogen treatment. Similarly, diaminobenzidine-staining for hydrogen peroxide in 9-LOX-RNAi and in control plants was not significantly altered. These data suggest that lipid peroxide formation during pathogen-induced cell death does not depend on the presence of 9-LOXs and can proceed via autoxidative processes. Moreover, hypersensitive cell death itself occurs independent of the origin of lipid hydroperoxides. Direct peroxidation of membrane lipids as well as the synthesis of cell death-inducing oxylipins are the proposed contributions of LOXs to programmed cell death in animals (30Maccarrone M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agro A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Animal 15-LOX can initiate programmed organelle disruption by dioxygenating mitochondrial membranes leading to formation of pore-like structures (31van Leyen K. Duvoisin R.M. Engelhardt H. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Treatment of mitochondria with the soybean 15-LOX results in disruption of membrane integrity and release of cytochrome c, usually a trigger of apoptosis (30Maccarrone M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agro A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whether lipid peroxidation during the pathogen-induced hypersensitive cell death in plants is catalyzed by LOXs or is the result of processes mediated by reactive oxygen species so far has been addressed by the determination of levels and nature of the accumulating lipid peroxides. It is generally assumed that the preponderance of S-enantiomeric hydroperoxides of polyunsaturated fatty acids represents the products of enzymatic reactions and that racemic mixtures result in almost all cases from non-enzymatic reactions, e.g. the autoxidative processes. Thus, the accumulation of large amounts of (9S)-HPOD and (9S)-HPOT in pathogen-infected plant tissue has led to the view that 9-LOXs are the enzymes responsible for lipid peroxidation (5Rustérucci C. Montillet J.L. Agnel J.P. Battesti C. Alonso B. Knoll A. Bessoule J.J. Etienne P. Suty L. Blein J.P. Triantaphylidès C. J. Biol.

Marmey P. Geiger J.P. Nicole M. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the timing of oxylipin accumulation and the onset of cell death which, in potato, occur concomitantly 6–12 h after bacterial infiltration (20Göbel C. Feussner I. Hamberg M. Rosahl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) support the notion that 9-LOX-mediated lipid oxygenation is the cause for membrane damage during the hypersensitive response. In tobacco treated with the hypersensitive response-inducing elicitor cryptogein, LOX activity starts to increase between 8 and 12 h after elicitor treatment, which correlates with cell death formation between 12 and 24 h (5Rustérucci C. Montillet J.L. Agnel J.P. Battesti C. Alonso B. Knoll A. Bessoule J.J. Etienne P. Suty L. Blein J.P. Triantaphylidès C. J. Biol.

Gain-of-function experiments using products of the LOX pathway were performed to demonstrate a role for LOXs in inducing cell death. In animals, various lipid hydroperoxides, as well as the substrate of animal LOXs, arachidonic acid, are known to induce apoptosis (30Maccarrone M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agro A.

In plants, both the hydroperoxides and the hydroxides of 9- and 13-LOX products of LA and LnA are able to induce programmed cell death in tomato protoplasts (36Knight V. Wang H. Gilchrist D.G. Bostock R.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 101Google Scholar) and lentil root protoplasts (30Maccarrone M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agro A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function approaches have included inhibitor studies, expression of LOX antibodies in plant cells, and deprivation of oxygen. In lentil root protoplasts, application of different LOX inhibitors resulted in reduction of H2O2-induced cell death (37Maccarrone M. Van Zadelhoff G. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J. Finazzi-Agro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5078-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, LOX inhibitors are generally considered to be problematic because of their unspecific activity on other enzymes. Eicosatetraynoic acid, for example, is considered to be an irreversible inhibitor for LOXs but is also used as a specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2 (38Viehweger K. Dordschbal B. Roos W. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1509-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to their possible effect on other enzymes, most of the LOX inhibitors can also act as general radical scavengers and may thus interfere with cell death via a LOX-independent mechanism. Electroporation of anti-LOX monoclonal antibodies into lentil root protoplasts decreased the H2O2-induced programmed cell death ∼2-fold, suggesting that the lentil LOX is important for cell death (30Maccarrone M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agro A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Finally, the failure of cryptogein to induce necrosis formation in tobacco under low oxygen pressure was interpreted that depriving LOXs of oxygen was the reason for lack of cell death formation (5Rustérucci C. Montillet J.L. Agnel J.P. Battesti C. Alonso B. Knoll A. Bessoule J.J. Etienne P. Suty L. Blein J.P. Triantaphylidès C. J. Biol.

However, anaerobic conditions have been shown to be above wound stress in the hierarchy of stress responses (26Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and this might also be true for pathogen stress. In the present study, the 9-LOX pathway was specifically blocked by RNAi of the pathogen-induced 9-LOX isoform of potato. Our data show that 9-LOX activity is drastically reduced and that 9-LOX-derived oxylipins are present in lower amounts than in wild type plants. On the other hand, increased amounts of oxylipins derived from autoxidation accumulate in response to pathogen infection. Because there is no phenotypic difference in the hypersensitive response in transgenic and control plants, as judged by trypan blue staining for dead cells and by diaminobenzidine staining for hydrogen peroxide formation, 9-LOX-derived lipid peroxides are apparently not required for the hypersensitive response in potato. Interestingly, the capacity of the plant to perform lipid peroxidation via autoxidative processes becomes apparent in the absence of detectable 9-LOX activity. Lipid peroxide formation is considered a crucial event in the development of hypersensitive cell death, and it appears to be facilitated by direct oxidation of fatty acids by ROS. Presumably, in the presence of 9-LOXs, lipid peroxidation proceeds via enzymatic reactions, possibly by the activation of the specific 9-LOX isoform by ROS. The enzymatic formation of lipid peroxides by LOXs during induction of hypersensitive cell death might be of dual advantage to the response of the plants to pathogens as follows: (i) because LOX-derived lipid peroxides are less toxic substances for the plant cell, because they are rapidly metabolized by enzymes of the LOX pathway; and (ii) several of these metabolites act as specific antimicrobial compounds. Being non-toxic for the plant, they might thus enhance the defense capacity of the plant in addition to the initial hypersensitive cell death reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2011899782,"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) is a locally invasive soft tissue neoplasm associated with mutations resulting in beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. This tumor is composed of cells with histological and molecular characteristics common to proliferating mesenchymal cells of dermal wounds. Using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, we show that Rhamm, a protein with an important role in wound healing and neoplastic progression, is also expressed at high levels in aggressive fibromatosis. A mouse harboring a targeted deletion in Rhamm was generated, resulting in viable Rhamm-/- animals. Rhamm-/- mice were crossed with Apc/Apc1638N mice, which harbor a targeted mutation in the Apc gene predisposing animals to gastrointestinal and aggressive fibromatosis tumors. Rhamm deficiency significantly decreased the number of aggressive fibromatosis tumors formed, but did not alter the number of gastrointestinal polyps. Cell culture studies show that Rhamm regulates cell proliferation in both fibroblasts and fibromatosis cells under conditions of low density, but not high density. These results suggest that Rhamm regulates proliferation of cells with sparse cell-cell contacts, such as occurs in aggressive fibromatosis; provides the first genetic evidence implicating Rhamm in tumor pathology; and suggest Rhamm blockade as a potential therapeutic target for this otherwise difficult-to-treat neoplasm."

This process of exocytosis relies on three SNARE proteins, namely syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the target plasma membrane and synaptobrevin on the vesicular membrane. In this study we examined the molecular assembly pathway that leads to formation of the fusogenic SNARE complex. We now show that the plasma membrane syntaxin and SNAP-25 interact with high affinity and equimolar stoichiometry to form a stable dimer on the pathway to the ternary SNARE complex. In bovine chromaffin cells, syntaxin and SNAP-25 colocalize in defined clusters that average 700 nm in diameter and cover 10% of the plasma membrane. Removal of the C terminus of SNAP-25 by botulinum neurotoxin E, a known neuroparalytic agent, dissociates the target SNARE dimer in vitro and disrupts the SNARE clustering in vivo.

Together, our data uncover formation of stable syntaxin/SNAP-25 dimers as a central principle of the SNARE assembly pathway underlying regulated exocytosis. Hormonal and neurotransmitter release occurs when vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner. The three SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BoNT/E, botulinum toxin E; LC, light chain. proteins, namely synaptobrevin2 (also known as VAMP2) on the vesicular membrane and syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 on the target plasma membrane, are essential for the last step of vesicular exocytosis, the fusion of membranes (1.Sudhof T.C. Sheller R.H. Cowan W.M. Sudhof T.C. Stevens C.F. Synapses. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD2001: 177-198Google Scholar, 2.Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). These three proteins form a highly stable ternary complex that likely drives the fusion of the two apposing membranes (3.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Botulinum toxins, which specifically cleave SNARE proteins prior to the formation of the ternary SNARE complex, block vesicle exocytosis in both neurons and endocrine cells (2.Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 4.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane protein SNAP-25 is a molecular target for botulinum toxin E (5.Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1617-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This toxin removes the C-terminal 26 amino acids from the SNAP-25 molecule and has been used previously to dissect stages of calcium-triggered exocytosis (6.Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7.Xu T. Binz T. Niemann H. Neher E. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Although these studies demonstrated that the ternary SNARE complex forms at a late stage of vesicle exocytosis, the molecular events preceding formation of this complex remain largely unknown. Several contradicting theories have been put forward with regard to the molecular pathway leading to SNARE complex assembly. One study suggested that SNAREs, although active, do not pre-assemble in resting cells into any intermediate complex but would form the ternary complex upon activation of exocytosis (8.Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that SNAP-25 engages vesicular synaptobrevin in a priming step and that binding of syntaxin1 would be the pivotal event leading to membrane fusion (9.Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An alternative theory states that syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 pre-assemble into a stable heterodimer on the plasma membrane, and only then does vesicular synaptobrevin engage the two target SNAREs (10.Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11.Koh T.W. Bellen H.J. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Importantly, it is not clear whether any SNARE intermediates actually exist in intact secretory cells as a prelude to SNARE-mediated fusion. To address these outstanding issues, we analyzed SNARE binary reactions in a quantitative manner using highly purified SNARE proteins. We also investigated the distribution of the three SNARE proteins in chromaffin cells, a well established model system for regulated secretion (12.Bader M.F. Holz R.W. Kumakura K. Vitale N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13.Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Analysis of the SNARE assembly pathway reveals that the only stable heterodimer is composed of the two target SNAREs, syntaxin1 and SNAP-25. These two proteins not only interact with high affinity in an equimolar stoichiometry but also colocalize in defined clusters on the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. The absence of synaptobrevin in the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 clusters indicates that this vesicular SNARE does not contribute to the cluster stability in chromaffin cells. Finally, we show that botulinum toxin E disrupts the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimers both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that they can be molecular targets of botulinum toxin poisoning. Preparation of Proteins—Plasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with syntaxin (amino acids 1-261) and synaptobrevin2 (amino acids 1-96) were described previously (10.Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recombinant SNARE proteins, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), were washed with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) followed by elution with 15 mm reduced glutathione in buffer A or thrombin cleavage. Eluted proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. SNAP-25 and native SNARE complex was purified from bovine brain cortex as described previously (10.Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For constructing the expression plasmid for the light chain of botulinum toxin E, the DNA fragment encoding the light chain was generated by PCR using total bacterial DNA (strain Beluga) as a template and 5′-CACAGGATCCATGCCAAAAATTAATAGTTTTAA-3′ and 5′-CTCTCAAGCTTAGGCCTTATGCCTTTTACAGAAAC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The fragment was inserted subsequent to cleavage with BamHI and HindIII into pQE9 (Qiagen). Thereafter, the self-complementary oligonucleotide 5′-TAAGCTAATTTAAATTAGCTTA-3′ was ligated into the singular StuI site to introduce the translation termination codon. The nucleotide sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The His6-botulinum toxin E light chain was expressed at 21 °C for 16 h. Protein was purified on a HiTrap nickel chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 20 mm imidazole in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) followed by elution with 100 mm imidazole in buffer B. Imidazole was removed by dialysis against buffer B. Quantitative Protein Binding Assays—SNARE binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min. Two-microgram SNARE proteins attached to either glutathione or anti-SNAP-25 (SMI81)-Sepharose beads (∼15-μl bed volume) were incubated in buffer A with 3 μg of protein to be tested for binding. Beads were washed three times by low speed centrifugation with 1 ml of buffer A, and bound protein was eluted in SDS-containing sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For analysis of the effect of the botulinum toxin E light chain on SNAP-25 in the preformed syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer, the binary complex immobilized on Sepharose beads was incubated with a purified botulinum toxin E light chain for 1 h at 37 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A before analysis of bound protein by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. To determine the dissociation constant for the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer, anti-SNAP-25-Sepharose beads containing 1 pmol of SNAP-25 were incubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of syntaxin-(1-261) (from 10-9 to 10-5m) in a reaction volume of 100 μl. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, and bound protein was analyzed by Western immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-syntaxin1 antibody and a West Dura enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The chemiluminescence signal was imaged using a ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The calculated intensity volumes were fitted with a variable slope dose-response relationship using Prism (GraphPad). For determination of the stoichiometry of SNAREs in the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer, proteins bound to the beads were eluted into sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Sypro Orange (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent protein bands were imaged using a ChemiDoc XRS, (Bio-Rad), and fluorescent intensity was quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To calculate the molar ratio of interacting proteins, the measured values of bound fluorescence for each band were divided by their corresponding molecular masses. Confocal Microscopy—Bovine chromaffin cells seeded on polylysine-coated bottom glass coverslip dishes (Mattek) were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and then blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% goat serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. Rabbit anti-SNAP-25 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) and mouse anti-syntaxin1 antibody (HPC-1 clone, Sigma; 1:1000) were added, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. In some cases, chromaffin cells were permeabilized with 0.002% digitonin in 139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5 in the absence or presence of botulinum toxin E light chain (5.4 μg/ml) for 15 min prior to fixation. Cells were washed extensively and stained using Alexa 488 anti-rabbit and Alexa 594 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Cells were washed overnight in phosphate-buffered saline. Images were collected on a Bio-Rad 600 confocal microscope using an oil immersion objective (63×; 1.4 numerical aperture). The point spread function of green and red fluorescence was calculated as described (14.Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was quantified using the LaserPix software (Bio-Rad). Areas of the target SNAREs were estimated using Equation 1, A(SNAP-25/syntaxin1)=((A(SNAP-25)×&percnt;FC)+0.5*(A(SNAP-25)×&percnt;NC))×100/A(TotChr) where A(SNAP-25/syntaxin1) is the area occupied by SNAP-25 clusters that colocalize with syntaxin1, A(SNAP-25) is the area occupied by SNAP-25 clusters, %FC is the percentage of full colocalization between SNAP-25 and syntaxin1, %NC is percentage of neutral colocalization between SNAP-25 and syntaxin1, and A(TotChr) is the average total area of the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells estimated to be 801.6 μm2 (n = 120). Exocytosis from neuroendocrine cells relies on syntaxin1, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin2 (1.Sudhof T.C. Sheller R.H. Cowan W.M. Sudhof T.C. Stevens C.F. Synapses. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD2001: 177-198Google Scholar, 13.Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 15.Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To determine the spatial organization of the SNARE fusion machinery, we chose to study chromaffin cells, which have a simple round geometry and serve as a popular model of regulated exocytosis. We used antibodies that recognize the SNARE proteins even when in complexes (data not shown) in conjunction with high resolution confocal microscopy. Chromaffin cells isolated from bovine adrenal glands were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for the two target SNAREs. Syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 clearly localized to the plasma membrane and, significantly, showed a high degree of colocalization within spots of high intensity in equatorial confocal sections (Fig. 1A). To investigate the distribution of syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 in the plane of the plasma membrane, polar confocal sections of chromaffin cells were also studied. Remarkably, the distribution of the two target SNAREs on the plasma membrane showed an extremely high degree of colocalization, with the two proteins co-existing in defined clusters (Fig. 1B). Using the high resolution polar confocal sections, we quantified the degree of syntaxin1/SNAP-25 colocalization and measured their area and surface density (Fig. 2A). Cluster analysis used previously for PC12 cell membrane sheets (14.Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in chromaffin cells, syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 are highly colocalized in clusters (Fig. 2B). Ninety percent of the syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 immunoreactivity exhibited perfect overlap within these clusters, which averaged ∼700 nm in diameter and 0.43 μm2 by area (Fig. 2B). A frequency histogram of SNARE cluster area (Fig. 2C) highlights the matching distribution for the two proteins, suggesting that they interact on the plasma membrane. In total, the SNARE clusters occupy ∼10% of the total chromaffin cell plasma membrane. We next investigated whether the vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin plays a role in the organization of the two target SNAREs on the plasma membrane. Using double immunostaining for SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin on both equatorial and polar confocal sections, we found that the majority of synaptobrevin immunoreactivity resides in vesicles away from the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). In the polar sections, SNAP-25 clusters were devoid of synaptobrevin immunoreactivity, indicating that the stable target SNARE clustering does not require the vesicular SNARE. Because staining for two more vesicular markers, deoxy-β-hydrolyze (Fig. 3B, DBH) and synaptotagmin1 (Fig. 3B, Syt), demonstrates segregation of vesicular and plasma membrane immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B), colocalization of the target SNAREs on the plasma membrane is likely irrespective of vesicular proteins. This was predictable, because previous electron microscopy studies demonstrated that the vast majority of secretory granules reside away from the plasma membrane in the resting cells (16.Plattner H. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The strict colocalization of syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 in chromaffin cells suggests that they may interact on the plasma membrane. To address the current conflicting hypotheses of protein interactions in the SNARE assembly pathway, we purified full-length SNAP-25 from the brain cortex and isolated the recombinant cytoplasmic parts of syntaxin1 and synaptobrevin2. We chose to use the SNAREs without their transmembrane regions (TMRs) because TMR-TMR interactions, according to the SNARE paradigm, follow interactions between the cytoplasmic SNARE parts and only occur upon membrane fusion. To assess the dimeric interactions between the highly purified SNAREs, we used Coomassie protein gel staining rather than Western immunoblotting, because the former provides an immediate estimate of binding efficiency and does not exaggerate weak, low affinity interactions, as can be the case for immunoblotting. Individual SNARE proteins were immobilized on Sepharose beads and incubated with the other cognate SNAREs, and bound protein was analyzed after extensive washing of the beads. The addition of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin to immobilized syntaxin1 resulted in the binding of SNAP-25 only (Fig. 4A). Immobilized SNAP-25, when incubated with its two partners, bound only to syntaxin1 and not to synaptobrevin (Fig. 4B). Finally, immobilized synaptobrevin did not interact with either of the monomeric target SNAREs alone but bound them both when incubated together (Fig. 4C). These experiments indicate that syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 in vitro form a dimeric precursor on the pathway to ternary SNARE complex formation as summarized in the schematic diagram (Fig. 4D). To quantitatively characterize this target SNARE intermediate, we measured both the affinity of syntaxin1 for SNAP-25 and the stoichiometry of this interaction. Determination of a dissociation constant (KD) for a protein-protein interaction requires that saturable binding be achieved under equilibrium conditions. Therefore, we immobilized 1 pmol of SNAP-25 on Sepharose beads and incubated it with syntaxin1 in the concentration range of 10-9 to 10-5m at 25 °C for 2 h. Bound syntaxin1 was measured by chemiluminescent immunoblotting in conjunction with a 12-bit cooled CCD camera. The binding was clearly saturable, and syntaxin1 bound to SNAP-25 with high affinity (KD = 126 nm) (Fig. 5A). We used a quantitative Sypro Orange dye to analyze the stoichiometry of this interaction at a syntaxin concentration above the point of saturation. This fluorescent dye is a protein stain devoid of protein-to-protein variations (17.Steinberg T.H. Jones L.J. Haugland R.P. Singer V.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Acquisition of fluorescence on a cooled CCD camera within the linear dynamic range revealed that syntaxin1 bound to SNAP-25 in an ∼1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 5B). Because the molar ratio of proteins in native SNARE complexes has not been quantified in a direct way, we purified the ternary complex from bovine brain cortex. The tight SNARE complex is disassembled by NSF ATPase (18.Whiteheart S.W. Schraw T. Matveeva E.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) but can also be broken into its constituent parts by boiling (4.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Boiling of the brain SNARE complex resulted in the appearance of monomeric syntaxin1, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin2 on an SDS gel, and Sypro Orange quantitation yielded an approximately equimolar ratio for the three SNAREs (Fig. 5C). This direct measurement provides, for the first time, the protein ratio in the native SNARE complex composed of full-length proteins. The equimolar stoichiometry is mirrored by the x-ray analysis of the truncated ternary complex obtained using recombinant SNARE fragments (3.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) and, therefore, supports the physiological relevance of the crystal structure. Our results so far suggested that the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells contains clusters of syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimers. Botulinum toxin E (BoNT/E) potently blocks exocytosis by cleaving SNAP-25 before ternary SNARE complex formation (2.Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Although botulinum toxins can not cleave SNAREs in the ternary complex, their effect on the SNARE binary complex is unclear. The light chain of botulinum toxin E (BoNT/E LC) readily cleaved monomeric SNAP-25 (Fig. 6A), confirming the proteolytic activity of the toxin. We prepared a stoichiometric complex of syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 immobilized on anti-SNAP-25-Sepharose beads and then added BoNT/E LC. The toxin treatment led not only to cleavage of SNAP-25 but, strikingly, following standard washes, to full loss of syntaxin1 from the immobilized SNAP-25. This suggests that the loss of the C-terminal 26 amino acids of SNAP-25 leads to disruption of the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer (Fig. 6B). To confirm this finding, we immobilized the target SNARE heterodimer through GST-syntaxin1 on glutathione beads and tested again the effect of BoNT/E LC. Addition of BoNT/E LC completely disrupted the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 association, further demonstrating that the full-length SNAP-25 molecule is required for the stable interaction with syntaxin1 (Fig. 6C). In light of the dramatic effect of BoNT/E LC on the stability of the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer, we analyzed its impact on the target SNARE distribution in the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. The addition of BoNT/E LC to permeabilized chromaffin cells led to marked changes in the localization of the target SNAREs. Following the toxin treatment, SNAP-25 immunoreactivity translocated partially into the cytosol in agreement with previous studies (19.Meunier F.A. Lisk G. Sesardic D. Dolly J.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 454-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas syntaxin1 immunoreactivity remained restricted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6D). The polar confocal sections showed a dramatic disruption of normal syntaxin1/SNAP-25 colocalization, indicating that the association of target SNAREs in the plasma membrane is due to their high affinity interaction (Fig. 5A). Western immunoblotting of chromaffin cells confirmed that the majority of SNAP-25 had been digested by BoNT/E LC (Fig. 6E). Quantitative analysis of the SNAP-25/syntaxin1 distribution on the plasma membrane demonstrated a profound drop in colocalization of the two target SNAREs on the plasma membrane following botulinum toxin E treatment (Fig. 6, F and G). The SNARE paradigm of intracellular membrane fusion, put forward a decade ago (20.Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar), has received overwhelming evidence through many independent lines of enquiry (1.Sudhof T.C. Sheller R.H. Cowan W.M.

In particular, studies of the three neuronal SNARE proteins, synaptobrevin2 from secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane syntaxin1 and SNAP-25, contributed significantly to our understanding of the last step of vesicle exocytosis. These three proteins are also involved in exocytosis from many endocrine cells throughout the body, including adrenaline-secreting chromaffin cells and insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells (13.Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 15.Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that the three SNARE proteins form a parallel four-helix bundle that can drive the fusion of two apposing membranes (3.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). However, the steps that actually lead to formation of the ternary SNARE complex are still poorly understood. By deciphering the pathway of SNARE assembly we will gain knowledge of how membrane fusion is regulated, because the availability of SNARE intermediates is likely to be an important point of control for the regulation of hormonal and neurotransmitter release. We now provide four lines of evidence that syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 form stable heterodimers independent of synaptobrevin, both in vitro and in vivo. First, we showed that the two target SNAREs form the only stable intermediate on the pathway leading to the ternary SNARE complex (Fig. 4). Second, we demonstrated that syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 interact with high affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 5). Third, the distribution of the two target SNAREs coincide in clusters on the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells, whereas the majority of secretory granules are found at a distance from their target membrane in resting cells (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Fourth, botulinum toxin E can not only disrupt the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer in vitro but also disorders the target SNARE clusters in chromaffin cells (Fig. 6). Taken together, our data show that, in chromaffin cells, syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 form the sole stable SNARE intermediate, which exists on the plasma membrane in discreet clusters. The demonstration of a single high affinity binary complex between syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 defines unambiguously the SNARE assembly pathway. Our data agree with biophysical measurements that proposed the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer as a possible intermediate (22.Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Subramaniam V. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Using chemiluminescent immunoblotting, some interactions between SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin were observed previously (4.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 23.Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these interactions have not been investigated in a quantitative manner and could well be sub-stoichiometric, because large amounts of protein were immobilized to detect binding. Our direct protein quantitation in the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer revealed a 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 5B). Significantly, the native SNARE complex also possesses equimolar protein ratios (Fig. 5C) in agreement with the crystal structure of the recombinant truncated complex (3.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). This validates independently the use of Sypro Orange as a quantitative protein dye (17.Steinberg T.H. Jones L.J. Haugland R.P. Singer V.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and calls into question the previous indirect estimation of two syntaxin molecules with one molecule of SNAP-25 in a binary complex (24.Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Based on our protein quantification of SNARE complexes, we suggest that transition from the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer to the ternary SNARE complex simply requires engagement of synaptobrevin. The localization of syntaxin1 and SNAP-25 on the chromaffin cell plasma membrane, in the absence of synaptobrevin, agrees well with the SNARE distribution in neurons and pancreatic secretory cells (15.Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25.Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The segregation of secretory granules from the plasma membrane, in chromaffin cells, is thought to be due to the cortical actin network (13.Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 26.Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaro J.M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The SNARE organization observed here is in contrast to a study of PC12 membrane sheets, which concluded that the plasma membrane contains synaptobrevin in large amounts and that the SNAREs do not interact in resting cells (8.Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is possible that the brief sonication of PC12 cells used to prepare plasma membrane sheets can lead to mixing of subcellular compartments and redistribution of SNAREs. Furthermore, some PC12 cell lines, being tumor cells, may have lost their SNARE organization, whereas chromaffin cells, as a primary culture, retain the highly organized secretory machinery. Nevertheless, partial colocalization of syntaxin and SNAP-25 has been observed in intact PC12 cells upon the expression of exogenous fluorescent syntaxin (14.Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The small size of syntaxin1/SNAP-25 clusters (700 nm in diameter) suggests that vesicles are either actively targeted to the fusion sites or, instead, the random collision of vesicles with these clusters leads to exocytosis. Significantly, recent dynamic single vesicle imaging studies revealed that only a proportion of approaching vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane (27.Duncan R.R. Greaves J. Wiegand U.K. Matskevich I. Bodammer G. Apps D.K. Shipston M.J. Chow R.H. Nature. 2003; 422: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28.Zenisek D. Steyer J.A. Almers W. Nature. 2000; 406: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Chow and co-workers observed defined sites of repeated vesicle docking and fusion in chromaffin cells (29.Oheim M. Loerke D. Stuhmer W. Chow R.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with a spatial distribution similar to the syntaxin/SNAP-25 clusters (Fig. 1B). Although our approach identified the target SNARE clusters in fixed chromaffin cells, this method has its own limitations, as it does not allow investigation of the dynamics of vesicle movement and fusion with the plasma membrane. Alternative methodologies such as genetic replacement of the endogenous target SNAREs with fluorescent syntaxin1 and SNAP-25, labeling of secretory vesicles, and the use of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of living cells will be useful for further advances. Our finding of the well organized target SNARE machinery in resting chromaffin cells is in agreement with the characterization of the syntaxin1/SNAP-25 heterodimer as the only stable intermediate in the SNARE assembly pathway and provides a clearer picture of steps underlying SNARE-mediated exocytosis. The discoveries that botulinum toxins cleave monomeric SNAREs and block neuronal exocytosis have provided an important cornerstone for the SNARE paradigm (2.Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 5.Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1617-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that SNAP-25, even when associated with syntaxin1, can also be targeted by botulinum toxin E leading to SNAP-25 cleavage and disruption of the binary complex. Because the target SNARE clusters likely define sites for ternary SNARE complex formation, disruption of these clusters by the toxin may contribute to the well established blockade of exocytosis (6.Chen Y.A.

Neurosci. 1998; 1: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The fact that the majority of SNAP-25 is in association with syntaxin on the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells also indicates that botulinum toxin E must target this heterodimer to block exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2051328369,"Alteration in the expression of invasion/metastasis-related melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MelCAM) is strongly associated with the acquisition of malignancy by human melanoma. However, little is known about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that regulate the expression and function of MelCAM, or its downstream signaling transduction. In this study, we show that there is a reciprocal regulation loop between AKT and MelCAM. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT in human melanoma cell lines substantially reduced the expression of MelCAM. Overexpression of constitutively active AKT upregulated the levels of MelCAM in melanoma cell lines, whereas expression of a dominant-negative PI-3 kinase downregulated MelCAM. On the other hand, overexpression of MelCAM activated endogenous AKT and inhibited proapoptotic protein BAD in melanoma cells, leading to increased survival under stress conditions. Constitutive activation of AKT was observed in most melanoma cell lines and tumor samples of different progression stages. These data link AKT activation with MelCAM expression, and implicate that intervention of MelCAM-AKT signaling axis in melanoma is a potential therapeutical approach."
https://openalex.org/W2095242471,"The hematopoietic cell kinase Hck is a Src family tyrosine kinase expressed in cells of myelomonocytic lineage, B lymphocytes, and embryonic stem cells. To study its role in signaling pathways we used the Hck-SH3 domain in protein interaction cloning and identified C3G, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 and R-Ras, as a protein that associated with Hck. This interaction was direct and was mediated partly through the proline-rich region of C3G. C3G could be co-immunoprecipitated with Hck from Cos-1 cells transfected with Hck and C3G. C3G was phosphorylated on tyrosine 504 in cells when coexpressed with Hck but not with a catalytically inactive mutant of Hck. Phosphorylation of endogenous C3G at Tyr-504 was increased by treatment of human myelomonocytic THP-1 cells with mercuric chloride, which is known to activate Hck tyrosine kinase specifically. Coexpression of Hck with C3G induced a high level of apoptosis in many cell lines by 30–02 h of transfection. Induction of apoptosis was not dependent on Tyr-504 phosphorylation or the catalytic domain of C3G but required the catalytic activity of Hck. Using dominant negative constructs of caspases we found that caspase-1, -8, and -9 are involved in this apoptotic pathway. These results suggest that C3G and Hck interact physically and functionally in vivo to activate kinase-dependent and caspase-mediated apoptosis, which is independent of catalytic domain of C3G.

Structurally, Hck is similar to other members of the Src family in that it has a catalytic domain at the C terminus that is preceded by a 100-amino acid SH2 domain and a 50-amino acid SH3 domain. The SH2 and SH3 domains are protein interaction modules that mediate either intramolecular or intermolecular associations. SH2 domains bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in a specific amino acid context, whereas SH3 domain interacts with polyproline tracts in polypeptides with optimal affinity for PXXP. Intramolecular interaction of the SH2 domain with the C-terminal phosphotyrosine and SH3 domain with proline sequences present between the catalytic domain and SH2 domain keep the Hck molecule in a closed inactive configuration (10Sicheri F. Marefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine or binding of ligands to SH2 or SH3 domains results in its activation. The Hck gene encodes two polypeptides (p61 and p59 in human cells and p59 and p56 in murine cells) that are derived from alternate translation initiation sites (11Lock P. Ralph S. Stanley E.

Radha V. Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26755-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Dual labeling for Hck and C3G was performed by incubating the cells serially with C3G antibody, anti-rabbit Cy3, mouse monoclonal anti-Hck, and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate. Treatment of Cells with Mercuric Chloride—THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. These cells were differentiated to a macrophage lineage by the addition of 20 ng ml-1 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 48 h. Differentiated cells were subjected to HgCl2 treatment as described by Robbins et al. (32Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7201-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.5 mm HgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature before preparation of whole cell lysates in SDS sample buffer for Western blotting. Apoptosis Assays—Quantitative analysis of apoptotic cells was carried out essentially as described previously (28Radha V. Ch Sudhakar Ray P. Swarup G. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Radha V. Ch Sudhakar Swarup G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the required plasmids and processed for immunofluorescence staining using appropriate antibodies. Cells were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 1 mg/ml para-phenylenediamine (antifade) and 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain the DNA. Cells showing immunofluorescence staining were counted, and those cells that showed loss of refraction, condensed chromatin, apoptotic bodies, or cell shrinkage were scored as apoptotic. At least 200 expressing cells were counted in each coverslip. The data represent the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Cells not expressing the transfected protein were also counted in each coverslip. Generally 1–3% of non-expressing cells showed apoptosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was carried out as described previously (28Radha V. Ch Sudhakar Ray P. Swarup G. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Apoptosis assays in J774 cells were performed by cotransfecting expression plasmid for EGFP with Hck and C3G plasmids and observing the phenotype of GFP-expressing cells. Overlay Assay and Western Blotting—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by pGEX vectors and purified using the glutathione-agarose affinity method as described (34Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Purified GST fusion proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 2% bovine serum albumin containing 1 mm dithiothreitol made in TBSTG (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% gelatin). The blot was then incubated for 1.5 h with purified GST-SH3 fusion proteins (30–50 μg/ml) of Hck. After this the blot was washed in TBSTG for 15 min (3 washes each for 5 min). The blot was then processed with primary antibody against SH3 domain of Hck followed by secondary antibody as described for Western blotting (26Gouri B.S.V. Swarup G. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kamatkar S. Radha V. Nambirajan S. Reddy R.S. Swarup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26755-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Detection of primary antibodies was either by ECL or by color development using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Phosphorylation—Whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting with 2× IP buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 2% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 300 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml protease inhibitors, soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 15 min on ice. The cell debris was removed by spinning at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with water and incubated with the antibody for 1 h. After this, protein A-agarose beads were added, and the incubation was carried out for one more hour. The beads with the antibody attached to them were pelleted by spinning at 4000 rpm for 2 min and washed with 1× IP buffer three times and either boiled with 1× sample buffer for Western blot or processed for kinase assay. Immunoprecipitated proteins attached to the protein A-agarose beads were phosphorylated in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml protease inhibitors soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, aprotinin), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μm[γ-32P] ATP in a total volume of 50 μl for 1 h on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of 3× sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and exposed for autoradiography. Interaction of SH3 Domain of Hck with C3G—In our screen for proteins that interact with the SH3 domain of Hck tyrosine kinase, we obtained a clone (C9) from a rat spleen cDNA library using protein interaction cloning strategy (17Singh Shivakrupa R. Swarup G. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This clone showed an open reading frame of 210 amino acids and the presence of 3 proline-rich motifs that corresponded with the proline-rich sequences 2, 3, and 4 (P2, P3, P4) of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G (12Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 13Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier, these sequences were shown to mediate interaction with Crk (13Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the interaction between Hck and C3G, different segments of clone C9 containing the proline-rich region P2 (GSTC3G-c), P4 (GST-C3G-b), and P2, P3, and P4 (GST-C9) were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). These fusion proteins, which were expressed to a comparable extent (Fig. 1B), were transferred to a membrane and incubated with purified GST-SH3 (Hck) fusion protein, and bound fusion proteins were detected using a monoclonal antibody against the Hck-SH3 domain. Hck-SH3 domain interacted with C3G sequences containing either P2 or P4 and also all three proline-rich regions, whereas no interaction was found with GST alone (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the Hck-SH3 domain is able to interact directly with the C3G proline-rich regions. The interaction with P2 was stronger than with P4, suggesting that interactions were specific and not because of overexpression. Phosphorylation of C3G at Tyr-504 by Expression of Hck— Earlier it was shown that human C3G, which shows 87.3% amino acid identity to rat C3G, can complement C3G function in knockout mice (20Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Human C3G is phosphorylated on tyrosine 504 upon coexpression of Crk1, and this modification enhances its exchange factor activity toward Rap1 (23Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because Hck-SH3 interacted with proline-rich regions of C3G, we explored the possibility of human C3G being a substrate of Hck in vivo. Cos-1 cells were transfected with various expression constructs, and whole cell lysates were blotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. It was seen that a 140-kDa protein that migrates similarly to C3G was phosphorylated on tyrosine when C3G was cotransfected with Hck (Fig. 2A). The 140-kDa protein detected by antiphosphotyrosine antibody is likely to be C3G itself because very little phosphotyrosine was seen on the Y504F mutant of C3G when coexpressed with Hck (Fig. 2A). A lower level of phosphorylation of the Y504F mutant of C3G was not due to a lower level of expression because C3G and Hck levels were comparable, as determined by reprobing the blot with anti C3G and anti-Hck antibodies (Fig. 2A). These results suggested that C3G was phosphorylated on tyrosine when coexpressed with Hck, and the major site of Hck-mediated phosphorylation on C3G was tyrosine 504. The phosphorylation of C3G at Tyr-504 was confirmed by Western blotting using two different antibodies specific to Tyr-504-phosphorylated C3G. As shown in Fig. 2B coexpression of Hck with C3G, but not with Y504F mutant of C3G, showed phosphorylation. This antibody (raised in goat, SC-12926) did not detect phosphorylation at other residues in C3G as seen by the total absence of a signal on Y504F C3G (Fig. 2B). In vivo C3G could be a direct substrate of Hck or could be the substrate of another tyrosine kinase activated by Hck. We examined the ability of Hck to phosphorylate C3G in vitro. Cos-1 cells were transfected with either Hck, C3G, or Hck and C3G, and lysates were immunoprecipitated using Hck antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase reactions (Fig. 3A) or blotted with anti C3G antibody (Fig. 3B). C3G was present in Hck immunoprecipitates, suggesting their interaction in vivo (Fig. 3B) and that it was phosphorylated in the Hck immunoprecipitate to some extent (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of Endogenous C3G upon Activation of Hck—Treatment of myelomonocytic cells with mercuric chloride has been shown to specifically activate Hck, and this approach has been used to identify Hck substrates (32Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7201-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Howlett C.J. Bisson S.A. Resek M.E. Tigley A.W. Robbins S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Lyn, the closest homolog of Hck among the Src family kinases is also expressed in these cells but is not activated by HgCl2 (32Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7201-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To find out whether endogenous C3G is phosphorylated upon activation of endogenous Hck we used the myelomonocytic cell line THP-1, which shows good expression of C3G protein. THP-1 cells were differentiated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for better expression of Hck and then subjected to HgCl2 treatment to activate Hck. It was observed that there was a dramatic increase in Tyr-504 phosphorylation of C3G upon HgCl2 treatment, as determined by Western blotting using phospho-C3G (Tyr-504)-specific antibody (Fig. 4A). The levels of C3G and Hck were unchanged under these conditions (Fig. 4A), but as expected, there was a large increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig. 4B). Direct interaction between Hck and C3G in THP-1 cells could not be demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments even after treatment of cells with HgCl2 (data not shown), indicating, therefore, that this interaction may be weak or transient. Activation of Apoptosis by Coexpression of Hck and C3G—We explored the physiological consequence of Hck-C3G interaction by studying the effects of Hck and C3G coexpression on cell survival. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Hck alone or with C3G and labeled using the TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) reagent after 42 h to detect apoptosis. It was observed that a larger number of cells that were cotransfected with Hck and C3G showed TUNEL positivity, suggesting that coexpression of these two molecules triggers a pathway leading to apoptosis (Fig. 5A). To quantitate the extent of apoptosis, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transfected with Hck and C3G and stained for Hck and C3G using specific antibodies. The stained cells were examined by microscopy, and it was observed that a large number of cells (about 45%) that expressed Hck and C3G showed apoptosis, as determined by morphological criteria such as shrinkage of cells, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation. Those cells that expressed only C3G or Hck did not show high level of apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Untransfected cells that did not express C3G or Hck showed only basal levels of apoptosis (3–4%). Expression of C3G with green fluorescence protein showed apoptosis only in about 6% of cells. Similar results were obtained in MCF-7 cells and the mouse macrophage cell line J774 (Fig. 5B). Apoptosis was assessed 30 h after transfection in J774 cells because a large number of apoptotic cells showed detachment from the coverslips at later points of time. The higher level of apoptosis induced by C3G alone in J774 cells may be due to the fact that these cells express Hck constitutively. These results suggest that coexpression of Hck and C3G leads to high levels of apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by a variety of inducers is generally mediated by caspases (36Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). C3G- and Hck-mediated apoptosis was inhibited by cotransfection with a catalytic mutant of procaspase-1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 6). This mutant procaspase-1 inhibited apoptosis induced by expression of caspase-1 but not by caspase-3 or caspase-4 (29Gupta S. Radha V. Ch Sudhakar Swarup G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Coexpression of catalytically inactive mutant of caspase-8 as well as a dominant negative isoform of caspase-9 (caspase-9s) also inhibited apoptosis induced by Hck and C3G. These results suggest that caspase-1, -8, and -9 are required for induction of apoptosis by C3G and Hck. Expression of C3G and Hck induced apoptosis in 36% of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4B). MCF-7 cells lack functional caspase-3 protein due to a deletion in the gene (37Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar), indicating thereby that caspase-3 function is not an absolute requirement for induction of apoptosis by C3G and Hck. Coexpression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 inhibited apoptosis induced by C3G and Hck (Fig. 6). Catalytic Domain of C3G Is Not Required for Apoptosis Induced by Coexpression of Hck and C3G—We explored the possibility of an apoptotic pathway being induced as a consequence of Tyr-504 phosphorylation of C3G. For this purpose we compared the extent of apoptosis in cells expressing both Hck and Y504F mutant of C3G with those expressing Hck and wild type C3G. As seen in Fig. 7B there was no significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells when Y504F C3G was expressed along with Hck, indicating that Hck-mediated Tyr-504 phosphorylation of C3G is not a requirement for triggering the apoptotic cascade. To identify whether the catalytic activity of C3G was required for Hck- and C3G-induced apoptosis, we quantitated the extent of apoptosis induced by two deletion mutants of C3G, one lacking the C-terminal catalytic domain (ΔC-C3G) and the other lacking the N-terminal 579 amino acids (ΔN-C3G) and possessing only one proline-rich sequence and the catalytic domain (Fig. 7A). Neither of these constructs induced apoptosis when expressed alone. As shown in Fig. 7B, we observed that apoptosis was very low when Hck was coexpressed with ΔN-C3G, but a large number (67%) of cells that coexpressed Hck and ΔC-C3G showed apoptosis. These results suggested that the catalytic sequences of C3G were not required, but the N-terminal half of the C3G, which has the proline sequences, was required for induction of apoptosis by coexpression with Hck. Kinase Activity of Hck Is Required for Hck- and C3G-induced Apoptosis—Because Hck- and C3G-induced apoptosis was not dependent on Tyr-504 phosphorylation of C3G, we investigated the requirement of Hck catalytic activity for inducing apoptosis. A catalytically inactive mutant of p59 Hck (mHck), which showed similar expression and subcellular localization as wild type Hck but showed no antiphosphotyrosine staining (Fig. 8A), was used along with C3G in cotransfection experiments. Cells that coexpressed mHck and C3G showed a low apoptotic index (Fig. 8B), indicating the requirement of Hck catalytic activity for triggering apoptosis upon coexpression with C3G. C3G was not phosphorylated when coexpressed with mHck, showing the requirement of Hck catalytic activity for phosphorylation of C3G (Fig. 8C). Our results presented here show that Hck tyrosine kinase physically interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G. This interaction may be mediated at least partly by the SH3 domain of Hck and proline-rich regions of C3G located in the central domain. The interaction between Hck and C3G appears to be very specific because it results in the phosphorylation of C3G predominantly at Tyr-504, although there are many tyrosines in C3G. Phosphorylation at this site has previously been shown to increase catalytic activity of C3G (23Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the suggestion that Hck directly phosphorylates C3G in vivo. However, the possibility that Hck activates another tyrosine kinase, which then phosphorylates C3G, cannot be ruled out because in vitro phosphorylation of C3G by Hck was inefficient. A possible explanation for inefficient in vitro phosphorylation of C3G by Hck is that in vivo another factor (such as a protein) may be required for efficient phosphorylation of C3G by Hck. Bcr-Abl, Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP), Cbl, Wasp, ELMO, ADAM15, and STAT3 have been identified as substrates of Hck that interact through SH3 domain (35Howlett C.J. Bisson S.A. Resek M.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction through SH3 domain may be a general feature of substrate recognition by Hck. The sequence surrounding the Tyr-504 of C3G does not have any acidic amino acids (IPSVPYAPFAA) toward the N terminus as required for recognition specificity of Src family kinases (44Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge the sequence requirement for phosphorylation by Hck tyrosine kinase has not yet been determined. Recently Src and Jak2 have been implicated in the phosphorylation of C3G in response to growth hormone stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells leading to Rap1 activation (24Ling L. Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27301-27311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By using dominant negative mutants of c-Src and Jak2, it was shown that the activity of both the kinases was required for C3G phosphorylation in response to growth hormone. It was suggested that the endogenous C3G gets phosphorylated at Tyr-504 because exogenously expressed Y504F mutant of C3G was not phosphorylated. Using phosphospecific antibodies, we have for the first time unequivocally demonstrated the phosphorylation of endogenous C3G at Tyr-504, which increased in response to activation of endogenous Hck. One of the consequences of interaction of C3G and Hck was the induction of apoptosis, which was inhibited by antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. Catalytic activity of Hck was required for activation of this apoptotic pathway, which requires caspase-8, -1, and -9. Neither the catalytic activity of C3G nor Tyr-504 phosphorylation of C3G were required for induction of apoptosis by expression of Hck and C3G. Then what is the role of C3G in the induction of apoptosis? Activation of Hck by mutation of negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site or by the SH3 ligand Nef results in fibroblast cell transformation (45Ziegler S.F. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2724-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 46Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 47Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to large increases in kinase activity of Hck. Expression of Y504F C3G or C3G showed only marginal increases in phosphorylation of certain endogenous polypeptides by Hck, as determined by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates (data not shown). C3G is a large molecule, and it could conceivably provide a binding site for a potential substrate of Hck. It is likely that the interaction between Hck and C3G may result in transient phosphorylation of certain specific proteins by Hck, which may lead to activation of an apoptotic pathway. Tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors is required for survival of cells. Lyn, Syk, and Lck tyrosine kinases are required for inhibition of apoptosis by cytokines (48Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 49al-Ramadi B.K. Zhang H. Bothwell A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12498-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). There are only a few examples of tyrosine kinases, such as c-Abl, Lyn, and AATYK, which have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis (50Gaozza E. Baker S.J. Vora R.K. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3125-3127Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 51Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 52Wang J.Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5643-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Depending upon the physiological context, Lyn is involved in the induction or inhibition of apoptosis (48Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 51Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our results show the potential of Hck to induce kinase activity-dependent apoptosis in the presence of C3G. Further work is required to understand the physiological significance of this novel property of Hck of inducing apoptosis. We have shown physical and functional interaction between Hck tyrosine kinase and guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G in which C3G acts upstream as well as downstream of Hck-mediated signaling. On one hand activation of Hck results in phosphorylation of C3G at Tyr-504, a phosphorylation known to increase C3G catalytic activity. On the other hand, through its non-catalytic sequences, C3G alters the signaling downstream of Hck in such a way that it leads to induction of apoptosis, which requires the catalytic activity of Hck. We thank Dr. M. Matsuda of the Department of Pathology, Research Institute, International Medical Centre of Japan, Tokyo for generously providing various human C3G mutants and Dr. S. Tanaka for providing normal C3G expression plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W2012233176,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and the epidermal growth factor receptor are overexpressed in a variety of cancers. In addition to overexpression, the FGFRs are found mutated in some cancers. The Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) is a critical mediator of RTK signaling, but its role in oncogenic RTK-induced cell transformation and cancer development is largely unknown. In the current report, we demonstrate that constitutively activated FGFR3 (K/E-FR3) transforms NIH-3T3 cells, and that SHP2 is a critical mediator of this transformation. Infection of K/E-FR3-transformed 3T3 cells with a retrovirus carrying a dominant-negative mutant of SHP2 (C/S-SHP2) retarded cell growth, reversed the transformation phenotype and inhibited focus-forming ability. Furthermore, treatment of K/E-FR3-transformed NIH-3T3 cells with PD98059 or LY294002, specific inhibitors of MEK and PI3K, respectively, inhibited focus formation. Biochemical analysis showed that K/E-FR3 activates the Ras-ERK and the PI3K signaling pathways, and that the C/S SHP2 mutant suppressed this effect via competitive displacement of interaction of the endogenous SHP2 with FRS2. However, the C/S SHP2 protein did not show any effect on receptor autophosphorylation, FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation or interaction of Grb2 with K/E-FR3 or FRS2. Together, the results show that K/E-FR3 is transforming and that the Ras-ERK and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, which are positively regulated by SHP2, are important for K/E-FR3-induced transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2054292602,"The lysyl oxidase-like protein 4 (LOXL4) is the latest member of the emerging family of lysyl oxidases, several of which were shown to function as copper-dependent amine oxidases catalyzing lysine-derived cross-links in extracellular matrix proteins. LOXL4 contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains in addition to the characteristic domains of the LOX family, including the copper-binding domain, the cytokine receptor-like domain, and the residues of the lysyl-tyrosyl quinone cofactor. In an effort to assess its amine oxidase activity, we expressed LOXL4 as recombinant forms attached with hexa-histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus by using an Escherichia coli expression system. The recombinant proteins were purified with nickel-chelating affinity chromatography and converted into enzymatically active forms by stepwise dialysis. The purified LOXL4 proteins showed β-aminopropionitrile-inhibitable activity of 0.022-0.032 units/mg toward a nonpeptidyl substrate, benzylamine. These results indicate that LOXL4, with the four scavenger receptor cysteine rich domains, may also function as an active amine oxidase. Availability of the pure and active forms of LOXL4 will be significantly helpful in functional studies related to substrate specificity and crystal structure of this amine oxidase, which should provide significant insights into functional differences within the LOX family members. The lysyl oxidase-like protein 4 (LOXL4) is the latest member of the emerging family of lysyl oxidases, several of which were shown to function as copper-dependent amine oxidases catalyzing lysine-derived cross-links in extracellular matrix proteins. LOXL4 contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains in addition to the characteristic domains of the LOX family, including the copper-binding domain, the cytokine receptor-like domain, and the residues of the lysyl-tyrosyl quinone cofactor. In an effort to assess its amine oxidase activity, we expressed LOXL4 as recombinant forms attached with hexa-histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus by using an Escherichia coli expression system. The recombinant proteins were purified with nickel-chelating affinity chromatography and converted into enzymatically active forms by stepwise dialysis. The purified LOXL4 proteins showed β-aminopropionitrile-inhibitable activity of 0.022-0.032 units/mg toward a nonpeptidyl substrate, benzylamine. These results indicate that LOXL4, with the four scavenger receptor cysteine rich domains, may also function as an active amine oxidase. Availability of the pure and active forms of LOXL4 will be significantly helpful in functional studies related to substrate specificity and crystal structure of this amine oxidase, which should provide significant insights into functional differences within the LOX family members.

In most tissues, LOX is responsible for the lysine-derived cross-links in collagen and elastin, which is the essential step for biogenesis of a fibrillar extracellular matrix (1Kagan H.M. Trackman P.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). More recently, several new functions, as varied as tumor suppression, cellular senescence, developmental control, and chemotaxis, have been assigned to this amine oxidase (2Di Donato A. Lacal J.C.

The importance of LOX has been further emphasized by the finding that abnormal LOX activity contributes to a number of different diseases, including atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysms, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic fibrosis (5Decitre M.

In recent years, four novel LOX-like proteins, LOXL, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4, have been identified, each containing the characteristic domains of LOX in the carboxyl (C) terminus, such as the copper-binding domain, the lysyl-tyrosyl-quinone residues and the cytokine receptor-like domain (10Asuncion L.

The presence of a LOX family suggests that the multiple diverse functions currently attributed to a single enzyme, LOX, may be because of different LOX-like proteins. In addition to the conserved C-terminal domains, LOXL2, LOXL3 and LOXL4, unlike LOX and LOXL, contain four scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) domains in the amino (N) terminus, thus forming a subfamily within the LOX family. Based on the conservation of the C-terminal LOX domains, these SRCR domain-containing members were predicted to contain the amine oxidase function, but it has yet to be determined. SRCR domains are known to mediate ligand binding in a number of secreted and receptor proteins (15Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The presence of SRCR domains within LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 indicates that these three proteins may play novel functions, possibly involving components of the extracellular matrix. The murine homologue of LOXL4, reported as LOXC, was initially identified as a transcript specifically expressed in the cartilage (17Ito H. Akiyama H. Iguchi H. Iyama K. Miyamoto M. Ohsawa K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24023-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, Northern analyses of the human LOXL4 gene showed more ubiquitous expression in many tissues, but it was different from the other members of the LOX family (10Asuncion L. Fogelgren B. Fong K.S. Fong S.F. Kim Y. Csiszar K. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Maki J.M. Tikkanen H. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting distinct tissue and substrate specificity of this protein. In this study, we report for the first time that LOXL4 functions as an active amine oxidase. The LOXL4 protein was expressed as His-tagged recombinant forms in inclusion bodies by using an Escherichia coli expression vector, extracted with 8 m urea, and renatured into enzymatically active forms toward a nonpeptidyl substrate, benzylamine. The amine oxidase activity of LOXL4 was sensitive to β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a well known specific inhibitor of LOX. Construction of LOXL4 Expression Plasmids—The LOXL4 cDNAs were PCR-amplified from human placental total RNA (BD Biosciences) by using Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The forward primers, LOXL4-p1, LOXL4-p2, LOXL4-p3, LOXL4-p4, and LOXL4-p5, were designed to start the open-reading frame of LOXL4 at Ala2, Val159, Val311, Val421, and Asp570, respectively. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers used for cloning LOXL4 cDNAs are described in Table I. A unique restriction site, either NheI or Hind III, was introduced in each primer for convenient subcloning. All of the recombinant proteins were designed to contain an additional Met-Ala-Ser sequence at the N terminus and a hexa-histidine tag at the C terminus. Thermocycling consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, with a predenaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were gel-purified and then ligated into pET21a (Novagen) at NheI and Hind III restriction sites in frame with the C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. All of the resulting expression constructs, pET21a-LOXL4-p1, pET21a-LOXL4-p2, pET21a-LOXL4-p3, pET21a-LOXL4-p4, and pET21a-LOXL4-p5, were confirmed to contain the desired LOXL4 sequences by DNA-sequencing analysis by using a Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's recommended method.Table IPrimers used for subcloning of LOXL4 cDNAs into pET21a The underlined letters indicate the unique restriction sites introduced for subcloning into pET21a.

The transformants were grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 of culture reached 0.6. For induction, 1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added. After 4 h of induction, the transformants were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mg/ml of lysozyme). Triton X-100 (1%, w/v) and DNase (0.1 mg/ml) were added sequentially to the lysates at intervals of 30 min during inverted mixing, and then sonication was repeated twice at 70% efficiency with a sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Inc). The inclusion bodies were precipitated by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min and homogenized in 60 ml of 8 m urea, 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.2, and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The solubilized inclusion bodies were purified with the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resins (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All of the purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The purity and sizes of the recombinant proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—To confirm the N-terminal sequences of the recombinant LOXL4 proteins, the purified proteins were subjected to N-terminal analysis by Edman degradation. After purification by the nickel-chelating affinity chromatography, 5 μg each of LOXL4-p2, LOXL4-p3, LOXL4-p4, and LOXL4-p5 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences), and stained with Ponceau S. The visualized protein bands were excised and loaded into a CLC Capillary 492 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The 10 N-terminal residues of each purified recombinant protein were analyzed by the automated N-terminal sequencing, and all of the recombinant LOXL4 proteins contained the expected sequences in the N terminus. Refolding of the LOXL4 Proteins—For stepwise dialysis, the purified LOXL4 proteins were diluted to 100 μg/ml in elution buffer (6 mm urea, 250 mm imidazol, and 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.2). The protein samples were dialyzed overnight first against a buffer of 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 9.6, 200 μm CuCl2, and 2% sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate and then against a buffer of 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 9.6, and 5 μm CuCl2. The proteins were further dialyzed twice against the phosphate buffer. The concentration of dialyzed protein samples was determined by the BCA method (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18574) Google Scholar). After dialysis, the protein solutions were aliquoted and lyophilized in the presence of 10 mm trehalose using a Freeze dryer (Labconco). Amine Oxidase Assays—Amine oxidase assays were performed with a UV spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments). The assay reactions included 10 mm benzylamine and 100 μg of a recombinant LOXL4 protein in 1 ml of the phosphate buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C with simultaneous detection at 250 nm. For the assays with BAPN, the LOXL4 protein was preincubated with 100 molar excess of BAPN in the phosphate buffer at 37 °C for 1 h, and then 10 mm benzylamine was added to the reaction mixture for amine oxidase assays. Expression of the LOXL4 Proteins—In an effort to express and purify enzymatically active forms of LOXL4, we constructed a series of LOXL4 expression plasmids. The LOXL4 cDNAs of variable lengths were PCR-amplified and cloned into pET21a, an E. coli expression plasmid. All of the recombinant LOXL4 proteins were designed to contain the characteristic C-terminal domains of the LOX family, including the copper-binding domain, the CRL-domain, and the LTQ residues (Lys638 and Tyr674). However, the recombinant proteins were designed to start at different residues, either encoding the full-length polypeptide of LOXL4 (LOXL4-p1) or subsequently deleting the four SRCR domains (LOXL4-p2, LOXL4-p3, LOXL4-p4, and LOXL4-p5) (Fig. 1A). Bone morphogenic protein-1, also known as procollagen C-proteinase, was shown to proteolytically cleave the LOX and LOXL precursor proteins at Ala/Gly-Asp, leaving an aspartic acid residue at the N terminus of each processed protein (19Borel A. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Kessler E. Gleyzal C. Hulmes D.J.S. Sommer P. Font B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48944-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A potential cleavage site of bone morphogenic protein-1 was also identified within LOXL4, at residues Ala569-Asp570. LOXL4-p5 was designed to correspond to this potentially processed form of LOXL4, deleting all of the SRCR domains in the N terminus (Fig. 1A). Upon induction by 1 mm IPTG at 37 °C, the recombinant LOXL4 proteins, except for LOXL4-p1, were expressed at high levels from the expression constructs (Fig. 1B). Fractionation of the cell lysates into different cellular compartments, such as cytoplasmic extracts, periplasmic extracts, and inclusion body fractions, revealed that most of the recombinant proteins were expressed in insoluble forms within inclusion bodies (data not shown). It was not clear yet why the LOXL4-p1 construct did not show any detectable expression, but it might be because of the presence of rare codons, such as CTA (Leu16), CCC (Pro19 and Pro21), and AGG (Arg23), in the N terminus of LOXL4, which are infrequently used in E. coli. Clusters of rare codons were shown to cause translation errors and reduction of the expression level in E. coli (21Jonasson P. Liljeqvist S. Nygren P.A. Stahl S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2002; 35: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The apparent sizes of the expressed recombinant LOXL4 proteins were in good agreement with the deduced molecular masses; 62 kDa for LOXL4-p2, 50 kDa for LOXL4-p3, 38 kDa for LOXL4-p4, and 22 kDa for LOXL-p5 (Fig. 1, B and C). The hexa-histidine-tagged recombinant LOXL4-proteins were over 95% pure on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1C). Automated N-terminal sequencing confirmed the presence of the designed N-terminal sequence in each LOXL4 recombinant protein, indicating that each protein band in the SDS-PAGE gels represents the desired length of the corresponding recombinant LOXL4 protein. The LOXL4-p2, LOXL4-p3, LOXL4-p4, and LOXL4-p5 proteins contained the open-reading frame of LOXL4 starting from Val159, Val311, Val421, and Asp570, respectively, with the additional Met-Ala-Ser tag at the N terminus, as expected. Amine Oxidase Activity of the Purified LOXL4 Proteins—In an attempt to refold the proteins denatured by urea during purification, we tried stepwise dialysis in the presence of N-lauroylsarcosinate and Cu2+, an oxidative catalyzer. In the first dialysis buffer, 2% (w/v) sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate and 200 μm CuCl2 were added. The second dialysis was carried out without any detergent but in the presence of 5 μm CuCl2, and the protein samples were further dialyzed twice in the potassium phosphate buffer. The refolded recombinant proteins were assessed for amine oxidase activity toward a nonpeptidyl substrate, benzylamine. One unit of amine oxidase activity was defined as the activity resulting in oxidation of 1 μmol of benzylamine per min at 37 °C. The conversion of benzylamine substrate to benzaldehyde was monitored at 250 nm using spectrophotometry. The specific activity of LOXL4-p2, LOXL4-p3, LOXL4-p4, and LOXL4-p5 was 0.022 units/mg, 0.025 units/mg, 0.027 units/mg, and 0.032 units/mg, respectively (Table II). All of these activities were inhibited to a background level by 100 molar excess of BAPN, an irreversible inhibitor of LOX (Table II).Table IIBAPN-inhibitable amine oxidase activity of the purified LOXL4 proteins Data are presented as the means ± standard deviations of assays in quadruplicate.

Mure M. Medzihardsky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Tang C. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30575-30578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The differences in specific activity within the tested recombinant LOXL4 proteins were primarily due to the differences in molar concentration of the recombinant proteins in the assays. These assay results indicate that all of the rested recombinant proteins, including the potentially bone morphogenic protein-1 processed form of LOXL4, function as an active amine oxidase toward benzylamine and, moreover, that the conserved C-terminal domains of LOXL4 are sufficient to confer the amine oxidase function to this protein. The SRCR Domains in LOXL4 —In our assays, the recombinant LOXL4 proteins containing one or more SRCR domains (LOXL4-p2, LOXL4-p3, and LOXL4-p4) showed BAPN-specific amine oxidase activity toward benzylamine (Table II). Although we have not yet tested the catalytic activity of these SRCR domain-containing recombinant proteins toward more physiological substrates, such as collagen and elastin, our results indicate that the presence of the SRCR domains does not interfere with the amine oxidase activity of LOXL4 at least in in vitro assays. The SRCR superfamily proteins are found either on the cell surface membranes or as secreted proteins. The SRCR domains within these proteins are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions for cell adhesion or cell signaling (15Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Bodian D.L.

The presence of SRCR domains within LOX4, therefore, may indicate possible existence of modulators that may affect the amine oxidase activity of LOXL4 through interaction with the SRCR domains. Identification of the interactive proteins of LOXL4 will be critical in further characterization of the functional significance of the SRCR domains in LOXL4. In summary, the purpose of this study was to assess the amine oxidase activity of LOXL4. With purified recombinant forms of LOXL4, we have shown that LOXL4 functions as an amine oxidase. Furthermore, by using a series of deletion constructs, we confirmed that neither the presence nor the deletion of SRCR domains affects the amine oxidase activity of LOXL4. The availability of these enzymatically active forms of LOXL4 will pave the way for further functional characterization of this latest member of amine oxidases, which should be critical in understanding the mechanistic bases for the diverse functions played by the LOX family members."

https://openalex.org/W2069834543,"Both progesterone and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are critically involved in mammary gland development and also in breast cancer progression. However, how the progesterone and IGF signaling pathways interact with each other to regulate breast cancer cell growth remains unresolved. In this study, we investigated progesterone regulation of IGF signaling components in breast cancer cells. We found that insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) levels were markedly induced by progesterone and the synthetic progestin R5020 in MCF-7 and other progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancer cell lines, whereas IRS-1 and the IGF-I receptor were not induced. The antiprogestin RU486 blocked the R5020 effect on IRS-2 expression. Ectopic expression of either PR-A or PR-B in C4-12 breast cancer cells (estrogen receptor and PR negative) showed that progestin upregulation of IRS-2 was mediated specifically by PR-B. The IRS-2 induction by R5020 occurred via an increase of IRS-2 mRNA levels. Furthermore, progestin treatment prior to IGF-I stimulation resulted in higher tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 levels, increased binding of IRS-2 to Grb-2 and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, and correspondingly enhanced ERK and Akt activation, as compared with IGF-I-only conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that IRS-2 may play an important role in crosstalk between progesterone and the IGFs in breast cancer cells."

Here we explored the molecular basis for the decrease or loss of hRFC gene expression in seventeen tumor cell lines with resistance to multiple antifolates due to impaired antifolate transport. We studied the role of various cis-acting elements including CRE/AP-1-like element and GC-box in hRFC promoters A and B, respectively, as well as AP-2, Mzf-1 and E-box that are contained within or near four tandemly repeated sequences upstream of promoter A. Decreased or abolished binding either to [32P]GC-box, Mzf-1, AP-1, E-box, or CRE oligonucleotides was detected in ∼50-80% of antifolate-resistant cell lines. Strikingly, ∼80% of the cell lines displayed a simultaneously decreased binding to three or more of these hRFC promoter elements, whereas normal AP-2 binding was retained. The possible contribution of promoter methylation to hRFC gene silencing was also explored.

Transient expression of the relevant transcription factors restored, at least partially, both promoter binding and hRFC gene expression.

Reduced folates are essential cofactors involved in various one-carbon transfer reactions resulting in the biosynthesis of nucleotides and amino acids essential for cell growth and DNA replication (1.Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Since mammalian cells lack the enzymatic capacity for the de novo biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate cofactors, these vitamins must be obtained from the diet (1.Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Folate analogues (i.e. antifolates) serve as anticancer drugs as they potently inhibit various enzymes involved in purine and deoxythymidylate biosynthesis resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and consequent cell death. Reduced folates and antifolates are divalent anions that cannot traverse membranes by passive diffusion and are therefore transported into mammalian cells primarily by the reduced folate carrier (RFC) 1The abbreviations used are: RFC, reduced folate carrier; CRE, cyclic AMP-response element; CREB-1, CRE-binding protein 1; Sp1 and Sp3, specificity proteins 1 and 3; AP1 and AP2, activating proteins 1 and 2; Mzf-1, myeloid zinc finger 1; USF-1, upstream stimulatory factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; RTPCR, reverse transcription PCR.

In order for antifolates to exert their cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, high levels of RFC-dependent transport activity must be maintained (2.Matherly L.H. Goldman I.D. Vitam.

Therefore, impaired drug transport results in decreased intracellular concentration of antifolates and consequent drug resistance; defective antifolate transport is a major mechanism of drug resistance in cultured tumor cells subjected to clinically relevant concentrations of various antifolates (10.Gong M.

Cancer. 2003; 98: 1958-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using human osteosarcoma specimens at diagnosis we have shown recently that expression of low RFC protein levels at the time of initial biopsy correlates with a poor response to preoperative chemotherapy containing MTX (20.Ifergan I.

Decreased RFC mRNA levels can result from transcriptional silencing; the lack of hRFC transcripts in MTX-resistant MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells with impaired MTX transport was due to promoter methylation (21.Worm J.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest a complex regulation of hRFC gene expression in normal tissues and tumor cell lines (22.Whetstine J.R. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6350-6358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23.Whetstine J.R. Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 367: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we recently initiated studies that focus on the elucidation of the molecular basis of the loss of hRFC gene expression in antifolate-resistant tumor cells. To this end, we recently found that alterations in the expression and binding of transcription factors to cAMP response element (CRE)/AP-1-like element and GC-box in hRFC promoters A and B, respectively, underlie the loss of hRFC gene expression in two antifolate-resistant cell lines with impaired antifolate transport (25.Rothem L. Aronheim A. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8935-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Apart from the constitutive GC-box and inducible CRE/AP-1 element, additional promoter elements including AP-2, myeloid zinc finger 1 (Mzf-1), and E-box are contained within or near four tandemly repeated sequences upstream of promoter A (Fig. 1). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and antibody-mediated supershift analysis we screened 17 antifolate-resistant human leukemia and breast cancer cell lines displaying impaired antifolate transport associated with a marked decrease or complete loss of RFC mRNA expression. Strikingly, the vast majority of the cell lines displayed a simultaneous loss of binding to three or more hRFC promoter elements including CRE, E-box, AP-1, Mzf-1, and GC-box, whereas AP-2 binding was retained. The markedly decreased binding to these cis-acting elements was associated with decreased expression of various transactivators. This is the first demonstration that simultaneous alterations in the expression and function of multiple transcription factors that bind to various cis-acting elements are a major mechanism of loss of hRFC gene expression in tumor cell lines that display resistance to various novel antifolates due to impaired drug uptake. We further show that while hRFC promoter silencing via methylation is rare in antifolate-resistant cell lines, it appears to alleviate the stress that would otherwise lead to alterations in the expression and function of transcription factors.

The cell lines were established by single step or stepwise antifolate selection of parental CCRF-CEM cells as previously described (14.Rothem L. Ifergan I. Kaufman Y. Priest D.G. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26.Liani E. Rothem L. Bunni M.A. Smith C.A. Jansen G. Assaraf Y.G. Int. J.

Human breast cancer ZR-75 cells and the MTX-resistant cell lines ZR-75-MTXR and MDA-MB-231 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid (Biological Industries, Beth-Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Antibody-mediated Supershift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing cells (2 × 107 cells) as previously described (27.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were formed by incubating nuclear extract proteins (6 μg) with [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP end-labeled CRE, GC-box, AP-1, AP-2, Mzf1, and E-box double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table I) as detailed elsewhere (28.Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide competition was performed with 10-100-fold molar excess of non-radioactive consensus oligonucleotides as previously described (25.Rothem L. Aronheim A. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8935-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A 2-fold decrease (or more) in the binding intensity as revealed by scanning densitometry relative to parental cells was scored as altered binding. Furthermore, decreased binding of a single band upon electrophoretic mobility shift assay was sufficient for scoring it as altered binding to a given consensus binding site. For supershift analysis, nuclear proteins (6 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CREB-1, -ATF-1, -Sp1, -Sp3, -c-Jun, Jun B, c-Fos, and -USF-1 antibodies (4 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotides as previously described (25.Rothem L.

A portion of total RNA (20 μg in a total volume of 20 μl) was reverse-transcribed using M-MLV (180 units, Promega) in a reaction buffer containing random hexamer primers, dNTPs, and a ribonuclease inhibitor Rnasin (Promega). Portions of cDNA (∼50 ng) synthesized from parental CEM cells and their antifolate-resistant sublines were amplified using Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in a reaction buffer (total volume 25 μl) containing: 10 pmol of each primer in 2xReddyMix PCR master mix reaction buffer according to the instructions of the manufacturer (ABgene, Surrey, UK). The PCR reaction was performed as follows: initial melting at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25-35 cycles each of 1 min at 95 °C, annealing at 62 °C for 45 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 10 min extension at 72 °C. Then, the PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The primers used for the semi-quantitative RT-PCR of hRFC and GAPDH were previously described (25.Rothem L. Aronheim A. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8935-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections with Various Expression Constructs—Exponentially growing suspension cells (2 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation and transfected by electroporation (1000 μF, 234 V) with 10 μg of the following expression plasmids: pCREB1-VP16 (kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Greenberg), pmyc-c-fos, pHA-c-Jun and pPacSp1 (a gift from Dr. G. Suske). Cells were then seeded at 2 × 106/ml in prewarmed growth medium. For transient RFC mRNA expression and EMSA, after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested and total RNA and nuclear proteins were extracted. Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear proteins (30 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, electroblotted onto Protran cellulose nitrate membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), reacted with anti-pCREB-1/pATF-1 (New England Biolabs), c-Fos (abcam, Cambridge, UK), Sp1 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), USF-1, Sp3, c-Jun, and AP-2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following three 10-min washes in TBS at room temperature, blots were reacted with second antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, Baltimore, PA), rewashed and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biological Industries, Beth-Haemek, Israel). ECL was recorded on x-ray films using several exposure times, which were evaluated by scanning densitometry. Determination of hRFC Promoter Methylation—We have devised two independent assays in order to explore hRFC promoter methylation in the various antifolate-resistant cell lines. A) Bisulfite DNA Sequencing Assay—The first assay is based on bisulfite modification of genomic DNA followed by genomic PCR and DNA sequencing. Bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was carried out using CpGenome DNA modification kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Intergen) under conditions that allowed the complete conversion of all cytosine residues (but not 5-methylcytosine) to uracil. DNA treated in vitro with SssI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs) was used as a positive control for methylated hRFC alleles. Following bisulfite modification, DNA was PCR-amplified using Reddymix (ABgene) and 10 pmol of each primer (5′-ATCCCAAAACCCCAAAA-3′, and 5′-GGATTTTAGGGTTAGTTT-3′), corresponding to a promoter region of hRFC where methylation was previously found to result in transcriptional silencing (21.Worm J.

All positions refer to ATG of the translation initiation as +1 using accession number 7717445. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 95°c for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 53 °C, and 3 min extension at 72 °C; a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min was performed to complete the genomic amplification process. Products were then resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, purified (Qiagen), and sequenced. B) Southern Blot-based Assay—Genomic DNA from the various cell lines was co-digested with NcoI (Fermentas) and MunI along with either SmaI (methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme) or XmaI (a methylation insensitive isozyme of SmaI) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Following digestion, DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis (2.2 V/cm) on 0.8% agarose gels containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA in the gel was then depurinated with 0.25 m HCl, denaturated with 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH, neutralized with 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, transferred to a ZetaProbe-GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), and UV cross-linked. Fragments were analyzed by Southern blot analysis using a 537-bp 32P-labeled genomic hRFC probe (see Fig. 9). Following an overnight hybridization at 65 °C, blots were washed under high stringency conditions with a final wash in a solution of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, and visualized by a phosphorimaging device. Loss of [3H]MTX Transport and Antifolate Resistance—In the present study we used a large panel of seventeen antifolate-resistant leukemia and breast cancer cell lines, the features of which are summarized in Table II; these previously published characteristics also include initial rates of [3H]MTX transport. The up to 99% loss of [3H]MTX uptake in these antifolate-resistant cell lines was associated with a marked decrease in RFC protein expression. Furthermore, in approximately two thirds of the cell lines, heterozygous nonsense mutations and/or missense mutations were present. Consequently, these cell lines displayed up to ∼3,500-fold cross-resistance to various hydrophilic antifolates.Table IISummary of the characteristics of the various cell linesCell lineAntifolate selection methodMTX transport (% of control)aMTX transport Vmax in ZR-75 (WT) was 10.8 ± 0.8 pmol/mg protein/min,bInitial rate of MTX transport in parental CEM (WT) cells was 4.11 ± 0.56 pmol/107 cells/minAntifolate resistance range (-fold)RFC Mutation(s)RFC protein expressioncRFC protein expression relative to CEM (WT) or ZR-75 (WT)Ref. no.AG2034R2AG2034, Stepwise365—939None0dRFC below the level of detection on Western blot14.Rothem L.

We therefore used semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis in order to determine hRFC mRNA levels (normalized to GAPDH) in the various antifolate-resistant cell lines. Whereas readily detectable in parental CEM cells after 25 cycles of RT-PCR, hRFC cDNA was observed in neither of the antifolate transport-defective cell lines (Fig. 2A); consistently, after 30 cycles of RT-PCR, decreased RFC cDNA levels could be detected in eight of the seventeen antifolate-resistant cell lines, whereas no detectable expression could be observed in the remainder (Fig. 2B). Decreased Binding of Transcription Factors to Various hRFC Promoter Elements in Antifolate-resistant Cell Lines—These RT-PCR data established that RFC gene expression was profoundly suppressed in various cell lines. To explore potential alterations in the binding of transcription factors to the various cis-acting elements in the hRFC promoter region, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear factor binding to consensus 32P-labeled oligonucleotides including CRE, E-box, AP-1, Mzf-1, and GC-box was markedly decreased (Fig. 3, A-E, respectively), whereas normal AP-2 binding was retained in all antifolate-resistant cell lines (Fig. 3F). Fig. 4A summarizes the percentage of cell lines with decreased oligonucleotide binding; 47-76% of the cell lines had decreased transcription factor binding either to GC-box, Mzf-1, AP1, E-box, or CRE. Strikingly, ∼76% of the cell lines displayed a simultaneous decrease in the binding to three or more hRFC promoter elements, whereas, only ∼18% of the cell lines had one or two hRFC elements altered in binding (Fig. 4B). In contrast, MDA-MB-231 was the only cell line that retained normal binding to all six cis-acting elements.Fig. 4Summary of the percentage of antifolate-resistant cell lines with loss of binding to individual or multiple transcription factor recognition sites.

However, obvious homologs with significant identity to known PGIs could not be identified in the sequenced genome of this organism. The PGI activity from A. pernix was purified and characterized. Kinetic analysis revealed that, unlike all known PGIs, the enzyme catalyzed reversible isomerization not only of glucose 6-phosphate but also of epimeric mannose 6-phosphate at similar catalytic efficiency, thus defining the protein as bifunctional phosphoglucose/phosphomannose isomerase (PGI/PMI). The gene pgi/pmi encoding PGI/PMI (open reading frame APE0768) was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analyses; the gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as functional PGI/PMI. Putative PGI/PMI homologs were identified in several (hyper)thermophilic archaea and two bacteria. The homolog from Thermoplasma acidophilum (Ta1419) was overexpressed in E. coli, and the recombinant enzyme was characterized as bifunctional PGI/PMI. PGI/PMIs showed low sequence identity to the PGI superfamily and formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. However, secondary structure predictions and the presence of several conserved amino acids potentially involved in catalysis indicate some structural and functional similarity to the PGI superfamily. Thus, we propose that bifunctional PGI/PMI constitutes a novel protein family within the PGI superfamily.

PGI plays a central role in sugar metabolism of eukarya, bacteria, and Archaea both in glycolysis via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway in eukarya and bacteria and in its modified versions found in Archaea. PGI is also involved in gluconeogenesis where the enzyme operates in the reverse direction (for the literature see Refs. 1.Noltmann E.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes.

The eukaryal and bacterial PGIs belong to the PGI superfamily defined by its two conserved signature patterns [DENS]-X-[LIVM]-G-G-R-[FY]-S-[LIVMT]-X-[STA]-[PSAC]-[LIVMA]-G- and [GS]-X-[LIVM]-[LIVMFYW]-X4-[FY]-[DN]-Q-X-G-V-E-X2-K. To date this superfamily includes more than 300 PGI sequences (see www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00342) (26.Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 28: 263-266Crossref Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) from bacteria and eukarya but only three from the archaeal domain. These include the PGI from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Methanococcus jannaschii (MjPGI). This PGI has recently been characterized as the first archaeal member of the PGI superfamily. 2Rudolph, Hansen, and P. Schönheit, Arch. Microbiol., in press. So far little is known about other archaeal PGIs. Recently, two other euryarchaeal PGIs have been characterized, one from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (2.Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27.Verhees C.H. Huynen M.A. Ward D.E. Schiltz E. De Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Biol.

Wakagi T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both PGIs belong to the cupin superfamily (29.Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Good-enough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and, thus, represent a convergent branch of PGI evolution. The cupin superfamily is present in all three domains of life, eukarya, bacteria, and Archaea, and comprises a group of structurally conserved but functionally diverse proteins ranging e.g. from mannose 6-phosphate isomerases and epimerases involved in formation of bacterial cell wall carbohydrates to nonenzymatic storage proteins in plant seeds and transcription factors (29.Dunwell J.M.

So far PGIs of any crenarchaeota have not been characterized, and the encoding genes have not been identified. Recently, cell extracts of the aerobic crenarchaeon Aeropyrum pernix have been shown to contain high PGI activities together with other enzymes of a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway. 3P. Schönheit, unpublished information. Several unusual enzymes of this pathway, i.e. an archaeal ATP-dependent repressor, open reading frame, and kinase glucokinase (31.Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a non-regulatory ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase of the phosphofructokinase-B family (32.Hansen T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 177: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and a non-regulatory pyruvate kinase (33.Johnsen U. Hansen T. Schonheit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25417-25427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have been characterized. Despite the fact that A. pernix contained high PGI activity, a gene with significant similarity to either the PGI superfamily or the cupin-type PGIs could not be identified in the completely sequenced genome of A. pernix (34.Kawarabayasi Y. Hino Y. Horikawa H. Yamazaki S. Haikawa Y. Jin-no K. Takahashi M. Sekine M. Baba S. Ankai A. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Fukui S. Nagai Y. Nishijima K. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Masuda S. Funahashi T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y. Yamazaki J. Kushida N. Oguchi A. Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 142-152Google Scholar). This suggests that the A. pernix PGI might be significantly different from all known PGIs analyzed so far. In this communication we report the purification and characterization of PGI activity of the crenarchaeon A. pernix. Surprisingly, unlike all known PGIs, the purified enzyme catalyzed the isomerization of both glucose 6-phosphate and epimeric mannose 6-phosphate at a similar catalytic efficiency, thus defining the enzyme as a novel bifunctional phosphoglucose isomerase/phosphomannose isomerase (PGI/PMI). The encoding gene pgi/pmi was identified in the genome of A. pernix and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Putative homologs were found in several archaeal and two bacterial genomes. The homolog of the euryarchaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum was functionally expressed in E. coli and characterized as bifunctional PGI/PMI. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses indicate that these bifunctional PGI/PMIs constitute a novel protein family within the PGI superfamily. Growth of A. pernix K1—A. pernix K1 (DSM 11879) was grown aerobically at 90 °C in a 100-l Biostat fermenter on a complex medium as described (35.Sako Y. Nomura N. Uchida A. Ishida Y. Morii H. Koga Y. Hoaki T. Maruyama T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) except that artificial sea water was used instead of Biomaris water, and 1 g of starch was added per liter. Cells were grown and harvested (after 17 h) at the late exponential growth phase. Purification of PGI Activity (PGI/PMI) from A. pernix—Because the enzyme was not sensitive to oxygen, all steps of the purification procedure were carried out in the presence of oxygen at 4 °C. During the purification procedure, the PGI activity of bifunctional PGI/PMI was followed as described below. Cell extracts were prepared from 214 g (wet weight) of frozen cells that were suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm dithioerythritol, 5 mm EDTA (buffer A). Cells were disrupted by passing through a French pressure cell at 1.3 × 108 pascals. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to DEAE-Sepharose (100 ml) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. Protein was eluted by increasing NaCl gradients in buffer A: 100 ml of 0-0.06 m, 30 ml of 0.06 m, 450 ml of 0.06-0.7 m, 10 ml of 0.7 m, 200 ml of 0.7-2 m. Fractions containing the highest PGI activity were pooled (0.14-0.36 m), adjusted to 2 m ammonium sulfate and to pH 8.0, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (16 ml) previously equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, 2 m ammonium sulfate). Protein was desorbed by a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient in buffer B: 130 ml of 2-0.3 m, 15 ml of 0.3 m, 60 ml of 0.3-0 m. PGI-containing fractions (0.1-0 m) were concentrated to a volume of 0.9 ml by ultrafiltration (exclusion size 10 kDa) and applied to a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The PGI activity-containing fractions (85-92 ml) were pooled, diluted 3-fold with buffer D (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5), and applied to an Uno-Q1 column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer D. Protein was eluted by increasing NaCl gradients in buffer D: 4 ml of 0-0.06 m, 1.5 ml of 0.06 m, 8 ml of 0.06-0.55 m, 1.5 ml of 0.55 m, 3 ml of 0.55-1 m, 1 ml of 1 m, 2 ml of 1-2 m, 5 ml of 2 m. Fractions containing the highest PGI activity (0.08-0.56 m) were pooled, concentrated to a final volume by vacuum centrifugation (55 °C, Christ RVC 2-18), and applied to a Bio-Silect SEC 250-5 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer C. Fractions with the highest PGI activity eluted at 12-13 ml and were essentially pure and stored at -20 °C. Under these conditions the activity remained about constant. Analytical Assays—The purity of the preparation was checked by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 according to standard procedures (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The protein concentration of purified recombinant protein was determined using the molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of the enzymes as calculated by the ProtParam (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html): ApPGI/PMI = 47650 m-1cm-1, TaPGI/PMI = 25010 m-1cm-1. Both methods deviated by less than 5%. Identification of ORFs encoding PGI/PMIs—Pure enzyme was excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and analyzed by MALDI-TOF spectroscopy after tryptic cleavage as previously described (38.Nimtz M. Grabenhorst E. Conradt H.S. Sanz L. Calvete J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other putative ORFs encoding for PGI/PMIs were identified by BLASTP searches using the A. pernix PGI/PMI sequence. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of Recombinant Protein—The function of ORF APE0768 and Ta1419, which encodes putative PGI/PMI, has been proven by their cloning and functional overexpression in E. coli as follows. The coding region of appgi/pmi and tapgi/pmi were amplified by PCR with Pwo polymerase (PEQLAB) from genomic DNA of A. pernix and T. acidophilum, respectively, as a template. The following primers were used to introduce unique restriction sites (underlined) for NcoI (ORF APE0768) or NdeI (ORF Ta1419) and XhoI, respectively: 5′-GAAACACGGGGGGGTTCCATGGGGTTG-3′ (appgi/pmi, forward) and 5′-GTAAAGGTTTCTCCTCCATCCCCGG-3′ (appgi/pmi, reverse); 5′-CGCGATCGTAATTTATACATATGATGCTTCGA-3′ (tapgi/pmi, forward) and 5′-CCTTTGCATCCGAACTCGAGAATGAAAAATGA-3′ (tapgi/pmi, reverse). After amplification and NdeI/XhoI double-digestion, the respective PCR products were inserted by T4 DNA ligase (Roche Diagnostics) into pET17b (Novagen) expression vectors linearized by NcoI/XhoI or NdeI/XhoI double-digestion. The resulting pgi/pmi-containing plasmids were introduced into E. coli JM109 and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) via transformation. The inserted gene sequences were confirmed on each strand by the method of Sanger et al. (39.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar). Transformed E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells were grown in 400 ml of Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8, and pgi/pmi expressions were initiated by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h of further growth (A600 ∼ 2.5-3.2), the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. Recombinant protein was purified as follows. Cell extracts were prepared by French press treatment (1.3 × 108 pascals) of cell suspensions in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min) the solutions were heat-precipitated for 45 min at 90 °C (ApPGI/PMI) and 75 °C (TaPGI/PMI), centrifuged again (5,000 × g for 30 min), and extensively dialyzed against buffer B. Recombinant ApPGI/PMI and TaPGI/PMI were purified by phenyl-Sepharose and gel filtration on Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 to apparent homogeneity as described above for the native ApPGI/PMI. TaPGI/PMI eluted at 0.2-0.1 m ammonium sulfate from phenyl-Sepharose and at 84-93 ml from the gel filtration column. Molecular Mass Determination—Molecular mass determinations were performed by both gel filtration on Superdex 200 (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) and by analytical ultracentrifugation. For analytical ultracentrifugation the TaPGI/PMI was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.0. Centrifugation was done at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a Titan AN 50 rotor and absorption optics. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed for an approximation of the molecular mass at 50,000 rpm, and sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium runs were performed at 10,000 rpm for determining the molecular mass in a 150-μl volume. In sedimentation velocity experiments the apparent sedimentation coefficient s20,wapp and an approximated molecular mass were evaluated from the velocity and shape of the sedimenting boundary by fitting the time-dependent concentration profiles calculated with Lamm's differential equation for a single sedimenting species to the measured data using the program package AKKUPROG (40.Kindler, B. (1997) Akkuprog: Auswertungen von Messungen chemischer Reaktionsgeschwindigkeiten und Analyse von Biopolymeren in der Ultrazentrifuge: Anwendung auf Protein-DNA Wechse/Wirkingen. Ph.D. thesis, Thesis Universität HannoverGoogle Scholar). When the measured concentration profile of sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium runs remained unchanged for 12 h, we assumed equilibrium to be attained. AKKUPROG was used to calculate the apparent molecular masses by fitting the ideal distribution for a single species to the measured concentration profiles. The partial specific volume of the protein was calculated from the amino acid sequence. Enzyme Assays and Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Activity of PGI/PMI s of A. pernix and T. acidophilum was measured both as PGI or PMI activity. PGI activity was used to determine the pH and the temperature optima of the enzymes. pH optima were determined using acetate, Tris/HCl, ethanolamine, CHES, and CAPS at 100 mm each. For the determination of enzyme activity the following standard conditions were used: ApPGI/PMI, 80 °C, pH 7.4, 2 μg of enzyme; TaPGI/PMI, 50 °C, pH 7.6, 5 μg of enzyme. PGI activity (G6P ↔ F6P) was determined in both directions. The formation of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) was investigated by coupling it to the reduction of NADP+ either via yeast (20-50 °C) or via hyperthermophilic Thermotoga maritima glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (50-95 °C) (41.Hansen T. Schlichting B. Schönheit P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 216: 249-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay I contained 100 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 mm NADP+, 5 mm fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), and 1.1 units of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This assay was routinely used for most PGI activity assays. The formation of F6P was measured by coupling it to the oxidation of NADH via mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was expressed and purified as previously described (42.Otte S. Lengeler J.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 194: 221-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay II contained 100 mm Tris/HCl, 0.3 mm NADH, 0.1-15 mm G6P, and 0.6 units of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase. At temperatures higher than 50 °C a discontinuous assay was used as previously described (2.Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PMI activity of PGI/PMIs was analyzed in the direction of F6P formation as described above with the modified standard assays I or II using 0.1-15 mm mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) as substrate. At 50 °C and below F6P formation was detected using modified standard assay II. Above 50 °C, F6P formation was detected by using modified standard assay I with the addition of 1 units of hyperthermophilic P. furiosus PGI (2.Hansen T. Oehlmann M. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The following substances were tested for potential inhibitory effect on PGI activity: erythrose 4-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate, and phosphate. The date points given in the figures are mean values of at least three experiments; S.E. are given. Kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation; the curves drawn represent best fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation (see Fig. 1) or to first order exponential decay equations (see Fig. 2, C and D) with the MicroCal™ software 5.0 using the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm; respective S.E. are given.Fig. 2Effect of temperature on the specific activity and thermostability of PGI/PMI from A. pernix and T. acidophilum.

S.E. are given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Temperature Dependence and Thermal Stability—The temperature dependence of enzyme activity was measured between 20 and 96 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate with F6P as substrate (5 mm). The thermostability of the purified enzyme (1 μg of enzyme, pH 7.0) was tested in sealed vials that were incubated at temperatures between 70 and 110 °C for 2-120 min. The vials were then cooled on ice for 10 min, and residual enzyme activity was tested and compared with the controls (unheated samples). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy analyses were performed on Jasco J-715 CD spectrometer. Spectra were recorded in 0.1-mm cuvettes and corrected for the signal of the solvent (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0). At least five spectra were averaged. Secondary structure analysis and assignments to different secondary structure types were performed by the experimentally established spectra-structure correlation using the Varselec option of Dicroprot (43.Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar). The program Predict Protein was used for sequence-based secondary structure predictions (cubic.bioc.columbia.edu) (44.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 45.Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Heat-induced unfolding of PGIs were analyzed in temperature gradient experiments using closed cuvettes (0.1 cm). The protein samples were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the protein concentrations were set to 100 μg/ml. The temperature of the samples was raised at a rate of 1 °C/min (40-100 °C). Protein unfolding was followed by changes of the α-helical CD ellipticity at 221 nm. The observed ellipticity at a given temperature (Φ) was corrected for the temperature-dependent base line, giving Φ′. The corrected values of the folded state Φ′f and the unfolded state Φ′uf were used for calculating the fraction of folded protein (xuf): xuf = (Φ′-Φ′f)/(Φ′uf-Φ′f). Spectra were recorded before and after each temperature gradient. The spectra as well as the ellipticity of the unfolded state was obtained at pH 2 and 12 when complete thermal unfolding was not obtained up to 100 °C. Temperature gradient experiments were performed in triplicate; the respective S.E. are given. Sequence Handling—Protein sequences were extracted from the NCBI, GenBank™, and Pfam data bases. Sequence alignments were constructed with the neighbor-joining (NJ) method of ClustalX using the GONNET matrix (46.Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35492) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining option of ClustalX, the maximum likelihood (ML) method of PROML (Phylip, version 3.6), and the maximum parsimony (MP) method of PROTPARS (Phylip, version 3.6). Confidence limits were estimated by 100 bootstrapping replicates. The PGI signature patterns were updated using an alignment provided by Pfam (see www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00342), which included all PGI sequences presently available (20.8.03). Purification of PGI Activity of A. pernix and Its Identification as Bifunctional PGI/PMI—Extracts from A. pernix grown on media with peptone and starch exhibited PGI activity (0.27 units/mg at 75 °C). This PGI activity was purified about 800-fold using five chromatographic steps to a specific activity of 200 units/mg with a yield of 3%. The purified protein was electrophoretically homogenous, as indicated by one band on SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme catalyzed the reversible isomerization of G6P to F6P, i.e. showed PGI activity. The Vmax values (at 80 °C) with G6P and F6P were 225 and 195 units/mg; the corresponding Km values were 3.5 and 0.44 mm, respectively (see also Table I). Surprisingly, the enzyme also catalyzed the isomerization of M6P to F6P at almost similar catalytic efficiency; with M6P the Vmax and Km values were 209 units/mg and 1.1 mm, respectively. Thus, the enzyme of A. pernix exhibited bifunctional activities as PGI and PMI, and it was, therefore, assigned as bifunctional PGI/PMI. The PGI/PMI differs from all known PGIs that show strict substrate specificity for G6P and F6P and did not use M6P. Rather, M6P has been shown to be an inhibitor of conventional PGIs (e.g. Refs. 1.Noltmann E.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972Google Scholar, 47.Concepcion J.L. Chataing B.

In the current study, we investigated ligand binding by CD1 proteins by developing a fluorescent probe binding approach using soluble recombinant human CD1 proteins. To increase stability and yield, soluble group 1 CD1 (CD1b and CD1c) and group 2 CD1 (CD1d) proteins were produced as single chain secreted CD1 proteins in which β2-microglobulin was fused to the N termini of the CD1 heavy chains by a flexible peptide linker sequence. Analysis of ligand binding properties of single chain secreted CD1 proteins by using fluorescent lipid probes indicated significant differences in ligand preference and in pH dependence of binding by group 1 versus group 2 CD1 proteins. Whereas group 1 CD1 isoforms (CD1b and CD1c) show stronger binding of nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled dialkyl-based ligands (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and ceramide), group 2 CD1 (CD1d) proteins were stronger binders of small hydrophobic probes such as 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid and 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-naphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid. Competition studies indicated that binding of fluorescent lipid probes involved association of the probe with the hydrophobic ligand binding groove of CD1 proteins. Analysis of selected alanine substitution mutants of human CD1b known to inhibit antigen presentation showed that NBD-labeled lipid probe binding could be used to distinguish mutations that interfere with ligand binding from those that affect T cell receptor docking. Our findings provide further evidence for the functional specialization of different CD1 isoforms and demonstrate the value of the fluorescent lipid probe binding method for assisting structure-based studies of CD1 function.

I proteins. Unlike MHC I proteins that bind and present peptide antigens, CD1 proteins bind lipid antigens in their hydrophobic antigen binding grooves and initiate CD1-dependent, lipid-specific T cell responses (1.Porcelli S.A. Modlin R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 297-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The five CD1 proteins expressed in humans are classified into three distinct groups based on amino acid homology and various characteristics of their expression and functions. Group 1 CD1 is composed of the CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c isoforms, and these are expressed primarily on myeloid lineage dendritic cells where they initiate adaptive immune responses against self or microbial lipid antigens (2.Rosat J.P.

In contrast, the more structurally divergent CD1d protein is classified as group 2 CD1 and is expressed on most cells of hematopoietic origin and also on certain epithelia. CD1d is essential for the development of a unique subset of T cells known as natural killer T cells (NK T cells), which contribute significantly to innate immune responses and also appear to play an important role in immunoregulation (7.Wilson S.B.

It appears to be expressed mainly intracellularly or as a secreted protein, and its potential function is currently unknown (10.Angenieux C. Salamero J. Fricker D. Cazenave J.P. Goud B.

At present, four classes of lipid antigens are known to be presented by CD1 molecules to T cells as follows: 1) mycolates (including free mycolic acids and glucose monomycolates from mycobacteria and related bacteria (6.Beckman E.M.

All of these lipid antigens contain a common motif of a polar head group covalently linked to one or more hydrophobic alkyl chains. Studies using mutagenesis of CD1 and CD1-restricted TCRs in addition to recently solved crystal structures of CD1b and CD1a complexed with phosphatidylinositols or glycosphingolipids demonstrated that CD1 molecules present lipid antigens by anchoring their hydrophobic alkyl chains within the hydrophobic binding groove of the proteins (15.Gadola S.D.

Elsliger M.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 808-815Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This mechanism of binding positions the polar head group or hydrophilic cap of the bound lipid at or near the opening of the groove where it can make direct contacts with T cell antigen receptors (17.Melian A. Watts G.F. Shamshiev A. De Libero G. Clatworthy A. Vincent M. Brenner M.B. Behar S. Niazi K. Modlin R.L. Almo S. Ostrov D. Nathenson S.G. Porcelli S.A. J.

Besra G.S. Porcelli S.A. Science. 1997; 278: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Because the alkyl tails of lipid antigens interact directly with the surface of the hydrophobic ligand-binding sites of CD1 proteins, it seems likely that structural differences in the size and shape of the binding grooves of different CD1 isoforms will influence the identity of the lipid ligands that they bind and present. For example, the crystal structure of CD1b revealed that its ligand binding region consists of a maze-like network of multiple inter-connected channels, which can accommodate very long hydrocarbon chains of CD1b antigens such as mycolates. In contrast, the binding grooves of the CD1a and CD1d proteins contain two hydrophobic pockets suited for binding the two relatively short alkyl chains present in all currently known lipid antigens presented by these two CD1 isoforms. The unique structure of mycobacterial lipid antigens presented by CD1c, which are mannosylated phosphoisoprenoids that contain a single alkyl tail with multiple methyl branches, suggests that the ligand binding region of CD1c may have slightly different properties than those of CD1b and CD1d. Given the established role of lipid antigen presentation by CD1 molecules in the triggering and regulation of a wide variety of immune responses (21.Dutronc Y. Porcelli S.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 337-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22.Park S.H. Bendelac A. Nature. 2000; 406: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the development of better methods with which to probe the antigen binding properties of each of the different CD1 isoforms is required. In the current study, we have established a new experimental system using soluble recombinant CD1 proteins and lipophilic fluorescent probes to characterize the lipid binding properties of three different isoforms of human CD1 proteins. By using a range of structurally distinct fluorescent lipid probes, we show that different isoforms of CD1 differ significantly in terms of the ligand selectivity and the influence of pH on ligand binding. Our results show that fluorescent lipid probes can be used to characterize the selective ligand binding properties of different CD1 proteins, and support the view that the diversification of the CD1 family into multiple different isoforms represents significant and nonredundant differences in the functions of these isoforms.

The following probes were used: 2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (2,6-ANS); 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (1,8-ANS); 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt (bis-ANS); 2-(12-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)dodecanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-C12-HPC); 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino)hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-C6-HPC); 6-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl)sphingosyl phosphocholine (NBD-C6-SM); and 6-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl)sphingosine (NBD-C6-Cer). Fluorescent probes were dissolved at 1 mm concentration in ethanol or methanol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Single Chain CD1 Proteins—Single chain CD1 (scCD1) cDNA constructs were generated by linking the sequence for the entire human β2m at its C terminus to the N-terminal sequence of the α1 domain of the CD1 proteins by the insertion of a sequence encoding a flexible peptide linker (GGGSGGSGSGGGA). Sequence elements encoding the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (GRLVPRGSYPYDVPDYAIEG), a BirA enzymatic biotinylation site (HVGLNDIFEAQKIEWHEGH), and a hexahistidine (HHHHHH) tag were added to the C terminus of the α3 domain of the CD1 proteins as is diagrammed in Fig. 1. Briefly, scCD1 expression constructs were generated in several steps by assembling fragments of DNA encoding the different functional elements. The pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression plasmid (Invitrogen) was adapted with complementary double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides designed with an NarI restriction enzyme site (GGCGCC) preceding the DNA encoding the influenza HA epitope tag, the BirA enzymatic biotinylation site, and a hexahistidine tag ending in a stop codon. A separate pcDNA3.1 vector was created with an insert that encodes the entire human β2m cDNA flanked by the glycine- and serine-rich linker ending in an NheI restriction enzyme site (GCTAGC). PCR was performed using human Jurkat T cell poly(A)+ RNA template to obtain a DNA fragment preceded by a KpnI restriction enzyme site (GGTACC) that encodes the human β2m leader and mature protein and continuing without the stop codon into the Gly/Ser linker, ending in an NheI restriction enzyme site (GCTAGC). The oligonucleotides used for this PCR were 5′-GGTACCACCATGTCTCGCTCCGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCTAGCTCCACCTCCAGAACCGGATCCACCTGATCCACCTCCACCCATGTCTCGATCCCA-3′. Separate PCRs were performed using plasmids containing the full-length human CD1b, CD1c, or CD1d isoform cDNAs as templates to extract cDNA fragments that encode forms of each of the mature CD1 proteins that would start from the N terminus of the α1 region without signal peptide and terminate just prior to the transmembrane segment. The forward direction oligonucleotides for these PCRs were designed to have an in-frame NheI restriction enzyme site (GCTAGC), and the reverse direction oligonucleotides contain the NarI restriction enzyme site (GGCGCC). The specific oligonucleotides pairs used for each of these reactions are as follows: CD1b, 5′-GGAGCTAGCGAACATGCCTTCCAGGGGCCGACCTCC-3′ and 5′-AGGCGCCAATTGAGCCAATGGAGGTGGGGTTTCTCCAGTAGAG-3′; CD1c, 5′-GGAGCTAGCGCAGACGCATCCCAGGAACACGTCTCC-3′ and 5′-AGGCGCCCATTCATGGAAGAGTGGTGTCCCCAGTAGAGG-3′; and CD1d, 5′-GGAGCTAGCGCTGAAGTCCCGCAAAGGCTTTTCCCCCTC-3′ and 5′-AGGCGCCCCAAGCCCATGGAGGTGTAGCTCCCACCCC-3′. A three-part ligation reaction was performed to join the β2m and linker portion of the construct with the CD1 cDNA and the epitope tag elements in the pcDNA3 expression vector. The resulting scCD1 constructs were fully sequenced to ensure that the coding regions and junctions contained no mutations. CHO cells were transfected with scCD1/pcDNA3 vector constructs containing a neomycin/G418 resistance marker using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). G418-resistant cells were selected and subcloned by limiting dilution, and culture supernatants were screened by capture ELISA to isolate stably transfected cells, which produced proteins at a high level. Stable CHO transfectants were adapted to CHO-S-SFM II media (Invitrogen, catalog number 12052098) and cultivated using a roller bottle system to scale up the production. One liter of culture supernatants was extensively dialyzed against 4 liters of PBS for 2 days with buffer exchange every 8 h, and then imidazole was added to the final concentration of 20 mm. The culture supernatants were passed by gravity through Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which contained 2 ml of Ni-NTA beads. CD1 proteins were eluted using 1 ml of PBS containing 200 mm imidazole, and the elution fractions were subjected to Sephadex G200 size exclusion chromatography (Pfizer and Amersham Biosciences). The purified soluble mouse CD1d protein with noncovalently associated β2m was produced using a previously published baculovirus expression system that was kindly provided by Dr. Mitchell Kronenberg (31.Naidenko O.V. Maher J.K. Ernst W.A. Sakai T. Modlin R.L. Kronenberg M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by following formula: (A280nm × Mr)/molar extinction coefficients. Molar extinction coefficients for scCD1b, -c, and -d, based on the content of tyrosine and tryptophan residues, were calculated to be 96,690, 97,970, and 116,770 liter/cm·mol, respectively. The purity of proteins was assessed by reducing SDS-PAGE analysis. The deglycosylation of proteins was performed using peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single chain CD1 mutant constructs were generated by replacing the wild type CD1b sequence between the BamHI and NotI sites of the scCD1b/pcDNA3 construct with analogous fragments containing the desired alanine substitution mutations. The mutant CD1b fragments were amplified by PCR from the previously reported CD1b mutant constructs (17.Melian A. Watts G.F. Shamshiev A. De Libero G. Clatworthy A. Vincent M. Brenner M.B. Behar S.

The resulting scCD1b mutant constructs were fully sequenced to confirm the specific mutations and were used to produce stable CHO transfectants as described above. Soluble mutant scCD1b proteins were purified from culture supernatants using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography. The final yields were ∼1–5 mg/liter. Direct Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Purified CD1 proteins at a concentration of 1 μg/ml were coated on wells of a high binding 96-well plate (Costar, Corning, NY) for 1 h at 37 °C, and unbound CD1 proteins were removed by washing. After blocking nonspecific binding sites by adding 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, anti-CD1 antibodies at a 1 μg/ml concentration were added for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing to remove unbound antibodies. Alkaline phosphate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Serotec, Oxford, UK) was used as secondary antibody to detect anti-CD1 antibodies bound to CD1 proteins, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used as substrate. Optical density at 405 nm was measured 10 min after the addition of substrate. Transfectants Expressing Membrane-bound scCD1 Proteins—To generate transmembrane forms of scCD1 proteins expressed in HeLa or 293T cells, plasmid constructs encoding the membrane-bound forms of scCD1 proteins were generated by replacing the CD1 coding regions of soluble scCD1/pcDNA3 constructs with fragments encoding the fulllength CD1 sequences including transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1A). Full-length CD1 fragments were amplified by PCR from cDNA templates of the various CD1 molecules using the following primers: 5′-ggatccggttctggaggtggaggttcagaacatgcctcccag and 5′-gcggccgcctcatgggatattctg for CD1b; 5′-ggatccggttctggaggtggagctagcgcagacgcatcccag and 5′-gcggccgcctcacaggatgtcctg for CD1c; and 5′-ggatccggttctggaggtggagctagcgctgaagtcccg and 5′-gcggccgcctcacaggacgccctg for CD1d. The resulting constructs were verified by sequencing and subsequently used to stably transfect HeLa cells or transiently transfect 293T cells using LipofectAMINE. HeLa and 293T transfectants expressing the native two-chain forms of CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d have been described previously (17.Melian A. Watts G.F. Shamshiev A. De Libero G. Clatworthy A. Vincent M.

Briefly, 1 μg of antibodies (BCD1b5, F10/21A3, and hCD1d42 for CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d, respectively) was used to stain 1 million cells expressing either the membrane-bound forms of scCD1 or native CD1 proteins in PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.05% NaN3. After washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE, CA) was used to detect CD1-specific antibodies bound to the cells, followed by washing.

The Fes expression was first detected in cells of the myeloid lineage, but recent work (2.Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that Fes exhibits a more wide spread expression pattern including developing neurons and vascular endothelial cells. Transgenic mice overexpressing v-Fps showed a neurological disorder that included a marked trembling, correlated with the expression of v-Fps in the brain, and a striking bilateral enlargement of the trigeminal nerves (3.Yee S.P.

In our previous works, Fes was found to be involved in semaphoring-mediated signaling during neural development (4.Inatome R. Tsujimura T. Hitomi T. Mitsui N. Hermann P. Kuroda S. Yamamura H.

Distinct from Src and other non-receptor PTK, Fes has a long N-terminal unique region containing Fes/CIP4 homology (FCH) domain followed by three coiled-coil domains, a central SH2 domain and a C-terminal kinase domain (6.Greer P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The FCH domain was first described as a region of homology between Fps/Fes/Fer PTKs and a Cdc42-interacting protein, CIP4 (7.Aspenstrom P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence homology searches have detected this FCH domain in numerous proteins, many of which are implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements (8.Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the FCH domain of CIP4 was reported to bind to microtubules, the exact role of FCH domain in Fes remains obscure. In this study we report that Fes plays an important role in microtubule dynamics including microtubule nucleation and bundling through its FCH domain. Implications of Fes in the regulation of microtubules and neural development are briefly discussed.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Procedures—Mouse brains or cultured cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μm Na3VO4) at 4 °C. The lysates (1 mg of protein) were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min and immunoprecipitated with the appropriate Ab. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl and finally with 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0. Immunoprecipitates were boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), followed by detection with the appropriate Ab as described previously (9.Takahashi S. Inatome R. Yamamura H. Yanagi S. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression Constructs—Cloning of mouse Fes cDNA was performed as described previously (5.Mitsui N. Inatome R. Takahashi S. Goshima Y. Yamamura H. Yanagi S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fes cDNA tagged with FLAG epitope at the N terminus were subcloned into pCMV5 expression vectors. Sequencing of all strands of the cloned reverse transcriptase-PCR fragments were performed using an ABI-310 automated DNA sequencer. Fes kinase-negative mutant was generated by missense mutation K562R as described previously (10.Craig A.W. Zirngibl R. Greer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19934-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Point mutation of Arg482 of Fes cDNA in SH2 domain to Lys (R482K) was performed by the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Strategene. A sense primer (5′-GGACTTCCTGGTTAAGGAGAGCCAGGGC-3′) was used. For the FCH-domain deletion mutant Fes (amino acid residues 1–95), a sense primer (5′-GAAGATCTAACTCGGGGCCCTTGAGC-3′) was used. For FCH and coiled-coil-domain deletion mutant Fes (amino acid residues 452–820), a sense primer (5′-GAAGATCTAAGCCTCTCTATGAGCAGCTG-3′) was used. Both Fes and Fes kinase-negative cDNAs were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) for green fluorescence. FCH-domain deletion mutant, FCH, coiled-coil-domain deletion mutant, and SH2 mutant were also subcloned into pEGFP-C1. Cell Culture and Stimulation—COS-7 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Hippocampal cultures were prepared as described previously (11.Inagaki N. Chihara K. Arimura N. Menager C. Kawano Y. Matsuo N. Nishimura T. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 781-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), fetuses from embryonic day 12 were cut into small size and homogenized in 0.05% trypsin-PBS solution with a Dounce homogenizer. After trypsin digestion for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto 6-well plates. Transfection of Plasmid into Cells and Treatment with Chemicals— COS-7 cells and MEFs were cultured in dishes at about 50% confluence. Expression vectors (1 μg) were mixed with serum-free medium and transfected using a LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the medium was changed to serum-free medium for about 4 h, and COS-7 cells were then treated with colcemid (0.8 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice with PBS, COS-7 cells were incubated with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium for 45 min at 37 °C to polymerize microtubules. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells transiently coexpressing cDNAs or hippocampal cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, all at room temperature. For double staining, the cells were incubated with appropriate Abs for 2 h at room temperature and washed three times with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then with appropriate secondary Ab (Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG) for 30 min. The samples were washed as before, mounted using SlowFade-Light (Molecular Probes), and analyzed using LSM510 META (Carl Zeiss). Association of Fes with Microtubules and Correlation with Microtubule Modifications—To investigate the subcellular distribution of Fes, Fes was visualized as green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged fusion protein (GFP-Fes) in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-Fes showed three characteristic expression patterns in COS-7 cells: aggregate, fibrous, and diffuse. On the other hand, GFP-Fes(k–) revealed either a diffuse or an aggregate distribution without the fibrous structures. The ratio of each expression pattern was measured in 100 Fes-transfected cells, and each percentage is shown in the panels of Fig. 1A. GFP-Fes revealed a fibrous formation at 30∼40% in transfected cells but in a kinase-dependent manner. Since these fibrous Fes structures appeared very similar to microtubules, we examined whether these Fes structures colocalized with microtubules. Expectedly, immunofluorescence analysis using anti-α-tubulin Ab showed a complete colocalization of Fes with microtubules (Fig. 1B, top panels). In addition, Fes structures were also immunostained with anti-phoshotyrosine (PY) Ab (Fig. 1B, bottom panels). To confirm the association of Fes with microtubules, immunoprecipitation assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1C, tyrosine-phosphorylated α-tubulin was detected in GFP-Fes immunoprecipitates but not in GFP-Fes(k–) immunoprecipitates. To examine whether Fes associates with microtubules in developing brain, whole lysate of neonatal rat brain was immunoprecipitated with anti-Fes Ab or normal rabbit serum as control. As shown in Fig. 1C, lower panels, tubulin was detected in Fes immunoprecipitates but not in control immunoprecipitates. In addition, colocalization of endogenous Fes with microtubules was detected in neuronal cells (see Supplemental Fig. S1). These results demonstrated that Fes colocalized and associated with microtubules in a kinase activity-dependent manner and that tubulin might be phosphorylated by Fes. The immunofluorescence signals from microtubules seemed to be enhanced by colocalization with Fes structures. To confirm this observation, the effect of Fes expression on microtubule bundling activity was compared by densitometric analysis of immunofluorescence signals from normal- and Fes-colocalized microtubules immunostained with anti-α-tubulin Ab. As shown in Fig. 1D, immunofluorescence signals from microtubules colocalized with Fes were significantly enhanced, and the space between microtubules became wider than that of normal microtubules. All Fes fibrous structures observed in other cells exhibited similar results. In control cells, these strong microtubule bundling was not observed (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we concluded that Fes was actively involved in the processes of microtubule bundling. We next examined whether Fes was involved in the posttranslational modifications of tubulins such as acetylation and detyrosination. Acetylated tubulins are generally found in stable microtubules. As shown in Fig. 1E, fibrous Fes structures were partially colocalized with acetylated and detyrosinated tubulins. Similar results were obtained in almost all other Fes-expressing cells. To examine whether Fes associates with acetylated tubulin, immunoprecipitation assay was performed. GFP-Fes, but not control GFP, was found to be associated with acetylated tubulin (Fig. 2B). However, this result showed a weak coimmunoprecipitation of Fes with acetylated tubulin, as with α-tubulin in Fig. 1C, suggesting that this interaction may be partial and limited. At present, it is uncertain whether Fes was actively involved in these posttranslational modifications. Role for Fes in Microtubule Nucleation and Effects of Various Fes Mutants on Microtubule Dynamics—To understand the role for Fes in microtubule dynamics, COS-7 cells expressing GFP-Fes were treated with colcemid, and the relationship between Fes and microtubule dynamics was examined during the time-dependent process of microtubule regeneration. When microtubules were depolymerized by colcemid treatment Fes existed in an aggregate form without any microtubule formation (not shown). Upon removal of colcemid to start microtubule nucleation and polymerization, microtubule nucleation of centrosomes was observed at 45 min after removal of colcemid and Fes aggregations were found to be colocalized with microtubule nucleation sites (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Thereafter, fibrous Fes structures which colocalized with newly polymerized microtubules were detected after 60 min (Fig. 2A, lower panels). To examine whether Fes associates with γ-tubulin, immunoprecipitation assay was performed. GFP-Fes, but not control GFP, was found to be associated with γ-tubulin, although at a very weak level of association (Fig. 2B). Equal amount of immunoprecipitated γ-tubulin or acetylated tubulin was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-γ-tubulin Ab (not shown). To confirm the localization of Fes to microtubule nucleation sites, COS-7 cells expressing GFP-Fes were double labeled with anti-α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin Abs. As shown in Fig. 2C, Fes aggregates were detected at microtubule nucleation sites with γ-tubulin aggregations. To investigate which domain of Fes was required for its localization to microtubule nucleation, effects of several deletion mutants on microtubule nucleation were examined. As shown in Fig. 2D, GFP-FCH domain fusion protein was able to localize to microtubule nucleation sites (Fig. 2D, upper panels). Interestingly, in some cells, aggregations of GFP-FCH domain were colocalized with multiple γ-tubulin aggregations (Fig. 2D, bottom panels), suggesting the close relationship between Fes FCH domain and γ-tubulin. On the other hand, FCH domain-deleted mutants never colocalized with microtubule nucleation sites. Rather, this mutant blocked normal formation of microtubule nucleation and centrosome. Surprisingly, a fibrous formation of FCH domain deleted Fes mutant was detected, but this mutant Fes showed little colocalization with microtubules (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, expression of FCH domain-deleted mutants blocked normal γ-tubulin localization at microtubule nucleation sites (Fig. 2F). How could FCH domain-deleted mutant lead to the collapse of microtubule structure? One explanation is that in addition to interfering with Fes-mediated signaling, the FCH domain-deleted mutant is also disrupting Fer signaling because Fes and Fer may perform redundant signaling functions in cells. Another explanation is that the FCH domain-deleted mutant could still bind to putative Fes substrates that were involved in microtubule formation, but without the FCH domain these substrates could not distribute to their normal subcellular location such as colocalization to microtubules or nucleation. Therefore, it is important to determine how this FCH domain might mediate functional modification of microtubules and which molecules interact with this domain. Overexpression of Fes FCH protein also blocked normal formation of microtubule nucleation and centrosome without fibrous structures. In this regard, we should consider that the involvement of FCH domains of CIP4 and other FCH domain containing proteins with microtubules is of relevance to the Fes FCH overexpression results. Indeed, a previous work (12.Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) has shown that truncation of Fes which retains the N-terminal domain, but lacks both the SH2 and the tyrosine kinase domain via gene targeting results in embryonic lethality. Thus, mice expressing Fes N-terminal domain showed far much severe phenotype when compared with Fes-deficient mice. This result is highly suggestive that FCH domain-containing proteins also may be involved in microtubule dynamics such as nucleation. Coiled-coil domains-deleted Fes mutant and Fes SH2 mutant revealed either a diffuse or an aggregate distribution but no fibrous formation, same as Fes(k–) mutant (see Supplemental Fig. S2). A striking feature of Fes/Fer PTKs is their ability to form oligomers which is believed to be mediated by the coiled coil domains (13.Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, a previous work (14.Hjermstad S.J. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar) has indicated that the SH2 domain of Fes can bind to autophosphorylation sites. Therefore, intramolecular or intermolecular interactions may be required for fibrous formation of Fes. These results are briefly summarized in Table I.Table IEffect of various Fes mutants on microtubule dynamicsWild-typeKinaseΔFCHFCHmSH2Fibrous formation+-+--Microtubule colocalization+----Microtubule bundling+----Acetylation+----Nucleation++-++Centrosome collapse--+++- Open table in a new tab Aberrant Structure of Centrosome in Fes-deficient Fibroblasts—To determine the physiological relevance of Fes in microtubule dynamics, we compared MEFs derived from wild-type and Fes-deficient mice. Light microscopic analysis indicated that Fes-deficient cells were smaller than wild-type fibroblasts (not shown). These Fes–/– and Fes+/+ MEFs were labeled with anti-acetylated tubulin Ab, and the structures of centrosome were compared. In contrast to wild-type, Fes-deficient cells displayed an aberrant centrosome structure with unbundling and disoriented filaments of acetylated microtubules. Furthermore, in Fes-deficient cells, the immunofluorescence signals for acetylated microtubules were significantly decreased and microtubule bundling was also severely inhibited. We examined microtubule nucleation in these cells further by γ-tubulin immunostaining. Normal microtubule nucleation colocalized with γ-tubulin was observed in control cells, but microtubule nucleation and centrosome were not normally developed in Fes-deficient cells (Fig. 3A, right panels). These phenotypes were commonly observed in almost all MEFs derived from three independent Fes-deficient mice. Furthermore, the transfection of FLAG-tagged Fes into Fes-deficient cell restored the normal structure of centrosome with oriented and bundled acetylated microtubules (Fig. 3B). This experiment was performed independently three times, and similar results were obtained. Thus, these results suggested that Fes was required for normal microtubule formation. We examined whether these abnormal microtubule structures observed in Fes-deficient cells were due to an indirect effect such as cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 3C, analysis using focal adhesion and F-actin staining showed no significant difference between wild-type and Fes-deficient cells. In addition, confocal laser microscopy scanning along the z axis revealed similar morphology between wild-type and Fes-deficient cells. These results suggested that abnormal microtubule formation of Fes-deficient cells was not due to cell adhesion. However, these findings cannot completely deny the indirect effect. Although an abnormal microtubule structure was detected in cultured Fes-deficient cells, Fes-deficient mice have been reported to be born and developed normally without any obvious defects (15.Hackenmiller R. Kim J. Feldman R.A. Simon M.C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Biochemical microtubule assembly analysis using brain lysates of wild-type and Fes-deficient mice did not show a significant change in microtubule polymerization activity. Since Fer is known as another member of Fes family PTKs, one possibility is that Fer may play a redundant role in microtubule dynamics during development of Fes-deficient mice. Generation of Fes and Fer double deficient mice will answer that question and reveal the physiological importance of this PTK family. Role for Fes in Neural Development—Transgenic mice overexpressing v-Fps showed a neurological disorder that included a striking bilateral enlargement of the trigeminal nerves (3.Yee S.P. Mock D. Maltby V. Silver M. Rossant J. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result suggested an important role for Fes in neural differentiation and growth. In our previous works, Fes was found to be associated with CRMP/CRAM and involved in semaphoring-mediated signaling during neural development (4.Inatome R. Tsujimura T. Hitomi T. Mitsui N. Hermann P.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that CRMP-2 binds to tubulin heterodimers and promotes microtubule assembly (16.Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Menager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Thus, both Fes and CRMPs are closely involved in microtubule dynamics. A previous report (17.Brandt R. Lee G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggested that conditions that stabilize microtubules could lead to bundle formation and allow microtubule assembly by a mechanism different from that employed by microtubule-associated proteins. This means that additional mechanisms besides the action of tau on tubulin exist to organize microtubules in the axon. One attractive hypothesis is that Fes and CRMP/CRAM may play a role in microtubule nucleation, serving as microtubule organizing center during neuronal development. In summary, our findings demonstrated that Fes is involved in microtubule nucleation through FCH domain and that FCH domain is required for normal formation of microtubule nucleation and centrosome. Further studies will be needed to characterize the mechanism of microtubule dynamics mediated by Fes. We are very grateful to Dr. D. Job for providing anti-detyrosinated tubulin Ab and to Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W2048025224,"In pituitary cells, transcriptional regulation of the prolactin (PRL) gene and prolactin secretion are controlled by multiple transduction pathways through the activation of G protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. In the somatolactotrope GH4C1 cell line, we have previously identified crosstalk between the MAPKinase cascade ERK1/2 and the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway after the activation of the VPAC2 receptor by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP38). In the present study, we focus on the involvement of the GTPases Ras and Rap1 as downstream components of signal transmission initiated by activation of the VPAC2 receptor. By using pull-down experiments, we show that VIP and PACAP38 preferentially activate Rap1, whereas thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) mainly activate Ras GTPase. Experiments involving the expression of the dominant-negative mutants of Ras and Rap1 signaling (RasN17 or Rap1N17) indicate that both GTPases Ras and Rap1 are recruited for the ERK activation by VIP and PACAP38, whereas Rap1 is poorly involved in TRH or EGF-induced ERK activation. The use of U0126, a selective inhibitor of MAPKinase kinase, provides evidence that MAPKinase contributes to the regulation of the PRL gene. Moreover, cotransfection of RasN17 or Rap1N17 with the PRL proximal promoter luciferase reporter construct indicates that Rap1 may be responsible for VIP/PACAP-induced activation of the PRL promoter. Interestingly, Ras would be involved as a negative regulator of VIP/PACAP-induced <i>PRL</i> gene activation, in contrast to its stimulatory role in the regulation of the PRL promoter by TRH and EGF."
https://openalex.org/W2079335591,"The REL gene is amplified in many human B-cell lymphomas and we have previously shown that expression of REL from a retroviral vector can malignantly transform chicken spleen cells in vitro. To identify REL protein functions necessary for malignant transformation, we have performed deletion analysis on REL sequences encoding residues of two C-terminal subdomains that are involved in transcriptional activation. We find that deletion of both C-terminal transactivation subdomains abolishes the ability of REL to transform chicken spleen cells in vitro. In contrast, deletion of either transactivation subdomain alone, which reduces the transactivation ability of REL, enhances the transforming activity of REL. Transforming REL mutants missing C-terminal sequences can also be selected at a low frequency in vitro. The REL transactivation domain can be functionally replaced in transformation assays by a portion of the VP16 transactivation domain that activates at a level similar to REL-transforming mutants. We also find that deletion of 29 C-terminal amino acids causes the subcellular localization of REL to change from cytoplasmic to nuclear in chicken embryo fibroblasts. In contrast, wild-type REL and all transforming REL mutants are located primarily in the cytoplasm of transformed spleen cells. Nevertheless, treatment of transformed spleen cells with leptomycin B causes wild-type REL and two REL mutants to relocalize to the nucleus, and nuclear extracts from these transformed cells contain REL DNA-binding activity. Taken together, these results suggest the following: (1) that REL must activate transcription to transform cells in vitro; (2) that a reduced level of transactivation enhances the oncogenicity of REL; (3) that REL shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in transformed chicken spleen cells; and (4) that mutations in REL, in addition to amplifications, could activate its oncogenicity in human lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2103981442,"The O-antigen polysaccharide (OPS) of Rhizobium etli CE3 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is linked to the core oligosaccharide via an N-acetylquinovosaminosyl (QuiNAc) residue. A mutant of CE3, CE166, produces LPS with reduced amounts of OPS, and a suppressed mutant, CE166α, produces LPS with nearly normal OPS levels. Both mutants are deficient in QuiNAc production. Characterization of OPS from CE166 and CE166α showed that QuiNAc was replaced by its 4-keto derivative, 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl-4-ulose. The identity of this residue was determined by NMR and mass spectrometry, and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of its 2-acetamido-4-deutero-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl derivatives produced by reduction of the 4-keto group using borodeuteride. Mass spectrometric and methylation analyses showed that the 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl-4-ulosyl residue was 3-linked and attached to the core-region external Kdo III residue of the LPS, the same position as that of QuiNAc in the CE3 LPS. DNA sequencing revealed that the transposon insertion in strain CE166 was located in an open reading frame whose predicted translation product, LpsQ, falls within a large family of predicted open reading frames, which includes biochemically characterized members that are sugar epimerases and/or reductases.

The bacterial species Rhizobium etli forms a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). During the symbiotic interaction of R. etli with bean, the bacteria eventually penetrate the root nodule cells via a plant-derived infection thread and are, thus, surrounded by the plant plasma membrane upon entering the nodule cell. The R. etli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideOPSO-specific polysaccharideKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acidQuiNAc2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyglucose (N-acetylquinovosamine)3Me6dTal3-O-methyl-6-deoxytaloseSECsize exclusion chromatographyGC-MSgas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryESI-MSelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometryFucfucoseGlcAMemethylglucuronateORFopen reading frame. plays an essential role in the infection of the host cells. Mutants that lack the O-chain polysaccharide (OPS) of the LPS or have reduced amounts of OPS fail to infect the host cells, resulting in root nodules that are devoid of bacteria and are unable to fix nitrogen (1Carlson R.W.

Similar results have also been observed for LPS mutants of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum (for a review, see Ref. 4Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W.

The complete glycosyl sequence of the R. etli parent strain OPS (5Forsberg L.S. Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and core region (6Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Bhat U.R. Bhagyalakshmi S.K. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. The parent OPS consists of exactly five trisaccharide repeating units, composed of one residue each of fucose (Fuc), 3-O-methyl-6-deoxytalose (3Me6dTal), and methylglucuronate (GlcAMe). Considerable structural heterogeneity exists due to variability in the degree of endogenous O-methylation at fucosyl residues and due to partial loss of O-acetyl and methyl ester groups during mild acid hydrolysis or while in solution. As depicted in Fig. 1, the OPS repeating units are “capped” at the nonreducing end by a single residue of tri- or di-O-methylfucose (2,3,4-TOMeFuc or 2,3-DOMeFuc). The repeating unit located toward the proximal end of the OPS is attached to a nonrepeating glycosyl sequence, defined as the outer core region, consisting of fucose, mannose, and N-acetylquinovosamine (QuiNAc) (residues B-D); the QuiNAc residue of this outer core trisaccharide links the OPS repeating units to O-4 of the 3-deoxy-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo) III residue, itself uniquely located at the distal end of the inner core region. A mutant of R. etli CE3 that produces an LPS with reduced amounts of OPS is CE166. This mutant also fails to invade the root nodule cells (8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and analysis of its LPS showed that it lacked QuiNAc (8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The amount of OPS could be restored to nearly normal levels by suppression with multiple copies of a plasmid containing the lpsα region, which contains numerous genes encoding for the synthesis of the OPS but does not contain the gene mutated in CE166. The suppressed mutant, called CE166α, is able to form nitrogen-fixing nodules, but they form more slowly and are more widely dispersed on the host root compared with nodules formed by the parent, CE3 (8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The LPS from CE166α, while nearly normal in amount, also does not contain appreciable levels of QuiNAc (8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggested that QuiNAc, or LPS structural features that require QuiNAc, are essential for normal nodulation of bean. An earlier report by Hrabak et al. (9Hrabak E.M. Urbano M.R. Dazzo F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 697-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that QuiNAc plays a role in the lectin-mediated interaction of R. trifolii with clover. A high level of OPS-containing LPS is essential for symbiotic infection; therefore, the synthesis of QuiNAc could play a role in regulating the level of OPS on the bacterial surface and, thereby, the symbiotic virulence of R. etli CE3. Since QuiNAc is a key glycosyl residue linking the OPS to the core region of the LPS (see Fig. 1), it was not understood how mutant CE166 or CE166α could produce LPS that contained the OPS but lacked QuiNAc. Here we show that in the LPSs from these mutants, QuiNAc is replaced by 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl-4-ulose, a likely biosynthetic precursor of QuiNAc synthesis. Growth of Bacteria—R. etli strain CE3, the Tn5-derived mutant CE166, and the suppressed mutant CE166α were grown in tryptone/yeast extract supplemented with Ca2+ (10Beringer J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 84: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 11Sherwood M.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 71: 351-358Crossref Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at late log/early stationary phase. Isolation of Lipopolysaccharide and the O-specific Polysaccharide—Lipopolysaccharides were extracted using the hot phenol-water procedure, and purified by ribonuclease treatments and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on Sepharose CL-4B as described previously (1Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Carlson R.W. Sanders R.E. Napoli C. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 912-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The OPSs were isolated from the total LPS by mild hydrolysis in 1.0% acetic acid at 105 °C for 2 h. The hydrolysates were subjected to freeze/thawing (three repetitions), and the precipitated lipid A was removed by ultracentrifugation at 160,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants, containing the solubilized O-polysaccharide and the core region oligosaccharides, were passed through a column of polymyxin-agarose to remove remaining traces of free lipid A and intact LPS (6Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The flow-through eluants were then chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-10 (45-90-μm fine, 1.5 × 90 cm) in 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 6.5, to separate the O-polysaccharides from the core oligosaccharides. Analysis of Glycosyl Residues—Carbohydrate compositions of OPS and derived fractions were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (electron impact) analysis of the trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides (13York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar) using a 30-meter DB-5 fused silica capillary column (J&W Scientific). Carbohydrate identities of neutral and amino sugars and the location of endogenous O-methyl groups were determined by GC-MS analysis of the alditol acetates, using a 30-meter SP-2330 capillary column (Supelco) (13York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Carboxylated glycosyl residues, and those containing keto functions, were also analyzed as the alditol acetates, requiring separate reduction steps in a specific sequence: 1) prereduction of OPS at the C-2 ketosidic position of terminal Kdo residues, using NaBD4 in dilute NH4OH, yielding the diastereomeric alditols; 2) normal acid hydrolysis (2 m trifluoroacetic acid, 105 °C, 3 h) to cleave all glycosidic linkages and cause formation of the Kdo 1,4-lactone (14York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 138: 109-126Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), reduction at C-1 of the Kdo lactone using NaBD4 in water (14York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 138: 109-126Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar), followed by reduction of all remaining glycosyl anomeric centers with excess NaBD4; 4) methyl esterification of uronic acids (and other remaining carboxylated sugars) using 0.2 m methanolic HCl at 80 °C for 30 min; 5) reduction of methyl-esterified sugars with NaBD4 in water; 6) peracetylation. Using this multistep procedure, reduction at C-4 of 4-hexulose residues was most efficient, presumably due to the use of three separate reduction steps. Results described below indicate that prereduction (step 1), prior to acid hydrolysis and alditol acetate preparation, may be the major factor leading to efficient C-4 reduction of the acid-labile 4-hexulose residues. During the preparation of alditol acetates by the normal procedure, with only one reduction step following acid hydrolysis, the yield of C-4 deuterated derivatives was barely detectable. For glycosidic linkage analysis, OPS samples were prereduced with NaBD4 prior to methylation in order to stabilize the reducing end residue. Subsequently, Kdo and uronic acid linkages were identified by sequential permethylation (Hakomori method), reduction of carboxymethyl groups with lithium triethylborodeuteride (Aldrich), remethylation (Hakomori), mild hydrolysis (0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 30 min) to cleave any internal ketosidic linkages, reduction (NaBD4), normal hydrolysis (2 m trifluoroacetic acid, 121 °C, 2 h), conversion to the partially methylated alditol acetates (13York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), and GC-MS analysis. OPS samples that were not prereduced prior to methylation failed to yield any Kdo derivatives (due to alkaline degradation of the reducing end Kdo residues) and also showed low yields of C-4 deuterium incorporation into the 4-hexulosyl residue. Chemical Modifications—De-O-acetylation of O-polysaccharides was performed in 10% aqueous NH4OH at 23 °C for 5 h. The progress of the reaction was followed by 1H NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Total β-elimination (depolymerization) was performed on portions of the native or de-O-acetylated OPS as follows. The polysaccharide (8-30 mg) was reduced with NaBD4 (10 mg/3 ml of 0.3 m NH4OH) overnight to stabilize the reducing end glycosyl residue and then methyl-esterified by treating three times with methanol containing 1-2 drops of aqueous 1 m HCl and evaporating to dryness. The fully esterified polysaccharide was then treated with aqueous NaOH (0.25 m, 38 °C, 18 h), and the products were chromatographed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) (1.5 × 92 cm) in water, or on a Superdex-Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm NH4HCO3. Column eluants were monitored by refractive index and for the presence of Δ4,5 hexuronosyl residues by measuring the absorbance at 232 nm. Fractions containing oligosaccharides were combined and analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and GC-MS. Identification of OPS Reducing End Residue by Reduction with Borodeuteride—The glycosyl residue located at the reducing end of the various OPS fractions was identified by reduction, using borodeuteride in NH4OH as described above, followed by normal hydrolysis and peracetylation as described. Derivatives were analyzed using the SP-2330 column. This procedure yields the α/β peracetates of all internal residues and the deuterated alditol acetate of the reducing end residue. Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS was performed on a SCIEX API-III triple quadrapole mass analyzer (PE/SCIEX, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) operated in the positive ion mode with an orifice potential of 35-50 V (5Forsberg L.S. Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Spectra are the accumulation of 10-60 scans collected over the m/z range 200-2400 with a mass step of 0.2-1.0 atomic mass units at 1 ms/step. OPS were desodiated by dialysis, followed by treatment with a strong cation exchange resin (H+ form), and then filtered using 0.45-μm nylon spin filters and stored in polypropylene tubes. Underivatized samples were analyzed at a concentration of 2 μg/μl with a flow rate of 3-5 μl/min using a solution of 15% (v/v) methanol in deionized water containing 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid. The predicted molecular weights of the various OPSs and derived oligosaccharides were calculated using the following average incremental mass values, based on the atomic weights of the elements: hexose, 162.1424; hexuronic acid, 176.1259; 4-deoxyhex-4-enopyranosiduronic acid, 158.1106; Kdo, 220.1791; anhydro-Kdo, 202.1638; 6-deoxyhexose, 146.1430; mono-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 160.1699; di-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 174.1968; tri-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 188.2236; 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexose, 187.1955; 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl-4-ulose, 185.1796; O-acetyl, 42.0373; free reducing end, 18.0153. NMR Spectroscopy—Proton NMR spectra of the native and de-O-acylated OPS samples were recorded at 35 °C in D2O at 2 mg/ml. Spectra were recorded on a Varian 500-MHz spectrometer using the Varian software. DNA Cloning and Sequence Determination—The 10.3-kb EcoRI fragment of CE166 DNA carrying the Tn5 insertion was cloned in vector pBlueScriptKS- (pBKS) (Stratagene). This plasmid (pET166) was digested with BamHI to allow separate subcloning of the inverted repeats at the termini of Tn5 and the rhizobial DNA connected to each Tn5 terminus. p166LK is a religated (circularized) BamHI fragment from pET166 carrying most of the pBKS and 2.0 kb of rhizobial DNA connected to the Km resistance-conferring half of Tn5. Plasmid p166RS is pBKS in which the BamHI site carries 1.2 kb of rhizobial DNA connected to the other half of the Tn5 from pET166. Sequencing of these subcloned rhizobial DNA fragments was carried out by the Sanger method at the University of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI) and the Medical College of Wisconsin sequencing facilities. Primers included sequences near each end of pBKS, near the ends of Tn5, and nucleotide stretches revealed in the rhizobial DNA. Only sequences that were verified by multiple overlapping sequencing runs are reported here. Construction of Plasmids pJBQ2 and pJBQ3, Which Complement Allele lpsQ166—A 1.7-kb stretch of DNA that included the lpsQ ORF was amplified by PCR, using CE3 DNA as template. The forward primer was 5′-TTCATCAGGTCTCACATGCA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTTCACTTCGGTACTGTTCG-3′. The resulting PCR product was ligated into plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), yielding plasmid pJBQ1. It was then subcloned into plasmid vectors pFAJ1700 (to give pJBQ2) and pFAJ1708 (to give pJBQ3). These vectors can be transferred to and replicate in R. etli (15Dombrecht B. Vanderleyden J. Michiels J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). pJBQ2 was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment from pJBQ1 into the EcoRI site of pFAJ1700. The lpsQ PCR product cloned in pJBQ3 was inserted in pFAJ1708 following digestion of both pJBQ1 and pFAJ1708 by enzymes XbaI and SacI such that the lpsQ ORF would be transcribed downstream of the nptII promoter of pFAJ1708. Plasmids pJBQ2 and pJBQ3 were transferred from E. coli INVαF′ cells into strain CE166 in mating mixtures containing E. coli MT616 and Tra+ mobilizer plasmid pRK600 (16Finan T.M. Kunkel B. De Vos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NMR Analyses and Initial Comparison of the Parent and Mutant Strain O-polysaccharides—Evaluation of the glycosyl composition of the three different OPSs using standard derivatization procedures (trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides and alditol acetates of neutral and amino sugars) gave results consistent with previous analyses (5Forsberg L.S.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), showing that the OPSs from mutants CE166 and CE166α were greatly diminished in QuiNAc (residue B in Fig. 1) compared with the parent strain CE3. The finding of detectable levels of QuiNAc in these preparations differed somewhat from results previously reported for CE166 OPS in which QuiNAc was essentially undetectable (accounting for <5% of parent strain levels) (6Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NMR analysis of the OPSs (Fig. 2) showed that the ratio of O-acetyl to N-acetyl methyl protons of the CE166 OPS was approximately the same as that of the parent; 4.4 versus 4.0. A similar ratio was observed for the CE166α OPS (not shown). These results, together with the greatly decreased level of QuiNAc, suggested that both mutant OPSs contained an unidentified glycosyl residue that, like QuiNAc, carries an N-acetyl group. Molecular Size of the Parent and Mutant Strain O-polysaccharides—ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 3) indicated that all three of the OPSs (as released from LPS by mild acid hydrolysis) have a similar molecular mass, each yielding several families of multiply charged ions. In Fig. 3A, the parent strain OPS yields two doubly charged ion families (I and II, from high to lower mass, respectively), which differ by 202 mass units (Δ m/z = 101), reflecting partial loss of an anhydro-Kdo residue from the reducing terminus of the O-chain. As previously reported (5Forsberg L.S. Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), this loss occurs in approximately one-third of the OPS molecules during the mild hydrolytic step and is a function of hydrolysis time. Based on the observed mass differences and the known structure of the parent OPS (5Forsberg L.S. Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), family I ions should consist of molecules terminating in anhydro-Kdo, and family II ions should consist of molecules terminating in QuiNAc. In Fig. 3B, these two ion families were again observed for the CE166 OPS, together with a third ion family (III) not observed in the parent OPS. This new, doubly charged ion family was also observed in the CE166α OPS spectrum (not shown). A predominant mass difference between representative ions from family II and family III is 187 mass units (Δ m/z = 93.5), suggesting the loss of a QuiNAc residue. Thus, family II ions are consistent with the structure R → Fuc → Man → QuiNAc (where R represents OPS repeating units plus capping residue; see Fig. 1), and family III ions are consistent with an R → Fuc → Man structure. For the mutant samples, the presence of QuiNAc-containing structures was somewhat unexpected, since these OPSs contained greatly reduced levels of QuiNAc. However, as stated above, the NMR spectrum indicated that the level of N-acetyl groups in the mutant OPS was very similar to that in the parent OPS, suggesting that the mutant contained an unidentified component, “X,” which was N-acetylated. Aside from variations arising from O-acetyl and methyl group content, the similar m/z values of the mutant OPS ions with those of the parent imply that compound X would have a mass very similar to that of QuiNAc. If this were the case, then the mutant group I ions would consist of a mixture of R → Fuc → Man → QuiNAc → anhydro-Kdo and R → Fuc → Man → X → anhydro-Kdo components, and the group II ions would arise from the structures R → Fuc → Man → QuiNAc and R → Fuc → Man → X, assuming that X was a direct replacement for the QuiNAc residue. One explanation for the existence of the group III ions in the mutant spectra is that the unidentified component is somewhat labile to the mild acid hydrolysis conditions and is partially removed during this procedure. A second possibility is that the mutant is able to form an R → Fuc → Man → Kdo sequence rather than the normal R → Fuc → Man → QuiNAc → Kdo due, for example, to the direct addition of Man II to Kdo III (residues A and C in Fig. 1) by the inner core LpcC mannosyl transferase. If this were the case, then, considering the specificity of LpcC, the Man II residue would be linked to O-5 of Kdo III. However, methylation analysis (not shown) showed that the mutant OPS contained only the expected 4-linked Kdo, making it unlikely that LpcC adds a Man to Kdo III. Identification of 2-Acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl-4-ulose—The NMR and mass spectrometry data suggested that the mutant OPSs contained an unidentified, N-acetylated component, having a mass very similar to that of QuiNAc. As stated above, composition analyses using standard derivatization procedures failed to reveal any significant differences among the polysaccharides aside from the aforementioned reduction in QuiNAc in both mutant OPSs. Considering the possibility that the unidentified component might also contain a carboxyl or other carbonyl function, in addition to the proposed N-acetyl group, the “carboxyl-reduced” alditol acetates were prepared and analyzed. The results (Table I) confirmed that the OPSs from CE166 and CE166α are greatly diminished in QuiNAc, as expected. Interestingly, a series of new glycosyl residues were observed that were present only in the mutant OPSs. These residues were identified from their mass spectra as structural (configurational) isomers of QuiNAc. The GC-MS profiles and representative spectrum of these components are shown in Fig. 4 and are consistent with alditol acetates of various 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl residues (epimers, having different retention times) each containing a single deuterium atom at C-4. Such residues would result from borodeuteride reduction of a 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexosyl-4-ulose residue. As shown by methylation analysis (see below), the deuterium was located exclusively at C-4 in all epimer derivatives. Thus, nonstereospecific reduction at C-4 would yield both the 4-deuterio-QuiNAc, (confirmed by its mass spectrum and co-chromatography with authentic QuiNAc) and its galacto isomer (N-acetyl-4-deuteriofucosamine). The two remaining C-4-deuterated derivatives are derived from reduction of the 4-ulose C-3 epimer, which most likely results from keto-enol isomerization of the 4-ulose residue prior to or during reduction.Table IGlycosyl composition of R. etli parent and mutant strain O-polysaccharides as determined by GC-MS analysis of the derived, carboxyl-reduced, alditol acetatesGlycosyl residueMolar ratioaRatios normalized to Man, determined from the GC-MS total ion current peak areas of the alditol acetates with response factor correction from authentic standards.

However, both mutant OPSs contained a series of new derivatives, representing the epimers of the 3-linked QuiNAc residue.

Two proapoptotic domains are relevant for Grim killing function; the N-terminal region, which induces apoptosis by disrupting inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) blockage of caspase activity, and the internal GH3 domain, which triggers a mitochondrial pathway. We explored the role of these two domains in heterologous killing of mammalian cells by Grim. The GH3 domain is essential for Grim proapoptotic activity in mouse cells, whereas the N-terminal domain is dispensable. The GH3 domain is required and sufficient for Grim targeting to mitochondria and for cytochrome c release in a caspase- and N-terminal-independent, IAP-insensitive manner. These Grim GH3 activities do not require Bax or Bak function, revealing GH3 activity as the first proapoptotic stimulus able to trigger the mitochondrial death pathway in mammalian cells in the absence of multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.

Multicellular organisms eliminate unwanted or damaged cells by cell death, a process essential in shaping embryonic structures, maintaining adult tissue homeostasis, and eliminating damaged cells. Most cell death processes are executed through a defined pattern of cellular and biochemical events known as apoptosis (1.Green D.R.

Genetic analysis of programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans identified essential elements of the basic machinery for the regulation and execution phases of apoptotic death and revealed their conservation among metazoans (4.Metzstein M.M. Stanfield G.M. Horvitz H.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thereafter, endogenous and viral molecules that promote, inhibit, or are required for apoptosis have been found conserved from nematodes to humans (5.Aravind L. Dixit V.M. Koonin E.V. Science. 2001; 291: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this scheme, mitochondria play a central role, integrating death signals and mediating apoptosis induction by releasing cytochrome c and other proteins that activate the death program (6.Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). Studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster have uncovered four essential components of the genetic program controlling cell death, reaper, hid, sickle, and grim, whose transcriptional activation precedes, induces and is necessary for programmed cell death by apoptosis (7.Chen P.

The four genes map to a single genetic complex and function as death switches that are regulated mainly at the transcriptional level, although Hid is also regulated through phosphorylation by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (13.Bergmann A.

Flies deficient in DIAP1 suffer massive apoptosis early in development, suggesting that relief of the IAP protective effect could be sufficient for Reaper, Hid, Sickle, and Grim to trigger cell death (24.Wang S.L.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Whereas Hid requires the N-terminal domain to induce cell death efficiently in cultured cells (20.Haining W.N. Carboy-Newcomb C.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An additional Grim internal region, the GH3 domain, conserved in Reaper, Sickle, and Grim, has been identified as essential for Grim proapoptotic function in flies (19.Clavería C. Caminero E. Martínez A.C. Campuzano S. Torres M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3327-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to the N-terminal Grim domain, the GH3 domain promotes Grim mitochondrial targeting in fly cells and triggers a death pathway that involves changes in cytochrome c display. The GH3 domain is predicted to conform an amphipathic α-helix whose alteration leads to impaired Grim killing ability. In vertebrates, members of the Bcl-2 homology group comprising both pro- and antiapoptotic molecules play a central role in regulating mitochondrial-mediated cell death (29.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). Of the four homology blocks found among the Bcl-2 family members, the BH3 domain appears essential for the function of the proapoptotic members. For some of these, BH3 is the only domain shared with the rest of the family (30.Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and its amphipathic α-helical structure is an essential feature, required for its biological activity. Recent studies in cells from mice deficient in both Bax and Bak (DKO) demonstrated that BH3-only proteins are unable to kill cells in the absence of Bax and Bak multidomain proapoptotic proteins (31.Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 32.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.

Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In this scenario, BH3-only proteins appear to function as programmed cell death initiators that bind to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in response to proapoptotic stimuli. This binding would allow conformational change, membrane integration, and aggregation of Bax/Bak proteins, responsible for release of cytochrome c and other proteins from mitochondria to the cytosol. Moreover, DKO cells are resistant to all proapoptotic stimuli tested that act through the mitochondrial death pathway (32.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J.

Our results show that GH3 activity is conserved in evolution, triggering a mitochondrial-cytochrome c death pathway in mammalian cells, whereas the N-terminal domain appears irrelevant for Grim killing activity in this context. Furthermore, Grim-induced mitochondrial death pathway is independent of Bax and Bak function, identifying Grim as the first molecule able to trigger this pathway in mammalian cells in the absence of both multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.

WT bad and the mutant forms were cloned in the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) using NotI and BamHI sites, and the sequence was confirmed. The truncated mouse Bid form (tBid) was PCR-amplified from mouse embryo cDNA using 5′-CTCTCTCTGCGGCCGCCATGGGCAGCCAGGCCAGCCG-3′ and 5′-GCTCGGATCCTCAGTCCATCTCGTTTCTAACC-3′ primers, which introduced NotI and BamHI sites; it was cloned in the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector using these sites, and the sequence was confirmed. Cell Culture and Death Assays—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For Grim mutants death assays, cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (control) or pcDNA3.1-grim (WT or mutants) expression vector (19.Clavería C. Caminero E. Martínez A.C. Campuzano S. Torres M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3327-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), together with pcDNA3.1-lacZ expression vector at a 2:1 molar ratio. After 30 h, cells were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, washed in PBS, and X-gal-stained following standard protocols. For Bad mutants death assays, cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (control) or pcDNA3.1-bad (WT or mutants) expression vector together with pcDNA3.1-lacZ expression vector at a 2:1 molar ratio. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, washed in PBS, and X-gal-stained as above. WT and bax-/-bak-/- (DKO) simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured as described previously (32.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V.

After 30 h, cells were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, washed in PBS, and X-gal-stained as above. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—To test the stability of the Grim protein and its mutant forms, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or pcDNA3.1-grim (WT or mutants) expression vector. Cells were treated with 50 μm zVAD-fmk (Bachem) and, after 20 h, they were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer with freshly added protease inhibitors, then proteins were eluted and analyzed in SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analyses were performed using rabbit anti-grim IgG (18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and HPR-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or pcDNA3.1-grim (WT or mutants) expression vector together with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or pcDNA-6myc-hNAIP expression vector at a 1:1 molar ratio. Cells were treated with 50 μm zVAD-fmk, and, after 24 h, they were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 isotonic lysis buffer with freshly added protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with an affinity-purified fraction of rabbit anti-Grim IgG or with a mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (overnight, 4 °C), mixed with 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Gammabind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated (45 min, 4 °C). The Sepharose beads were washed twice in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, once in 0.25 m LiCl washing buffer, and twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, washing buffer before proteins were eluted and analyzed in SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analyses were performed using rabbit anti-grim IgG and protein G-HPR conjugate (Bio-Rad) or mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako), then developed by ECL. Immunofluorescence—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in microscope slide chambers (Cultek) and transfected with pcDNA3.1-grim (WT or mutants) or pcDNA3.1-bad (WT or mutants) expression vector. When indicated, cells were treated with 100 μm zVAD-fmk. After 24 h, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (15 min, room temperature), and washed three times in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min, washed three times in PBS, preincubated in 10% goat serum/0.1% Tween 20/PBS for 1 h, and incubated successively with the primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h each, with three 5-min washes in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS between incubations. Grim was detected with rabbit anti-grim IgG, mitochondria were detected with human anti-mitochondrial serum (18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M.

Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488, goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3, goat anti-human IgG-Cy3, biotinylated goat anti-human IgG, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin-Cy5 (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch). MitoTracker staining was performed by incubating cells with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) before fixing, as recommended by the manufacturer. Optical sections were obtained using an Ar-Kr laser and TCS-NT Leica confocal imaging systems. For the Bax conformational change assay, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), pcDNA3.1-grim, or pcDNA3.1-tBid expression vector, this last together with pEGFP-C1 expression vector at a 2:1 molar ratio. Cells were treated with 100 μm zVAD-fmk (22 h), then washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (15 min, room temperature), and washed three times in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS (15 min) and immunofluorescence was performed as described. Anti-Grim antibody was biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation kit (Pierce), and was used to detect Grim in this assay. Bax was detected with anti-Bax NT rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), and cytochrome c as described above. Secondary antibodies used were NeutrAvidin-Alexa 488, goat anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3, and goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy5 (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch). WT and DKO SV40-transformed MEF were cultured in microscope slide chambers and transfected with rtTA-grim expression vector (18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After lipofection, cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of doxycycline and 100 μm zVAD-fmk, and after 24 h, cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described. The GH3 Domain Is Essential for Grim Proapoptotic Function in Mammalian Cells—We recently described the GH3 domain as essential for Grim proapoptotic activity in flies (19.Clavería C. Caminero E. Martínez A.C. Campuzano S. Torres M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3327-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested whether GH3 integrity was a requisite for its conserved activity in mouse 3T3 cells. As previously described (18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), wild type (WT) Grim induced cell death when overexpressed in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). In contrast, a Grim mutant form with a 13-amino acid deletion that removes the GH3 domain (Δ86-98, Fig. 1A) only marginally induced apoptosis in this assay (Fig. 1B). A 5′-shifted 11-amino acid deletion, such that the 3′ part of the domain is preserved (Δ83-93, Fig. 1A), was less effective in eliminating the proapoptotic activity than complete GH3 deletion (Fig. 1B). The elimination of four internal amino acids common to the two larger deletions (Δ89-92, Fig. 1A) also resulted in effective impairment of Grim killing ability (Fig. 1B). The consequences of removing these regions are similar to those observed in assays in cultured Drosophila SL2 cells and transgenic flies (19.Clavería C. Caminero E. Martínez A.C. Campuzano S. Torres M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3327-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, point mutations in the GH3 domain that alter Grim activity in flies similarly affect Grim activity in mouse cells. A nonconservative replacement of Leu-89 by glutamic acid (L89E, Fig. 1A) impaired GH3 killing ability nearly to the level of the Δ89-92 mutant (Fig. 1B), whereas a semi-conservative replacement of Leu-89 by alanine (L89A, Fig. 1A) had only a mild effect on Grim proapoptotic function (Fig. 1B). These results show that, as in the fly, the GH3 domain is required for Grim proapoptotic function in mouse cells and that the residues relevant for GH3-mediated killing in flies are equally important for its conserved activity in mammalian cells. Because residual proapoptotic function was observed even in the most extreme case of Grim function impairment, we tested whether the conserved N-terminal domain was responsible for the residual killing activity. As reported (18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain was unnecessary for Grim killing in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (Δ2-14, Fig. 1B). Combinations of the N-terminal deletion with either the complete GH3 deletion (Δ2-14, Δ86-98) or the internal four-amino acid deletion (Δ2-14, Δ89-92) did not further reduce Grim function (Fig. 1B). We therefore could not demonstrate a proapoptotic function for the N-terminal domain in this context. Deletion of the GH3 domain, alone or in combination with the N-terminal domain deletion, did not compromise Grim ability to bind mammalian, viral, or insect IAPs (Fig. 2 and not shown). Furthermore, IAPs only show a residual rescue capacity of Grim killing activity in mouse cells (Ref. 18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and not shown), suggesting an IAP-independent mechanism of action for the GH3 domain. This conclusion is also validated by the fact that GH3-induced proapoptotic events are independent of caspase activity (see below), which would not be the case for an IAP-dependent pathway. We conclude that the proapoptotic activity of the GH3 domain is required for Grim function in mammalian cells and is not related to an IAP-inhibitory pathway, whereas N-terminal domain function does not appear to be essential in this context. Grim Targets Mitochondria and Induces Cytochrome c Release in Mammalian Cells—We previously showed that Grim localizes diffusely in the cytoplasm of preapoptotic mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and progressively colonizes mitochondria as apoptosis progresses (18.Clavería C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martínez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To identify the mechanism involved in Grim cell killing in mammalian cells, we tested for cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) state in 3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing Grim. We found that cytochrome c was undetectable in mitochondria of the large majority of cells expressing Grim (Fig. 3, A-D). This Grim-induced cytochrome c release is unaffected by the presence of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. 3, E-H) or p35 coexpression (not shown). Cytochrome c release was detected in Grim-expressing cells in which no other symptom of apoptosis was observed. In contrast, most Grim-transfected cells retain MMP, as measured by MitoTracker incorporation (Fig. 3, I-L). Conservation of MMP extends into apoptosis progression, when changes in cell shape and organelle distribution have already taken place (Fig. 3, I-L). MMP loss was only observed in cells in which the apoptotic process was very advanced (not shown). To confirm that cytochrome c release preceded MMP loss, we stained simultaneously with the cytochrome c antibody and MitoTracker and observed that most Grim-expressing cells retained MMP but had released cytochrome c, whereas the reverse was never found (Fig. 3, M-P). These results show that in mammalian cells cytochrome c release is the first Grim-induced proapoptotic event and that it does not require the previous activation of cytosolic caspases; MMP loss occurs later as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction or advanced apoptosis. The GH3 Domain Is Required for Grim Targeting to Mitochondria and Cytochrome c Release in Mammalian Cells—Because the GH3 domain triggers a mitochondrial death pathway in flies, we tested the involvement of the GH3 domain in the mitochondrial changes induced by Grim in mammalian cells. Complete or partial elimination of the GH3 domain, or even the L89E substitution, abolished mitochondrial localization (Fig. 4, C and E and not shown) and cytochrome c release (Fig. 4, D and F, and not shown). In all cases, however, the subcellular distribution of the mutant proteins was not diffuse, but concentrated in prominent cytoplasmic dots (Fig. 4, C-F). In contrast, the Δ2-14 mutant, which did not appreciably impair Grim function in cultured cells, retained mitochondrial localization and provoked cytochrome c release (Fig. 4, G and H). Furthermore, NAIP or OpIAP coexpression does not impair the ability of Grim or any of its mutant proteins to induce apoptosis or to release cytochrome c in 3T3 cells (not shown). The L89A Grim mutant, which showed slightly reduced proapoptotic activity, displayed mitochondrial staining and induced cytochrome c release, although in a lower proportion of transfected cells than that observed for WT Grim, suggesting that greater concentrations of the mutant protein were required to achieve funct"

Unlike animal mucin-type glycans, those of some microbial eukaryotes are initiated by α-linked GlcNAc rather than α-GalNAc. Based on sequence similarity to a recently cloned soluble polypeptide hydroxyproline GlcNAc-transferase that modifies Skp1 in the cytoplasm of the social ameba Dictyostelium, we have identified an enzyme, polypeptide α-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (pp α-GlcNAc-T2), that attaches GlcNAc to numerous secretory proteins in this organism. Unlike the Skp1 GlcNAc-transferase, pp α-GlcNAc-T2 is predicted to be a type 2 transmembrane protein. A highly purified, soluble, recombinant fragment of pp α-GlcNAc-T2 efficiently transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to synthetic peptides corresponding to mucin-like domains in two proteins that traverse the secretory pathway. pp α-GlcNAc-T2 is required for addition of GlcNAc to peptides in cell extracts and to the proteins in vivo. Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation analyses show that pp α-GlcNAc-T2 attaches GlcNAc in α-linkage to the Thr residues of all the synthetic mucin repeats. pp α-GlcNAc-T2 is encoded by the previously described modB locus defined by chemical mutagenesis, based on sequence analysis and complementation studies. This finding establishes that the many phenotypes of modB mutants, including a permeability defect in the spore coat, can now be ascribed to defects in mucin-type O-glycosylation. A comparison of the sequences of pp α-GlcNAc-T2 and the animal pp α-GalNAc-transferases reveals an ancient common ancestry indicating that, despite the different N-acetylhexosamines involved, the enzymes share a common mechanism of action.

These intriguing observations suggest that O-glycosylation supports many functions in Dictyostelium, but, until the function of the modB gene is determined, it is not clear whether the phenotypes are caused by the glycosylation defect or whether they are all pleiotropic effects resulting from a separate lesion.Recently, the gene that encodes the enzyme that transfers GlcNAc to a hydroxyproline residue in the cytoplasmic/nuclear protein Skp1 of Dictyostelium was identified (23Teng-umnuay P. van der Wel H.

Although this linkage involves a distinct acceptor hydroxyamino acid and the enzyme resides in the cytoplasm rather than the Golgi apparatus, its sequence exhibits homology with those of the animal pp α-GalNAc-Tases (25West C.M. van der Wel H. Gaucher E.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26West C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification and characterization of a related Dictyostelium pp α-GlcNAc-Tase that is be expressed in the secretory pathway and initiates the O-glycosylation of SP29 and the spore coat protein SP85/PsB. This pp α-GlcNAc-Tase, referred to as pp α-GlcNAc-T2, is encoded by the classically defined modB locus demonstrating that modB mutations directly target the first step of mucin-type O-glycosylation. These findings establish a functional role for mucin-type O-glycosylation in Dictyostelium, and suggest that pp α-GlcNAc-T2, and sequences related to it in other microbes (26West C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) comprise a microbial lineage of Golgi pp α-GlcNAc-Tases that shares a common evolutionary origin with the animal Golgi pp α-GalNAc-Tases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCellsStrain Ax3, an axenic mutant of D. discoideum, was used as the normal reference strain. DL118(H) is an axenic, spontaneously haploidized derivative of the original diploid strain DL118, which carries the chemically mutagenized modB mutant allele from HL220 (16Murray B.A. Wheeler S. Jongens T. Loomis W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17West C.M. Loomis W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13801-13809Google Scholar). HU2421 is a non-axenic strain also carrying the HL220 modB allele (28Bowers-Morrow V.M. Ali S.O. Williams K.L. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). HW11 is an axenic strain that carries a modB mutant allele, which appears to partially retain function (29West C.M. Brownstein S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cis4c is a cisplatin-resistant strain (27Li G. Alexander H. Schneider N. Alexander S. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that contains an insertion of the bsr- marker in the cis4c(gntB) gene described in this report. This gene was originally described as having similarity to the kinase domain of a putative phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase from Arabidopsis. These strains are each haploid.Cell ExtractsExponentially growing cells were harvested at ≤8 × 106/ml from HL-5 growth medium (30Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min, washed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and frozen as pellets at -80 °C. Stationary phase cells were collected similarly after cells reached maximal density in HL-5 for 1 day. Aggregation, slug, and fruiting body stage cells were obtained by depositing washed growth phase cells on non-nutrient agar plates (30Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); developing for 8, 12-15, or 30 h, respectively; scraping; and storing at -80 °C. Particulate extracts were prepared by resuspending frozen cell pellets in ice-cold Sucrose Buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MnCl2, and protease inhibitors (see below). Suspended cells were sonicated using a probe for two 10-s pulses at 10 watts, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended at 6 × 108 original cells/ml in 0.2% (v/v) Tween 80 in Sucrose Buffer using light probe sonication.Sequencing the cis4c(gntB) LocusThe ClaI-ClaI fragment of the cis4c locus (see Figs. 1 and 2A) had been cloned previously (27Li G. Alexander H. Schneider N. Alexander S. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences from this fragment were used to query data bases containing sequences from shotgun-cloned Dictyostelium gDNA fragment for overlapping sequences, accessible via the DictyBase World Wide Web Server (dictybase.org/dicty.html). An alignment of these sequences led to the predicted pp α-GlcNAc-T2 coding region. This sequence was confirmed by PCR amplification of gDNA using predicted oligonucleotide primers from the data base-derived alignment as described under “Results.” Sequences of mutant alleles were determined similarly.Fig. 2Schematic diagram of pp α-GlcNAc-T2 DNA and protein expression constructs.A, predicted exons and coding region of cis4c(gntB) DNA.

Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pVS4 contains a start codon followed by the celA cleavable signal peptide, which was used previously to direct the secretion of CelA from growing cells (31Ramalingam R. Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and spore coat proteins from prespore cells (30Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a neophosphotransferase gene enabling growth in the presence of G418. The expression plasmids were electroporated into strain DL118(H) cells, which were then plated onto 10-cm tissue culture dishes in the presence of 7.5 μg/ml G418 in modified HL-5 growth medium (32West C.M. Zhang P. McGlynn A.C. Kaplan L. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were grown in 120 μg/ml G418 to enrich for higher level expressors, and cloned by plating on Klebsiella aerogenes on SM agar plates. This typically results in selection of clones containing chromosomally integrated tandem arrays of the plasmid (33Shah-Mahoney N. Hampton T. Vidaver R. Ratner D. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Strain HW210, derived from a transfectant using pVS4(gntBEx2) in which the cis4c(gntB) coding region was inserted into the BglII site, was used as a source of recombinant enzyme.GlcNAc-Tase Activity AssayAcceptor peptides were synthesized at the UF ICBR Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory on an ABI 430 peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptide quality was verified by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis and MALDI-TOF-MS. Peptides were purified by preparative HPLC on a C18 column using an ascending gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by vacuum drying.pp α-GlcNAc-T2 activity was assayed by the transfer of [3H]GlcNAc from UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (39.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to synthetic peptides corresponding to repeat sequences in SP85 or SP29 (Table I). The reaction mixture typically contained purified enzyme, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 80, 5 mm MnCl2, UDP-GlcNAc, and acceptor peptide (typically 0.1-1.0 mm), in a total volume of 24 μl, and was incubated at 22 °C for 30-120 min. UDP-GlcNAc was a mixture of 0.1-0.5 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma). The reaction was terminated by dilution to 1 ml with 20 mmsodium pyrophosphate. Incorporation was determined by application onto a 1-ml C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Millipore) under vacuum, washing six times with 5 ml of water, and elution of the peptide with 5 ml of MeOH. The MeOH eluate was collected into a 20 ml scintillation vial, supplemented with 15 ml of Scintiverse scintillation mixture (Fisher), and counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter.Table ISynthetic peptides employed as acceptor substratesPeptide nameSource organismSequenceSP85-peptide-1D. discoideumTQPP TQPP TYPPSP85-peptide-2D. discoideumTYPP TQPP TQPP TYPPSP29-peptide-1D. discoideumTVTP TVTP TVTP TP TNTP NPTP SQTSMucin-peptide-1T. cruziKPPTTTTTTTTKPP Open table in a new tab The assay of the particulate cell extract was similar, except that Tris buffer was used in place of HEPES, and the reaction solution was supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 80. The reaction was terminated by dilution with 1 ml of 10 mm NaEDTA, pH 8.0, in Sucrose Buffer and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was applied to the Sep-Pak as above to measure incorporation into peptide.pH dependence of activity was determined after dilution of the purified enzyme in 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm Trizma base, and 20 mm MES (in place of HEPES alone), which had been adjusted to pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, or 9.0 with HCl or NaOH.Purification of Expressed pp α-GlcNAc-T2Buffers were adjusted to their pH values at 22 °C, filtered, degassed, and stored at 4 °C. Buffer A was composed of 20% (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Buffer B was 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Buffer C was 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise indicated. 1500 ml of an HL-5 culture of strain HW210, grown to 2 × 107 cells/ml, was centrifuged at 1600 g for 5 min to remove cells, and the supernatant was further clarified at 7000 × g for 10 min. (NH4)2SO4 (ultrapure, ICN) was added to a final concentration of 30% saturation with stirring, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min. This process was sequentially repeated by bringing the (NH4)2SO4 concentration of the supernatant to 50, 70, and 90%. The pellets from each step were dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.The 50-70% (NH4)2SO4 cut was adjusted to 20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2.6 × 20 cm phenyl-Sepharose Fast-Flow (high sub) column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer A at 4 °C. The column was washed with Buffer A until the A280 returned to base-line level, and eluted with a descending linear 750-ml gradient of Buffer A to Buffer B. The column was washed with Buffer B until the A280 returned to near base-line level, and a 750-ml ascending linear gradient from 0-70% ethylene glycol in Buffer B, followed by 200 ml of 70% ethylene glycol in Buffer B was then applied.Fractions from the main pp GlcNAc-Tase activity peak from the phenyl-Sepharose column were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer C for 6 h, and load onto a DEAE-5PW column (8 mm ID × 7.5 cm, TSK-GEL, 10 μm) equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was eluted in an ascending gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer at 22 °C at 1 ml/min. The enzymatically active fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Centriplus-30 centrifugal concentrator device (Amicon) at 4 °C, and aliquots were stored at -80 °C.Antibody against pp α-GlcNAc-T2A peptide, LEEDPNQDPSFPNSYC, predicted from the coding region of pp α-GlcNAc-T2 to be surface-exposed, was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to induce an antiserum in rabbits against the full-length protein (Sigma-Genosys). Preimmune serum and serum from the third bleed were used at 1:50 dilution in Western blotting.SDS-PAGE and Western BlottingSamples were suspended or diluted in SDS sample buffer, separated on a freshly prepared 7-20% linear gradient polyacrylamide slab gel, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad semidry blotting apparatus (30Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots in Figs. 3 and 4 were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and the blot in Fig. 9 was blocked using a 1:1 dilution with TBS of Blocking Buffer from Li-Cor (Lincoln, NE). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the respective blocking buffers, and blots were washed using TBS. Secondary antibodies in Figs. 3 and 4 were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (Jackson Laboratories), diluted 1:2000, and detected colorimetrically (30Zhang Y. Zhang P. West C.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4367-4377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody in Fig. 9 was Alexa-Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Li-Cor) diluted 1:10,000, and imaged at 700 nm in a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imager. For Fig. 4, the low Mr standard kit from Sigma was used; for Fig. 9, the BenchMark prestained protein ladder from Invitrogen was used.Fig. 3O-glycosylation of cell surface proteins in mutant cells. Cells from strain Ax3 (normal or wild type (wt)), the cis4c(gntB) mutant, or strain DL118(H) (modB mutant) were developed to the slug stage, harvested, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the mAbs listed below each panel. A, the anti-carbohydrate mAb 16.1 binds SP85 (SP85+) in wild-type cells but not in either cis4c(gntB) or modB mutant cells. B, probing with mAb 5F5, specific for the polypeptide backbone of SP85, shows that SP85 exhibits a lower apparent Mr in both mutant strains (SP85-) compared with normal cells (SP85+). C, probed with a mixture of mAbs 54.2 and 83.5. The anti-carbohydrate mAb 54.2, which binds both SP85 and SP29 (SP29+) in wild-type cells, fails to bind these proteins in the mutant strains. In contrast, the binding of the anti-fucose mAb 83.5, which recognizes many proteins including SP96 and SP75, is not affected in the mutant strains.

We wished to identify effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on vascular smooth muscle cells in distinct phenotypes, such as spindle and epithelioid. We found that the EGF receptors were abundant in epithelioid cells but not spindle cells. EGF treatment inhibited serum-independent DNA synthesis, which was absent in spindle cells, of epithelioid cells. Additionally, using a pulse-chase assay, we found that bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells failed to re-enter the S phase in the presence of EGF. These EGF effects were abolished by either inhibiting the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase with AG1478 or inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with PD98059. In response to treatment with EGF, the EGF receptor was phosphorylated, which was correlated with phosphorylation and activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Inhibition of EGF receptor phosphorylation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation resulted in a reversal of the EGF-induced inhibition of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cell cycle arrest. Subsequent studies revealed that the activation of the EGF receptor and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in epithelioid cells induced expression of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27Kip1 but not p21Cip1. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the EGF receptor is abundantly expressed in epithelioid vascular smooth muscle cells and that the activation of this receptor results in cell cycle arrest through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Both cell types not only contrast themselves in vitro but also in vivo (2Hao H. Gabbiani G. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

It has been proposed that epithelioid VSMCs may be the cell type resulting in the formation of intimal thickening in vivo (2Hao H. Gabbiani G. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to characterize the differential responses of these cells to growth factors. Specifically, we were interested in assessing the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF), which has been identified in a wide range of biological fluids including blood, and its blood concentration is associated with platelet coagulation (10Nexo E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13822-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and inhibits serum-independent growth of these cells. 2Y. Gui and X.-L. Zheng, unpublished observation. The EGF inhibition of cell growth has also been found in several other cell systems, such as MDA468 human breast cancer cells (19Xie W. Su K. Wang D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E.

Therefore, we hypothesized that EGF may differentially affect VSMCs in distinct phenotypes. vascular smooth muscle cell epidermal growth factor EGF receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase bromodeoxyuridine propidium iodide phosphate-buffered saline laser scanning cytometry phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. Activation of EGF receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity is known to trigger various intracellular signaling pathways for different cell responses (25Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 26Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. Exp.

Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The well characterized pathway would be the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (28Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). Although activation of the MAPK pathway may stimulate cell growth or activate the cell cycle, increasing evidence suggests that stimulation of this pathway inhibits cell proliferation or causes cell cycle arrest of even VSMCs (29Bornfeldt K.E. Campbell J.S. Koyama H. Argast G.M. Leslie C.C. Raines E.W. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that EGF may phenotype-specifically regulate the cell cycle through activation of the MAPK pathway. In this report, we present data showing that the EGF receptor (EGFR) is abundantly expressed in epithelioid smooth muscle cells and that EGF stimulation activates the MAPK pathway and induces cell cycle arrest of epithelioid VSMCs. Materials—Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). AG1478, PD98059, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), propidium iodide (PI), mouse monoclonal antibodies for smooth muscle α-actin, and α-tubulin were obtained from Sigma. Anti-MAPK was acquired from Calbiochem. Anti-MAPK (phospho-specific), MAPK assay kit, anti-EGFR, and phospho-specific EGFR antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-p27Kip1 and anti-p21Cip1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-BrdUrd antibodies, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies labeled with Alex Fluor-488 or 647 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell culture medium, RPMI 1640, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Primary Cell Culture, Cell Cloning, and Treatment—Primary culture of VSMCs was carried out using an explant method as described (31Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Briefly, the thoracic aortic tissue derived from male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) was cut into small pieces (1 mm3) and placed on the plastic surface of culture dishes. The tissue explants were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The culture was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The culture medium was changed twice a week during the first 2 weeks, and the cells were usually observed to migrate from tissues between days 4 and 7 after explanting. The islets of outgrowing cells were then trypsinized with a 0.25% trypsin, 0.25 mm EDTA solution (Invitrogen), followed by subculture. The cells were then characterized by detecting the expression of several differentiation marker proteins, such as smooth muscle α-actin and h1-calponin. The cells from passages 6-8 were used for cloning purpose. Spindle and epithelioid VSMCs were cloned using a dilution cloning method as described (32Blaes N. Bourdillon M.C. Daniel-Lamaziere J.M. Michaille J.J. Andujar M. Covacho C. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cloned cells were then examined for typical morphologies and serum dependence of cell growth. For cell starvation, the cultured cells were maintained in the medium containing 0.5% serum for 2 days. The cells were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for the time indicated in the figure legends. For the experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, all of the inhibitors were administrated into the medium 30 min before the addition of EGF. Staining for Incorporated BrdUrd in Nuclei—VSMCs cultured on coverslips were labeled with BrdUrd (10 μm), a thymidine analog, at 37 °C for 60 min. After being washed twice with PBS, the cells were fixed with 80% ethanol for 20 min and 100% ethanol for another 20 min. The cells were then permeablized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. To allow access for BrdUrd antibodies, DNA was denatured using freshly prepared 4 m HCl for 20 min at room temperature. The residual HCl was neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.5) for 3 min. The cells were blocked with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 20 min, followed by incubation with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies (33Gratzner H.G. Science. 1982; 218: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes) for 60 min. The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes). After secondary antibody incubation (40 min), the cells were incubated with PBS containing PI (5 μg/ml) and RNase (200 μg/ml) for 20 min. The coverslips were mounted to microscopic slides using 10 μl of mounting solution (75% glycerol, 25% PBS with 5 μg/ml PI) and sealed with nail polish, followed by laser scanning cytometry (LSC) analysis. Laser Scanning Cytometry—DNA analysis and BrdUrd incorporation in response to various treatments were performed with LSC (CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA) as previously described (34Kamentsky L.A. Burger D.E. Gershman R.J. Kamentsky L.D. Luther E. Acta Cytol. 1997; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell monolayers were grown on coverslips and immunostained with anti-BrdUrd antibody and the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by counterstaining with PI for nuclear DNA as described above. The cells mounted on microscopic slides were located visually with a CCD camera attached to the LSC instrument. Detailed information for LSC methodology has been published elsewhere (34Kamentsky L.A. Burger D.E. Gershman R.J. Kamentsky L.D. Luther E. Acta Cytol. 1997; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 35Darzynkiewicz Z. Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The slides were scanned under 20× objectives using both argon and helium lasers to excite the PI and Alexa Fluor 647 fluorochromes. Each slide was scanned randomly for three fields, and at least 1000 cells in each field were scanned. The scanning data were acquired and analyzed with WinCyte acquisition software (Version 3.4, CompuCyte). Multiple data parameters were displayed in a series of data windows through software. We contoured each nucleus as a single event through PI staining as described previously (34Kamentsky L.A. Burger D.E. Gershman R.J. Kamentsky L.D. Luther E. Acta Cytol. 1997; 41: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 35Darzynkiewicz Z. Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All of the scanned cells were used to generate the DNA histograms and the scattergrams for BrdUrd incorporation. The BrdUrd-positive cells were shown to have higher total fluorescence in their nuclei as demonstrated in the scattergram of total fluorescent intensity (Alexa Fluor 647 Integral) versus total DNA content (PI Integral). Because DNA contents reflect the positions of the cell cycle, we were able to observe cells in different cell cycle phases by detecting their DNA contents. Therefore, the cells, after being labeled with BrdUrd, could be monitored for their movement in the cell cycle by detecting the incorporated BrdUrd. The BrdUrd Pulse-Chase Assay—VSMCs were grown on coverslips to a confluence of ∼70% using the RPMI medium containing 10% serum. The cells were then starved for 2 days using the medium containing 0.5% serum, followed by a pulse labeling with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator (36Crissman H.A. Oishi N. Habbersett R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 37Higashikubo R. Ragouzis M. Roti Roti J.L. Cell Prolif. 1996; 29: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At this time point, the cells in the S phase, which actively synthesize DNA, would become BrdUrd-positive. Thereafter, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with sterile PBS. The cells were then cultured with fresh medium with 0.5% serum in the presence or absence of EGF (10 ng/ml). Every 2 h up to 24 h, a fraction of cells with or without treatment with EGF was removed and fixed with 80% ethanol and stored at -20 °C. The fixed cells were subsequently processed for immunostaining and detection of BrdUrd using LSC as described. In the interval between the BrdUrd labeling and sampling, the BrdUrd-labeled cells under a normal cell cycle would progress through the S and G2/M phases into the G0/1 phase of the next generation. Therefore, this set of experiments would demonstrate the cell cycle movement of these BrdUrd-labeled cells in the presence or absence of EGF. Determination of Cell Growth—Both spindle and epithelioid cells were maintained in 10% serum. The cells were trypsinized, counted to determine cell concentration, and seeded in 35-mm Petri dishes with 0.5 × 105 cells in each dish with medium containing 10% serum for 24 h. The cells were then cultured with the medium containing 0.5% serum for 2 days, followed by harvesting and counting cells as day 0. Three dishes of cells from both spindle and epithelioid cells were harvested for cell count determination using a hemocytometer every day up to day 5. Western Blotting—VSMCs grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed with PBS and lysated with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-phosphoglycerate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysate was passed through a 20-gauge needle three times, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). Supernatants were collected for protein measurement by the Bradford assay. Equal amount of protein of each sample (40 μg) was separated by 11% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies against MAPK, phospho-specific MAPK, p27kip1, and p21Cip1 at 1:2000 dilution were used as primary antibodies to detect respective proteins. To detect EGFR, cell lysate protein of 60 μg from each sample was loaded for separation on SDS-PAGE gel, and antibodies (1:1000 dilution) against total EGFR, phospho-EGFR (Tyr845), phospho-EGFR (Try992), phospho-EGFR (Tyr1045), and phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) (Cell Signaling Technology) were applied, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:2500 dilution) were then used, and peroxidase activity was detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (18Zheng X.L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13822-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MAPK Activity Assay—MAPK activity was analyzed with the p44/42 MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, cultured cells were treated with and without EGF (10 ng/ml) for various times followed by extraction of protein from cell lysates as described in Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein (200 μg) from each cell lysate sample were incubated with 15 μl of immobilized phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr 202/Tyr 204) monoclonal antibody with gentle rocking at 4 °C overnight. The immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 s, followed by a wash with lysis buffer, twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). The complex was then incubated with 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ElK-1 fusion protein at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 12.5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and briefly microcentrifuged. Equal volumes (25 μl) of the supernatant from each sample were separated on 11% SDS-PAGE gel for Western immunoblot detection with phospho-ElK-1 antibody (dilution 1:1000). The second antibody was coupled to horseradish peroxidase, which was detected by chemiluminescence using a Phototope® horseradish peroxidase Western detection kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Data Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The number of replicates (n) represents the number of cell samples used in the studies. The differences between the means were evaluated by the Student's t test (paired or independent) when two groups were compared and by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's correction when three or more groups were compared. p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 was considered significant. All of the statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 10, Chicago, IL). EGF Inhibition of Serum-independent Growth of Epithelioid VSMCs—From primary cultured rat aortic VSMCs, we had cloned both spindle and epithelioid VSMCs. Consistent with the findings by other laboratories (2Hao H. Gabbiani G. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 3Orlandi A. Ehrlich H.P. Ropraz P. Spagnoli L.G. Gabbiani G. Arterioscler.

Biol. 1996; 16: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), spindle and epithelioid VSMCs not only displayed distinct morphologies (Fig. 1, A and B) but also demonstrated differential growth properties. In the presence of 0.5% serum for 2 days, very few spindle cells underwent DNA synthesis (Fig. 1, C and D). In response to 60 min of BrdUrd labeling, only ∼5% of cells were BrdUrd-positive, as shown with red in the upper two quadrants of Fig. 1D. In contrast, the epithelioid cells had up to 20% BrdUrd incorporation rate in the same conditions (Fig. 1, E and F). Consistently, in the presence of 0.5% serum, the cell number of spindle cells increased slightly, but epithelioid cells replicated themselves with a significant increase in cell number (Fig. 1G). In keeping with the findings by others (5Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Ropraz P. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Holifield B. Helgason T. Jemelka S. Taylor A. Navran S. Allen J. Seidel C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Hao H. Ropraz P. Verin V. Camenzind E. Geinoz A. Pepper M.S. Gabbiani G. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Frid M.G. Aldashev A.A. Dempsey E.C. Stenmark K.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 940-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we also observed that in epithelioid VSMCs the smooth muscle differentiation marker protein, smooth muscle α-actin, was much lower than that in spindle cells (Fig. 1G, inset). Taking advantage of those two cell systems, we wished to examine the effect of EGF on the smooth muscle cell cycle. To do so, we first examined the expression of EGFRs in these two cell subtypes. As detected by Western blot (Fig. 2A), the expression of EGFRs in epithelioid cells was significantly higher than that in spindle cells. However, there was no significant difference in the abundance of α-tubulin protein detected (Fig. 2A). Based on this finding, we hypothesized that these two VSMC subtypes might respond to EGF differently. As expected, treatment with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 48 h significantly reduced the serum-independent BrdUrd incorporation rate in epithelioid cells (Fig. 2B). However, EGF neither stimulated nor inhibited the BrdUrd incorporation of spindle cells. This might be due to a lower expression of EGFR in these VSMCs. Although we observed significant inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation by EGF in epithelioid cells, we did not observe inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of EGF for several days compared with the control epithelioid cells without EGF treatment (data not shown). This result was likely due to the presence of apoptosis in the control cells and the antiapoptotic effect of EGF. Nevertheless, we wished to further characterize the inhibitory effect of EGF on cell cycle progression in the presence of 0.5% serum. Cell Cycle Arrest of Epithelioid VSMCs by EGF—Because we found that epithelioid VSMCs actively synthesized DNA in the starvation medium containing 0.5% serum and that the treatment with EGF inhibited DNA synthesis but did not inhibit cell proliferation, we wanted to examine whether the epithelioid VSMCs indeed underwent a normal cell cycle with cell division and whether EGF inhibited cell cycling under the same conditions. We labeled the S phase cells, which were actively synthesizing DNA, with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 60 min so that these BrdUrd-positive cells, when entering another phase of the cell cycle, could be detected through the immunostaining using monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the scattergrams of the BrdUrd incorporation, the cells in quadrant regions 1 and 2 were defined as BrdUrd-positive (Fig. 3, red). According to the DNA content and cell distribution pattern in the DNA histogram (Fig. 3, right panels of A and B), cells in either quadrant region 1 or 3 were considered in the G0/1 phase, and those in quadrant region 2 or 4 were considered in the S and G2/M phases. One of cell cycle features of epithelioid cells in the presence of 0.5% serum was that there were few cells in the G2/M phase (∼3% of total cells). The positions of the BrdUrd-positive cells were displayed in red in the scattergrams and the DNA histograms (Fig. 3, A and B, right panels, or C-H, insets) through WinCyte software (Version 3.4, CompuCyte). Right after pulse labeling (0 h), as anticipated, the BrdUrd-positive cells were typically located in the S phase (Fig. 3, right panels of A and B). These labeled cells were then maintained in culture and observed for their cell cycle positions at different time points in the presence (Fig. 3, D, F, and H) or absence (Fig. 3, C, E, and G) of EGF (10 ng/ml). Using this BrdUrd pulse-chase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures,” we found that the BrdUrd-positive cells (as shown in red) exited the S phase and moved to the G2/M phase after ∼6 h (Fig. 3, C and D). Some of these labeled cells underwent cell division to produce daughter cells, which could be recognized through their location in the G0/1 phase as shown in quadrant region 1 of panel C or D of Fig. 3, and in region-1 (the G0/1 peak) of the DNA histograms in the insets of panels C and D. This location change of the BrdUrd-positive cells was more significant after 12 h with and without the presence of EGF. After 12 h, most BrdUrd-positive cells (red) were located in the G0/1 phase as shown in quadrant region 1 of the scattergrams and region 1 of the DNA histograms (Fig. 3, E and F). At this time point, we observed some BrdUrd-positive cells (red) started to appear in quadrant region 2 or re-enter the cell cycle in the absence of EGF (Fig. 3E) but not in the presence of EGF (Fig. 3E). More significantly, at the time point of 24 h, we noticed that ∼30% of these BrdUrd-positive daughter cells re-entered the S phase of the cell cycle in the absence of EGF (Fig. 3G). However, in the presence of EGF, only a few of cells were observed to re-enter the cell cycle (Fig. 3H). The data from the control cells suggested that epithelioid cells indeed underwent cell division or cell cycling in the starvation medium containing 0.5% serum. In contrast, in the presence of EGF, the BrdUrd-positive daughter cells failed to re-enter the S phase, as indicated by few BrdUrd-positive daughter cells in quadrant region 2 after 24 h (Fig. 3H), suggesting cell cycle arrest.

https://openalex.org/W2083690034,"Developing Dictyostelium cells form structures containing approximately 20,000 cells. The size regulation mechanism involves a secreted counting factor (CF) repressing cytosolic glucose levels. Glucose or a glucose metabolite affects cell-cell adhesion and motility; these in turn affect whether a group stays together, loses cells, or even breaks up. NADPH-coupled aldehyde reductase reduces a wide variety of aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols, including converting glucose to sorbitol. The levels of this enzyme previously appeared to be regulated by CF. We find that disrupting alrA, the gene encoding aldehyde reductase, results in the loss of alrA mRNA and AlrA protein and a decrease in the ability of cell lysates to reduce both glyceraldehyde and glucose in an NADPH-coupled reaction. Counterintuitively, alrA- cells grow normally and have decreased glucose levels compared with parental cells. The alrA- cells form long unbroken streams and huge groups. Expression of AlrA in alrA- cells causes cells to form normal fruiting bodies, indicating that AlrA affects group size. alrA- cells have normal adhesion but a reduced motility, and computer simulations suggest that this could indeed result in the formation of large groups. alrA- cells secrete low levels of countin and CF50, two components of CF, and this could partially account for why alrA- cells form large groups. alrA- cells are responsive to CF and are partially responsive to recombinant countin and CF50, suggesting that disrupting alrA inhibits but does not completely block the CF signal transduction pathway. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy indicates that the concentrations of several metabolites are altered in alrA- cells, suggesting that the Dictyostelium aldehyde reductase affects several metabolic pathways in addition to converting glucose to sorbitol. Together, our data suggest that disrupting alrA affects CF secretion, causes many effects on cellular metabolism, and has a major effect on group size."

https://openalex.org/W2026155630,"We performed for the first time the allelotype of relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 38 cases were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using 71 markers. In all, 26 (68%) patients showed LOH on at least one chromosomal arm, indicating that LOH is a frequent event at relapse. The most frequent loss was found on chromosomal arm 9p at the p16/INK4a locus (39%). LOH at the TEL gene locus on chromosomal arm 12p also occurred often (25%). Frequent loss was observed on chromosome arms 4q (20%), 6q (21%), and 17q (20%). Sequential analysis (i.e. samples obtained from both initial diagnosis and relapse) shows that some patients (63%) have the identical LOH status at both phases, suggesting the presence of the same clone. Other samples (37%) showed distinct LOH alterations, indicating clonal evolution at relapse. Despite the heterogeneous and complex changes, some shared LOH loci occurred in these matched samples, suggesting that many of the same tumor-suppressor genes are aberrant at both phases. In summary, novel tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome arms 4q, 6q, and 17q, as well as the p16 and TEL genes, have an important role in the relapse of childhood ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2030788230,"The adenovirus E4orf6 is a viral oncoprotein known to cooperate with the E1A gene product in transforming primary murine cells. It has been shown to inhibit the apoptotic activities of p53 and p73 through direct binding to these proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the adenovirus E4orf6 protein inhibits apoptosis mediated by BNIP3 and Bik, which are BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family. This activity was not mediated by p53 and p73 because E4orf6 had the same effect on the apoptosis in Saos-2 cells that do not express p53-related genes. It was also ascertained that E4orf6 could change the mitochondrial localization of BNIP3 and Bik. A mutant lacking the nuclear export signal of E4orf6 failed to inhibit apoptosis and to translocate BNIP3 protein from the mitochondria. Moreover, it was also established that E4orf6 was able to interact with BNIP3 and Bik. In BNIP3 protein, the region required for the interaction included the transmembrane domain, which is required for the localization of BNIP3 to the mitochondria. These results suggest that E4orf6 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, enabling it to interact with BH3-only proteins, eventually leading to the inhibition of apoptotic activity."
