https://openalex.org/W1572643844,"The cell-free rat liver system in which Cl*-amino acids are incorporated irreversibly into cY-peptide linkage in protein has been used in our laboratories for a number of years as a measure of protein synthesis. The essential components of this system are the microsomal ribonucleoprotein particles, certain enzymes derived from the soluble protein fraction, adenosine triphosphate, guanosine dior triphosphate, and a nucleoside triphosphate-generating system (l-3). The ribonucleoprotein particles of the microsomes appear to be the actual site of peptide condensation. The soluble enzymes and ATPâ€™ have been found to effect the initial carboxyl activation of the amino acids (4). The role of GTP is not yet understood, although the present paper sheds light on its probable locus of action. Much evidence has accumulated in the past 8 years, beginning with the studies of Caspersson (5) and Brachet (6), implicating a role for cellular RNA in protein synthesis. The intermediate stages between amino acid activation and final incorporation into protein in the rat liver in vitro system offered us unexplored regions in which to seek more direct evidence for a chemical association of RNA and amino acids. A preliminary report of such an association has recently been presented by us (7). There it was shown that the RNA of a particular fraction of the cytoplasm hitherto uncharacterized became labeled with Cl*-amino acids in t,he presence of ATP and the amino acid-activating enzymes, and that this labeled RNA subsequently was able to transfer the amino acid to microsomal protein"

The cells were grown, adherent to glass, in a synthetic medium consisting of salts, vitamins, glucose, and the thirteen essential amino acids, supplemented with 5 per cent dialyzed human serum as previously described (5). Harvesting of Cells--In growth experiments, the cells were harvested during the logarithmic growth phase 6 or 24 hours after the last change of medium. In experiments which involve deficient media, the cells were harvested 24 hours after being overlaid with medium which lacked one or more of the essential amino acids. Preparation of Free Amino Acid Pools-The effects of temperature, mechanical disruption, and washing on the composition of the free amino acid pools were examined. When the cells were harvested by scraping them free from the glass in salt solution at room temperature before precipitation with cold trichloroacetic acid, the supernatant fluid contained up to 30 per cent of the protein nitrogen. This rapid and extensive autolysis was prevented by precipit,ating the protein without mechanically disturbing the cell layer. The 1 liter Blake bottles in which the cells were grown were drained for about 5 minutes, chilled rapidly in ice, and washed quickly with a balanced salt solution. Cold 8 per cent trichloroacetic acid was then added and the cell coagulum was scraped free of the glass, the vol"

The biological activity of whale growth hormone as measured by the tibia test was found to be comparable to that of bovine growth hormone. The isoelectric point of whale somatotropin was determined to be 6.2 and the molecular weight calculated from molecular kinetic data was found to be 39,000. The N-terminal residue determined by the fluorodinitrobenzene reaction was phenylalanine in an amount of nearly 1 mole per mole of the hormone protein. The hormone was further characterized by quantita- tive determination of tyrosine and tryptophan and by its ultraviolet ab- sorption spectrum. The authors wish to express appreciation to the American Cancer So- ciety, and to the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, for grants in partial support of this work."
