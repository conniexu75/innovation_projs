https://openalex.org/W2227280755,"In recent years, several extreme weather disasters have partially or completely damaged regional crop production. While detailed regional accounts of the effects of extreme weather disasters exist, the global scale effects of droughts, floods and extreme temperature on crop production are yet to be quantified. Here we estimate for the first time, to our knowledge, national cereal production losses across the globe resulting from reported extreme weather disasters during 1964-2007. We show that droughts and extreme heat significantly reduced national cereal production by 9-10%, whereas our analysis could not identify an effect from floods and extreme cold in the national data. Analysing the underlying processes, we find that production losses due to droughts were associated with a reduction in both harvested area and yields, whereas extreme heat mainly decreased cereal yields. Furthermore, the results highlight ~7% greater production damage from more recent droughts and 8-11% more damage in developed countries than in developing ones. Our findings may help to guide agricultural priorities in international disaster risk reduction and adaptation efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2187289245,"Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a life-supporting planet. While volcanoes expel volatile components into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for replenishment of mantle reservoirs. Many natural, 'superdeep' diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust. Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W2235731016,"Synaptotagmin 7 is shown to be essential for synaptic facilitation at a variety of central synapses, and the results pave the way for future functional studies of short-term synaptic plasticity, a fundamental form of neuronal computation. Synaptic facilitation is a process — first observed more than 70 years ago — that allows neurons to dynamically regulate neurotransmitter release in an activity-dependent manner. It is manifest as short-term synaptic enhancement lasting for up to several hundred milliseconds. Wade Regehr and colleagues have now identified synaptotagmin 7 as the calcium sensor required for synaptic facilitation at a variety of central synapses. Previous studies had established a role for synaptotagmin 7 in the slow phase of transmission known as asynchronous release and in Ca2+-dependent recovery from depression. This result offers a key molecular handle for future functional studies of short-term synaptic plasticity, a fundamental form of neuronal computation. It has been known for more than 70 years that synaptic strength is dynamically regulated in a use-dependent manner1. At synapses with a low initial release probability, closely spaced presynaptic action potentials can result in facilitation, a short-term form of enhancement in which each subsequent action potential evokes greater neurotransmitter release2. Facilitation can enhance neurotransmitter release considerably and can profoundly influence information transfer across synapses3, but the underlying mechanism remains a mystery. One proposed mechanism is that a specialized calcium sensor for facilitation transiently increases the probability of release2,4, and this sensor is distinct from the fast sensors that mediate rapid neurotransmitter release. Yet such a sensor has never been identified, and its very existence has been disputed5,6. Here we show that synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) is a calcium sensor that is required for facilitation at several central synapses. In Syt7-knockout mice, facilitation is eliminated even though the initial probability of release and the presynaptic residual calcium signals are unaltered. Expression of wild-type Syt7 in presynaptic neurons restored facilitation, whereas expression of a mutated Syt7 with a calcium-insensitive C2A domain did not. By revealing the role of Syt7 in synaptic facilitation, these results resolve a longstanding debate about a widespread form of short-term plasticity, and will enable future studies that may lead to a deeper understanding of the functional importance of facilitation."

https://openalex.org/W2224084604,"Influenza pandemics occur unpredictably when zoonotic influenza viruses with novel antigenicity acquire the ability to transmit amongst humans. Host range breaches are limited by incompatibilities between avian virus components and the human host. Barriers include receptor preference, virion stability and poor activity of the avian virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in human cells. Mutants of the heterotrimeric viral polymerase components, particularly PB2 protein, are selected during mammalian adaptation, but their mode of action is unknown. We show that a species-specific difference in host protein ANP32A accounts for the suboptimal function of avian virus polymerase in mammalian cells. Avian ANP32A possesses an additional 33 amino acids between the leucine-rich repeats and carboxy-terminal low-complexity acidic region domains. In mammalian cells, avian ANP32A rescued the suboptimal function of avian virus polymerase to levels similar to mammalian-adapted polymerase. Deletion of the avian-specific sequence from chicken ANP32A abrogated this activity, whereas its insertion into human ANP32A, or closely related ANP32B, supported avian virus polymerase function. Substitutions, such as PB2(E627K), were rapidly selected upon infection of humans with avian H5N1 or H7N9 influenza viruses, adapting the viral polymerase for the shorter mammalian ANP32A. Thus ANP32A represents an essential host partner co-opted to support influenza virus replication and is a candidate host target for novel antivirals."
https://openalex.org/W2224540085,"Tissues including liver stiffen and acquire more extracellular matrix with fibrosis. The relationship between matrix content and stiffness, however, is non-linear, and stiffness is only one component of tissue mechanics. The mechanical response of tissues such as liver to physiological stresses is not well described, and models of tissue mechanics are limited. To better understand the mechanics of the normal and fibrotic rat liver, we carried out a series of studies using parallel plate rheometry, measuring the response to compressive, extensional, and shear strains. We found that the shear storage and loss moduli G' and G and the apparent Young's moduli measured by uniaxial strain orthogonal to the shear direction increased markedly with both progressive fibrosis and increasing compression, that livers shear strain softened, and that significant increases in shear modulus with compressional stress occurred within a range consistent with increased sinusoidal pressures in liver disease. Proteoglycan content and integrin-matrix interactions were significant determinants of liver mechanics, particularly in compression. We propose a new non-linear constitutive model of the liver. A key feature of this model is that, while it assumes overall liver incompressibility, it takes into account water flow and solid phase compressibility. In sum, we report a detailed study of non-linear liver mechanics under physiological strains in the normal state, early fibrosis, and late fibrosis. We propose a constitutive model that captures compression stiffening, tension softening, and shear softening, and can be understood in terms of the cellular and matrix components of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2222099312,"Estimating diet composition is important for understanding interactions between predators and prey and thus illuminating ecosystem function. The diet of many species, however, is difficult to observe directly. Genetic analysis of fecal material collected in the field is therefore a useful tool for gaining insight into wild animal diets. In this study, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to quantitatively estimate the diet composition of an endangered population of wild killer whales (Orcinus orca) in their summer range in the Salish Sea. We combined 175 fecal samples collected between May and September from five years between 2006 and 2011 into 13 sample groups. Two known DNA composition control groups were also created. Each group was sequenced at a ~330bp segment of the 16s gene in the mitochondrial genome using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing system. After several quality controls steps, 4,987,107 individual sequences were aligned to a custom sequence database containing 19 potential fish prey species and the most likely species of each fecal-derived sequence was determined. Based on these alignments, salmonids made up >98.6% of the total sequences and thus of the inferred diet. Of the six salmonid species, Chinook salmon made up 79.5% of the sequences, followed by coho salmon (15%). Over all years, a clear pattern emerged with Chinook salmon dominating the estimated diet early in the summer, and coho salmon contributing an average of >40% of the diet in late summer. Sockeye salmon appeared to be occasionally important, at >18% in some sample groups. Non-salmonids were rarely observed. Our results are consistent with earlier results based on surface prey remains, and confirm the importance of Chinook salmon in this population's summer diet."
https://openalex.org/W2315407635,"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motif (ADAMTS)2, 3, and 14 are collectively named procollagen N-proteinases (pNPs) because of their specific ability to cleave the aminopropeptide of fibrillar procollagens. Several reports also indicate that they could be involved in other biological processes, such as blood coagulation, development, and male fertility, but the potential substrates associated with these activities remain unknown. Using the recently described N-terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrate approach, we analyzed the secretomes of human fibroblasts and identified 8, 17, and 22 candidate substrates for ADAMTS2, 3, and 14, respectively. Among these newly identified substrates, many are components of the extracellular matrix and/or proteins related to cell signaling such as latent TGF-β binding protein 1, TGF-β RIII, and dickkopf-related protein 3. Candidate substrates for the 3 ADAMTS have been biochemically validated in different contexts, and the implication of ADAMTS2 in the control of TGF-β activity has been further demonstrated in human fibroblasts. Finally, the cleavage site specificity was assessed showing a clear and unique preference for non-polar or slightly hydrophobic amino acids. This work shows that the activities of the pNPs extend far beyond the classically reported processing of the aminopropeptide of fibrillar collagens and that they should now be considered as multilevel regulators of matrix deposition and remodeling.—Bekhouche, M., Leduc, C., Dupont, L., Janssen, L., Delolme, F., Vadon-Le Goff, S., Smargiasso, N., Baiwir, D., Mazzucchelli, G., Zanella-Cleon, I., Dubail, J., De Pauw, E., Nusgens, B., Hulmes, D.

https://openalex.org/W2477005373,"How black holes accrete surrounding matter is a fundamental yet unsolved question in astrophysics. It is generally believed that matter is absorbed into black holes via accretion disks, the state of which depends primarily on the mass-accretion rate. When this rate approaches the critical rate (the Eddington limit), thermal instability is supposed to occur in the inner disk, causing repetitive patterns of large-amplitude X-ray variability (oscillations) on timescales of minutes to hours1. In fact, such oscillations have been observed only in sources with a high mass-accretion rate, such as GRS 1915+105 (refs 2, 3). These large-amplitude, relatively slow timescale, phenomena are thought to have physical origins distinct from those of X-ray or optical variations with small amplitudes and fast timescales (less than about 10 seconds) often observed in other black-hole binaries—for example, XTE J1118+480 (ref. 4) and GX 339−4 (ref. 5). Here we report an extensive multi-colour optical photometric data set of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient source6 containing a black hole of nine solar masses7 (and a companion star) at a distance of 2.4 kiloparsecs (ref. 8). Our data show that optical oscillations on timescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can occur at mass-accretion rates more than ten times lower than previously thought1. This suggests that the accretion rate is not the critical parameter for inducing inner-disk instabilities. Instead, we propose that a long orbital period is a key condition for these large-amplitude oscillations, because the outer part of the large disk in binaries with long orbital periods will have surface densities too low to maintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disk. The lack of sustained accretion—not the actual rate—would then be the critical factor causing large-amplitude oscillations in long-period systems. Observations of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient containing a black hole of nine solar masses and a companion star, show that optical oscillations on timescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can occur at mass-accretion rates at least ten times lower than previously thought, suggesting that the accretion rate is not the critical parameter for inducing inner-disk instabilities.

The authors propose that a long orbital period is a key condition, because the outer part of the disc will have surface densities too low to maintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disc.

Furthermore, the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV macro domain was determined at 1.43-Å resolution in complex with ADP-ribose. Comparison of macro domains from MERS-CoV and other human CoVs revealed structural differences in the α1 helix alters how the conserved Asp-20 interacts with ADP-ribose and may explain the efficient binding of the MERS-CoV macro domain to ADP-ribose.

https://openalex.org/W2235506763,"Chloride conducting channelrhodopsins (ChloCs) are new members of the optogenetic toolbox that enable neuronal inhibition in target cells. Originally, ChloCs have been engineered from cation conducting channelrhodopsins (ChRs), and later identified in a cryptophyte alga genome. We noticed that the sequence of a previously described Proteomonas sulcata ChR (PsChR1) was highly homologous to the naturally occurring and previously reported ChloCs GtACR1/2, but was not recognized as an anion conducting channel. Based on electrophysiological measurements obtained under various ionic conditions, we concluded that the PsChR1 photocurrent at physiological conditions is strongly inward rectifying and predominantly carried by chloride. The maximum activation was noted at excitation with light of 540 nm. An initial spectroscopic characterization of purified protein revealed that the photocycle and the transport mechanism of PsChR1 differ significantly from cation conducting ChRs. Hence, we concluded that PsChR1 is an anion conducting ChR, now renamed PsACR1, with a red-shifted absorption suited for multicolor optogenetic experiments in combination with blue light absorbing cation conducting ChRs."

Although intracellular endosomal processing in dendritic cells and B cells has been characterized for a few antigens, the overall range of processing pathways responsible for generating the MHC II peptidome are currently unclear. To determine the contribution of non-endosomal processing pathways, we eluted and sequenced over 3000 HLA-DR1-bound peptides presented in vivo by dendritic cells. The processing enzymes were identified by reference to a database of experimentally determined cleavage sites and experimentally validated for four epitopes derived from complement 3, collagen II, thymosin β4, and gelsolin. We determined that self-antigens processed by tissue-specific proteases, including complement, matrix metalloproteases, caspases, and granzymes, and carried by lymph, contribute significantly to the MHC II self-peptidome presented by conventional dendritic cells in vivo. Additionally, the presented peptides exhibited a wide spectrum of binding affinity and HLA-DM susceptibility. The results indicate that the HLA-DR1-restricted self-peptidome presented under physiological conditions derives from a variety of processing pathways. Non-endosomal processing enzymes add to the number of epitopes cleaved by cathepsins, altogether generating a wider peptide repertoire. Taken together with HLA-DM-dependent and-independent loading pathways, this ensures that a broad self-peptidome is presented by dendritic cells. This work brings attention to the role of “self-recognition” as a dynamic interaction between dendritic cells and the metabolic/catabolic activities ongoing in every parenchymal organ as part of tissue growth, remodeling, and physiological apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2223555797,"Although thrips are globally important crop pests and vectors of viral disease, species identifications are difficult because of their small size and inconspicuous morphological differences. Sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI-5' (DNA barcode) region has proven effective for the identification of species in many groups of insect pests. We analyzed barcode sequence variation among 471 thrips from various plant hosts in north-central Pakistan. The Barcode Index Number (BIN) system assigned these sequences to 55 BINs, while the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery detected 56 partitions, a count that coincided with the number of monophyletic lineages recognized by Neighbor-Joining analysis and Bayesian inference. Congeneric species showed an average of 19% sequence divergence (range = 5.6% - 27%) at COI, while intraspecific distances averaged 0.6% (range = 0.0% - 7.6%). BIN analysis suggested that all intraspecific divergence >3.0% actually involved a species complex. In fact, sequences for three major pest species (Haplothrips reuteri, Thrips palmi, Thrips tabaci), and one predatory thrips (Aeolothrips intermedius) showed deep intraspecific divergences, providing evidence that each is a cryptic species complex. The study compiles the first barcode reference library for the thrips of Pakistan, and examines global haplotype diversity in four important pest thrips."
https://openalex.org/W2224944171,"Background Excessive sitting has been linked to poor health. It is unknown whether reducing total sitting time or increasing brief sit-to-stand transitions is more beneficial. We conducted a randomized pilot study to assess whether it is feasible for working and non-working older adults to reduce these two different behavioral targets. Methods Thirty adults (15 workers and 15 non-workers) age 50–70 years were randomized to one of two conditions (a 2-hour reduction in daily sitting or accumulating 30 additional brief sit-to-stand transitions per day). Sitting time, standing time, sit-to-stand transitions and stepping were assessed by a thigh worn inclinometer (activPAL). Participants were assessed for 7 days at baseline and followed while the intervention was delivered (2 weeks). Mixed effects regression analyses adjusted for days within participants, device wear time, and employment status. Time by condition interactions were investigated. Results Recruitment, assessments, and intervention delivery were feasible. The ‘reduce sitting’ group reduced their sitting by two hours, the ‘increase sit-to-stand’ group had no change in sitting time (p < .001). The sit-to-stand transition group increased their sit-to-stand transitions, the sitting group did not (p < .001). Conclusions This study was the first to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of specific sedentary behavioral goals. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov NCT02544867"
https://openalex.org/W2227315955,"Madagascar has become a model region for testing hypotheses of species diversification and biogeography, and many studies have focused on its diverse and highly endemic herpetofauna. Here we combine species distribution models of a near-complete set of species of reptiles and amphibians known from the island with body size data and a tabulation of herpetofaunal communities from field surveys, compiled up to 2008. Though taxonomic revisions and novel distributional records arose since compilation, we are confident that the data are appropriate for inferring and comparing biogeographic patterns among these groups of organisms. We observed species richness of both amphibians and reptiles was highest in the humid rainforest biome of eastern Madagascar, but reptiles also show areas of high richness in the dry and subarid western biomes. In several amphibian subclades, especially within the Mantellidae, species richness peaks in the central eastern geographic regions while in reptiles different subclades differ distinctly in their richness centers. A high proportion of clades and subclades of both amphibians and reptiles have a peak of local endemism in the topographically and bioclimatically diverse northern geographic regions. This northern area is roughly delimited by a diagonal spanning from 15.5°S on the east coast to ca. 15.0°S on the west coast. Amphibian diversity is highest at altitudes between 800-1200 m above sea-level whereas reptiles have their highest richness at low elevations, probably reflecting the comparatively large number of species specialized to the extended low-elevation areas in the dry and subarid biomes. We found that the range sizes of both amphibians and reptiles strongly correlated with body size, and differences between the two groups are explained by the larger body sizes of reptiles. However, snakes have larger range sizes than lizards which cannot be readily explained by their larger body sizes alone. Range filling, i.e., the amount of suitable habitat occupied by a species, is less expressed in amphibians than in reptiles, possibly reflecting their lower dispersal capacity. Taxonomic composition of communities assessed by field surveys is largely explained by bioclimatic regions, with communities from the dry and especially subarid biomes distinctly differing from humid and subhumid biomes."

One major player in the formation and maintenance of invadosomes is the Src tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates invadopodial substrates, such as cortactin and the scaffold protein Tks5 (tyrosine kinase substrate 5) (2Murphy D.A. Courtneidge S.A. The “ins” and “outs” of podosomes and invadopodia: characteristics, formation and function.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2012; 91: 878-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells expressing active Src are a convenient system for studying the regulation of invadosomes. Additional key players in invadosome formation are the actin-regulatory Rho GTPases, in particular Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA (12Spuul P. Ciufici P. Veillat V. Leclercq A. Daubon T. Kramer I.J. Genot E.

Active Cdc42 stimulates the formation of invadosomes (12Spuul P. Ciufici P. Veillat V. Leclercq A. Daubon T. Kramer I.J. Genot E.

Other signaling molecules implicated in invadosome formation are phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), ERK1/2/MAPK, and cytosolic free calcium (6Hoshino D. Branch K.M. Weaver A.M.

Cell Biol. 2014; 207: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The maturation of invadosome precursors into ECM-degrading structures is a dynamic process that is regulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) (4Beaty B.T.

Interestingly, individual invadosomes can assemble into higher-order “rosettes” consisting of giant circular arrays of F-actin. Rosettes are observed in some cancer cells (19Kocher H.M. Sandle J.

Invadosome rosettes may remodel the ECM more efficiently and in a more localized manner than do individual invadosomes (20Pan Y.R. Chen C.L. Chen H.C. FAK is required for the assembly of podosome rosettes.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Evidence for invadosome rosettes in human tissues is emerging, for example, in the vasculature of lung tumors (9Seano G. Chiaverina G. Gagliardi P.A. di Blasio L. Puliafito A. Bouvard C. Sessa R. Tarone G. Sorokin L. Helley D. Jain R.K. Serini G. Bussolino F. Primo L. Endothelial podosome rosettes regulate vascular branching in tumour angiogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the signal inputs and pathways that drive the remodeling of pre-existing invadosomes into rosettes remain largely unknown. Here we examine how distinct GPCR agonists, notably lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and endothelin, influence the behavior of Src-induced invadosomes in human A375M melanoma cells. LPA is a multifunctional lipid mediator and a major serum constituent that signals through six distinct GPCRs (LPA1–6) (24Moolenaar W.H.

LPA is produced by autotaxin, a secreted lysophospholipase D originally identified as a motility factor for melanoma cells (26Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T.

Autotaxin and LPA receptor signaling in cancer.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2011; 30: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), but little is known about how LPA may affect invadosome behavior. Endothelin is produced by stromal and tumor cells and signals in an autocrine or paracrine manner to promote malignant cell behavior; acting through the endothelin B receptor, endothelin is strongly implicated in melanoma progression (31Saldana-Caboverde A.

We show here that LPA and endothelin induce the rapid transition of the ECM-degrading invadosome cluster into highly dynamic rosettes through Gi, and we analyze the underlying signaling events with a focus on Rho family GTPases. By using FRET-based biosensors, we monitor and dissect the agonist-regulated activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 and find a key role for Gi-mediated Cdc42 activation with a likely modulatory role for Rac1 and an opposing role for RhoA. Our results provide new insights into how certain GPCRs remodel invadosomes, thereby rapidly redistributing ECM-degrading activity. LPA (1-oleyl) and S1P were from Avanti Polar Lipids.

A375M, MDA-MB-435, and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (10% FCS), and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine2000. Src(Y530F) (chicken), LifeAct-mCherry, and GFP-actin were stably introduced into A375M cells by retroviral transduction. c-Src(Y530F) was introduced into LZRS-Neo vector with BamHI/NotI. GFP-actin and LifeAct-mCherry were used in the LZRS-Zeo vector. Viral particles were created in AmphoPack293 cells. Cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (LZRS-SrcYF) or 1 mg/ml Zeocin (LZRS-GFP-actin). Empty vectors (LZRS-Neo and LZRS-Zeo) were used as controls. In MDA-MB-435 cells, active c-Src(YF) was introduced by transient transfection. Primary antibodies used were as follows: cortactin (1:200; Millipore), FAK (1:200; Transduction Laboratories), vinculin (1:400; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and pY20 (1:200; BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-mouse Alexa488 IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes) and goat anti-mouse Alexa532 IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes). Cells were seeded on glass uncoated coverslips (24 mm) for 48 h, serum-starved for >2 h, stimulated, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (10 min), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (2 min), blocked in 3% BSA (PBS, room temperature, 1 h), and stained with selected antibodies (in 3% BSA in PBS). F-actin was detected using phalloidin-Alexa488 or phalloidin-Alexa568 (1 unit/ml). LPAR1 shRNAs were as follows: shRNA 1, GCCATCGTTATGGGTGCTATA; shRNA 2, CCTATTGGTCATGGTGGCAAT; shRNA 3, GCCTATGAGAAATTCTTCCTT; shRNA 4, CGGGATACCATGATGAGTCTT. Cdc42 shRNAs were as follows: shRNA 1, CGGAATATGTACCGACTGTTT; shRNA 2, CCTGATATCCTACACAACAAA; shRNA 3, CAGATGTATTTCTAGTCTGTT; shRNA 4, CCCTCTACTATTGAGAAACTT. Hairpins were introduced using the pLKO lentiviral vector (empty pLKO vector as a negative control). Viral particles were produced in HEK293 cells transfected with calcium phosphate. Transduced cells were imaged or harvested for total mRNA extraction after 48 h. Coverslips were coated with gelatin as described previously (59Artym V.V. Yamada K.M. Mueller S.C. ECM degradation assays for analyzing local cell invasion.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 522: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine degradative capacity, 100,000 cells/coverslip were seeded in serum-free DMEM (with or without GM6001). After 48 h, coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and cells were stained with phalloidin. Gelatin degradation was determined from confocal images of >20 fields of view/coverslip, using 2 coverslips/condition in two independent experiments (4 coverslips/condition). For time lapse imaging, cells expressing GFP-actin were plated on coverslips coated with gelatin-ATTO-633 for 24 h. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips (24 mm) for 24–72 h in DMEM (10% FCS) and serum-starved >2 h before experiments. Cells were imaged in DMEM/F-12 at 37 °C in a humidified chamber at 5% CO2 using a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. The pinhole was set to 1.5 Airy units, and focus was set to the ventral membrane of the cells. We took great care to excite at minimal laser intensity to avoid photobleaching or phototoxicity. Experiments were performed in HEPES-buffered saline (containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES), pH 7.2, at 37 °C. Cells were plated on uncoated coverslips and transfected 24 h before experiments with the indicated biosensors were placed on a thermostatted (37 °C) inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope and excited at 425 nm. Donor and acceptor emission were detected simultaneously with two photomultipliers, using a 505-nm beam splitter and optical filters: 470 ± 20 nm (CFP channel) and 530 ± 25 nm (YFP channel). FRET was expressed as the ratio between acceptor and donor signals, set at 1 at the onset of the experiment. The design of FRET-based biosensors of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA was based on the design of the Raichu sensors (34Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M.

Hodgson L. Klemke R.L. Hahn K.M. Spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activity in migrating cells.Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) (details to be described elsewhere). Briefly, the complete amino acid sequence of a given Rho GTPase was positioned at the C terminus of a single polypeptide chain to preserve its interaction with GDI and other regulatory proteins. A FRET pair consisting of Cerulean3 and circularly permutated Venus was used. The CRIB domain of PAK and HR1 region of PKN were used as the effector domain for activated Rac1/Cdc42 and RhoA, respectively. In control biosensors, point mutations (H83D/H86D in PAK and L59Q in PKN) were introduced to generate binding-deficient effector domains, so that FRET ratios remained at the basal level regardless of the activation state of the Rho GTPases. Cells transfected with a given biosensor were imaged on the TCS SP5 confocal microscope using a Leica ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture “lambda-blue” oil immersion objective. Excitation was at 442 nm, and the FRET ratio was determined from emission images acquired simultaneously at 448–505 nm (CFP channel) and at 505–555 nm (YFP channel) and expressed as a ratio (YFP/CFP). In these cells, LifeAct-mCherry was imaged simultaneously in the range 568–650 nm. Intracellular [Ca2+] was detected essentially as published (60Langeslag M. Clark K. Moolenaar W.H. van Leeuwen F.N. Jalink K. Activation of TRPM7 channels by phospholipase C-coupled receptor agonists.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 232-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Experiments were done in serum-free DMEM/F-12, using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at two channels (495–550 nm and 560–650 nm). The confocal pinhole was fully opened, and recordings were normalized by setting basal levels to 1.0. Invadosomes were detected by intensity and size segmentation of colocalizing actin and cortactin signals after manual thresholding using Fiji software (37Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C. Saalfeld S. Schmid B. Tinevez J.Y. White D.J. Hartenstein V. Eliceiri K. Tomancak P. Cardona A. Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30160) Google Scholar) and normalized to control cells. At least three independent experiments were analyzed for every condition (18 fields of view/condition, 5–10 cells/field of view, >100 cells/condition). Cells were plated in 6-well plates, serum-starved overnight, treated with inhibitors (U0126 (10 μm) for 1 h, PLX4720 (1 μm) for 2 h, wortmannin (100 nm) for 15 min, PTX (200 ng/ml) overnight) and stimulated with agonists as indicated. Whole-cell lysates were prepared by scraping PBS-washed cells in denaturing conditions in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (or, for detection of phospho-Akt, in JS lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with NaO3V4 (5 μm), NaF (1 μm), and protease inhibitor mixture). Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000). LPAR1–6 expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR reactions on cDNA derived from cell lysates (total mRNA isolation was followed by SuperScript cDNA synthesis), using power SYBR Green with specific primers: LPAR1, AATCGGGATACCATGATGAGT (forward) and CCAGGAGTCCAGCAGATGATAAA (reverse); LPAR2, CGCTCAGCCTGGTCAAAGACT (forward) and TTGCAGGACTCACAGCCTAAAC (reverse); LPAR3, AGGACACCCATGAAGCTAATGAA (forward) and GCCGTCGAGGAGCAGAAC (reverse); LPAR4, CCTAGTCCTCAGTGGCGGTATT (forward) and CCTTCAAAGCAGGTGGTGGTT (reverse); LPAR5, CCAGCGACCTGCTCTTCAC (forward) and CCAGTGGTGCAGTGCGTAGT (reverse); LPAR6, AAACTGGTCTGTCAGGAGAAGT (forward) and CAGGCAGCAGATTCATTGTCA (reverse). Expression levels were normalized to the expression of cyclophilin A (CATCTGCACTGCCAAGACTGA (forward) and TTGCCAAACACCACATGCTT (reverse)) and calculated according to the cycling threshold method. Given the key role of c-Src in invadopodia formation, we examined various human tumor cells for their ability to produce invadopodia upon expression of active c-Src and for their responsiveness to selected GPCR agonists. On the basis of these criteria, we selected metastatic A375M melanoma cells as our main model system. A375M cells showed characteristic actin-rich invadopodia that colocalized with cortactin at the ventral plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Expression of constitutively active Src(Y530F) (Fig. 1D) had only minor effects on cell morphology (Fig. 1B) but led to a marked increase in the number of invadosomes that clustered predominantly at the cell periphery (Fig. 1, C and E). These actin-rich clusters contained the invadopodial marker Tks5, cortactin, vinculin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Fig. 1C). Along with focal adhesion kinase, high levels of phosphotyrosine (pY) were also found in these invadosomes (Fig. 1C). Of note, invadosome cluster formation was not unique for A375M cells, because very similar structures were also observed in Src(YF)-expressing MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells (see Fig. 2D). As expected, invadosome clusters disappeared upon the addition of the Src inhibitor PP2 (results not shown). The Src-induced invadosomes were stable and persisted in serum-free medium, indicating that their formation and maintenance is a cell-intrinsic mechanism, not requiring exogenous growth factors, at least in the presence of active c-Src. The invadosomes were functional in that they colocalized with sites of robust gelatin degradation, a process that was inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 1, F and G).FIGURE 2.Agonist-induced remodeling of invadosome clusters into rosettes.

https://openalex.org/W2289125032,"RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU) is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that demonstrates high affinity for quadruplex structures in DNA and RNA. To elucidate the significance of these quadruplex-RHAU interactions, we have performed RNA co-immunoprecipitation screens to identify novel RNAs bound to RHAU and characterize their function. In the course of this study, we have identified the non-coding RNA BC200 (BCYRN1) as specifically enriched upon RHAU immunoprecipitation. Although BC200 does not adopt a quadruplex structure and does not bind the quadruplex-interacting motif of RHAU, it has direct affinity for RHAU in vitro. Specifically designed BC200 truncations and RNase footprinting assays demonstrate that RHAU binds to an adenosine-rich region near the 3′-end of the RNA. RHAU truncations support binding that is dependent upon a region within the C terminus and is specific to RHAU isoform 1. Tests performed to assess whether BC200 interferes with RHAU helicase activity have demonstrated the ability of BC200 to act as an acceptor of unwound quadruplexes via a cytosine-rich region near the 3′-end of the RNA. Furthermore, an interaction between BC200 and the quadruplex-containing telomerase RNA was confirmed by pull-down assays of the endogenous RNAs. This leads to the possibility that RHAU may direct BC200 to bind and exert regulatory functions at quadruplex-containing RNA or DNA sequences.

RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU), 8The abbreviations used are: RHAU, RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element; RSM, RHAU-specific motif; OB, oligosaccharide binding; BCYRN1, brain cytoplasmic RNA 1; TBE, Tris-borate EDTA; hTR, human telomerase RNA; LNA, locked nucleic acid; IP, immunoprecipitation; qPCR, quantitative PCR; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. also known as DHX36 and G4R1, is an ATP-dependent DEAH-box RNA helicase initially characterized as a regulator of mRNA stability via binding to the AU-rich element of urokinase plasminogen activator mRNA (1Tran H.

Subsequent to this, the discovery that RHAU possesses the ability to unwind both DNA and RNA quadruplexes shifted the focus of RHAU to a role in quadruplex biology (2Vaughn J.P. Creacy S.D.

Quadruplexes are stable secondary structures that occur in guanine-rich nucleic acids through the alignment and hydrogen bonding of guanines in multiple tetrad planes (5Burge S. Parkinson G.N. Hazel P. Todd A.K. Neidle S. Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5402-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). A typical requirement for quadruplex formation is the presence of four tracts of three or more guanines that align in parallel or anti-parallel strands with short (<7-nt) interspersed loops (6Simonsson T. G-quadruplex DNA structures: variations on a theme.Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar); however, quadruplexes with longer loops have also been reported (7Beaudoin J.D. Jodoin R. Perreault J.P.

Prevalence of quadruplexes in the human genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2908-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The quadruplex binding specificity of RHAU is mediated by a short N-terminal motif, referred to as the RHAU-specific motif (RSM). In addition to the RSM, RHAU contains a catalytic helicase core (DEXDc and HELICc domains) as well as an HA2 domain and oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold. Whereas the RSM confers quadruplex interacting specificity, maximal quadruplex binding affinity requires the presence of the helicase core (17Lattmann S. Giri B. Vaughn J.P. Akman S.A. Nagamine Y.

Whereas isoform 1 localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm, isoform 2 lacks 14 amino acids within the helicase domain and is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm (1Tran H. Schilling M.

RHAU has also garnered attention for complicity with several non-coding RNAs, both in the regulation of subcellular localization of specific microRNAs and in the remodeling of quadruplexes within the 5′-region of the telomerase RNA (22Lattmann S.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15181-15186Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As such, RHAU appears to perform multiple functions in a number of cellular contexts. Because RHAU is a key helicase that possesses the ability to unwind RNA quadruplexes, it is a valuable tool to study the function of quadruplexes in RNA biology. To further expand upon the role of RHAU in this context, we have performed an RNA co-immunoprecipitation screen to identify novel RHAU-interacting RNAs (21Booy E.P. Howard R. Marushchak O. Ariyo E.O. Meier M. Novakowski S.K. Deo S.R. Dzananovic E. Stetefeld J. McKenna S.A. The RNA helicase RHAU (DHX36) suppresses expression of the transcription factor PITX1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3346-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This screen identified brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BCYRN1, BC200) as an RNA specifically enriched upon RHAU immunoprecipitation. The BC200 gene produces a 200-nucleotide primate-specific transcript expressed predominantly in neural tissue as well as germ cells (30Watson J.B. Sutcliffe J.G. Primate brain-specific cytoplasmic transcript of the Alu repeat family.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3324-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Skryabin B.V. Kremerskothen J.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2382-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BC200 RNA possesses three distinct structural regions. The first 120 nucleotides of BC200 are homologous to the left monomer of Alu-J repetitive elements and are predicted to fold into a distinct and conserved structure (Alu domain) similar to that of the 7SL RNA of the signal recognition particle (31Skryabin B.V.

Immediately following the Alu domain resides a 40-nt adenosine-rich stretch followed by 40 additional nucleotides of unique sequence that contain a run of 12 consecutive cytosines (31Skryabin B.V. Kremerskothen J. Vassilacopoulou D. Disotell T.R. Kapitonov V.V. Jurka J. Brosius J. The BC200 RNA gene and its neural expression are conserved in Anthropoidea (primates).J. Mol.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2382-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although its function has yet to be clearly defined, the BC200 RNA is postulated to play a role in transport of mRNAs as well as subcellular regulation of translation (32Tiedge H. Chen W. Brosius J.

Roles of long noncoding RNAs in brain development, functional diversification and neurodegenerative diseases.Brain Res. Bull. 2013; 97: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Increased expression of BC200 in tumor cells and reduced expression in the context of neurodegenerative disease is suggestive of a role in the regulation of a subset of genes governing cell survival and proliferation. With altered expression in several disease states and little known about the function of BC200, we set out to evaluate the relationship between the RNA helicase RHAU and this non-coding RNA and assess the implications of the relationship for their respective functions. In this report, we validate the interaction between BC200 and RHAU in four immortalized cell lines (HEK293T, MCF-7, HeLa, and SK-BR-3). We present evidence that BC200 does not contain a guanine quadruplex and furthermore interacts with RHAU independent of the quadruplex interaction motif (RSM). Digestion of the BC200 RNA with single-strand-specific RNases confirms the basic structural features predicted by homology modeling. Segmentation of the RNA into discrete domains combined with RNase footprinting assays support an interaction dependent upon the adenosine-rich region of BC200. Modifications of the RHAU protein indicate that the interaction is specific to RHAU isoform 1 and requires the presence of the HA2 domain and OB fold within the C terminus of the protein. We conclude that RHAU expression/binding does not regulate BC200 RNA stability and that BC200 does not impair RHAU helicase activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the cytosine-rich tract near the 3′-end of the BC200 RNA can act as a binding partner to unwound quadruplex RNA. These data raise the hypothesis that BC200 may interact with G-rich sequences and its localization at these sites may be facilitated by the quadruplex helicase RHAU.

For His6-RHAU(53–105) immunoprecipitations, His6-RHAU(53–105) was supplemented to the cell lysates at a concentration of 250 nm. Recombinant RHAU proteins (RHAU truncations, isoform 1, isoform 2, and deletion mutants) were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 58 °C for 30 s. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis following amplification to ensure reaction specificity. The primer sequences used are as follows: telomerase RNA (hTR)-forward, TCTAACCCTAACTGAGAAGGGCGT; hTR-reverse, TGCTCTAGAATGAACGGTGGAAGG; BCYRN1-forward, TAATCCCAGCTCTCAGGGAGGCTAA; BCYRN1-reverse, GGTTGTTGCTTTGAGGGAAGTTACGC; GAPDH-forward, ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTG; GAPDH-reverse, CTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTGGG. The pUC57 plasmid containing the BC200 sequence and various truncations were synthesized by Genscript Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Constructs contained a T7 promoter and DraI (BC200 and BC(45–200)), BsaI (BC(122–200) and BC50), or BbsI (BC119, BC(51–119), and BC185) linearization restriction endonuclease cutting sites. The 3′-end of the T7 promoter was modified to accommodate in vitro transcription without the addition of aberrant 5′-nucleotides (TATAGG for BC200, BC50, BC119, BC185, and BC(45–200); TATAGA for BC(51–119) and BC(122–200)). Run-off transcription reactions and native RNA purification by size exclusion FPLC were performed as described previously (42Booy E.P. Meng H. McKenna S.A.

To assess direct protein-RNA interactions, EMSAs were performed with constant RNA concentrations of either 150 nm, in the case of quadruplex forming RNAs, or 50 nm in the case of the BC200 RNAs. Quadruplex-forming RNAs required higher concentration due to poor staining efficiency with the fluorescent dye SYBR Gold. RHAU, RHAU(53–105), or an equal volume of protein storage buffer was added to the binding reactions at the indicated concentrations. Binding reactions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, after which the products were resolved by native Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (TBE-PAGE), stained with the fluorescent nucleic acid dye SYBR Gold, and imaged on a Fluorchem Q imaging system using the Cy2 excitation LEDs and emission filters (Protein Simple, San Jose CA). Quantification was performed by densitometry analysis of the free RNA on three independent replicates per condition. All CD spectra were obtained using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) and 0.1-cm quartz cell with a 200-μl volume (Hellma). Collection parameters were constant for all samples and include a data pitch of 0.5 nm (spectral band width of 1 nm) using continuous mode with a scan speed of 50 nm/min, response time of 1 s, and accumulation of nine scans. BC200 RNA and truncations were in PBS buffered to pH 7.4 with sample concentrations in the 5–15 μm range. Postcollection, data were converted to m−1 cm−1 absorbance units. To perform streptavidin pull-down assays, RNAs were biotinylated at the 3′-end with T4 RNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNAs were added to a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris/Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 10% PEG, 100 μg/ml BSA, 50 units of T4 RNA ligase, 3 μm RNA, and 30 μm pCp-Biotin. Reactions were incubated at 12 °C for 3 h, after which the biotinylated RNAs were purified using the GeneJET RNA Cleanup and Concentration microkit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Biotinylation efficiency was assessed by performing EMSAs with the purified biotinylated RNA and a 2-fold excess of recombinant Streptavidin protein. Streptavidin pull-down assays were performed as described previously (21Booy E.P. Howard R. Marushchak O. Ariyo E.O. Meier M. Novakowski S.K. Deo S.R. Dzananovic E. Stetefeld J. McKenna S.A.

Due to low labeling efficiency and incomplete separation, a significant fraction of unlabeled BC(45–200) was present in the final product. Transfection of siRNAs and plasmids and co-transfection experiments were performed in the same manner as described previously (21Booy E.P. Howard R. Marushchak O. Ariyo E.O. Meier M. Novakowski S.K.

Genomic screening with RNAi: results and challenges.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 37-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, as cell lines often display genomic instability and loss of biochemical regulatory mechanisms, screens using primary human cells are now necessary to gain physiological insight in areas most relevant to disease. The use of primary human cells for HTS introduces several new challenges, including limited source material, cellular quiescence, heterogeneity in cell type, and variability from donor-to-donor. Phenotypic HTS of collections of small molecules can identify lead compounds for cell biological research and hypothesis generation, yet a lack of understanding of the target and the mechanism of action remains a major impediment to their utility due to off target effects. Pancreatic islets are composed of five endocrine cell types, including beta cells that respond to elevations in blood glucose and nutrients by secreting insulin. Insulin maintains euglycemia in part by promoting glucose uptake and storage in metabolically sensitive tissues, including liver, muscle, and fat. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia due to an autoimmune-mediated destruction of beta cells. Transplantation of donor islets as a treatment for type 1 diabetes is limited by several factors as follows: donor shortages, side effects associated with immunosuppression, loss of insulin secretion, and even cell death, problems common to treatments for other degenerative diseases (4Cooper D.K.

Alternative replacement strategies are currently being developed in which stem cell-derived progenitors are expanded ex vivo prior to transplantation. An additional potential source is adult beta cells themselves; thus acquiring a working knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing the proliferative behavior of adult beta cells and their progenitors is central to the success of all replacement strategies. However, as adult beta cells proliferate infrequently, and the precise molecular events involved in deriving mature beta cells from precursors is complex, generating an alternative adult source of human pancreatic beta cells for replacement strategies has not yet been achieved (16Kulkarni R.N.

Taken together, there is now a critical need for approaches that elicit proliferative behavior of mature human beta cells and their progenitors and to establish a working understanding of the underlying mechanisms for precise intervention so as to avoid the risk of unrestricted growth. Here, we address these issues and describe the development and implementation of an HTS approach using RNA interference to analyze proliferation following gene silencing in a mixed population of primary human pancreatic islet cells, and we report that the cell cycle-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN2C/p18 or CDKN1A/p21 are critical negative regulators of human beta cell proliferation. Antibodies for Western blotting were as follows: β-actin (Sigma, 1:20,000); p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000); pRb (Pharmingen, 1:500) and p21 (Pharmingen 1:500); p27 (Cell Signaling, 1:500); PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200); pAKT (Cell Signaling, 1:1000) and AKT (Cell Signaling, 1:1000); LKB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), p18 (Cell Signaling 1:200), and HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000). Antibodies for immunofluorescence were as follows: insulin (Dako, 1:1000), somatostatin (Dako, 1:1000), and glucagon (Dako, 1:1000).

We used two sources of human pancreatic islets, the NIDDK (National Institutes of Health)-funded Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP islets) at City of Hope and the J. Shapiro laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada (Edmonton islets). Male and female deceased donors were used, ranging in age from 16 to 79 years and body mass index from 20.1–35.7 kg/m2, none of which had a prior diagnosis of diabetes. The average purity of the Integrated Islet Distribution Program and Edmonton islets were 91.3 and 42.7%, viability of 94 and 80% respectively. When islet purity was under 85%, islets were picked manually and cultured for up to 30 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in non-tissue culture-treated Petri dishes in PIM(S) media supplemented with 5% human AB serum, glutamine/glutathione mixture, and penicillin/streptomycin (all reagents from Prodo Laboratories Inc.). Medium was changed every 2–3 days. Islets were washed in PBS and dissociated with Accutase (1 ml/1000 islets) for 20–30 min at 37 °C, triturating every 5 min for 10 s. Dissociated islets were counted and seeded at a density of 15,000–20,000 cells/well in a 384-well plate for fluorescence or 60,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate to generate protein extracts. With the exception of the initial plate coating experiment, islets were always seeded on a PDL-coated plate (described below) to facilitate attachment of dissociated cells. Six different matrices/surfaces were compared to determine the optimal surface to promote dissociated islet adherence. 384-Well plates were left untreated (tissue culture polystyrene) as a control surface. Matrigel (BD Biosciences), collagen type 1 (Sigma), applied cell extracellular matrix (Applied Biological Materials Inc.), and poly-d-lysine (Sigma) were coated onto the wells of 384-well plates according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HTB-9 extracellular matrix was coated onto 384-well plates as described previously (28Walpita D. Hasaka T. Spoonamore J. Vetere A. Takane K.K. Fomina-Yadlin D. Fiaschi-Taesch N. Shamji A.

Dissociated islets were then seeded onto the coated/uncoated plates, infected with non-targeting shRNA for 96 h, and fixed for immunofluorescence as described below. Human islets were dissociated and seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per well into a 384-well plate in triplicate 96 h before treatment. Dissociated islet cells or whole islets (10 islets per replicate) were equilibrated in 50 μl of Krebs-Ringer Buffer (KRB) containing 2.8 mm glucose for 15 min and then incubated in 2.8 mm glucose in KRB (low glucose) for 30 min (cells) or 1 h (islets) prior to stimulation with 16.7 mm glucose in KRB for 30 min (cells) or 1 h (islets). KRB supernatants from 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose treatments were collected, and insulin amount was determined using an HTRF insulin assay (Cisbio). All conditions were done in triplicate. The pLKO.1eGFP vector was constructed by replacing the puromycin gene in pLKO.1 with a BamHI-KpnI enhanced GFP PCR product. Three independent dsDNA sequences per target were designed using the Sigma Mission shRNA tool and inserted into AgeI-EcoRII-digested pLKO.1eGFP vector. Pilot experiments as outlined in Table 1 showed that the GP-VSVG envelope protein coding vector (pMD2G) provided greater infection efficiency than GP-LCMV (pHCMV) as evaluated by GFP and titer (supplemental Fig. 1 a and Table 1). The optimized ratio selected for all experiments is highlighted in Table 1. We found the best ratio of pMD2G vector to use by measuring LKB1 protein level (supplemental Fig. 1b). Virus was packaged in HEK293T for 72 h with pLKO1.1-eGFP plasmid encoding GFP and shRNA (supplemental Fig. 1c) and pMD2G and pCMV8.74 encoding coat and structural genes, respectively. 10 ml of culture supernatant was concentrated 100× by ultracentrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 2 h on a 20% sucrose layer (supplemental Fig. 1d) as described (30Eberhard C.E. Fu A. Reeks C. Screaton R.A. CRTC2 is required for beta-cell function and proliferation.Endocrinology. 2013; 154: 2308-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The shRNA library sequences for the screen are listed in Table 2. Table 3 lists the additional shRNA constructs made against p18 and p21. The virus was then resuspended overnight at 4 °C in serum-free PIMS medium without antibiotics, arrayed into 384-well screening plates, and stored at −80 °C until use. The titer was determined using quantitative PCR lentivirus titration (titer) kit (Applied Biological Materials Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In a direct comparison of crude versus concentrated virus (supplemental Fig. 1 e), we saw that concentrated virus resulted in greater knockdown efficiency and less toxicity than crude virus-treated cells using LKB1 shRNA and LKB1 protein levels as a readout (Fig. 1e).

After incubation for the indicated times, cells were fixed and processed for imaging or Western blot analysis. Lentiviral islet infection was performed with 1 μl per well for TAg encoding virus and 2 μl per well of shRNA concentrated virus in 384-well plate and 5 μl per well in a 96-well plate. After seeding/infection (72 h), EdU was added to the medium (20 μm) for the remaining time of the experiment, and medium was changed every 48–72 h. At the appropriate time point, dissociated islet cells were fixed by adding 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C using a Multidrop Combi dispenser (Fisher), quenched with 0.75% glycine in PBS at room temperature, and gently rinsed twice with PBS using an automated plate washer (Biotek). All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, rinsed with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h. Primary antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies in 3% BSA in PBS were incubated for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with Draq5 (2.5 μm) or Hoechst (5 μg/ml) for 15 min. EdU detection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for 30 min in the dark, before the blocking step. Each step was followed by three washes in 1× PBS performed using a BioTek 405CW multiwell plate washer. Western blotting was performed as described previously (30Eberhard C.E. Fu A. Reeks C. Screaton R.A. CRTC2 is required for beta-cell function and proliferation.Endocrinology. 2013; 154: 2308-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis consisted of two-tail unpaired t tests. NS or no asterisk = not significant; p ≥ 0.05; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Fluorescent images were captured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Opera® automated confocal multiwell plate microscope fitted with a ×40 high NA water lens. Forty fields per well were acquired per fluorescent channel: blue 405 (Hoechst); green 488 (GFP); red 594 (insulin); and far-red 647 (EdU). For HTS, images were analyzed using an algorithm that calculates the number of infected cells (GFP+) that were also insulin+ (beta cells) and scored the presence of EdU in the nucleus. Each condition was done in triplicate. All cells identified as positive by the algorithm for both EdU and insulin were confirmed manually. To enable HTS in primary human cells, we developed an imaging assay in 384-well microplates using freshly isolated human islets from non-diabetic male and female subjects. Donors were 16–68 years and had body mass index ranging from 20 to 36 kg/m2. Fluorescence imaging using markers of the major islet endocrine lineages in dissociated islet cell preparations confirmed the expected ratio between beta cell (insulin-positive cells, 60% of total) to alpha and delta cell populations (glucagon and somatostatin-positive cells, 30% of total; Fig. 1a). GSIS assays demonstrated a glucose-induced increase (2–8-fold) in insulin secretion over basal in islets from all donors, after dispersion and seeding as single cells in 384-well imaging plates even after long term culture (up to 32 days; Fig. 1b). The least time-consuming approach to performing HTS withRNAi is to use commercially available libraries of arrayed siRNA duplexes. However, lipid-mediated transfection of siRNA is both inefficient and interferes with central primary beta cell functions, including GSIS (data not shown) (31Moore F. Cunha D.A. Mulder H.

Furthermore, lentivirus infects target cells independent of the cell cycle stage, and the integration of the lentiviral genome delivery enables stable and long term silencing, a feature that is particularly important for slower growing or quiescent cells. To determine whether lentiviral shRNA delivery was feasible in human islet cells, we generated lentivirus using a modified pLKO1.1 vector that encodes shRNA and expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to achieve maximal titer and infection efficiency (Fig. 1c and Table 1). Lentivirus preparation was optimized to achieve >90% beta cell infection (Fig. 1d) and to increase knockdown reproducibility and avoid toxicity triggered by exogenous factors present in the supernatant from HEK293T viral packaging cells (Fig. 1e). Importantly, GSIS observed with intact islets and dispersed cells was also unaffected by viral infection, confirming their integrity under screening conditions (Fig. 1f). To optimize cell attachment for automated processing during screening, we compared retention of dissociated human islet cells infected with lentivirus on surfaces previously used for culturing human islets (Fig. 2a). Infection rates of endocrine cells were ≥90%, and the absolute number of beta cells retained was the same on all surfaces (Fig. 2, b and c). However, the percentage of beta cells remaining attached following processing for imaging was highest on poly-d-lysine (PDL; Fig. 2d). Moreover, a distinct non-islet fibroblast-like cell accu"

Cellular rNTP concentrations are much higher than those of dNTP. When copying DNA, DNA polymerases not only select the base of the incoming dNTP to form a Watson-Crick pair with the template base but also distinguish the sugar moiety. Some DNA polymerases use a steric gate residue to prevent rNTP incorporation by creating a clash with the 2′-OH group. Y-family human DNA polymerase η (hpol η) is of interest because of its spacious active site (especially in the major groove) and tolerance of DNA lesions. Here, we show that hpol η maintains base selectivity when incorporating rNTPs opposite undamaged DNA and the DNA lesions 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer but with rates that are 103-fold lower than for inserting the corresponding dNTPs. X-ray crystal structures show that the hpol η scaffolds the incoming rNTP to pair with the template base (dG) or 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine with a significant propeller twist. As a result, the 2′-OH group avoids a clash with the steric gate, Phe-18, but the distance between primer end and Pα of the incoming rNTP increases by 1 Å, elevating the energy barrier and slowing polymerization compared with dNTP.

RNA and DNA are fundamental to life in all forms. The two nucleic acid polymers are composed of ribonucleotides and 2′-deoxyribonucleotides as the basic units, respectively. However, ribonucleotides have been found in DNA; they constitute a large proportion of the “DNA lesions” in the genome. In mice, they have been shown to be collectively the most frequently occurring DNA lesions, even more than abasic sites and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG). 2The abbreviations used are: 8-oxodG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine; h, human; pol, DNA polymerase; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; PDB, Protein Data Bank; dAMPNPP, 2′-deoxyadenosine-5′-[(α,β)-imido]triphosphate; dCMPNPP, 2′-deoxycytidine-5′-[(α,β)-imido]triphosphate. The presence of ribonucleotides in DNA increases the possibility of spontaneous hydrolysis, causing DNA to break more frequently.

In this study, we investigated the ability of hpol η to incorporate ribonucleotides into DNA and crystallized hpol η with incoming rNTPs opposite both undamaged DNA and an 8-oxodG lesion. Our results demonstrate that hpol η can incorporate ribonucleotides into DNA with relatively high selectivity but low efficiency, even when the template strand contains the DNA lesion 8-oxodG or CPD. The x-ray crystal structures show that the incoming rNTP at the hpol η active site adopts a slightly different orientation relative to dNTP to avoid a clash with the steric gate residue, without significantly disrupting the pairing with the template dG or 8-oxodG. The latter appears to be the first crystal structure of an incoming rNTP opposite a DNA lesion within a DNA polymerase. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or TriLink BioTechnologies (San Diego) and purified by HPLC by the manufacturers. rNTPs and dNTPs were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). These experiments were conducted with the catalytic core of hpol η or the Y92A mutant (1–432 amino acids), and the former has been shown to have similar catalytic activity as the full-length protein in vitro (33Zhao Y. Biertümpfel C. Gregory M.T. Hua Y.J. Hanaoka F. Yang W. Structural basis of human DNA polymerase η-mediated chemoresistance to cisplatin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 (from Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) was used for crystallization. The fluorescently labeled primer 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-CGG GCT CGT AAG CGT CAT-3′ was annealed with each of the following template oligonucleotides at a 1:1 molar ratio by heating to 95 °C and slowly cooling: 1) 5′-TCA TGA TGA CGC TTA CGA GCC CG-3′; 2) 5′-TCA TTA TGA CGC TTA CGA GCC CG-3′; 3) 5′-TCA T(8-oxodG)A TGA CGC TTA CGA GCC CG-3′; 4) 5′-TCA (CPD)A TGA CGC TTA CGA GCC CG-3′ (CPD indicates cis-syn thymine dimer). These annealed fluorescent substrates were used in extension, single nucleotide incorporation, and steady-state kinetic assays. The following oligonucleotides were annealed at equal molar ratios for crystallization: 5′-AGC GTC AT-3′ and 5′-CAT GAT GAC GCT-3′; 5′-AGC GTC AT-3′ and 5′-CAT (8-oxodG)AT GAC GCT-3′. The extension assays were conducted with 5 μm DNA substrate (oligonucleotide), 1.2 μm hpol η, and 4 mm dNTP or rNTP mixtures (1 mm for each dNTP or rNTP) in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl at 37 °C for 5, 30, 55, and 240 min. Single nucleotide incorporation assays were conducted using the same reaction buffer but with 5 μm annealed DNA substrate, 500 nm hpol η, and 1 mm each of dNTP or rNTP at 37 °C for 5, 30, and 55 min. For steady-state kinetic assays, 5 μm DNA substrate was incubated with 1.5 to 500 nm hpol η or the Y92A mutant as well as varying concentrations of each dNTP or rNTP at 37 °C for 5 min, in the same reaction buffer as extension and single base incorporation assay. Reactions were stopped by the addition of a quench buffer (90% formamide (v/v) and 10 mm EDTA). Products were separated on 18% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a Typhoon system (GE Healthcare). The data for steady-state kinetic assays were fit to a (hyperbolic) Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Each DNA substrate and hpol η were mixed at a molar ratio of 1.1 to 1, before adding CaCl2 (final concentration 3.33 mm) and excess amount of rNTP. To obtain crystals by hanging drop vapor diffusion, 1 μl of each protein/DNA mixture was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution, which contained 100 mm sodium MES (pH 6.0), 5 mm CaCl2, and 16–22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, followed by equilibration with 500 μl of the reservoir solution at 18 °C. The crystals were washed through cryoprotectant (composed of 3 volumes of reservoir solution and 1 volume of glycerol) before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on the 21-ID-F or 21-ID-G beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL).

To assess the ribonucleotide incorporation ability of hpol η, we compared the extension of the primers in the presence of all four dNTPs or rNTPs with different incubation times. The primer was extended at 5 min and reached full-length after 30 min in the presence of rNTPs, compared with 5 min for full-length extension with dNTPs (Fig. 1A). To estimate the fidelity of ribonucleotide incorporation, hpol η was incubated with annealed undamaged DNA substrate as well as individual dNTP or rNTP. Under our reaction conditions, multiple nucleotides were added to the primer in the presence of a single dNTP in an error-prone manner. However, only one or two nucleotide extensions was observed with a single rNTP. Among the four ribonucleotides, rCTP (able to Watson-Crick pair with template dG) was the most efficient one for insertion (Fig. 1B). To further measure the efficiency and fidelity of rNTP incorporation by hpol η, steady-state kinetic experiments were conducted. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for rCTP insertion opposite template dG was 770-fold less than that for dCTP and 2–5-fold less relative to those for the mismatched dNTPs. However, rates of incorporation of the other ribonucleotides (other than rCTP) were very low and could not be measured experimentally. In addition, to investigate the effect of the template base, another set of DNA substrates with dT in the template instead of dG was included in the steady-state kinetic study. The change for catalytic efficiency between rATP and dATP insertion opposite template dT was 3400-fold, slightly higher than that between rCTP and dCTP opposite dG (770-fold, Table 1).TABLE 1Steady-state kinetics for insertion of nucleoside triphosphates opposite dG and dT by hpol ηTemplatedNTP/rNTPKmkcatkcat/KmfaMisinsertion frequency is as follows: f = (kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct.1/fbFold change is 1/f.μmmin−1μm−1 min−1dGdCTP2.4 ± 0.3119 ± 350 ± 611dATP84 ± 911 ± 10.13 ± 0.020.0026380dGTP58 ± 712 ± 10.21 ± 0.030.0042240dTTP170 ± 1658 ± 20.34 ± 0.030.0068150rCTP188 ± 1412 ± 10.064 ± 0.0070.0013770dTdCTP127 ± 819 ± 10.15 ± 0.010.0048210dATP2.5 ± 0.277 ± 231 ± 311dGTP9.1 ± 0.627 ± 13.0 ± 0.20.09710dTTP132 ± 1527 ± 10.20 ± 0.020.0065150rATP278 ± 372.5 ± 0.10.0090 ± 0.00120.000293400a Misinsertion frequency is as follows: f = (kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct.b Fold change is 1/f. Open table in a new tab We conducted primer extension assays by hpol η with 8-oxodG in the template strand in the presence of dNTPs or rNTPs. The pattern for primer extension past 8-oxodG was very similar to that against undamaged DNA (Figs. 1A and 2A). The primer was partially extended to full length by 30 min with the mixture of all four rNTPs, whereas hpol η elongated the primer to full length within 5 min with dNTPs. In single nucleotide insertion assays, only one rC was added to the primer within 5 min, although in the presence of the other individual rNTPs significantly elongated primers were only observed after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 2, A and B). In steady-state kinetic assays, hpol η incorporated dCTP opposite template 8-oxodG 2300-fold more efficiently than rCTP and 43,000-fold more than rATP. The difference between the catalytic efficiencies for rCTP and rATP incorporation was about 19, compared with 5 for dCTP and dATP, indicating that during nucleotide incorporation hpol η has similar base selectivity regardless of the sugar (Table 2).TABLE 2Steady-state kinetics for insertion of nucleoside triphosphates opposite 8-oxodG by hpol ηTemplatedNTP/rNTPKmkcatkcat/Kmf1/fμmmin−1μm−1 min−18-oxodGdCTP1.7 ± 0.381 ± 348 ± 911dATP8.4 ± 1.077 ± 39.2 ± 1.10.195.3dGTP18 ± 229 ± 11.6 ± 0.20.03330dTTP140 ± 1144 ± 10.31 ± 0.030.0065150rCTP292 ± 426.1 ± 0.30.021 ± 0.0030.000442300rATP445 ± 400.51 ± 0.020.0011 ± 0.00010.00002343000 Open table in a new tab Given that hpol η is capable of bypassing CPD by inserting the correct nucleotide dA (26Masutani C.

The final Fourier (2Fo − Fc) sum electron density map (with a threshold of 1σ) is shown in Fig. 4A. The incoming rCTP formed a Watson-Crick base pair with the template dG, but a significant propeller twist was observed. The dihedral angle between the two base planes was 27°. In addition, the base pair was slightly shifted toward the major groove, compared with the dG:dCTP pair at the hpol η active site. Phe-18 was identified as the steric gate residue, and the distance between either 2′-OH or 3′-OH of rCTP and their closest atoms of the Phe-18 side chain was 3.2 Å (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W2223301681,"Understanding the ability of koalas to respond to changes in their environment is critical for conservation of the species and their habitat. We monitored the behavioural response of koalas to declining food resources in manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis) woodland at Cape Otway, Victoria, Australia, from September 2011 to November 2013. Over this period, koala population density increased from 10.1 to 18.4 koalas.ha-1. As a result of the high browsing pressure of this population, manna gum canopy condition declined with 71.4% manna gum being completely or highly defoliated in September 2013. Despite declining food resources, radio collared koalas (N = 30) exhibited high fidelity to small ranges (0.4-1.2 ha). When trees became severely defoliated in September 2013, koalas moved relatively short distances from their former ranges (mean predicted change in range centroid = 144 m) and remained in areas of 0.9 to 1.0 ha. This was despite the high connectivity of most manna gum woodland, and close proximity of the study site (< 3 km) to the contiguous mixed forest of the Great Otway National Park. Limited movement had catastrophic consequences for koalas with 71% (15/21) of radio collared koalas dying from starvation or being euthanased due to their poor condition between September and November 2013."
https://openalex.org/W2225721877,"Sequencing of the honeybee genome revealed many neuropeptides and putative neuropeptide receptors, yet functional characterization of these peptidic systems is scarce. In this study, we focus on allatostatins, which were first identified as inhibitors of juvenile hormone synthesis, but whose role in the adult honey bee (Apis mellifera) brain remains to be determined. We characterize the bee allatostatin system, represented by two families: allatostatin A (Apime-ASTA) and its receptor (Apime-ASTA-R); and C-type allatostatins (Apime-ASTC and Apime-ASTCC) and their common receptor (Apime-ASTC-R). Apime-ASTA-R and Apime-ASTC-R are the receptors in bees most closely related to vertebrate galanin and somatostatin receptors, respectively. We examine the functional properties of the two honeybee receptors and show that they are transcriptionally expressed in the adult brain, including in brain centers known to be important for learning and memory processes. Thus we investigated the effects of exogenously applied allatostatins on appetitive olfactory learning in the bee. Our results show that allatostatins modulate learning in this insect, and provide important insights into the evolution of somatostatin/allatostatin signaling."

However, conventional laboratory methods used for diagnosing SCA remain prohibitively expensive and impractical in this setting. This study describes the clinical validation of a low-cost paper-based test for SCA that can accurately identify sickle trait carriers (HbAS) and individuals with SCA (HbSS) among adults and children over 1 year of age.In a population of healthy volunteers and SCA patients in the United States (n = 55) the test identified individuals whose blood contained any HbS (HbAS and HbSS) with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for both visual evaluation and automated analysis, and detected SCA (HbSS) with 93% sensitivity and 94% specificity for visual evaluation and 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity for automated analysis. In a population of post-partum women (with a previously unknown SCA status) at a primary obstetric hospital in Cabinda, Angola (n = 226) the test identified sickle cell trait carriers with 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity using visual evaluation (none of the women had SCA). Notably, our test permits instrument- and electricity-free visual diagnostics, requires minimal training to be performed, can be completed within 30 minutes, and costs about $0.07 in test-specific consumable materials.Our results validate the paper-based SCA test as a useful low-cost tool for screening adults and children for sickle trait and disease and demonstrate its practicality in resource-limited clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2226292930,"Background The cotton-melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a polyphagous species with a worldwide distribution and a variety of biotypes. North China is a traditional agricultural area with abundant winter and summer hosts of A. gossypii. While the life cycles of A. gossypii on different plants have been well studied, those of the biotypes of North China are still unclear. Results Host transfer experiments showed that A. gossypii from North China has two host-specialized biotypes: cotton and cucumber. Based on complete mitochondrial sequences, we identified a molecular marker with five single-nucleotide polymorphisms to distinguish the biotypes. Using this marker, a large-scale study of biotypes on primary winter and summer hosts was conducted. All A. gossypii collected from three primary hosts—hibiscus, pomegranate, and Chinese prickly ash—were cotton biotypes, with more cotton-melon aphids found on hibiscus than the other two species. In May, alate cotton and cucumber biotypes coexisted on cotton and cucumber seedlings, but each preferred its natal host. Both biotypes existed on zucchini, although the cucumber biotype was more numerous. Aphids on muskmelon were all cucumber biotypes, whereas most aphids on kidney bean were cotton biotypes. Aphids on seedlings of potato and cowpea belong to other species. In August, aphids on cotton and cucumber were the respective biotypes, with zucchini still hosting both biotypes as before. Thus, the biotypes had different fitnesses on different host plants. Conclusions Two host-specialized biotypes (cotton and cucumber) are present in North China. Hibiscus, pomegranate, and Chinese prickly ash can serve as winter hosts for the cotton biotype but not the cucumber biotype in North China. The fitnesses of the two host-specialized biotypes differ on various summer hosts. When alate aphids migrate to summer hosts, they cannot accurately land on the corresponding plant."

The collection (n = 44) was subjected to extensive molecular typing (MLST, spa, SCCmec, dru, PFGE, virulence and antimicrobial resistance genotyping) and antimicrobial resistance phenotyping by disk diffusion. MRSA was isolated from Australian veterinarians representing various occupational emphases. The isolate collection was dominated by MRSA strains belonging to clonal complex (CC) 8 and multilocus sequence type (ST) 22. CC8 MRSA (ST8-IV [2B], spa t064; and ST612-IV [2B], spa variable,) were strongly associated with equine practice veterinarians (OR = 17.5, 95% CI = 3.3–92.5, P < 0.001) and were often resistant to gentamicin and rifampicin. ST22-IV [2B], spa variable, were strongly associated with companion animal practice veterinarians (OR = 52.5, 95% CI = 5.2–532.7, P < 0.001) and were resistant to ciprofloxacin. A single pig practice veterinarian carried ST398-V [5C2], spa t1451. Equine practice and companion animal practice veterinarians frequently carried multiresistant-CC8 and ST22 MRSA, respectively, whereas only a single swine specialist carried MRSA ST398. The presence of these strains in veterinarians may be associated with specific antimicrobial administration practices in each animal species."
https://openalex.org/W2233167742,"Unesterified cholesterol accumulates in late endosomes in cells expressing the misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or general activation of ER stress led to dynein-mediated clustering of cholesterol-loaded late endosomes at the Golgi region, a process regulated by ER-localized VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs). We hypothesized that VAPs serve as intracellular receptors that couple lipid homeostasis through interactions with two phenylalanines in an acidic track (FFAT) binding signals (found in lipid sorting and sensing proteins, LSS) with proteostasis regulation. VAPB inhibited the degradation of ΔF508-CFTR. The activity was mapped to the ligand-binding major sperm protein (MSP) domain, which was sufficient in regulating CFTR biogenesis. We identified mutations in an unstructured loop within the MSP that uncoupled VAPB-regulated CFTR biogenesis from basic interactions with FFAT. Using this information, we defined functional and physical interactions between VAPB and proteostasis regulators (ligands), including the unfolded protein response sensor ATF6 and the ER degradation cluster that included FAF1, VCP, BAP31, and Derlin-1. VAPB inhibited the degradation of ΔF508-CFTR in the ER through interactions with the RMA1-Derlin-BAP31-VCP pathway. Analysis of pseudoligands containing tandem FFAT signals supports a competitive model for VAP interactions that direct CFTR biogenesis. The results suggest a model in which VAP-ligand binding couples proteostasis and lipid homeostasis leading to observed phenotypes of lipid abnormalities in protein folding diseases. Unesterified cholesterol accumulates in late endosomes in cells expressing the misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or general activation of ER stress led to dynein-mediated clustering of cholesterol-loaded late endosomes at the Golgi region, a process regulated by ER-localized VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs). We hypothesized that VAPs serve as intracellular receptors that couple lipid homeostasis through interactions with two phenylalanines in an acidic track (FFAT) binding signals (found in lipid sorting and sensing proteins, LSS) with proteostasis regulation. VAPB inhibited the degradation of ΔF508-CFTR. The activity was mapped to the ligand-binding major sperm protein (MSP) domain, which was sufficient in regulating CFTR biogenesis. We identified mutations in an unstructured loop within the MSP that uncoupled VAPB-regulated CFTR biogenesis from basic interactions with FFAT. Using this information, we defined functional and physical interactions between VAPB and proteostasis regulators (ligands), including the unfolded protein response sensor ATF6 and the ER degradation cluster that included FAF1, VCP, BAP31, and Derlin-1. VAPB inhibited the degradation of ΔF508-CFTR in the ER through interactions with the RMA1-Derlin-BAP31-VCP pathway. Analysis of pseudoligands containing tandem FFAT signals supports a competitive model for VAP interactions that direct CFTR biogenesis. The results suggest a model in which VAP-ligand binding couples proteostasis and lipid homeostasis leading to observed phenotypes of lipid abnormalities in protein folding diseases.

Lipid metabolism in cystic fibrosis.Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2009; 12: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression of ΔF508-CFTR, which fails to fold in the ER and is removed by ER-associated degradation (ERAD), leads to the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes (LE) (2Gentzsch M. Choudhury A. Chang X.B. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R. Misassembled mutant ΔF508 CFTR in the distal secretory pathway alters cellular lipid trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and to defects in the traffic of internalized (labeled) cholesterol from LE (6White N.M. Jiang D. Burgess J.D. Bederman I.R.

Physiol. 2007; 292: L476-L486Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in LE is accompanied by a reduction in cellular cholesterol esters and by defects in the traffic of glycosphingolipids (2Gentzsch M. Choudhury A. Chang X.B. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R. Misassembled mutant ΔF508 CFTR in the distal secretory pathway alters cellular lipid trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These outcomes are reminiscent of cholesterol traffic defects observed in Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) (7Cianciola N.L.

Biophys. 2011; 515: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In NPC, cholesterol traffic from LE to the ER, where it is esterified, is inhibited. Cholesterol accumulation in ΔF508-CFTR-expressing cells or NPC fibroblasts is alleviated by the overexpression of Rab9 (2Gentzsch M. Choudhury A. Chang X.B. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R.

Invest. 2002; 109: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Rab9 can either function directly, augmenting the traffic of sterols from LE to the trans-Golgi network, or indirectly, by facilitating trafficking of proteins required for intracellular cholesterol transport. The lack of cholesterol supply to the ER is accompanied by the activation of SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) and endogenous cholesterol synthesis both in model CF cells (6White N.M. Jiang D. Burgess J.D. Bederman I.R. Previs S.F. Kelley T.J. Altered cholesterol homeostasis in cultured and in vivo models of cystic fibrosis.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2007; 292: L476-L486Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and mice that contain an in-frame deletion in the CFTR gene (10Xu Y. Tertilt C. Krause A. Quadri L.E. Crystal R.G. Worgall S. Influence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator on expression of lipid metabolism-related genes in dendritic cells.Respir. Res. 2009; 10: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Importantly, these cellular lipid phenotypes are somewhat mirrored in CF patients that present deficiencies in essential fatty acids as well as low plasma LDL and HDL levels (5Worgall T.S. Lipid metabolism in cystic fibrosis.Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2009; 12: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cholesterol accumulation in LE is not specific to the ΔF508-CFTR mutation, does not require CFTR function, and is observed in cells expressing CFTR-related mutant transporters (2Gentzsch M. Choudhury A. Chang X.B. Pagano R.E. Riordan J.R. Misassembled mutant ΔF508 CFTR in the distal secretory pathway alters cellular lipid trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or unrelated misfolded proteins that are processed in the ER (3Ron I. Horowitz M. ER retention and degradation as the molecular basis underlying Gaucher disease heterogeneity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2387-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 4Ron I. Horowitz M. Intracellular cholesterol modifies the ERAD of glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher disease patients.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 93: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations suggest that protein misfolding in the ER leads to global effects on lipid homeostasis. Indeed aberrant cholesterol distribution is observed during general perturbation of protein folding in the ER; drugs that perturb ER N-glycosylation or oxidative folding similarly lead to cholesterol accumulation in LE (11Colgan S.M. Tang D. Werstuck G.H. Austin R.C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress causes the activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Kim A.J. Shi Y. Austin R.C. Werstuck G.H.

Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid accumulation, and inflammatory gene expression in hepatic cells.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E499-E511Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that enable the coupling of protein biogenesis in the ER with cholesterol flow remain undefined. Changes to transcription programs involved in cholesterol synthesis and alterations in cholesterol uptake and intracellular traffic may both play a role in altering cholesterol levels and distribution. These changes might be utilized to address protein misfolding in the ER. Introduction of free cholesterol or long chain saturated fatty acids in the ER membrane leads to activation of ER stress (14Pineau L. Colas J. Dupont S. Beney L. Fleurat-Lessard P. Berjeaud J.M. Bergès T. Ferreira T. Lipid-induced ER stress: synergistic effects of sterols and saturated fatty acids.Traffic. 2009; 10: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be that when ER-associated folding or degradation machineries are perturbed or overloaded, the traffic of free cholesterol to the ER is reduced to minimize the derived biosynthetic and processing load. This reduction would be functionally homologous to the general inhibition of protein synthesis during the development of ER stress. The ER unfolded protein response (UPR) couples the adjustments to protein folding and degradation mechanisms with phospholipid and sterol synthesis (15Ron D. Walter P. Signal integration in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4850) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms that couple the intracellular cholesterol distribution with protein folding remain largely undefined. The global nature of lipid effects observed in CF patients and the relation to protein folding in the ER led us to hypothesize that VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) might be involved in regulated coupling of protein folding with lipid homeostasis. VAPs are evolutionarily conserved ER-localized type II membrane proteins that function in both protein and lipid homeostasis (16Loewen C.J. Levine T.P.

Kandel E.R. Bartsch D. A VAMP-binding protein from Aplysia required for neurotransmitter release.Science. 1995; 269: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The proteins serve as anchors that physically link the ER with other organelles forming membrane contact sites (MCS). VAPs are anchored in the ER membrane via the C terminus to present a coiled-coil dimerization domain and an N-terminal major sperm protein (MSP) domain in the cytosol. The MSP domain binds FFAT signals (two phenylalanine residues in an acidic track) containing ligands, mostly involved in lipid sorting and sensing activities (16Loewen C.J. Levine T.P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14097-14104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). LSS include members of the oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORPs) in mammals or the oxysterol-binding Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs in yeast (19Weber-Boyvat M. Zhong W. Yan D. Olkkonen V.M. Oxysterol-binding proteins: functions in cell regulation beyond lipid metabolism.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 86: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LSS function at MCS that connect the ER (through FFAT binding) with Golgi, endosomes, and the plasma membranes. ORPs function directly in sterol and phospholipid transfer, using an oxysterol regulatory domain to bind and mediate bidirectional inter-membrane exchange of monophosphorylated phosphoinositides with sterols. ORPs may also function as sensors that report on lipid environments. ER-anchored ORPs function in a VAP-independent manner to exchange phosphoinositide with phosphatidylserine. In addition, a number of lipid-modifying and transfer enzymes interact with the ER using FFAT-VAP binding and function in ceramide traffic, phosphoinositide, and phosphatidic acid exchange and regulated phosphoinositide phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles that provide directionality for cellular lipid flow (20Olkkonen V.M.

Tomishige N. Yamaji T. CERT-mediated trafficking of ceramide.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Regulation of MCS assembly also allows for lipid-modifying enzymes to function in trans and regulate organelle positioning within the cell. A role for VAPs in regulating hepatitis C virus replication complexes has been shown, and this role is likely related to regulatory activities that control the lipid composition of these membranous structures (26Kukihara H. Moriishi K. Taguwa S. Tani H. Abe T. Mori Y. Suzuki T. Fukuhara T. Taketomi A. Maehara Y. Matsuura Y. Human VAP-C negatively regulates hepatitis C virus propagation.J.

Overall, a role for VAPs as central elements in general lipid homeostasis is well established. VAPs are also implicated in the regulation of proteostasis. Yeast VAP (Scs2, suppressor of choline sensitivity) couples Opi1 regulation with UPR activity to control ER membrane expansion during ER stress (28Brickner J.H. Walter P. Gene recruitment of the activated INO1 locus to the nuclear membrane.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e342Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Opi1 regulates Ino1 activity, a key element in phospholipid synthesis. Scs2 also interacts with the ER-localized proteostasis regulators Yet1p-Yet3p (29Wilson J.D. Thompson S.L. Barlowe C. Yet1p-Yet3p interacts with Scs2p-Opi1p to regulate ER localization of the Opi1p repressor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The relation between VAP, UPR, and proteostasis regulation is conserved in mammals. VAPs interact with and regulate the activity of the mammalian UPR sensors Ire1 and ATF6 (30Gkogkas C. Middleton S. Kremer A.M. Wardrope C. Hannah M. Gillingwater T.H. Skehel P. VAPB interacts with and modulates the activity of ATF6.Hum. Mol.

Neurochem. 2009; 108: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ATF6 regulates UPR-mediated membrane expansion, linking the regulation of lipid biosynthesis with protein folding in the ER (32Maiuolo J. Bulotta S. Verderio C. Benfante R. Borgese N.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7832-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The physiological role of VAP in regulating proteostasis is undefined. However, the significance of such regulation is exemplified by the role of VAPB mutants in the development of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (31Suzuki H. Kanekura K. Levine T.P.

A P56S mutation in the MSP domain of VAPB destabilizes the domain and supports the aggregation of VAPB with VAPA leading to a general loss of function. Deletion of Drosophila dVAP is manifested as a proteostasis disease, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates and the build up of ER quality control compartments characteristic of inhibited protein degradation (37Chai A.

Gain-of-function mutations in the ALS8 causative gene VAPB have detrimental effects on neurons and muscles.Biol. Open. 2014; 3: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cytosolic MSP domain of dVAP is cleaved and secreted (using an unconventional secretion pathway) serving as an activating ligand for Eph receptors (40Tsuda H. Han S.M. Yang Y. Tong C. Lin Y.Q. Mohan K. Haueter C. Zoghbi A. Harati Y. Kwan J. Miller M.A. Bellen H.J.

Cell. 2012; 22: 348-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The P56S mutation inhibits cleavage and signaling activities. Therefore, the loss of VAP signaling may lead to the development of ALS. However, the loss of dVAP can be partially compensated by the expression of ORP8, an FFAT-independent ER-anchored ORP (36Moustaqim-Barrette A. Lin Y.Q. Pradhan S. Neely G.G. Bellen H.J. Tsuda H. The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 8 protein, VAP, is required for ER protein quality control.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: 1975-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus VAP-FFAT binding and lipid transfer activities are likely involved in regulating cellular proteostasis and might contribute to the development of ALS (38Forrest S. Chai A. Sanhueza M. Marescotti M. Parry K. Georgiev A. Sahota V. Mendez-Castro R. Pennetta G. Increased levels of phosphoinositides cause neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22: 2689-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that VAPs function as ER-localized receptors, which couple proteostasis with lipid homeostasis. We now demonstrate that VAPs (or isolated MSP domains) inhibit the degradation of misfolded ΔF508-CFTR in the ER. We defined mutations in the MSP domain that uncouple this proteostasis activity from VAP expression and defined selective interactions of VAP-MSP with proteostasis ligands regulating UPR and ER-associated degradation of CFTR. We provide evidence to suggest a model in which competitive ligand binding by VAP-MSP regulates proteostasis and lipid homeostasis coupling. HeLa, HEK293, and ΔF508-CFTR stably expressing HEK293 cells and the RNF5/RMA1 knockdown HeLa cell lines (provided by Dr. Z. Ronai, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Thermo Scientific Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Serum Source International and Thermo Scientific Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Mediatech) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. In some experiments, cells were grown in 10% delipidated FBS (Cocalico Biologicals). U18666A was purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs. Cycloheximide and tunicamycin were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies used in this study include anti-calnexin (StressGen), anti-Lamp2 (gift from Dr. G. Apodaca and the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-HA (Invitrogen and Covance), anti-GFP (Invitrogen and Polysciences, Inc.), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-p97/VCP (Research Diagnostics, Inc.), anti-RMA1 (Abgent), anti-β-actin (Abcam), and anti-BAP31 (gift from Dr. G. Shore, McGill University, Montreal Canada). Mammalian expression vectors encoding HA-tagged human VAPA and VAPB were kindly provided by Dr. C. Hoogenraad (Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The VAPA construct was a variant that harbors a substitution of a conserved Glu to Gly at position 185. The substitution resides outside of the proteostasis-active MSP domain of VAPA and in agreement did not affect VAPA activity in our assays. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis generated several variants used in the structure-function analysis of VAPs. The N-terminal MSP domain was expressed by mutagenizing amino acids 132 and 125 in VAPA and VAPB, respectively, to stop codons. The HA-VAPA-MSP construct was generated using the forward primer 5′-CCAAATTGAGATGCGTATTTGAATAGCCCAATGAAAATGATAAATTGAATGATATGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCATATCATTCAATTTATCATTTTCATTGGGCTATTCAAATACGCATCTCAATTTGG-3′, and the HA-VAPB-MSP construct was generated using the forward primer 5′-GGATTCAAAACTTAGATGTGTGTTTGAATAGCCAGCAGAGAATGATAAACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGTTTATCATTCTCTGCTGGCTATTCAAACACACATCTAAGTTTTGAATCC-3′. Conversion of amino acids 201 and 196 in VAPA and VAPB, respectively, to stop codons produced truncations after the VAP coiled-coil domain (HA-VAPA-MSP+CC andHA-VAPB-MSP+CC). The VAPA-specific primers used were 5′-CGGCACCTGAGAGATGAAGGTTTATAACTCAGAAAGGTAGCACATTCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATGTGCTACCTTTCTGAGTTATAAACCTTCATCTCTCAGGTGCCG-3′, and the VAPB-specific primers used were 5′-GCAGTTCAAGGAAGAAGATGGACTGTAAATGAGGAAGACAGTGCAGAGCAACAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGTTGCTCTGCACTGTCTTCCTCATTTACAGTCCATCTTCTTCCTTGAACTGC-3′.The ALS-causing mutation in VAPB, P56S, was generated using the 5′-CGTAGGTACTGTGTGAGGTCCAACAGCGGAATCATCGATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATCGATGATTCCGCTGTTGGACCTCACACAGTACCTACG-3′ primers. Sequence alignment of VAPA and VAPB identified proline 63 as the ALS-related residue in VAPA, which was mutated to serine 63 using the 5′-GCCGGTACTGTGTGAGGTCCAACAGTGGAATTATTGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCAATAATTCCACTGTTGGACCTCACACAGTACCGGC-3′ primers. VAP double point mutations within the MSP domain, as identified previously (42Kaiser S.E. Brickner J.H. Reilein A.R. Fenn T.D. Walter P. Brunger A.T. Structural basis of FFAT motif-mediated ER targeting.Structure. 2005; 13: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), prevent FFAT binding, and these constructs were generated in VAPA using the primers 5′-CCGAATGAAAAGAGTAAACACGACTTTGACGTACAGACAATTTTTGCTCCACC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGAGCAAAAATTGTCTGTACGTCAAAGTCGTGTTTACTCTTTTCATTCGG-3′ (HA-VAPA-K95D/M97D). In VAPB, the double point mutations within the MSP domain were generated using the 5′-CCCAATGAGAAAAGTAAACACGACTTTGACGTTCAGTCTATGTTTGCTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAGCAAACATAGACTGAACGTCAAAGTCGTGTTTACTTTTCTCATTGGG-3′ primers (HA-VAPB-K87D/M89D). Analysis of the VAP-MSP domain identified exposed acidic residues within an unstructured loop, which were mutagenized to generate the 2DK mutants. Two reverse-charge point mutations in VAPA (D84K/D86K) and VAPB (D77K/D79K), which were termed the “2DK” mutants, were generated in VAPA using the primers 5′-GCTACAGCCCTTTAAGTATAAGCCGAATGAAAAGAGTAAACACAAGTTTATGG-3′ and 5′-CCATAAACTTGTGTTTACTCTTTTCATTCGGCTTATACTTAAAGGGCTGTAGC-3′ and in VAPB using the primers5′-GTGATGTTACAGCCTTTCAAGTATAAGCCCAATGAGAAAAGTAAACACAAGTTTATGG-3′ and 5′-CCATAAACTTGTGTTTACTTTTCTCATTGGGCTTATACTTGAAAGGCTGTAACATCAC-3′.

https://openalex.org/W2277099230,"Gene duplication often provides selective advantages for the survival of microorganisms in adapting to varying environmental conditions. P. aeruginosa PAO1 possesses two seven-gene operons [phz1 (phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1) and phz2 (phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2)] that are involved in the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and its derivatives. Although the two operons are highly homologous and their functions are well known, it is unclear how the two phz operons coordinate their expressions to maintain the phenazine biosynthesis. By constructing single and double deletion mutants of the two phz operons, we found that the phz1-deletion mutant produced the same or less amount of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid and pyocyanin in GA medium than the phz2-knockout mutant while the phz1-phz2 double knockout mutant did not produce any phenazines. By generating phzA1 and phzA2 translational and transcriptional fusions with a truncated lacZ reporter, we found that the expression of the phz1 operon increased significantly at the post-transcriptional level and did not alter at the transcriptional level in the absence of the phz2 operon. Surprisingly, the expression the phz2 operon increased significantly at the post-transcriptional level and only moderately at the transcriptional level in the absence of the phz1 operon. Our findings suggested that a complex cross-regulation existed between the phz1 and phz2 operons. By mediating the upregulation of one phz operon expression while the other was deleted, this crosstalk would maintain the homeostatic balance of phenazine biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa PAO1."
https://openalex.org/W2230291276,"Pygmy populations occupy a vast territory extending west-to-east along the central African belt from the Congo Basin to Lake Victoria. However, their numbers and actual distribution is not known precisely. Here, we undertake this task by using locational data and population sizes for an unprecedented number of known Pygmy camps and settlements ( n = 654) in five of the nine countries where currently distributed. With these data we develop spatial distribution models based on the favourability function, which distinguish areas with favourable environmental conditions from those less suitable for Pygmy presence. Highly favourable areas were significantly explained by presence of tropical forests, and by lower human pressure variables. For documented Pygmy settlements, we use the relationship between observed population sizes and predicted favourability values to estimate the total Pygmy population throughout Central Africa. We estimate that around 920,000 Pygmies (over 60% in DRC) is possible within favourable forest areas in Central Africa. We argue that fragmentation of the existing Pygmy populations, alongside pressure from extractive industries and sometimes conflict with conservation areas, endanger their future. There is an urgent need to inform policies that can mitigate against future external threats to these indigenous peoples’ culture and lifestyles."
https://openalex.org/W2238427655,"Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cellular metabolism, growth, and proliferation. mTORC1 has been implicated in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration, and is a target to prolong lifespan. Here we report a small molecule inhibitor (Cbz-B3A) of mTORC1 signaling. Cbz-B3A inhibits the phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and blocks 68% of translation. In contrast, rapamycin preferentially inhibits the phosphorylation of p70S6k and blocks 35% of translation. Cbz-B3A does not appear to bind directly to mTORC1, but instead binds to ubiquilins 1, 2, and 4. Knockdown of ubiquilin 2, but not ubiquilins 1 and 4, decreases the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, suggesting that ubiquilin 2 activates mTORC1. The knockdown of ubiquilins 2 and 4 decreases the effect of Cbz-B3A on 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Cbz-B3A slows cellular growth of some human leukemia cell lines, but is not cytotoxic. Thus Cbz-B3A exemplifies a novel strategy to inhibit mTORC1 signaling that might be exploited for treating many human diseases.

Currently, inhibitors of mTOR generally fall within two categories: rapamycin and rapamycin derivatives (rapalogs), and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors. Rapamycin binds to mTORC1 as a complex with FKBP12, and will also inhibit mTORC2 activity after prolonged treatment (17Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M.

Our laboratory recently reported that Boc3Arg (B3A) is a small molecule degron that, when coupled to an appropriate recognition ligand, can induce the degradation of a target protein (Fig. 1) (40Long M.J. Gollapalli D.R. Hedstrom L. Inhibitor mediated protein degradation.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 629-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). B3A-linked trimethoprim and ethacrynic acid increase the degradation of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and glutathione transferase (GST), respectively, in both cycloheximide-treated cells and cell lysates. B3A-induced degradation is proteasome dependent but does not appear to require ubiquitination of the target protein. We believe that B3A resembles an unfolded peptide and may usurp the cytosolic protein quality control processes. While further investigating the mechanism of B3A-induced degradation, we unexpectedly discovered that B3A ligands inhibit translation. Here we show that Cbz-B3A blocks translation by inhibiting the mTORC1 pathway in a process that is dependent on the presence of ubiquilins 2 and 4. Unlike rapamycin, Cbz-B3A has a larger effect on the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 than p70S6k. Rapamycin was obtained from Gold Biotechnology.

Firefly luciferase and firefly luciferase-eDHFR were cloned into pBABE-puro vector, which was a gift from Hartmut Land, Jay Morgenstern, and Bob Weinberg (Addgene plasmid number 1764). pBABE-puro-luciferase was co-transfected with VSV-G into GP2–293 cells (Retro-X Universal Packaging System, Clonetech, Mountain View, CA) with TransIT-2020 (MirusBio) according to the TransIT-2020 protocol. After 48 h, the viral supernatant was harvested, spun down, filtered with a 45-μm syringe filter, and added to HEK-293T supplemented with 8 μg/ml of Polybrene. After 4 h of infection, the media was replaced with fresh media. 48 h later, media was replaced with media containing 3 μg/ml of puromycin. Media was replaced with fresh media containing puromycin every 3–4 days. After 2 weeks of puromycin selection, the cells were grown out from single cell colonies and screened for luciferase expression. Stably transduced luciferase HEK-293T cells were plated in 96-well plates 24 h prior to treatment with 100 μm Cbz-B3A, amine-B3A, acetyl-B3A, and Cbz-acetyl. After 4 h, cells were harvested and measured with Luciferase Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. Before the addition of luciferin, the protein concentration was measured by removing 2 μl of lysate from each well and adding it to diluted Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate, and the absorbance was measured at A595. The protein concentration was used to normalize the luciferase signal. For translation assays, cells were pretreated for 15 min with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide or 6 μm bortezomib. For the recombinant luciferase assay, Quantilum Recombinant Luciferase (Promega) was diluted 1:250,000 in reporter lysis buffer with 1 mg/ml of BSA, then mixed 1:1 with 200 μm compound in the same buffer for a final dilution of 1:500,000 and 100 μm compound in 20 μl. This was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then measured with a Luciferase Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the luciferase half-life experiment, stably transduced luciferase HEK-293T cells were plated in a 96-well black plate with a clear bottom at 5,000 cells/well 24 h before the experiment. Cells were incubated for 4 h with the indicated concentrations of Cbz-B3A, then the media was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Sigma), 1× GlutaMax (Gibco), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Gibco), 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide, the indicated concentration of Cbz-B3A, and 1 mm d-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology). Real-time PCR was conducted on a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000. RNA was reverse transcribed and cDNA was amplified with iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Firefly luciferase was amplified using primers 5′-CTCACTGAGACTACATCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCAGATCCACAACCTTCGC. Renilla luferase was amplified using primers 5′-GGAATTATAATGCTTATCTACGTGC-3′ and 5′-CTTGCGAAAAATGAAGACCTTTTAC-3′. Actin was amplified using primers 5′-GGCATGGGTCAGAAGGATT-3′ and 5′-GGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAA-3′. pRSV-Renilla, which was a gift from Dr. Michael Marr, was transfected into HEK-293T cells with TransIt 2020 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection and plated into a 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. The media was removed 24 h later and replaced by media containing 100 μm Cbz-B3A or DMSO and the cells were treated for 4 h. After treatment, cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), then substrate was added and Renilla luciferase was measured on a luminometer. For the substrate, 10 μl of 10 mm coelenterazine (Gold Biotechnology) dissolved in acidified ethanol was added to 1 ml of Renilla buffer (25 mm Na4PPi, 10 mm NaOAc, 15 mm EDTA, 0.5 m Na2SO4, 1.0 m NaCl, pH 5.0). 80,000 cells/well of HEK-293T cells were plated into 24-well plates 24 h before the assay. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of compound for 4 h. After 4 h, the media was removed and replaced with DMEM without methionine and cysteine (Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.2 mCi/ml of EXPRESS [35S] protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10% dialyzed FBS (Pierce), 1× GlutaMax (Gibco), 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Gibco), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), and the indicated concentration of compound. After 1 h, this media was removed, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed with low deoxycholate RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 500 μm EGTA, 1× Roche Complete protease inhibitors, 1:100 Benzonase, pH 8.0). Lysate was centrifuged at maximum speed for 20 min at 4 °C. The concentration was measured by a Bradford assay. 10 μg of lysate was added to 100 μl of ice-cold 1 mg/ml of BSA with 0.02% sodium azide. 1 ml of ice-cold 10% TCA was added, the solutions were mixed and incubated on ice for 0.5 h. These mixtures were vacuum filtered onto GF/C Whatman glass microfiber filters. The filters were washed with 2× 5 ml of 10% TCA, then 2× 3 ml of ethanol. The filters were then dried for one-half h. The filters were placed into scintillation vials with 5 ml of scintillation fluid and read on a scintillation counter. HEK-293T cells were grown in DMEM minus l-lysine and l-arginine (Thermo Scientific Pierce) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS for SILAC (Pierce), 1× GlutaMax (Gibco), 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Gibco) and either 84 μg/ml of [13C/15N]l-arginine and 146 μg/ml of [13C/15N]l-lysine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) or 84 μg/ml of l-arginine and 146 μg/ml of l-lysine (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for a minimum of 6 passages. Cells were lysed by 3 quick freeze/thaws in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 200 μm sodium vanadate and used for pulldowns. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Thermo Orbitrap Elite and Thermo XL-ETD Orbitrap microcapillary LC-MS/MS. The false discovery rate was set to 0.01 (1%) for peptide and protein identifications. To determine SILAC ratios, a minimum of two ratio counts between SILAC peptide pairs was required. NHS-activated Sepharose 4 fast flow beads (GE Healthcare) were added to screw cap spin columns (Pierce) washed with phosphate buffer. Amine-acetyl or amine-B3A was dissolved in ethanol at 5 mm then diluted 5-fold into 100 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, to reach a concentration of 1 mm compound in buffer. 1 mm amine-acetyl or amine-B3A was added to beads and rotated overnight at room temperature. Afterward, the beads were blocked with 100 mm ethanolamine for 3 h. The manufacturer's protocol was followed thereafter. Briefly, HEK-293T cells were lysed by 3 quick freeze/thaws in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 200 μm sodium vanadate. Lysate was added to the beads at 3 μg/μl and rotated for 30 min at room temperature, then washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and inhibitors and eluted with 1× Laemmli loading buffer at 65 °C for 20 min. CETSA was performed as previously described (42Martinez Molina D. Jafari R. Ignatushchenko M. Seki T. Larsson E.A. Dan C. Sreekumar L. Cao Y. Nordlund P. Monitoring drug target engagement in cells and tissues using the cellular thermal shift assay.Science. 2013; 341: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were lysed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with Roche Complete protease inhibitor by 3 quick freeze thaws, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was adjusted to 4 mg/ml. Lysate was incubated with compound for 30 min and heated to different temperatures in a thermal cycler for 3 min, then cooled to room temperature for 3 min. All samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and a Western blot was run on the supernatant. ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA for ubiquilin 1 (catalogue number L012942-00-0005), ubiquilin 2 (L013566-00-0005), and ubiquilin 4 (L021178-01-0005) were obtained from Dharmacon and transfected into HEK-293T cells with DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection and analyzed by Western blot. To determine cellular growth, a CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) was used per the manufacturer's instructions. To determine cytotoxicity, LDH release was measured with the LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For 4-h assays, 96-well plates were seeded at 75,000 cells/ml for BaF3/p210 cells or K562 cells. For HEK-293T cells, 10,000 cells/well were plated 24 h before treatment. Cells were treated for 4 h at 37 °C and 50 μl was removed from every well and used in the LDH cytotoxicity assay per the manufacturer's protocol. For 48 h assays, 7,500 cells/ml of BaF3/p210 or K562 cells were incubated with compound at 37 °C for 48 h (200 μl/well). For HEK-293T cells, 1,000 cells/well were plated 24 h prior to compound treatment. After treatment, 50 μl was removed from each well for the LDH assay for all cell lines and 100 μl of mixed cells were removed and used with the CellTiter-Glo kit for K562 and BaF3/p210 cells. For HEK-293T cells, wells were treated as directed with the Cel"
https://openalex.org/W2222313681,"The paradigm of chronobiology is based almost wholly upon the daily biological clock, or circadian rhythm, which has been the focus of intense molecular, cellular, pharmacological, and behavioral, research. However, the circadian rhythm does not explain biological timings related to fundamental aspects of life history such as rates of tissue/organ/body size development and control of the timing of life stages such as gestation length, age at maturity, and lifespan. This suggests that another biological timing mechanism is at work. Here we focus on a ""many days"" (multidien) chronobiological period first observed as enigmatic recurring growth lines in developing mammalian tooth enamel that is strongly associate with all adult tissue, organ, and body masses as well as life history attributes such as gestation length, age at maturity, weaning, and lifespan, particularly among the well studied primates. Yet, knowledge of the biological factors regulating the patterning of mammalian life, such as the development of body size and life history structure, does not exist. To identify underlying molecular mechanisms we performed metabolome and genome analyses from blood plasma in domestic pigs. We show that blood plasma metabolites and small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) drawn from 33 domestic pigs over a two-week period strongly oscillate on a 5-day multidien rhythm, as does the pig enamel rhythm. Metabolomics and genomics pathway analyses actually reveal two 5-day rhythms, one related to growth in which biological functions include cell proliferation, apoptosis, and transcription regulation/protein synthesis, and another 5-day rhythm related to degradative pathways that follows three days later. Our results provide experimental confirmation of a 5-day multidien rhythm in the domestic pig linking the periodic growth of enamel with oscillations of the metabolome and genome. This association reveals a new class of chronobiological rhythm and a snapshot of the biological bases that regulate mammalian growth, body size, and life history."
https://openalex.org/W2233247904,"The canonical Wnt signaling pathway, in which β-catenin nuclear localization is a crucial step, plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation. Pin1, a prolyl isomerase, is also known as a key enzyme in osteogenesis. However, the role of Pin1 in canonical Wnt signal-induced osteoblast differentiation is poorly understood. We found that Pin1 deficiency caused osteopenia and reduction of β-catenin in bone lining cells. Similarly, Pin1 knockdown or treatment with Pin1 inhibitors strongly decreased the nuclear β-catenin level, TOP flash activity, and expression of bone marker genes induced by canonical Wnt activation and vice versa in Pin1 overexpression. Pin1 interacts directly with and isomerizes β-catenin in the nucleus. The isomerized β-catenin could not bind to nuclear adenomatous polyposis coli, which drives β-catenin out of the nucleus for proteasomal degradation, which consequently increases the retention of β-catenin in the nucleus and might explain the decrease of β-catenin ubiquitination. These results indicate that Pin1 could be a critical target to modulate β-catenin-mediated osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2235975933,"Zinc finger ZRANB2 proteins are widespread in animals, but their functions and mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we clearly demonstrate that ZRANB2 is a newly identified LPS-binding protein present abundantly in the eggs/embryos of zebrafish. We also show that recombinant ZRANB2 (rZRANB2) acts as a pattern recognition receptor capable of identifying the bacterial signature molecule LPS as well as binding the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguilarum, and Aeromonas hydrophila and functions as an antibacterial effector molecule capable of directly killing the bacteria. Furthermore, we reveal that N-terminal residues 11–37 consisting of the first ZnF_RBZ domain are indispensable for ZRANB2 antimicrobial activity. Importantly, microinjection of rZRANB2 into early embryos significantly enhanced the resistance of the embryos against pathogenic A. hydrophila challenge, and this enhanced bacterial resistance was markedly reduced by co-injection of anti-ZRANB2 antibody. Moreover, precipitation of ZRANB2 in the embryo extracts by preincubation with anti-ZRANB2 antibody caused a marked decrease in the antibacterial activity of the extracts against the bacteria tested. In addition, the N-terminal peptide Z1/37 or Z11/37 with in vitro antibacterial activity also promoted the resistance of embryos against A. hydrophila, but the peptide Z38/198 without in vitro antibacterial activity did not. Collectively, these results indicate that ZRANB2 is a maternal LPS-binding protein that can protect the early embryos of zebrafish against pathogenic attacks, a novel role ever assigned to ZRANB2 proteins. This work also provides new insights into the immunological function of the zinc finger proteins that are widely distributed in various animals.

This work also provides new insights into the immunological function of the zinc finger proteins that are widely distributed in various animals. Embryos of most mammalian species including our human being develop in the uterus inside the mother's body and are thus well protected from pathogenic attacks. By contrast, the eggs of most fish are released and fertilized externally, and the resulting embryos/larvae are exposed to a hostile aquatic environment full of potential pathogens capable of causing various types of diseases (1Brock F.V.

For example, the bacterium Flavobacterium psychrophilum has been shown to be the cause of a bacterial cold water disease that can affect salmonids ranging from yolk sac to yearling fish (2Plumb J.A. Health Maintenance of Cultured Fishes: Principal Microbial Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994Google Scholar), and the virus Herpesvirus ictaluri is the cause of channel catfish virus disease, an acute viremia, which may result in high mortality and stunting of fry in juvenile channel catfish (3Plumb J.A. Epizootiology of channel catfish virus disease.Mar. Fish. Rev. 1978; 40: 26-29Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that exposure of salmon fry and juveniles to the Gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri causes the occurrence of enteric redmouth disease, leading to 60% mortality (4Haig S.J. Davies R.L. Welch T.J. Reese R.A. Verner-Jeffreys D.W.

However, early developing fish embryos/larvae have little or only limited ability to synthesize immune relevant molecules endogenously, and their lymphoid organs are not fully formed (5Ellis A.E.

Furthermore, the early embryonic developmental stage is one of the most vulnerable periods in the fish life history (7Zhang P. Zucchelli M. Bruce S. Hambiliki F. Stavreus-Evers A. Levkov L.

Transcriptome profiling of human pre-implantation development.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7844Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), making the embryos more susceptible to invading pathogens. How fish embryos/larvae survive the pathogenic attacks in such a hostile environment is an intriguing and thus far unsolved question. Fish eggs are in most cases cleidoic, i.e. in a closed free-living system post-fertilization; they are therefore supposed to depend upon the maternal provision of immune relevant molecules for protection against potential pathogens before full maturation of adaptive immune system (8Zhang S. Wang Z. Wang H. Maternal immunity in fish.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2013; 39: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the past 2 decades, the massive increase in aquaculture has put a greater emphasis on studies of the immune system and defense mechanisms against diseases associated with fish. As a result, a great progress has been made in recent years on the defense roles of maternally derived factors in embryos and larvae in fishes. It has been shown that maternal IgM is able to be transferred from mother to offspring in several fish species (9Bly J.E. Grimm A.S. Morris I.G.

Renal Physiol. 1997; 273: F731-F738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been isolated from a variety of vertebrates, including humans, mouse, rat, chicken, amphibians, and fish, and shown to be highly conserved among these species. Prior studies show that ZRANB2 proteins are co-immunoprecipitated with mRNAs and colocalized with the splicing factors SMN, U1–70K, U2AF35, and SC35, implying that ZRANB2 is a novel component of spliceosomes (38Adams D.J. van der Weyden L.

Recently, ZRANB2 has been characterized as a novel Smad-binding protein that suppresses bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling (40Ohte S. Kokabu S. Iemura S. Sasanuma H. Yoneyama K. Shin M. Suzuki S. Fukuda T. Nakamura Y. Jimi E. Natsume T. Katagiri T. Identification and functional analysis of Zranb2 as a novel Smad-binding protein that suppresses BMP signaling.J.

ZRANB2 localizes to supraspliceosomes and influences the alternative splicing of multiple genes in the transcriptome.Mol. Biol. Rep. 2013; 40: 5381-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our study is thus the first report to show that ZRANB2 plays an immunological role in animals. This provides a new angle for the study of the immune functions and mechanisms of zinc finger proteins that are widely present in various animals. Wild-type zebrafish Danio rerio were purchased from a local fish dealer and maintained in the containers with well aerated tap water at 27 ± 1 °C. The fishes were fed with live bloodworms and fish flakes (TetraMin) twice a day. Sexually mature D. rerio were placed in the late evening at a female to male ratio of 2:1, and the naturally fertilized eggs were collected early the next morning and cultured at 27 ± 1 °C until use. Lipopolysaccharide-conjugated affinity resin was prepared by coupling LPS (Sigma) from Escherichia coli O55:B5 with CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 300 embryos collected at cell stages 64 to 128 were washed three times with sterilized distilled water, homogenized, and centrifuged at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-mm pyrogen-free filter to remove insoluble substances. After the addition of protease inhibitors, the supernatant was loaded onto the column, which had been pre-equilibrated with the initial buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The column was washed with at least 10 column volumes of the initial buffer to remove the impurities. To recover proteins from the affinity matrix, the column was eluted with the elution buffer (4 m urea in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) as described by Chiou et al. (42Chiou S.T. Chen Y.W. Chen S.C.

The effluent fractions containing the adsorbed proteins were pooled, desalted by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column, and then concentrated with an Ultrafree-MC 5,000 nominal molecular weight filter unit (Millipore). The entire isolation procedure was performed at 4 °C. The LPS-bound proteins obtained were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining according to the methods of Minoda et al. (43Minoda Y. Saeki K. Aki D. A novel Zinc finger protein, ZCCHC11, interacts with TIFA and modulates TLR signaling.Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 1023-1030Google Scholar) and Choi et al. (44Choi S. Baik J.E. Jeon J.H. Cho K. Seo D.G. Kum K.Y. Yun C.H. Han S.H. Identification of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins in human saliva.Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 2207-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometric analysis, the protein bands visualized with silver staining were cut from gels and digested with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega). MALDI/TOF MS analysis was performed on a Bruker Ultraflex MALDI/TOF MS mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) and searched against the nonredundant protein sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science). MALDI/TOF MS analysis revealed that one of the proteins was ZRANB2, which is highly conserved among different species (see below). To examine the distribution of ZRANB2 in the different tissues and at the different developmental stages, the kidney, heart, liver, spleen, gut, muscle, gill, eye, ovary, testis, brain, skin, and tail were dissected out of zebrafish, and the newly fertilized eggs and embryos were collected at 12 and 24 h post-fertilization (hpf). 3The abbreviations used are: hpf, hours post-fertilization; qRT-PCR, semiquantitative real time-PCR; WISH, whole-mount in situ hybridization; r, recombinant (e.g. rZRANB2); PRR, pattern recognition receptor; PDB, Protein Data Bank. All the samples were homogenized in PBS, pH 7.5, using a Polytron and sonicator, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (ComWin Biotech). The supernatants were loaded onto and run on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins on the gel were electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by a semi-dry technique, and the blotted membranes were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 2 h followed by incubation with rabbit anti-human ZRANB2 antibody (ZNF265 antibody, N-terminal region, ARP37747_T100) diluted 1: 800 with PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight. The antibody was prepared from the peptide RCGREKTTEAKMMKAGGTEIGKTLAEKSRGLFSANDWQCKTCSNVNWARR, which shares 98% conservation with the corresponding sequence of zebrafish ZRANB2 (Aviva Systems Biology). After a thorough washing in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (ComWin Biotech) diluted 1:2000, at room temperature for 3 h. The bands were visualized using DAB (3,3′N-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) (ComWin Biotech). To examine the localization of ZRANB2 in cells, the embryos at desired stages were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight and frozen in prechilled acetone at −20 °C for 30 min. The embryos were washed four times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBST), blocked in PBST with 5% sheep serum, 1% BSA, and 1% dimethylsulfoxide for about 2 h, and then incubated with human anti-rabbit ZRANB2 antibody diluted 1:500 at 4 °C overnight. After washing four times with PBST for at least 1 h, the embryos were incubated in PBST with 5% sheep serum, 1% BSA, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody diluted 1:200 at 4 °C overnight. For control, the embryos were similarly washed and incubated with rabbit preimmune serum. To stain the nuclei, the embryos were counterstained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 10 min, washed in PBST for 10 min, and stored at 4 °C. The embryos/larvae were observed and photographed under a Leica confocal microscope. In parallel, 24-hpf larvae were fixed in 4% polyformaldehyde in PBS and precipitated in a 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, they were embedded in optical cutting temperature compound, and sections were cut at 14 μm thickness at −20 °C (Leica). The sections were stained as described above, observed, and photographed under a Leica confocal microscope. A total of 60 embryos/larvae of zebrafish was collected at about the 128-cell stage and ground in RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa). Total RNA were isolated from the ground samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (Omega). After digestion with recombinant DNase I (RNase-free) (TaKaRa) to eliminate genomic contamination, the cDNA were synthesized with a reverse transcription kit (TaKaRa) with an oligo(dT) primer. The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h and inactivated at 75 °C for 15 min. The cDNA were stored at −20 °C till used. Based on the sequence of zebrafish zranb2 (AAH52752.1) on NCBI, a primer pair, zranb2S and zranb2A, specific for zranb2 (Table 1), was designed using the Primer Premier program, version 5.0, and used for PCR to amplify the ZRANB2 cDNA using the RNA isolated above. The PCR protocol was as follows: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 37 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplification product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Tiangen Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions and transformed into Trans 5α bacteria (TransGen Biotech). The DNA inserts were sequenced to verify for authenticity.TABLE 1Sequences of the primers used in this studyPrimersSequences (5′-3′)For zranb2 cloningzranb2S (sense)TGTCGGGGAAGAGTTTTCGCGTTAGzranb2A (antisense)GACCGGGAACTTGGACAAATCTGCAFor qRT-PCRqzranb2S (sense)TTCGTGGGAAAACCAAGAAGGATAGqzranb2A (antisense)CTGCATCATCTTCATCATCATCATCβ-ActinS (sense)GATGCGGAAACTGGAAAGGGβ-ActinA (antisense)AGGAGGGCAAAGTGGTAAACGFor WISH-PCRwzranb2S (sense)TCGGGGAAGAGTTTTCGCGTTwzranb2A (antisense)AGACCGGGAACTTGGACAAATCTGCFor ZRANB2 expression in vitrorzranb2S (sense)GCGGATCCTCGGGGAAGAGTTTTCGCGTTrzranb2A (antisense)GCCAAGCTTGACCGGGAACTTGGACAAATCTGCAFor Z38/198 expression in vitroz38/198S (sense)GCGGATCCAAGACGACTGAAGCAAAGATGATGz38/198A (antisense)GCCAAGCTTGACCGGGAACTTGGACAAATCTGCAFor 16s rRNA of A. hydrophila16s rRNAS (sense)AACCCAACATCTCACGACAC16s rRNAA (antisense)AATACCGCATACGCCCTACFor qRT-PCR of 16s rRNA of A. hydrophilaq16s rRNAS (sense)GCCGGTGCTTATTCTGCAGCTAATGq16s rRNAA (antisense)GCCGGTGCTTATTCTGCAGCTAATG Open table in a new tab The ZRANB2 cDNA obtained was analyzed for coding probability with the DNASTAR software package, version 5.0, and the protein domain analyzed using the SMART program. The signal peptide prediction was conducted using the Signal P 3.0 server, and the molecular mass and isoelectronic point (pI) of the mature peptide were determined using ProtParam. The nuclear localization signal was predicted by PSORT II, and the three-dimensional structure prediction was performed by SWISS-MODEL online software at the Expert Protein Analysis System using residues 1–40 (PDB code: 1n0z.1.A) and residues 65–95 (PDB code: 2k1p.1.A) of human ZRANB2 as the model. Homology searches in the GenBankTM database were carried out using the BLAST server, and multiple alignments of the protein sequences were generated using the ClustalW program (45Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D.

The phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA, version 4.0, using p-distance based on the neighbor-joining method. The reliability of each node was estimated by bootstrapping with 1000 replications. Chromosomal locations of human (Homo sapiens), cow (Bos taurus), mouse (Mus musculus), frog (Xenopus tropicalis), and zebrafish (D. rerio) zranb2 genes were obtained from the Sequence Viewer and Ensembl genome browser. To detect the expression patterns of zranb2 in different tissues and at different developmental stages, the tissues including the kidney, heart, liver, spleen, gut, muscle, gill, eye, ovary, testis, brain, skin, and tail as well as the embryos/larvae, including the newly fertilized eggs, 4-, 16-, and 256-cell-stage embryos (∼1, 1.5, and 2.5 hpf), high blastula-stage embryos (∼3.5 hpf), 50% epiboly-stage embryos (∼5 hpf), 10-somite-stage embryos (∼15 hpf), 2-day-old larvae, and 3-day-old larvae, were sampled, ground in RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa), and stored at −70 °C until use. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were processed as described above. The semiquantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a final volume of 20 μl of the reaction mixture consisting of 10 μl of SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Tli RNase H Plus), 0.4 μl of ROX reference dye II, 0.5 μl of template, and each the sense and antisense primers (200 nm), qzranb2S and qzranb2A, specific for zranb2, designed using the Primer Premier program. The β-actin gene was chosen as the reference for internal standardization. All of the qRT-PCR experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated three times. The amplification was performed on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) initially at 95 °C for 15 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 35 s. The expression levels of zranb2 relative to that of the β-actin gene were calculated by the comparative Ct method (46Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔCt method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123143) Google Scholar). The embryos/larvae were collected at the 2-cell stage, 256-cell stage, 50% epiboly stage, 10-somite stage, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days post-fertilization. A fragment of zranb2 was PCR-amplified using the primer pair wzranb2S and wzranb2A (Table 1) and subcloned into vector pGEM-T. The constructed vector was digested by the NcoI enzyme, and the zranb2-specific antisense probe labeled with digoxigenin-linked nucleotides was synthesized by Sp6 RNA polymerase. WISH was performed as described by C. Thisse and B. Thisse (47Thisse C. Thisse B. High-resolution in situ hybridization to whole-mount zebrafish embryos.Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2223721207,"Submerged macrophytes are subjected to potential mechanical stresses associated with fluctuating water levels in natural conditions. However, few experimental studies have been conducted to further understand the effects of water level fluctuating amplitude on submerged macrophyte species and their assemblages or communities. We designed a controlled experiment to investigate the responses of three submerged macrophyte species (Hydrilla verticillata, Ceratophyllum demersum and Elodea nuttallii) and their combinations in communities to three amplitudes (static, ± 30 cm, ± 60 cm) of water level fluctuations. Results showed that water level fluctuating amplitude had little effects on the community performance and the three tested species responded differently. H. verticillata exhibited more growth in static water and it was negatively affected by either of the water level fluctuations amplitude, however, growth parameters of H. verticillata in two fluctuating water level treatments (i.e., ± 30 cm, ± 60 cm) were not significantly different. On the other hand, the growth of C. demersum was not significantly correlated with different amplitude treatments. However, it became more abundant when water levels fluctuated. E. nuttallii was inhibited by the two fluctuating water level treatments, and was less in growth parameters compared to the other species especially in water level fluctuating conditions. The inherent differences in the adaptive capabilities of the tested species indicate that C. demersum or other species with similar responses may be dominant species to restore submerged macrophyte communities with great fluctuating water levels. Otherwise, H. verticillata, E. nuttallii or other species with similar responses could be considered for constructing the community in static water conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2225750911,"Interferon alpha (IFNα) is routinely used in the clinical practice for adjuvant systemic melanoma therapy. Understanding the molecular mechanism of IFNα effects and prediction of response in the IFNα therapy regime allows initiation and continuation of IFNα treatment for responder and exclusion of non-responder to avoid therapy inefficacy and side-effects. The transporter protein associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP1) is part of the MHC class I peptide-loading complex, and important for antigen presentation in tumor and antigen presenting cells. In the context of personalized medicine, we address this potential biomarker TAP1 as a target of IFNα signalling.We could show that IFNα upregulates TAP1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with malignant melanoma receiving adjuvant high-dose immunotherapy. IFNα also induced expression of TAP1 in mouse blood and tumor tissue and suppressed the formation of melanoma metastasis in an in vivo B16 tumor model. Besides its expression, TAP binding affinity and transport activity is induced by IFNα in human monocytic THP1 cells. Furthermore, our data revealed that IFNα clearly activates phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in THP1 and A375 melanoma cells. Inhibition of Janus kinases abrogates the IFNα-induced TAP1 expression. These results suggest that the JAK/STAT pathway is a crucial mediator for TAP1 expression elicited by IFNα treatment.We suppose that silencing of TAP1 expression provides tumor cells with a mechanism to escape cytotoxic T-lymphocyte recognition. The observed benefit of IFNα treatment could be mediated by the shown dual effect of TAP1 upregulation in antigen presenting cells on the one hand, and of TAP1 upregulation in 'silent' metastatic melanoma cells on the other hand. In conclusion, this work contributes to a better understanding of the mode of action of IFNα which is essential to identify markers to predict, assess and monitor therapeutic response of IFNα treatment in the future."

Genetic variations in TLRs have been associated with the severity of viral bronchiolitis in infancy and with the later occurrence of post-bronchiolitis asthma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if there are any exploratory associations between TLR gene polymorphisms and lung function at 5 to 7 years of age in former bronchiolitis patients.We performed impulse oscillometry (IOS) at the median age of 6.3 years for 103 children who had been hospitalized for bronchiolitis at less than six months of age. The main parameters evaluated were airway resistance and reactance at 5Hz in baseline and post-exercise measurements. Data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of TLR1 rs5743618, TLR2 rs5743708, TLR6 rs5743810 and TLR10 rs4129009 (TLR2 subfamily) and TLR3 rs3775291, TLR4 rs4986790, TLR7 rs179008, TLR8 rs2407992 and TLR 9 rs187084 were available for analyses.The TLR4 rs4986790 wild genotype A/A was associated with a greater Rrs5 response (0.72 vs. -0.42, p = 0.03) to exercise. In TLR6 rs5743810, the minor allele T was associated with greater Rrs5 response (0.80 vs. -0.03, p = 0.04) to exercise. In TLR7 rs179008, the major allele A was associated with baseline decline in dRrs/df (-1.03 vs 0.61, p = 0.01) and increased Fres (2.28 vs. 0.89, p = 0.01) in girls.Among the nine studied TLRs, only TLR7 rs179008 showed some exploratory associations with post-bronchiolitis lung function deficiency, and polymorphisms of TLR4 rs4986790, and TLR6 rs5743810 in particular, with airway reactivity. These findings call for further confirmatory studies."
https://openalex.org/W2225130452,"Introduction Although selective reporting of clinical trial results introduces bias into evidence based clinical decision making, publication bias in pediatric epilepsy is unknown today. Since there is a considerable ambiguity in the treatment of an important and common clinical problem, pediatric seizures, we assessed the public availability of results of phase 3 clinical trials that evaluated treatments of seizures in children and adolescents as a surrogate for the extent of publication bias in pediatric epilepsy. Methods We determined the proportion of published and unpublished study results of phase 3 clinical trials that were registered as completed on ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, and Google Scholar for publications and contacted principal investigators or sponsors. The analysis was performed according to STROBE criteria. Results Considering studies that were completed before 2014 (N = 99), 75 (76%) pediatric phase 3 clinical trials were published but 24 (24%) remained unpublished. The unpublished studies concealed evidence from 4,437 patients. Mean time-to-publication was 25 SD ± 15.6 months, more than twice as long as mandated. Conclusion Ten years after the ICMJE’s clinical trials registration initiative there is still a considerable amount of selective reporting and delay of publication that potentially distorts the body of evidence in the treatment of pediatric seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2229579920,"Background Fortification of staple foods is considered an effective and safe strategy to combat micronutrient deficiencies, thereby improving health. While improving micronutrient status might be expected to have positive effects on immunity, some studies have reported increases in infections or inflammation after iron supplementation. Objective To study effects of micronutrient-fortified rice on hookworm infection in Cambodian schoolchildren. Methods A double-blinded, cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 16 Cambodian primary schools partaking in the World Food Program school meal program. Three types of multi-micronutrient fortified rice were tested against placebo rice within the school meal program: UltraRice_original, UltraRice_improved and NutriRice. Four schools were randomly assigned to each study group (placebo n = 492, UltraRice_original n = 479, UltraRice_improved n = 500, NutriRice n = 506). Intestinal parasite infection was measured in fecal samples by Kato-Katz method at baseline and after three and seven months. In a subgroup (N = 330), fecal calprotectin was measured by ELISA as a marker for intestinal inflammation. Results Baseline prevalence of hookworm infection was 18.6%, but differed considerably among schools (range 0%- 48.1%).Micronutrient-fortified rice significantly increased risk of new hookworm infection. This effect was modified by baseline hookworm prevalence at the school; hookworm infection risk was increased by all three types of fortified rice in schools where baseline prevalence was high (>15%), and only by UltraRice_original in schools with low baseline prevalence. Neither hookworm infection nor fortified rice was related to fecal calprotectin. Conclusions Consumption of rice fortified with micronutrients can increase hookworm prevalence, especially in environments with high infection pressure. When considering fortification of staple foods, a careful risk-benefit analysis is warranted, taking into account severity of micronutrient deficiencies and local prevalence of parasitic infections.

https://openalex.org/W1816288161,"In social networks, individuals constantly drop ties and replace them by new ones in a highly unpredictable fashion. This highly dynamical nature of social ties has important implications for processes such as the spread of information or of epidemics. Several studies have demonstrated the influence of a number of factors on the intricate microscopic process of tie replacement, but the macroscopic long-term effects of such changes remain largely unexplored. Here we investigate whether, despite the inherent randomness at the microscopic level, there are macroscopic statistical regularities in the long-term evolution of social networks. In particular, we analyze the email network of a large organization with over 1,000 individuals throughout four consecutive years. We find that, although the evolution of individual ties is highly unpredictable, the macro-evolution of social communication networks follows well-defined statistical patterns, characterized by exponentially decaying log-variations of the weight of social ties and of individuals' social strength. At the same time, we find that individuals have social signatures and communication strategies that are remarkably stable over the scale of several years."
https://openalex.org/W2228316342,"Objective To investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviors about use of child safety seats among parents of newborns and explore expectant mothers’ views and decisions regarding child safety seats use. Methods A cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview were conducted in the maternity departments of two hospitals in China. Parents of newborns were recruited after delivery and surveyed on their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding child safety seats use. Pregnant women were also interviewed to learn about their views and decisions regarding child safety seats use. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data collected. Results Of a total of 242 parents of newborns recruited in the quantitative survey, 202 (83.5%) parents had heard of child safety seats and 149 (61.6%) parents reported they would use child safety seats for their babies. Parents’ knowledge, car ownership, occupation, and income were significantly associated with their decision regarding use of child safety seats. Three themes were identified from the qualitative interview of 30 pregnant women: (1) the pregnant women perceived child passenger safety as important; (2) the car ownership and price and quality of child safety seats were major influencing factors of their decisions on use of child safety seats; and (3) lack of awareness and lack of laws requiring use were perceived to contribute to low use of child safety seats in China. Conclusion Lack of knowledge and awareness on child passenger safety were found to be two most important factors associated with low use of child safety seats. Effective interventions are urgently needed to improve parents’ knowledge before laws are enacted and implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2232376616,"Background Co-speech gestures are omnipresent and a crucial element of human interaction by facilitating language comprehension. However, it is unclear whether gestures also support language comprehension in aphasic patients. Using visual exploration behavior analysis, the present study aimed to investigate the influence of congruence between speech and co-speech gestures on comprehension in terms of accuracy in a decision task. Method Twenty aphasic patients and 30 healthy controls watched videos in which speech was either combined with meaningless (baseline condition), congruent, or incongruent gestures. Comprehension was assessed with a decision task, while remote eye-tracking allowed analysis of visual exploration. Results In aphasic patients, the incongruent condition resulted in a significant decrease of accuracy, while the congruent condition led to a significant increase in accuracy compared to baseline accuracy. In the control group, the incongruent condition resulted in a decrease in accuracy, while the congruent condition did not significantly increase the accuracy. Visual exploration analysis showed that patients fixated significantly less on the face and tended to fixate more on the gesturing hands compared to controls. Conclusion Co-speech gestures play an important role for aphasic patients as they modulate comprehension. Incongruent gestures evoke significant interference and deteriorate patients’ comprehension. In contrast, congruent gestures enhance comprehension in aphasic patients, which might be valuable for clinical and therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2229723945,"T-cell lymphopenia is a major risk factor for autoimmunity. Here we describe congenic Lewis (LEW) rats with a loss-of-function mutation in the Gimap5 gene, leading to a 92% reduction in peripheral T-cell numbers. Gimap5-deficient LEW rats developed eosinophilic autoimmune gastroenteritis accompanied by a 40-fold increase in IgE serum levels. This phenotype was ameliorated by antibiotic treatment, indicating a critical role of the microbial flora in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Interestingly, Gimap5-deficient LEW rats showed strongly aggravated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) after immunization with guinea pig myelin basic protein. This phenotype, however, persisted after antibiosis, confirming that the enhanced CNS autoimmune response in T-cell lymphopenic Gimap5-deficient LEW rats was unrelated to the composition of the microbial flora. Rather, it seems that it was caused by the 7-fold increase in the percentage of activated T cells producing IL-17 and IFN-γ, and the skewed T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, both of which were the result of T-cell lymphopenia and not affected by antibiosis. This notion was supported by the observation that adoptive T-cell transfer corrected the TCR repertoire and improved EAE. Collectively, our findings confirm a critical albeit differential role of T-cell lymphopenia in the susceptibility to organ-specific autoimmune responses.—Fischer, H.

https://openalex.org/W2237347256,"Amino-terminal regions of secretin-family peptides contain key determinants for biological activity and binding specificity, although the nature of interactions with receptors is unclear. A helix N-capping motif within this region has been postulated to directly contribute to agonist activity while also stabilizing formation of a helix extending toward the peptide carboxyl terminus and docking within the receptor amino terminus. We used cysteine trapping to systematically explore spatial approximations between cysteines replacing each residue in this motif of secretin (sec), Phe6, Thr7, and Leu10, and cysteines incorporated into the extracellular face of the receptor. Each peptide was a full agonist for cAMP, but had a lower binding affinity than natural hormone. These bound to COS cells expressing 61 receptor constructs incorporating cysteines in every position along each extracellular loop (ECL) and adjacent parts of transmembrane (TM) segments. Patterns of covalent labeling were distinct for each probe, with Cys6-sec labeling multiple residues in the carboxyl-terminal half of ECL2 and throughout ECL3, Cys7-sec predominantly labeling only single residues in the carboxyl-terminal end of ECL2 and the amino-terminal end of ECL3, and Cys10-sec not efficiently labeling any of these residues. These spatial constraints were used to refine our model of secretin bound to its receptor, now bringing ECL3 above the amino terminus of the ligand and revealing possible charge-charge interactions between this part of secretin and receptor residues in TM5, TM6, ECL2, and ECL3, which can orient and stabilize the peptide-receptor complex. This was validated by testing predicted approximations by mutagenesis and residue-residue complementation studies. Amino-terminal regions of secretin-family peptides contain key determinants for biological activity and binding specificity, although the nature of interactions with receptors is unclear. A helix N-capping motif within this region has been postulated to directly contribute to agonist activity while also stabilizing formation of a helix extending toward the peptide carboxyl terminus and docking within the receptor amino terminus.

Cellular mechanisms preventing genome instability are crucial to human health because genome instability is considered a hallmark of cancer. Collectively referred to as the DNA damage response, conserved pathways ensure proper DNA damage recognition and repair. The function of numerous DNA damage response components is fine-tuned by posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination. This not only involves the enzyme cascade responsible for conjugating ubiquitin to substrates but also requires enzymes that mediate directed removal of ubiquitin. Deubiquitinases remove ubiquitin from substrates to prevent degradation or to mediate signaling functions. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae deubiquitinase Ubp7 has been characterized previously as an endocytic factor. However, here we identify Ubp7 as a novel factor affecting S phase progression after hydroxyurea treatment and demonstrate an evolutionary and genetic interaction of Ubp7 with DNA damage repair pathways of homologous recombination and nucleotide excision repair. We find that deletion of UBP7 sensitizes cells to hydroxyurea and cisplatin and demonstrate that factors that stabilize replication forks are critical under these conditions. Furthermore, ubp7Δ cells exhibit an S phase progression defect upon checkpoint activation by hydroxyurea treatment. ubp7Δ mutants are epistatic to factors involved in histone maintenance and modification, and we find that a subset of Ubp7 is chromatin-associated. In summary, our results suggest that Ubp7 contributes to S phase progression by affecting the chromatin state at replication forks, and we propose histone H2B ubiquitination as a potential substrate of Ubp7.

Genome stability is constantly challenged by exogenous agents or by DNA damage that occurs as a result of endogenous processes such as cellular metabolism or replication (reviewed in Ref. 1Branzei D. Foiani M. Maintaining genome stability at the replication fork.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). If DNA damage is not detected and properly repaired in a timely fashion, then it can result in cell death or, in the case of erroneous repair, lead to mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and genome instability. Preventing genome instability is essential to human cells because it is considered an enabling characteristic of cancer (2Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42667) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a normal cell, multiple complex pathways function to detect and repair diverse types of DNA damage, collectively referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). 3The abbreviations used are: DDR, DNA damage response; SC, synthetic complete; YPD, yeast extract peptone dextrose; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; HR, homologous recombination; DUB, deubiquitinase; HU, hydroxyurea; NER, nucleotide excision repair; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ERC, evolutionary rate covariation; WB, Western blotting; TLS, translesion synthesis; Ub, ubiquitin. During S phase, replicative stress activates a signaling cascade, called the intra-S phase checkpoint, that inhibits cell cycle progression, late-origin firing, and homologous recombination (HR) while promoting the function of specific checkpoint and replication stress response factors (1Branzei D. Foiani M. Maintaining genome stability at the replication fork.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, hyperphosphorylation of the kinase Rad53 is central for checkpoint activation and mediates the downstream response. The DDR and multiple other cellular pathways depend on posttranslational modification of substrates with ubiquitin (3Bergink S. Jentsch S. Principles of ubiquitin and SUMO modifications in DNA repair.Nature. 2009; 458: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is facilitated by a sequential cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, which catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine residue or the N terminus of a substrate protein (4Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. N-terminal ubiquitination: more protein substrates join in.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 5Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination can target proteins to the 26S proteasome for degradation, have signaling functions, alter the subcellular localization, or change protein-protein interactions (5Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination, like phosphorylation, is a reversible posttranslational modification whereby ubiquitin is removed from cellular substrate proteins by specialized ubiquitin proteases or deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) (6Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mechanism and function of deubiquitinating enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). DUBs function in numerous cellular processes, such as the regulation of protein stability, cell cycle control, regulation of gene expression, membrane trafficking, and DNA repair (6Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mechanism and function of deubiquitinating enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 7Reyes-Turcu F.E. Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Regulation and cellular roles of ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinating enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 363-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In addition to cleaving and activating proubiquitin, DUBs recycle ubiquitin and, importantly, reverse substrate ubiquitination. Regulated ubiquitination and deubiquitination is crucial for the DDR. One well studied example is the deubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is fulfilled by budding yeast Ubp10 during S phase (8Gallego-Sánchez A. Andrés S. Conde F. San-Segundo P.A. Bueno A. Reversal of PCNA ubiquitylation by Ubp10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002826Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are five main DUB protein families: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases, ovarian tumor, Josephin domain, JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme, and the largest group, the ubiquitin-specific protease class (reviewed in Refs. 6Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mechanism and function of deubiquitinating enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 7Reyes-Turcu F.E. Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Regulation and cellular roles of ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinating enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 363-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, 16 DUBs of the Ubp family (ubiquitin-specific protease in mammals) have been identified (9Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Analysis of the deubiquitinating enzymes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), among them Ubp7. Although overall the function of Ubp7 is not fully understood, it has been characterized as a late-arriving endocytic protein (10Weinberg J.S. Drubin D.G. Regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by dynamic ubiquitination and deubiquitination.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 951-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that interacts with the endosomal sorting complex member Hse1 (11Ren J. Kee Y. Huibregtse J.M. Piper R.C. Hse1, a component of the yeast Hrs-STAM ubiquitin-sorting complex, associates with ubiquitin peptidases and a ligase to control sorting efficiency into multivesicular bodies.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and can deubqiuitinate the early endocytic protein Ede1 (10Weinberg J.S. Drubin D.G. Regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis by dynamic ubiquitination and deubiquitination.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 951-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Additionally, there is some evidence that Ubp7 may be involved in the DDR. First, Ubp7 has been found to interact with the Cdc48 cofactor Doa1/Ufd3 upon MMS treatment and to partially rescue the DNA damage sensitivity of doa1Δ mutants (12Lis E.T. Romesberg F.E. Role of Doa1 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA damage response.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4122-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Second, UBP7 has been identified as a weak high-copy suppressor of srs2Δ elg1Δ (13Gazy I. Liefshitz B. Bronstein A. Parnas O. Atias N. Sharan R. Kupiec M. A genetic screen for high copy number suppressors of the synthetic lethality between elg1Δ and srs2Δ in yeast.G3. 2013; 3: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that deletion of UBP7 sensitizes yeast cells toward the DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea (HU) and cisplatin, suggesting that Ubp7 plays a role in the DDR. Furthermore, we find that ubp7 mutants have evolutionary and genetic interactions with the DNA repair subpathways of HR and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Finally, we provide evidence that Ubp7 is involved in the control of S phase progression following HU treatment and the intra-S phase checkpoint, likely by contributing to replication fork speed through alteration of the surrounding chromatin state. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Unless noted otherwise, all strains were derivatives of W303 (14Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Elevated recombination rates in transcriptionally active DNA.Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 15Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. A suppressor of two essential checkpoint genes identifies a novel protein that negatively affects dNTP pools.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Media and plates were prepared according to standard protocols but with twice the amount of leucine (16Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast transformation and epitope tagging were carried out as described previously (17Janke C. Magiera M.M.

The indicated amounts of hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) were added directly to SC-agar, whereas cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved at 100 mg/ml in DMSO prior to addition to cooled SC-agar (pH 5.8). Cultures of the indicated yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in SC (for dilution on SC plates) or YPD to log phase and diluted to a starting A600 of 0.2. 5-Fold serial dilutions in H2O were plated on the appropriate plates and incubated at 30 °C for 2 (YPD) or 3 (SC + HU) days. UV and γ irradiation were performed after dilutions of yeast cultures had been spotted on plates. Cisplatin plates were stored in the dark. WT, ubp7Δ, and rad51Δ cells were grown overnight to stationary phase in 3 ml of YPD medium at 30 °C, diluted to an A600 of 0.2, and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. The culture was diluted to an A600 of 0.5 and subsequently diluted 1:2000. 250 μl was plated onto YPD medium or YPD medium containing 10, 50, or 100 mm HU. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h and photographed. The surviving colonies were counted and compared with their corresponding untreated YPD control plates. The experiment was done in triplicate, with three individual clones per genotype analyzed per trial. ERC values compare sequence evolution rates for two proteins along all branches of a multispecies phylogenetic tree. Specifically, the ERC statistic is calculated between each protein pair as the correlation coefficient of their branch-specific rates. Rate of change is calculated using a projection operation to normalize branch lengths against the underlying species tree (19Sato T. Yamanishi Y. Kanehisa M. Toh H. The inference of protein-protein interactions by co-evolutionary analysis is improved by excluding the information about the phylogenetic relationships.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ERC values were calculated using protein sequences from 18 yeast species (20Clark N.L. Alani E. Aquadro C.F. Evolutionary rate covariation reveals shared functionality and coexpression of genes.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Ubp7 protein was compared with genes within diverse DNA repair pathways by calculating the ERC values between it and their constituent genes as annotated in the Gene Ontology through YeastMine (19Sato T. Yamanishi Y. Kanehisa M. Toh H. The inference of protein-protein interactions by co-evolutionary analysis is improved by excluding the information about the phylogenetic relationships.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Balakrishnan R.

The ERC values for these pathways can be found in their entirety in supplemental Table S2. Statistical significance of a relationship between Ubp7 and a pathway was determined by comparing Ubp7 ERC values with a specific DNA repair pathway to the background genome distribution using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The direct repeat assay was performed as described previously (22Godin S. Wier A. Kabbinavar F. Bratton-Palmer D.S. Ghodke H. Van Houten B. VanDemark A.P. Bernstein K.A.

Lisby M. Rothstein R. Genome-wide analysis of Rad52 foci reveals diverse mechanisms impacting recombination.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e228Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, nine single yeast colonies of each strain were grown in 2 ml of SC medium and plated on SC plates and SC plates lacking leucine. The average recombination rate and standard deviation over five independent trials were calculated according to Ref. 24Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. The distribution of the numbers of mutants in bacterial populations.J. Genet. 1949; 49: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar. The assays with HU (35 mm) and cisplatin (10 μg/ml) treatment were conducted in an identical fashion, but the cultures were treated with the indicated drug doses for 26 h before plating. The experiments were performed in quadruplicate. For the CAN1 mutation assay, five individual colonies of each genotype were grown in 2 ml of SC medium and plated on SC plates and SC plates lacking arginine supplemented with 60 mg/liter L-canavanine (Sigma-Aldrich). The median mutation frequency per trial was used to determine the depicted mean frequency ± S.D. from three independent trials. The respective yeast cultures were grown in SC with adenine (100 mg/l) at room temperature and, when applicable, treated with 100 mm HU (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. Prior to microscopy, 1 ml of yeast culture was harvested (1500 g, 2 min, room temperature), mixed with an equal volume of liquid 1.4% agarose (in SC medium), and mounted on slides. Images were acquired using a Nikon TiE inverted live-cell system with a ×100 oil immersion objective (1.45 numerical aperture), a Photometrics HQ2 camera, and motorized Prior Z stage. For individual strains, stacks of 11 0.3-μm sections were captured using the following exposure times for the respective fluorophore: differential interference contrast, 60 ms; Rfa1-YFP, 1 s. Nikon Elements software (Nikon Instruments) was used for acquisition and analysis. Images were exported from Nikon Elements as 8-bit RGB TIF files and enhanced for contrast and brightness using Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). All images depicted in one panel were adjusted in an identical fashion. For analysis of focus formation, all 11 z slices of each image (3 μm in total) were analyzed manually for foci. To be counted as a focus, the signal had to be visible in at least two to three consecutive planes. Single z slices are depicted in the figures. Yeast whole-cell lysates were prepared by TCA precipitation as described in Ref. 18Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Epitope tagging of yeast genes using a PCR-based strategy: more tags and improved practical routines.Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar. Lysates were loaded on 8%, 10%, or 15% Tris/glycine gels or 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (Invitrogen) in MOPS buffer and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and incubated with primary antibody overnight. Exposed films of Western blotting analyses were scanned and adjusted for contrast and brightness using Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.). Alternatively, the chemiluminescent signal was captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Bio-Rad, Geldoc XR+). Quantification of the scanned images was performed using ImageJ (25Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34883) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: Myc (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-40, 1:500, WB), Clb2 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-9071, 1:2000, WB), HA (rabbit polyclonal, catalog no. sc-805, and mouse monoclonal, catalog no. sc-7392 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000, WB), histone H3 total (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 9715, 1:1000, WB), histone H2B total (rabbit polyclonal, Active Motif, catalog no. 39237, 1:5000, WB), ubiquityl-histone H2B (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 5546, 1:1000, WB), Kar2 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-33630, 1:5000, WB), Adh1 (rabbit, Chemicon, catalog no.

Essentially, this assay was performed according to Refs. 26Liang C. Stillman B.

Cultures of an UBP7–3HA strain were grown to log phase and, for the cell cycle-synchronized samples, arrested for 3 h with 10 μm α factor (Genescript), 200 mm HU (Sigma-Aldrich), or 15 μg/ml nocodazole (Enzo Life Sciences). Approximately 30 A were harvested, resuspended, and incubated in prespheroplast buffer (100 mm PIPES/KOH (pH 9.4), 10 mm DTT, and 0.1% NaN3) for 10 min at room temperature. The pellet was then spheroplasted using Zymolyase (20 mg/ml, 100T, Amsbio) in spheroplast buffer (50 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 0.6 m sorbitol, and 10 mm DTT) for 40 min at 37 °C. Harvested spheroplasts were washed, resuspended in an equal volume of extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 m sorbitol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors (Roche complete), and 2 mm PMSF) and lysed on ice by increasing the Triton X-100 concentration to 1% and vortexing. A sample for the whole-cell extract was taken prior to adding the extract on the half volume of sucrose cushion (extraction buffer, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 30% sucrose). Soluble and chromatin fractions were separated by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min). FACS and two-dimensional gel analysis were performed as described previously (28Szakal B. Branzei D. Premature Cdk1/Cdc5/Mus81 pathway activation induces aberrant replication and deleterious crossover.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) following treatment of yeast cultures with 200 mm HU as indicated. To investigate the role of Ubp7 in the DDR, we first used ERC to infer which DNA repair pathways have evolutionary histories resembling Ubp7 (Fig. 1a). ERC is a statistic of correlation between the species-specific evolutionary rates of two proteins as measured across several species (20Clark N.L. Alani E. Aquadro C.F. Evolutionary rate covariation reveals shared functionality and coexpression of genes.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Clark N.L. Aquadro C.F. A novel method to detect proteins evolving at correlated rates: identifying new functional relationships between coevolving proteins.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27: 1152-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Typically, functionally related protein pairs, such as those in a shared pathway or complex, have elevated ERC values relative to random pairs, and such ERC signatures have guided DNA repair research in previous studies (30Clark N.L. Alani E. Aquadro C.F. Evolutionary rate covariation in meiotic proteins results from fluctuating evolutionary pressure in yeasts and mammals.Genetics. 2013; 193: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Godin S.K. Meslin C. Kabbinavar F. Bratton-Palmer D.S. Hornack C. Mihalevic M.J. Yoshida K. Sullivan M. Clark N.L. Bernstein K.A. Evolutionary and functional analysis of the invariant SWIM domain in the conserved Shu2/SWS1 protein family from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Homo sapiens.Genetics. 2015; 199: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We compiled sets of proteins participating in specific DNA damage response pathways: HR, NER, base excision repair, mismatch repair, and non-homologous end joining. We also analyzed endocytosis because of the reported role of Ubp7 in this process. When comparing the evolutionary rates of Ubp7 to these gene sets across 18 yeast species, it is clear that Ubp7 has a strong evolutionary association with proteins involved in HR and NER (Fig. 1a; HR, p = 6.01 × 10−5; NER, p = 9.92 × 10−5; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; supplemental Table S2). Because Ubp7 is evolutionarily correlated with the HR and NER DNA repair pathways (Fig. 1a), we next tested whether deletion of UBP7 would sensitize yeast cells to different forms of DNA damage. Although ubp7Δ mutants are HU-sensitive, they do not exhibit a pronounced growth defect on plates containing MMS (Fig. 1b). The HU sensitivity of ubp7-null cells was also evident in viability assays (Fig. 1d) and by decreased colony size (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, HU and MMS interfere with replication fork progression differently. HU is thought to cause prolonged stalling and reduce replication fork speed, whereas MMS is an alkylating agent (reviewed in Ref. 32Hustedt N. Gasser S.M. Shimada K. Replication checkpoint: tuning and coordination of replication forks in S phase.Genes. 2013; 4: 388-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggests that Ubp7 may be involved in the cellular response to replication fork stalling but not to other forms of replicative damage that could also induce double strand break formation. In line with a specific function of Ubp7 in a DNA damage response subpathway is our finding that the ubp7-null strain is also not sensitive to γ or UV radiation (Figs. 1b and 2a). In cells, HR, NER, and translesion synthesis (TLS) function together to enable the repair of complex types of DNA damage such as intra- and interstrand cross-links. Because we found that UBP7 coevolved with two of these particular pathways, we determined the sensitivity of ubp7Δ toward a DNA cross-linking agent. Indeed, we found that ubp7Δ is modestly sensitive to cisplatin (Fig. 1c). Overall, these observed sensitivities support the in silico evolutionary analysis and suggest that Ubp7 affects specific DNA damage response and/or repair pathways. Given the role of NER in repairing cisplatin-induced DNA lesions, we next tested whether Ubp7 is a component of the NER pathway. To do so, we analyzed the UV sensitivity of a UBP7 deletion (Fig. 2a) and the genetic interactions of ubp7Δ with two mutants of the NER pathway: rad4Δ and rad7Δ (Fig. 2b). Rad4 (Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C) and Rad23 comprise the nuclear excision repair factor 2 (NEF2) complex, which functions to detect and repair UV-damaged DNA (33Guzder S.N. Sung P.

NEF2 is required for the early incision step of NER, and, consistently, rad4Δ mutants are very sensitive to UV irradiation (35Bankmann M. Prakash L. Prakash S.

The isolation, genetics and survival characteristics of ultraviolet light-sensitive mutants in yeast.Mutat. Res. 1968; 6: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). Rad7, together with Rad16, forms the NEF4 complex, which binds to NEF2 and enhances its activity. In contrast to NEF2, NEF4 is not strictly required for the incision step of NER and likely acts on post-incision steps (37Reed S.H. You Z. Friedberg E.C. The yeast RAD7 and RAD16 genes are required for postincision events during nucleotide excision repair: in vitro and in vivo studies with rad7 and rad16 mutants and purification of a Rad7/Rad16-containing protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29481-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), consistent with its less pronounced UV sensitivity (36Cox B.S. Parry J.M. The isolation, genetics and survival characteristics of ultraviolet light-sensitive mutants in yeast.Mutat. Res. 1968; 6: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). Most deletion mutants of NER pathway members are UV-sensitive to varying degrees. We did not detect any UV sensitivity of ubp7Δ alone (Fig. 2a), indicating that Ubp7 is likely not a central component of UV-induced NER. However, rad4Δ ubp7Δ and rad7Δ ubp7Δ mutants do exhibit a very slight but reproducible synthetic sensitivity on cisplatin-containing medium (Fig. 2b). Therefore, Ubp7 may function in an additional pathway required for processing cisplatin-induced damage in the absence of Rad4/Rad7. One of the complex lesions that arise from cisplatin treatment is interstrand cross-links (ICLs). In contrast to humans, where the Fanconi anemia pathway has been well characterized to act on this type of DNA damage, yeast has fewer known factors that are specialized in repairing this type of lesion (38McHugh P.J.

Particularly in recommender systems, it directly influences the accuracy of the recommendation. Though many methods have been presented, most of these have only focused on how to improve the recommendation results. In this paper, we introduce an empirical study of user preferences based on a set of rating data about movies. We develop a simple statistical method to investigate the characteristics of user preferences. We find that the movies have potential characteristics of closure, which results in the formation of numerous cliques with a power-law size distribution. We also find that a user related to a small clique always has similar opinions on the movies in this clique. Then, we suggest a user preference model, which can eliminate the predictions that are considered to be impracticable. Numerical results show that the model can reflect user preference with remarkable accuracy when data elimination is allowed, and random factors in the rating data make prediction error inevitable. In further research, we will investigate many other rating data sets to examine the universality of our findings."

Chronic HCV infection promotes insulin resistance rather than beta-cell dysfunction. The objective was to elucidate whether a conversion from tacrolimus to cyclosporine A affects fasting and/or dynamic insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion or all in HCV-positive renal transplant recipients. Methods In this prospective, single-center study 10 HCV-positive renal transplant recipients underwent 2h-75g-oral glucose tolerance tests before and three months after the conversion of immunosuppression from tacrolimus to cyclosporine A. Established oral glucose tolerance test-based parameters of fasting and dynamic insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were calculated. Data are expressed as median (IQR). Results After conversion, both fasting and challenged glucose levels decreased significantly. This was mainly attributable to a significant amelioration of post-prandial dynamic glucose sensitivity as measured by the oral glucose sensitivity-index OGIS [422.17 (370.82–441.92) vs. 468.80 (414.27–488.57) mL/min/m2, p = 0.005), which also resulted in significant improvements of the disposition index (p = 0.017) and adaptation index (p = 0.017) as markers of overall glucose tolerance and beta-cell function. Fasting insulin sensitivity (p = 0.721), insulinogenic index as marker of first-phase insulin secretion [0.064 (0.032–0.106) vs. 0.083 (0.054–0.144) nmol/mmol, p = 0.093) and hepatic insulin extraction (p = 0.646) remained unaltered. No changes of plasma HCV-RNA levels (p = 0.285) or liver stiffness (hepatic fibrosis and necroinflammation, p = 0.463) were observed after the conversion of immunosuppression. Conclusions HCV-positive renal transplant recipients show significantly improved glucose-stimulated insulin sensitivity and overall glucose tolerance after conversion from tacrolimus to cyclosporine A. Considering the HCV-induced insulin resistance, HCV-positive renal transplant recipients may benefit from a cyclosporine A-based immunosuppressive regimen.

https://openalex.org/W2222240670,"Mechanistic modeling of DNA double strand break (DSB) rejoining is important for quantifying and medically exploiting radiation-induced cytotoxicity (e.g. in cancer radiotherapy). Most radiation-induced DSBs are quickly-rejoinable and are rejoined within the first 1-2 hours after irradiation. Others are slowly-rejoinable (persist for several hours), and yet others are essentially unrejoinable (persist for >24 hours). The dependences of DSB rejoining kinetics on radiation dose and dose rate remain incompletely understood. We hypothesize that the fraction of slowly-rejoinable and/or unrejoinable DSBs increases with increasing dose/dose rate. This radiation-dependent (RD) model was implemented using differential equations for three DSB classes: quickly-rejoinable, slowly-rejoinable and unrejoinable. Radiation converts quickly-rejoinable to slowly-rejoinable, and slowly-rejoinable to unrejoinable DSBs. We used large published data sets on DSB rejoining in yeast exposed to sparsely-ionizing (electrons and γ-rays, single or split-doses, high or low dose rates) and densely-ionizing (α-particles) radiation to compare the performances of the proposed RD formalism and the established two-lesion kinetic (TLK) model. These yeast DSB rejoining data were measured within the radiation dose range relevant for clonogenic cell survival, whereas in mammalian cells DSB rejoining is usually measured only at supra-lethal doses for technical reasons. The RD model described both sparsely-ionizing and densely-ionizing radiation data much better than the TLK model: by 217 and 14 sample-size-adjusted Akaike information criterion units, respectively. This occurred because: the RD (but not the TLK) model reproduced the observed upwardly-curving dose responses for slowly-rejoinable/unrejoinable DSBs at long times after irradiation; the RD model adequately described DSB yields at both high and low dose rates using one parameter set, whereas the TLK model overestimated low dose rate data. These results support the hypothesis that DSB rejoining is progressively impeded at increasing radiation doses/dose rates."
