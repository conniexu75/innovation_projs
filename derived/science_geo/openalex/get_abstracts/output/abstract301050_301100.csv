There are several important aspects of this proposed legislation which merit consideration, notably (1) How great is the actual need? and (2) Who would actually be covered by the proposed measure?1. The need for subsidized hospitalization and medical care is believed to be distinctly limited. A national study of the total life situation of those 65 and over (by Wiggins and Schoeck) showed that 90 per cent of the respondents reported no unmet medical needs of which they were aware. About 96 per cent reported no medical debts. This would leave presumably 4 per cent with such debts.2. The proposed legislation would cover those eligible for benefits under the Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act, but not other elderly persons. The Wiggins-Schoeck Report has been bitterly assailed by supporters of H.R. 4222 as being nonrepresentative and incomplete. Its authors (in a recent letter to Science) point out that it is indeed representative of the older population currently designated in H.R. 4222, and that it intentionally omitted those segments which would not be covered by H.R. 4222. In other words the data on needs of elderly persons as uncovered by Wiggins and Schoeck is pertinent to the legislation at hand. For this reason it is believed that physicians will be interested in reading the reply of these authors to the criticisms of their survey.With the permission of Science and of the authors, it is reprinted herewith."
