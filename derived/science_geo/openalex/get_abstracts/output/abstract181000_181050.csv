https://openalex.org/W2104382960,"The DJ-1 gene encodes a ubiquitous, highly conserved protein. Here, we show that DJ-1 mutations are associated with PARK7, a monogenic form of human parkinsonism. The function of the DJ-1 protein remains unknown, but evidence suggests its involvement in the oxidative stress response. Our findings indicate that loss of DJ-1 function leads to neurodegeneration. Elucidating the physiological role of DJ-1 protein may promote understanding of the mechanisms of brain neuronal maintenance and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2167437752,"High levels of arsenic in well water are causing widespread poisoning in Bangladesh. In a typical aquifer in southern Bangladesh, chemical data imply that arsenic mobilization is associated with recent inflow of carbon. High concentrations of radiocarbon-young methane indicate that young carbon has driven recent biogeochemical processes, and irrigation pumping is sufficient to have drawn water to the depth where dissolved arsenic is at a maximum. The results of field injection of molasses, nitrate, and low-arsenic water show that organic carbon or its degradation products may quickly mobilize arsenic, oxidants may lower arsenic concentrations, and sorption of arsenic is limited by saturation of aquifer materials."
https://openalex.org/W1985577573,"The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) is closely related to IL-2 and IL-15, and their receptors all share the common cytokine receptor gamma chain, gammac, which is mutated in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease (XSCID). We demonstrate that, although mice deficient in the receptor for IL-21 (IL-21R) have normal lymphoid development, after immunization, these animals have higher production of the immunoglobulin IgE, but lower IgG1, than wild-type animals. Mice lacking both IL-4 and IL-21R exhibited a significantly more pronounced phenotype, with dysgammaglobulinemia, characterized primarily by a severely impaired IgG response. Thus, IL-21 has a significant influence on the regulation of B cell function in vivo and cooperates with IL-4. This suggests that these gammac-dependent cytokines may be those whose inactivation is primarily responsible for the B cell defect in humans with XSCID."

https://openalex.org/W2081901919,"The origin of the domestic dog from wolves has been established, but the number of founding events, as well as where and when these occurred, is not known. To address these questions, we examined the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation among 654 domestic dogs representing all major dog populations worldwide. Although our data indicate several maternal origins from wolf, &gt;95% of all sequences belonged to three phylogenetic groups universally represented at similar frequencies, suggesting a common origin from a single gene pool for all dog populations. A larger genetic variation in East Asia than in other regions and the pattern of phylogeographic variation suggest an East Asian origin for the domestic dog, ∼15,000 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W3205595473,"Two angiotensin II (Ang II)-specific receptors, AGTR1 and AGTR2, are expressed in the mammalian brain. Ang II actions on blood pressure regulation, water electrolyte balance, and hormone secretion are primarily mediated by AGTR1. The function of AGTR2 remains unclear. Here, we show that expression of the AGTR2 gene was absent in a female patient with mental retardation (MR) who had a balanced X;7 chromosomal translocation. Additionally, 8 of 590 unrelated male patients with MR were found to have sequence changes in the AGTR2 gene, including one frameshift and three missense mutations. These findings indicate a role for AGTR2 in brain development and cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2014895510,"The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) responds both to stretching of the cell membrane and to membrane depolarization. The crystal structure at 3.9 angstroms resolution demonstrates that Escherichia coli MscS folds as a membrane-spanning heptamer with a large cytoplasmic region. Each subunit contains three transmembrane helices (TM1, -2, and -3), with the TM3 helices lining the pore, while TM1 and TM2, with membrane-embedded arginines, are likely candidates for the tension and voltage sensors. The transmembrane pore, apparently captured in an open state, connects to a large chamber, formed within the cytoplasmic region, that connects to the cytoplasm through openings that may function as molecular filters. Although MscS is likely to be structurally distinct from other ion channels, similarities in gating mechanisms suggest common structural elements."
https://openalex.org/W2162634818,"Plasmas are an attractive medium for the next generation of particle accelerators because they can support electric fields greater than several hundred gigavolts per meter. These accelerating fields are generated by relativistic plasma waves-space-charge oscillations-that can be excited when a high-intensity laser propagates through a plasma. Large currents of background electrons can then be trapped and subsequently accelerated by these relativistic waves. In the forced laser wake field regime, where the laser pulse length is of the order of the plasma wavelength, we show that a gain in maximum electron energy of up to 200 megaelectronvolts can be achieved, along with an improvement in the quality of the ultrashort electron beam."
https://openalex.org/W1977083296,"Humans use multiple sources of sensory information to estimate environmental properties. For example, the eyes and hands both provide relevant information about an object's shape. The eyes estimate shape using binocular disparity, perspective projection, etc. The hands supply haptic shape information by means of tactile and proprioceptive cues. Combining information across cues can improve estimation of object properties but may come at a cost: loss of single-cue information. We report that single-cue information is indeed lost when cues from within the same sensory modality (disparity and texture gradients in vision) are combined, but not when different modalities (vision and haptics) are combined."

https://openalex.org/W2037228253,"We have analyzed the kinetics of assembly and elongation of the mammalian RNA polymerase I complex on endogenous ribosomal genes in the nuclei of living cells with the use of in vivo microscopy. We show that components of the RNA polymerase I machinery are brought to ribosomal genes as distinct subunits and that assembly occurs via metastable intermediates. With the use of computational modeling of imaging data, we have determined the in vivo elongation time of the polymerase, and measurements of recruitment and incorporation frequencies show that incorporation of components into the assembling polymerase is inefficient. Our data provide a kinetic and mechanistic framework for the function of a mammalian RNA polymerase in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2052813974,"Mitochondrial DNA sequences isolated from ancient dog remains from Latin America and Alaska showed that native American dogs originated from multiple Old World lineages of dogs that accompanied late Pleistocene humans across the Bering Strait. One clade of dog sequences was unique to the New World, which is consistent with a period of geographic isolation. This unique clade was absent from a large sample of modern dogs, which implies that European colonists systematically discouraged the breeding of native American dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2087583468,"Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is a mammalian transcription factor that binds DNA as an obligate dimeric partner of BMAL1 and is implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythm. Here we show that both PAS domains of NPAS2 bind heme as a prosthetic group and that the heme status controls DNA binding in vitro. NPAS2-BMAL1 heterodimers, existing in either the apo (heme-free) or holo (heme-loaded) state, bound DNA avidly under favorably reducing ratios of the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Low micromolar concentrations of carbon monoxide inhibited the DNA binding activity of holo-NPAS2 but not that of apo-NPAS2. Upon exposure to carbon monoxide, inactive BMAL1 homodimers were formed at the expense of NPAS2-BMAL1 heterodimers. These results indicate that the heterodimerization of NPAS2, and presumably the expression of its target genes, are regulated by a gas through the heme-based sensor described here."

https://openalex.org/W2070920868,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase, is released into the cytoplasm to induce cell death in response to apoptotic signals. However, the mechanisms underlying this process have not been resolved. We report that inactivation of the Caenorhabditis elegans AIF homolog wah-1 by RNA interference delayed the normal progression of apoptosis and caused a defect in apoptotic DNA degradation. WAH-1 localized in C. elegans mitochondria and was released into the cytosol and nucleus by the BH3-domain protein EGL-1 in a caspase (CED-3)-dependent manner. In addition, WAH-1 associated and cooperated with the mitochondrial endonuclease CPS-6/endonuclease G (EndoG) to promote DNA degradation and apoptosis. Thus, AIF and EndoG define a single, mitochondria-initiated apoptotic DNA degradation pathway that is conserved between C. elegans and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2131590555,The evolutionary history that led to Eocene-and-later primates of modern aspect (Euprimates) has been uncertain. We describe a skeleton of Paleocene plesiadapiform Carpolestes simpsoni that includes most of the skull and many postcranial bones. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Carpolestidae are closely related to Euprimates. C. simpsoni had long fingers and an opposable hallux with a nail. It lacked orbital convergence and an ankle specialized for leaping. We infer that the ancestor of Euprimates was primitively an arboreal grasper adapted for terminal branch feeding rather than a specialized leaper or visually directed predator.
https://openalex.org/W2079437483,"Large-scale, three-dimensional numerical simulations of the deflagration stage of a thermonuclear supernova explosion show the formation and evolution of a highly convoluted turbulent flame in the gravitational field of an expanding carbon-oxygen white dwarf. The flame dynamics are dominated by the gravity-induced Rayleigh-Taylor instability that controls the burning rate. The thermonuclear deflagration releases enough energy to produce a healthy explosion. The turbulent flame, however, leaves large amounts of unburned and partially burned material near the star center, whereas observations that imply these materials are present only in outer layers. This disagreement could be resolved if the deflagration triggers a detonation."
https://openalex.org/W1979188601,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a causative agent of gastric diseases ranging from gastritis to cancer. The CagA protein is the product of thecagA gene carried among virulent H. pyloristrains and is associated with severe disease outcomes, most notably gastric carcinoma. CagA is injected from the attached H. pylori into gastric epithelial cells and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. The phosphorylated CagA binds and activates SHP-2 phosphatase and thereby induces a growth factor-like morphological change termed the “hummingbird phenotype.” In this work, we demonstrate that CagA is also capable of interacting with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). As is the case with SHP-2, Csk selectively binds tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA via its SH2 domain. Upon complex formation, CagA stimulates Csk, which in turn inactivates the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases. Because Src family kinases are responsible for CagA phosphorylation, an essential prerequisite of CagA·SHP-2 complex formation and subsequent induction of the hummingbird phenotype, our results indicate that CagA-Csk interaction down-regulates CagA·SHP-2 signaling by both competitively inhibiting CagA·SHP-2 complex formation and reducing levels of CagA phosphorylation. We further demonstrate that CagA·SHP-2 signaling eventually induces apoptosis in AGS cells. Our results thus indicate that CagA-Csk interaction prevents excess cell damage caused by deregulated activation of SHP-2. Attenuation of CagA activity by Csk may enable cagA-positive H. pylori to persistently infect the human stomach for decades while avoiding excess CagA toxicity to the host.

Src homology 2 SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 C-terminal Src kinase hemagglutinin wild-type Helicobacter pylori is a micro-aerophilic spiral-shaped bacterium (1Marshall B.J.

The H. pylori cagA gene encodes the 120- to 145-kDa CagA protein, and it is a marker for the presence of the cagpathogenicity island (7Covacci A. Censini S. Bugnoli M. Petracca R. Burroni D.

More recently, the biological heterogeneity of H. pylori has been recognized, and H. pylori strains harboring the cagA gene have been suspected to have a specific responsibility in promoting the atrophic-metaplastic mucosal lesions that represent the most recognized pathway in multistep intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis. Thus they are considered to be more virulent than cagA-negative strains (5Covacci A. Telford J.L. Del Giudice G. Parsonnet J. Rappuoli R.

Consistently, molecular epidemiological studies have suggested that cagA-positive H. pyloriinfection significantly increases the risk of gastric carcinoma (5Covacci A. Telford J.L. Del Giudice G.

In vitroinfection of gastric epithelial cells withcagA-positive, but not cagA-negative, H. pylori induces a unique morphological change termed the hummingbird phenotype, which is characterized by strong elongation of the cell (14Segal E.D.

Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). During the infection, the CagA protein, which is produced within H. pylori, is translocated from the bacteria into the attached epithelial cells via the bacterial type IV injection apparatus. The translocated CagA protein then localizes at the inner surface of the plasma membrane and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases such as c-Src, Lyn, Fyn, and Yes (17Asahi M.

In vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites of CagA are characterized by Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs, which vary in number among different H. pylori strains (24Yamaoka Y. Kodama T. Kashima K.

We as well as others have demonstrated that CagA is the essential and sufficient H. pylori factor in the induction of the hummingbird phenotype (15Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V.

Microbiol. 2002; 43: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA is a prerequisite for the morphological changes. We have further shown that CagA binds and stimulates an SH2 1 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Thus, CagA induces the hummingbird phenotype by recruiting and activating SHP-2 at the plasma membrane. Considering the critical roles of SHP-2 in transmission of mitogenic signals as well as in regulation of cell motility (26Freeman R.M., Jr. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although it is known that the majority of the CagA proteins in host cells form complexes with SHP-2, we found in this work that CagA is also capable of binding C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) (29Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol.

Upon binding with Csk, CagA stimulates its kinase activity and thereby inactivates Src family kinases. Given that Src family kinases are responsible for CagA phosphorylation (22Stein M. Bagnoli F.

Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), our findings indicate that CagA-Csk interaction down-regulates CagA·SHP-2 signaling that perturbs cellular functions. Anti-Csk polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope-specific monoclonal antibody 12CA5 and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 were used as primary antibodies for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Anti-HA polyclonal antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-c-Src polyclonal antibody N-16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Anti-Phospho-Src (Tyr-416) polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), and anti-nonphospho-Src (Tyr-416) 7G9 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) were used as primary antibodies for immunoblotting. Normal rabbit IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mammalian expression vectors for HA-tagged wild-type CagA (WT CagA-HA) isolated from NCTC11637 H. pylori and its phosphorylation-resistant mutant (PR CagA-HA) have been described previously (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). EPIYA mutants of WT CagA-HA, abCCC and ABccc, were generated from HA-tagged wild-type CagA by substituting tyrosine residues that constitute EPIYA motifs with alanine residues using a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the DNA fragments encoding these mutants were cloned into a pSP65SRα mammalian expression vector. Rat Csk cDNA was C-terminal Myc-epitope-tagged and cloned into pSP65SRα (Csk-Myc). To disable the SH2 domain of Csk, serine 109 of Csk was substituted with the cysteine residue (CskS109C-Myc) by site-directed mutagenesis. A kinase-dead mutant of human c-Src was made by replacing ATP-binding lysine 298 to alanine (SrcΔK). A kinase-dead and autophosphorylation-defective double mutant of human c-Src was made by replacing lysine 298 and tyrosine 419 with alanine and phenylalanine, respectively (SrcΔKΔY). These cDNAs were cloned into pSP65SRα. Myc-tagged SHP-2 and its constitutively active mutant, myr-SHP-2ΔSH2, have been described previously (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). AGS human gastric epithelial cells and monkey COS-7 cells were, respectively, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression vectors were transiently transfected into the cells by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 36 h after transfection. The morphology of the AGS cells was examined at 17 h post-transfection. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer as described previously (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were treated with the appropriate antibody, and then immune complexes were trapped on protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) were soaked in solutions of primary antibodies and then visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantitation of chemiluminescence on the immunoblotted membrane was performed by using a luminescence image analyzer (LAS1000, FUJIFILM). Csk kinase activity was measured with the use of poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma) as a substrate (34Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer mB (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Brij-35) containing 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were treated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and the immune complex was then trapped on protein G-Sepharose beads. After wash for three times with lysis buffer mB and two times with wash buffer (50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mmMnCl2, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4), immunoprecipitates were incubated in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) containing 20 μm ATP and 2 μg of poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 at 30 °C for indicated time. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS gel loading buffer. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The amount of phosphorylated tyrosine residues in poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 were quantified using the luminescence image analyzer. AGS cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with 1.5 μg of the puromycin-resistant gene (pBabe-puro) and 28.5 μg of expression plasmid by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. At 16 h after the transfection, cells were collected, split into twelve 100-mm plates, and selected in RPMI 1640 medium/10% fetal bovine serum containing 0.4 μg/ml puromycin for 10 days. After the drug selection, the cells were stained with May-Giemsa solution. Densities of colonies were quantitated by using the LAS1000. AGS cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with expression vector or control empty vector. At 36 h after the transfection, cells were collected, treated with Cy3-conjugated Annexin V (Bio Vision), and subjected to flow cytometric analysis using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The cagAgene was isolated from the genome of H. pylori standard strain NCTC11637 and, after addition of a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag, was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pSP65SRα as previously described (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The cagA gene product, CagA, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation when expressed in mammalian cells. Notably, NCTC11637-derived CagA protein possesses five glutamic acid-proline-isoleucine-tyrosine-alanine (EPIYA) motifs that are potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in gastric epithelial cells (Fig. 1 A). Complex formation between CagA and SHP-2 is reconstituted in COS-7 cells by co-transfection of CagA and SHP-2 expression vectors (16Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Using this reconstitution system, we screened additional SH2-containing cellular proteins that are capable of physically interacting with CagA and found that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) bound wild-type CagA when co-expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, phosphorylation-resistant CagA, in which all of the five tyrosine-phosphorylatable EPIYA motifs were replaced with non-phosphorylatable EPIAA, was incapable of binding Csk. This indicates that the complex formation is entirely dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA. Csk is known to inactivate c-Src protein-tyrosine kinase by phosphorylation tyrosine 530 (Tyr-530) in the C-terminal tail of c-Src (Tyr-527 in avian c-Src). Csk is considered to phosphorylate and inactivate other Src family kinases as well. Using the co-expression system in COS-7, we also overexpressed the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, c-Src, Gab1, Gab2, Shc, Grb2, Crk-II, or Sos, together with CagA. However, we were not able to detect any specific interaction between CagA and these proteins in COS-7 cells. Thus, CagA specifically binds SHP-2 and Csk. 2H. Higashi, R. Tsutsumi, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observation. To determine which EPIYA motifs were involved in Csk binding in COS-7 cells, we employed two EPIYA mutants of CagA, abCCC and ABccc (Fig. 1 A). In the abCCC mutant, the former two EPIYA motifs were converted into phosphorylation-resistant EPIAA sequences. Similarly, the latter three EPIYA motifs, which were generated by duplication of an EPIYA-containing 34-amino acid sequence three times, were replaced by EPIAA to make the ABccc mutant. Co-expression studies in COS-7 cells revealed that both abCCC and ABccc mutants were capable of binding Csk, indicating that multiple EPIYA motifs can independently bind Csk once they are tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1 B,lanes 5–8). To confirm the CagA-Csk interaction in gastric epithelial cells, CagA was transiently expressed in the AGS human gastric carcinoma cell line. From the cell lysates prepared, Csk was immunoprecipitated using anti-Csk, and the anti-Csk immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-HA, which specifically detects the HA-tagged CagA. As expected, endogenous Csk was capable of specifically binding wild-type, but not the phosphorylation-resistant, CagA in AGS cells (Fig. 1 C). Hence, CagA formed a complex with endogenous Csk in gastric epithelial cells, and the complex formation was strictly dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA. The above-described observations suggested that CagA-Csk interaction involved the phosphotyrosine-containing EPIYA motifs of CagA. Like SHP-2, Csk possesses an SH2 domain, which specifically binds a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide (35Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T.

Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the Csk SH2 domain in CagA binding, we generated a Csk mutant, CskS109C, in which serine 109 was replaced by cysteine to destroy the structural integrity of the SH2 domain as previously reported (36Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When expressed in COS-7 cells, CskS109C was incapable of binding wild-type CagA (Fig. 2). Accordingly, we concluded that CagA·Csk complex formation is mediated by the interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA motifs of CagA and the SH2 domain of Csk. To elucidate the biological consequences of the CagA-Csk interaction, we decided to examine the effect of CagA binding on Csk kinase activity. To do so, Myc-tagged Csk was ectopically expressed in COS-7 cells in the absence or presence of CagA. Cell lysates were prepared and Csk was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with anti-Myc (Fig. 3 A). The immunopurified Csk was then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 as a substrate (34Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3(B and C), Csk kinase activity was strongly potentiated when Csk formed a complex with CagA. Based on the observations, we concluded that CagA stimulates Csk kinase activity through the physical complex formation. Next, to determine whether CagA indeed activates Csk in cells, we generated a human c-Src derivative, SrcΔKΔY, in which lysine 298, an ATP-binding site, and tyrosine 419, an autophosphorylation site (39Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar,40Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), were respectively replaced by arginine and phenylalanine residues. The resulting SrcΔKΔY is enzymatically inactive and is not autophosphorylated at Tyr-419 because of the mutation, yet it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr-530 by Csk. The c-Src mutant was co-expressed together with CagA in AGS cells, and its phosphorylation levels were examined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 A, SrcΔKΔY became more tyrosine-phosphorylated when CagA was co-expressed in cells. Because SrcΔKΔY possesses only one tyrosine phosphorylation site, Tyr-530, the result indicates CagA stimulated Csk and the activated Csk phosphorylated Tyr-530 of c-Src. Once Tyr-530 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Csk, c-Src forms a “closed” inactive structure. In contrast, c-Src changes to an “open” active state by dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 and autophosphorylation at Tyr-419 (29Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol.

Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The above-described observations indicate that CagA-Csk interaction activates Csk and thereby inhibits c-Src kinase activity through inhibitory phosphorylation at Tyr-530. To investigate this, we examined c-Src kinase activity using anti-phospho-Src and anti-nonphospho-Src antibodies, which detect active c-Src that is phosphorylated at Tyr-419, and inactive c-Src, which is non-phosphorylated at Tyr-419, respectively. CagA was co-expressed in AGS cells with the kinase-dead c-Src, SrcΔK, in which Lys-298 was substituted with arginine, and levels of phosphorylation on Tyr-419 were examined using these antibodies. Under conditions in which comparable amounts of SrcΔK were expressed, CagA significantly increased the levels of inactive c-Src that was specifically detected by anti-nonphospho-Src, whereas the levels of active c-Src, which were detected by anti-Phospho-Src, were reciprocally reduced (Fig. 4 B). The observation indicated that CagA inactivated c-Src by activating Csk upon physical complex formation. As the result, the levels of autophosphorylation at Tyr-419 in SrcΔK were reduced. Notably, overall tyrosine phosphorylation levels of SrcΔK, which possesses both Tyr-419 and Tyr-530, slightly increased in the presence of CagA as determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. This was most probably due to elevated levels of SrcΔK phosphorylated at Tyr-530 by Csk. Because Csk is considered to be the universal negative regulator for the Src family kinases (29Okada M.

Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), it should collectively phosphorylate and inactivate the Src family members expressed in gastric epithelial cells upon complex formation with CagA. Notably, SrcΔK underwent autophosphorylation at Tyr-419, yet it is catalytically inactive. Hence, autophosphorylation of c-Src is an intermolecular, rather than intramolecular, process caused by c-Src dimerization as described previously (41Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Upon expression in AGS cells, CagA induces a morphological change termed the hummingbird phenotype (14Segal E.D. Cha J., Lo, J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA by Src family kinases is an essential prerequisite for CagA·SHP-2 complex formation, inhibition of Src family kinases by Csk was suspected to reduce phosphorylation levels of CagA and thus to inhibit the hummingbird phenotype induction by CagA. To determine whether Csk acts as a negative regulator of CagA·SHP-2 signaling, we examined the effect of ectopic Csk expression on the hummingbird phenotype induction by CagA.

Medeiros D.M. Advanced Human Nutrition. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL2000: 254-259Google Scholar). Intracellular zinc concentration is strictly regulated, and intracellular zinc homeostasis is maintained through various mechanisms including zinc sensing, binding, and sequestrating. Zinc sensing is mediated by regulating the expression of zinc transport proteins, including those for zinc influx during zinc deficiency and efflux during zinc excess (2Liuzzi P.J. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The intracellular binding of excess zinc ions is largely facilitated by metallothioneins (3Coyle P. Philcox J.C.

Members of the ZnT family have similar membrane topology with six transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich loop between transmembrane domains IV and V, where zinc may be bound by histidines and subsequently transported across the membrane. Six ZnT proteins have been cloned and characterized since 1995.ZnT1 is involved in zinc efflux across the plasma membrane (4Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D.

They reside on the vesicular membranes of cells and facilitate the zinc accumulation in vesicles. The tissue distributions of ZnT2, ZnT3, and ZnT4 in mice are overlapped, yet are tissue-specific. ZnT2 is widely expressed but not detectable in liver, mammary gland, muscle, adipose, thymus, and spleen (2Liuzzi P.J. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J.

A unique feature of ZnT5 is that it has a long amino-terminal portion (410 amino acids), which is not homologous to any other members of the ZnT family.

The intracellular location of ZnT6 was found to be regulated by zinc in the cultured normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. High extracellular zinc in the culture medium induced the trafficking of ZnT6 from the TGN compartment to the vesicular compartment. This zinc-induced protein trafficking was also seen with ZnT4 in NRK cells, although the trafficking was less sensitive to the extracellular zinc concentration (9Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J.

ZnT7 contains many properties described for the members of the ZnT family, including six predicted transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich loop between transmembrane domains IV and V. The histidine-rich loop has been proposed to bind zinc, because histidine is a common ligand for zinc. We show that the Znt7 gene is expressed in many mouse tissues including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, small intestine, and lung, with abundant expression in small intestine and liver and less expression in heart. We also demonstrate that the expression of the ZnT7 protein is restricted to the tissues of lung and small intestine with abundant expression in the proximal segment (duodenum and part of jejunum) of small intestine. The ZnT proteins have been shown to play roles in decreasing the cytoplasmic zinc by either transporting zinc out of cells or sequestrating zinc into intracellular compartments. We show that ZnT7 leads to zinc accumulation in the Golgi apparatus when overexpressed in CHO cells. This finding, combined with the similarity in the amino acid sequence and predicted secondary structures to the previously described ZnT proteins, strongly indicate that ZnT7 is a zinc transporter involved in translocation of the cytoplasmic zinc into the Golgi apparatus (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6).The presence of ZnT7 in the vesicular compartment in the hBRIE 380, WI-38, and transiently transfected NRK cells (Fig. 4) suggests that ZnT7 may also be involved in transporting zinc into a unique vesicular compartment. The vesicular compartment where ZnT7 localizes appears different from that of ZnT2, ZnT3, ZnT4, ZnT5 or ZnT6 (5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D.

J. 2002; 364: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that those ZnT proteins are dedicated zinc transporters for different vesicular compartments. The localization of ZnT7 in the Golgi and vesicular compartments combined with the abundant expression of the ZnT7 protein in the duodenum of small intestine indicate that ZnT7 may play an important role in zinc absorption in the gut.Functional characterization of gene homologues in model organisms is an invaluable reference for investigating human or mouse genes with unknown functions. In this regard, yeast mutant strains are particularly informative, because the mutant strains for zinc metabolism are available and have been proven to be useful for characterizing the function of ZnT4 and ZnT6 in zinc homeostasis (7Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,9Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol.

The ZRT1 (zinc-regulated transporter) gene encodes a high affinity zinc uptake protein (29Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The zrt1mutant is defective in growth in zinc-limited medium (29Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The ZRT3 and ZRC1 (zinc resistance conferring) genes encode zinc transporters responsible for the release of the stored zinc from vacuoles and the sequestration of zinc into vacuoles, respectively (30MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Deletion of the zrt3 gene results in zinc deficiency when cells are grown in a zinc-limited medium (30MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Deletion of the zrc1gene leads to zinc hypersensitivity when cells are grown in zinc-rich medium (31Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, our attempts to either augment the zinc-deficient phenotypes of the zrt1 and zrt3mutants or complement for the function of the zrc1 mutant with mouse ZnT7 were unsuccessful. Failure to exhibit the function in yeast mutants may suggest that ZnT7 requires a partner(s) to be functional and that this protein(s) is not available in yeast cells. This hypothesis is supported by our results in zinc-dependent Zinquin fluorescence study in the ZnT7-Myc-expressing CHO cells (Fig. 6). ZnT7 was able to transport the cytoplasmic zinc into the Golgi apparatus when the cells were grown in the medium containing a higher level of zinc. The requirement of an additional component(s) for function has been previously proposed for ZnT1 (4Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In that study, expression of a truncated ZnT1 protein, in which the first transmembrane domain of ZnT1 was deleted, has a dominant negative effect on zinc efflux in wild-type cells, leading to zinc hypersensitivity. Thus, it is important to investigate the functional component(s) of ZnT7 in the delivery of zinc into the Golgi apparatus as well as cytoplasmic vesicles by yeast and/or mammalian two-hybridization analysis and by truncation/mutagenesis analysis.To date, seven ZnT genes (including ZnT7 reported here), each encoding a closely related protein, have been identified and characterized (4Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D.

In addition, our preliminary study indicated that there is another novel member of the ZnT family, ZnT8, which is only expressed in brain and liver (data not shown). An intriguing question is why mammalian cells need so many functionally redundant ZnT proteins. A possible scenario is that the ZnT genes are selected for enhanced fidelity of a zinc efflux/sequestration process in cells. To maintain this fidelity of appropriate translocation of the cytoplasmic zinc into a variety of subcellular compartments, coordinated regulations of the ZnT protein levels may occur in particular cell types and particular subcellular compartments.It has been demonstrated that the mRNA of the ZnT genes exceptZnt1 exhibit tissue- and cell type-specific expression profiles, indicting that these ZnT genes are regulated at the transcriptional level in different tissues (6Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 7Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwa Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The regulatory elements that can confer tissue- and cell type-specific expression in the promoter regions of these ZnT genes are currently unknown. The abundance and subcellular localization of the ZnT proteins may be further regulated at translational and post-translational levels. For example, the mRNAs of Znt4, Znt6, andZnt7 were detected in liver by Northern blot analysis, whereas the proteins are barely detectable on the Western blots (Fig. 3, and data not shown) (7Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). That is also the case forZnt3, whose mRNA is highly expressed in testis, yet its protein is not detectable on the Western blot (6Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). This translational regulatory mechanism may play an important role in the restriction of ZnT protein expression in tissues. Post-translational modifications have been demonstrated for ZnT2, ZnT4, ZnT6, and ZnT7 (Fig. 3, and data not shown) (9Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These modifications, which may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, may modulate the stability and/or transport activity of the ZnT proteins. Furthermore, zinc-induced Golgi-to-vesicle trafficking has been observed for ZnT4 and ZnT6 in the cultured NRK cells (9Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although we have not detected that this zinc-induced Golgi-vesicle trafficking occurs to ZnT7 (data not shown), this regulation may be critical for some ZnT proteins such as ZnT4 and ZnT6, leading to a rapid increase of local protein concentrations to effectively remove excess zinc from cells.In conclusion, there is evidence that each member of the ZnT family is dedicated to effluxing or sequestrating the cytoplasmic zinc into a variety of intracellular compartments in different cells. However, functional redundancy exists in many tissues, which is evidenced by the lack of obvious phenotypes in the brain of the Znt3knock-out mice and in the tissues (except for mammary glands and otolith) of the lethal milk mutant (14Piletz J.E. Ganschow R.E. Science. 1978; 199: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Burgunder J.M. Prud'homme J.F. Brice A. Fontaine B. Heilig B. Weissenbach J. Erway L.C. Grider A., Jr. J. Hered. 1984; 75: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to hypothesize that, due to universal importance of zinc in cellular processes, cells have to retain the genes whose functions are partially overlapped to ensure survival in case one gene is inactivated. Zinc, a divalent cation, is required for the function of many zinc-containing proteins, many of which participate in various aspects of gene regulation, protein synthesis, intracellular protein trafficking, hormone function, and immune function (1Wildman R.E.C. Medeiros D.M. Advanced Human Nutrition. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL2000: 254-259Google Scholar). Intracellular zinc concentration is strictly regulated, and intracellular zinc homeostasis is maintained through various mechanisms including zinc sensing, binding, and sequestrating. Zinc sensing is mediated by regulating the expression of zinc transport proteins, including those for zinc influx during zinc deficiency and efflux during zinc excess (2Liuzzi P.J. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The intracellular binding of excess zinc ions is largely facilitated by metallothioneins (3Coyle P. Philcox J.C. Carey L.C. Rofe A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Recent studies in zinc transport proteins, however, have indicated that zinc transporter (ZnT)1 proteins play critical roles in maintaining intracellular zinc homeostasis through efflux and sequestration mechanisms during zinc excesses (4Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). ZnT proteins are characterized by their ability to decrease the cytoplasmic zinc concentration by transporting zinc out of cells or into intracellular compartments. Members of the ZnT family have similar membrane topology with six transmembrane domains and a histidine-rich loop between transmembrane domains IV and V, where zinc may be bound by histidines and subsequently transported across the membrane. Six ZnT proteins have been cloned and characterized since 1995. ZnT1 is involved in zinc efflux across the plasma membrane (4Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). TheZnt1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in mice and is up-regulated in cells with elevated intracellular zinc (2Liuzzi P.J. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Langmade S.J. Ravindra R. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34803-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). ZnT2, ZnT3, and ZnT4 are similar to each other. They reside on the vesicular membranes of cells and facilitate the zinc accumulation in vesicles. The tissue distributions of ZnT2, ZnT3, and ZnT4 in mice are overlapped, yet are tissue-specific. ZnT2 is widely expressed but not detectable in liver, mammary gland, muscle, adipose, thymus, and spleen (2Liuzzi P.J. Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J.

Blanchard R.K. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). ZnT3 is only expressed in brain and testis (6Palmiter R.D. Cole T."

https://openalex.org/W2048432197,"The untranslated roX1 and roX2 RNAs are components of the Drosophila male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which modifies histones to up-regulate transcription of the male X chromosome. roX genes are normally located on the X chromosome, and roX transgenes can misdirect the dosage compensation machinery to spread locally on other chromosomes. Here we define MSL protein abundance as a determinant of whether the MSL complex will spread in cis from an autosomal roX transgene. The number of expressed roX genes in a nucleus was inversely correlated with spreading from roX transgenes. We suggest a model in which MSL proteins assemble into active complexes by binding nascent roX transcripts. When MSL protein/ roX RNA ratios are high, assembly will be efficient, and complexes may be completed while still tethered to the DNA template. We propose that this local production of MSL complexes determines the extent of spreading into flanking chromatin."

A variety of approaches have been developed in recent years to study such interactions, including the development of the two-hybrid system in yeast (1Fields S. Song O.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Google Scholar), they cannot report heterologous interactions. Here we present a system to measure the heterologous association of transmembrane helices in E. coli. Recently, an E. coli two-hybrid system based on the LexA DNA binding domain was developed, and it was shown that coupling of this domain to any soluble protein can be used to measure homo-oligomerization of a soluble protein (14Porte D. Oertel-Buchheit P. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22721-22730Google Scholar). LexA is a transcription factor with an N-terminal DNA binding domain containing about 70 amino acids and a C-terminal dimerization domain (for a review on LexA, see Ref. 15Schnarr M. Oertel-Buchheit P. Kazmaier M. Granger-Schnarr M. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 423-431Google Scholar). LexA dimerization is required to repress transcription efficiently, and the LexA DNA binding domain does not contribute to the dimerization of the protein. The discovery of LexA DNA binding domain variants that bind to different DNA sequence enabled the development of a system to analyze heterodimerization of soluble proteins in E. coli (16Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Google Scholar). To study the interaction of two different transmembrane domains, the GALLEX system presented here was developed. Two LexA DNA binding domains with different DNA sequence specificity were coupled to wild type (WT) and mutated glycophorin A (GpA) TM helices and the promoter/operator sequence contained one specific binding site for each. Association of two separately expressed chimeras that interact in the membrane represses the synthesis of a reporter gene, β galactosidase. The correct membrane insertion of the chimeric proteins was tested as well as the ability of the system to measure either homo- or heterodimerization of single TM helices. Using GALLEX, different interactions between WT and mutated glycophorin A TM helices were measured. By this method, it could be shown that the WT TM domain interacts with other investigated TM helices to a certain degree, and a strongly heterodimerizing pair of glycophorin A mutants was found. The heterodimerization of two TM helices in a glycophrin A-like manner was recently described as key to the formation of heterodimeric integrin complexes (17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar). Integrins are a family of single spanning membrane proteins that from α/β heterodimers. The analysis of the interaction of the α4 and the β7 integrin TM helices using GALLEX showed that both TM domains form weak homo- as well as hetero-oligomers. Although heterodimer formation results also from the interaction of a large extracellular domain (18Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Google Scholar), the role of the transmembrane domains for the formation of these heterodimers was recently discussed (17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar, 19Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Google Scholar). Molecular cloning was carried out using standard techniques described in Ref. 20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. All enzymes used for PCR and cloning and plasmids were purchased from New England Biolabs. The N-terminal part (corresponding to residues 1–87) of the WTlexA gene from E. coli (21Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR, introducing an NdeI site at the 5′-end and anSacI site at the 3′-end. The restriction-digested PCR fragment was ligated to the NdeI/SacI restriction-digested plasmid pMal-p2, resulting in the plasmid pLEX. A fragment from the plasmid pccGpA (8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar), carrying the TM region of GpA C-terminally fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) domain, was amplified by PCR, introducing an XbaI site at the 3′-end of the fragment. After digestion with SacI and XbaI, the fragment was ligated into theSacI/XbaI-digested plasmid pLEX, resulting in the plasmid pLGM. In construction of pLKM, for cloning reasons, aK mR cassette was amplified by PCR and ligated to the SacI/BamHI restriction-digested vector pLGM, replacing the GpA TM region and introducing aSpeI site at the 5′-end of the malE gene. For the measurements of heteroassociation, a two-plasmid system was created, allowing the simultaneous low level expression of two different chimeric proteins. The plasmid pLKM was restriction-digested with ScaI and PflMI, and the resulting termini were filled by T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends. The plasmid pBR322 was restriction-digested with SspI/AvaI, and the termini of the resulting 2743-bp fragment were filled with T4 DNA polymerase. The plasmid pACYC184 was restriction-digested withAvaI/PvuII, and the termini of the resulting 2423-bp fragment were filled with T4 DNA polymerase. The fragment originating from pLKM was cloned into the fragments of pBR322 and pACYC184, finally producing the plasmid pBLM100 and pALM100, respectively. These plasmids can be used for the measurement of hetero- as well as homoassociation of single TM helices. For generating plasmids expressing a chimera with a mutated LexA protein (LexA408), the mutated gene was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pSR659 (21Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Google Scholar). All cloning steps were identical as described above for the WT gene. The fragment originating from pLKM(mut) was cloned into the fragments of pBR322 and pACYC184, finally producing the plasmids pBLM148 and pALM148, respectively. These plasmids can be used to express a chimeric protein with the mutated LexA DNA binding domain, and, in combination with pALM100 or pBLM100, they can be used to measure heteroassociation of TM helices. The plasmids and E. coli strains used for testing the homo- and heteroassociation capacity of given TM helices are shown in Fig. 1. All further pBLM- and pALM-based constructs were made by ligating synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes, which encode for the TM sequences of interest, into the SpeI/SacI restriction-digested vectors. The association capacity of different chimeric proteins was measured as the repression of reporter gene (β-galactosidase) activity in the E. coli SU101 (homoassociation) and SU202 (heteroassociation) indicator strains. The genotypes of these strains are described previously (16Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Google Scholar). To measure dimerization, overnight cultures of freshly transformed SU101 cells were grown in the presence of various IPTG concentrations, diluted to an A 600 = 0.1 and finally grown to anA 600 = 0.6 in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and IPTG. 100 μl of cells were used for the measurement of the β-galactosidase activity as described in Ref.21Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Google Scholar. For maltose complementation assays, a single colony of NT326 cells expressing the LexA-TM-MalE chimeric proteins was cultured on M9 agar plates containing 0.4% maltose, 1% ion agar, 0.02% IPTG, and 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Only if the MBP portion of the chimeric protein is present in the periplasm will the cells be able to use maltose as the carbohydrate source, since this strain is deficient in endogenous MBP. To prove that the chimeric proteins are associated with the membrane, cells were extracted with NaOH as described in detail in Ref. 22Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Google Scholar. After extraction, the pellet, containing stably associated membrane proteins, was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The proteins in the supernatant fraction, which contains cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and peripheral membrane proteins, were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid and finally resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-gels and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes for Western analysis. Western analysis was performed using anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs), and blots were finally developed using goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad) with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. A schematic of the system to measure heterologous association of transmembrane helices in the E. coli inner membrane is shown in Fig. 2. The basic idea is to detect association by suppression of β-galactosidase when two versions of LexA domains bind to two adjacent, different DNA sequences. For initial testing and optimization of the system, GpA TMs were used, because the self-association of this transmembrane helix is very well characterized (8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar, 23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar, 24Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Google Scholar, 25Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14340-14344Google Scholar). Each of the individual single transmembrane fragments has an N-terminal LexA DNA binding domain and a C-terminal MBP domain from E. coli. The hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain functions as a membrane insertion signal, placing the LexA domain in the cytoplasm and the MBP domain in the periplasm of E. coli. If the transmembrane domains interact, the LexA cytoplasmic domains are in close proximity and can bind to the operator region, repressing the expression of β-galactosidase. The expression of chimera with noninteracting TMs results in a high β-galactosidase activity due to the lack of repression. To measure heteroassociation, two chimeras were simultaneously expressed from the plasmid pair pALM148 and pBLM100. Whereas the pALM plasmids originate from the plasmid pACYC184 and contain a tetracycline resistance gene, the pBLM plasmids are derived from pBR322 and contain the gene for β-lactamase, resulting in ampicillin resistance. In these plasmids, the expression of the chimeric proteins is driven by the inducible Ptac promoter, and until IPTG is added the transcription is strongly repressed by the lac I gene encoding the Lac repressor. E. coli strain SU101 was used to measure the homo-oligomerization capacity of a given TM helix. In this strain, thelacZ gene is under the control of the wild-type LexA recognition sequence (op+) stably integrated into the E. coli genome. In E. coli SU202, the lacZ reporter gene is placed under the control of a op408/op+ hybrid operator. This asymmetric promoter is composed of half of the wild-type promoter plus an altered half (16Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and allows the binding of a LexA heterodimer composed of one wild-type LexA DNA binding domain and one altered domain (LexA408). It is reported that homodimers do not recognize this hybrid operator so that heterodimeric proteins alone efficiently repress the reporter gene activity (16Dmitrova M. Younes-Cauet G. Oertel-Buchheit P. Porte D. Schnarr M. Granger-Schnarr M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 205-212Google Scholar). Therefore, the capacity for heterodimerization should be measurable even if the individual proteins homodimerize. To test the system's ability to measure the homodimerization of a given TM, the strongly dimerizing GpA WT sequence and the nondimerizing G83I sequence (8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar, 24Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Google Scholar) were fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and the MBP domain as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” In GALLEX, the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter drives the expression of the chimeric proteins. The ability of the fusion proteins to repress the reporter gene's activity was determined at different levels of protein expression obtained upon varying the IPTG concentration (data not shown). In the range between 0.005 and 0.01 mm IPTG, a 50–80% difference was measured between the β-galactosidase activity of the strains expressing either the GpA WT or the GpA G83I chimera. Based on these results, an IPTG concentration of 0.005 mmwas used for all further experiments testing for homodimerization inE. coli SU101 (if not indicated differently). Although higher IPTG concentration can result in lower β-galactosidase activities, the difference in the β-galactosidase activity between interacting and weakly interacting TMs (GpA WT versus G83I) becomes reduced. It should be noted that the absolute difference in the β-galactosidase activity between the GpA WT and G83I chimeric constructs also depends on the plasmid used for the expression: using pALM100 as the parental plasmid, a difference in the β-galactosidase activity of about 50% was measured, whereas the use of pBLM100 led to differences of up to 80%. This observed discrepancy is most probably explained by the different copy numbers of the plasmids. The optimal length of the incorporated TM for effective gene repression was determined. For this purpose, GpA TM segments of 16, 17, 18, and 19 residues comprising dimerization motifs (23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar) were cloned into the plasmid pBLM100, and the reporter gene activity was measured in theE. coli strain SU101 after induction of protein expression by the addition of 0.5 mm IPTG. As shown in Fig. 3, insertion of a TM of 17 residues led to the strongest repression. Remarkably, the repression of the β-galactosidase activity was about 10-fold stronger than for the TM helix of 19 amino acids. To measure the relative homodimerization of the WT GpA TM and its mutants at interfacial residues (L75V, I76A, and G83I), the TM domains were expressed from pALM100, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured in E. coli SU101. As a control, the parental plasmid pACYC184 was transformed in E. coli SU101, and the maximal β-galactosidase activity measured in this strain was set to 100%. The results shown in Fig. 4demonstrate that the GpA TM domain with the G83I point mutation interacts very weakly. The different GpA TM helices interact in the order WT > I76A > L75V ≫ G83I. Membrane localization of the chimeric proteins was shown by NaOH extraction. This method was used to separate membrane proteins from cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins (26Russel M. Model P. Cell. 1982; 28: 177-184Google Scholar). After rigorous extraction of the cells with NaOH, the expressed chimeras are only found in the membrane protein fraction (Fig. 5 A), so almost all of the chimeric protein is bound to the cytoplasmic membrane and not localized in the cytoplasm or periplasm. The topology of the chimeric proteins was examined by complementation assays on M9 minimal medium. The E. coli strain NT326 lacks endogenous MBP, resulting in the inability of the cells to transport maltose into the cytoplasm. If the chimeric proteins are inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane with the MBP portion localized in the periplasm, the MBP domain will compensate for this deficiency, and the cells will be able to grow on minimal medium with maltose as the only carbon source. The results shown in Fig. 5 B demonstrate that all chimeric proteins with a TM domain can complement the endogenous MBP deficiency, consistent with the correct insertion of the protein into the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane with the MBP domain located in the periplasm. And since the assay shows repression, the LexA domains are located in the cytoplasm, and the topology is established. For initial testing and optimization of the system to measure heterodimerization, the TM domains of GpA WT and GpA G83I were cloned into the vector pair pALM148/pBLM100 (see Fig. 1). After transformation, strains were obtained that measure the heterodimerization of the chimeric proteins (with respect to the LexA DNA binding domains) driven by the homodimerization of the GpA WT TM region. The other strain expresses the GpA G83I TM domain from both plasmids, which should result in little association. As expected, when the GpA WT chimeric proteins were co-expressed from the two different plasmids, the reporter gene was highly repressed at 0.01 mmIPTG, in contrast to the strain expressing the GpA G83I chimeric proteins (data not shown). Although the GpA TM domain strongly self-dimerizes, which adds some complexity to the measurement, this TM was used for a more thorough characterization and optimization of the system, since the interaction of these helices is already well documented (8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar, 23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar, 25Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14340-14344Google Scholar). Further, it is desirable that the system should be able to measure heteroassociation of other TMs that strongly homodimerize. The relative heterodimerization of the WT GpA TM and its mutants at interfacial residues (L75V, I76A, and G83I) was measured in E. coli SU202. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The data obtained using the heterosystem show that the WT GpA TM helix is able to form heterodimers with each mutation in the order WT > I76A > L75V > G83I. The GpA WT sequence forms strongly interacting homodimers, resulting in a high repression of the reporter gene (about 80% repression). Interestingly, the WT sequence also forms heterodimers with each of the other tested sequences, resulting in low β-galactosidase activity. The relative activities are shown in Fig. 6, A andB. Also, the L75V and I76A sequences form homodimers as well as heterodimers with the other TM helices. Besides the formation of heterodimers between GpA WT and any mutant, the results also show that the two mutants L75V and I76A homodimerize to a significant extent. If GpA I76A is expressed from pBLM100 and GpA L75V is expressed from pALM148, the repression reaches about the level of the GpA WT homodimer (22%), whereas if the TMs are expressed in the other orientation, the activity is only repressed to 44%. Nevertheless, in this case, thelacZ repression is almost as high as the GpA WT/I76A interaction, and the general lower β-galactosidase activity seems to be caused by the intrinsic asymmetry of the GALLEX system as discussed below. The amino acid substitution G83I is highly disruptive, resulting in high β-galactosidase activities, and none of the other mutations formed a strong dimer with the G83I TM, resulting in high β-galactosidase activities for each heterodimer studied (Fig. 6,A and B). To analyze whether an GpA-like interaction of the α and β integrin TM helices can contribute to the formation of the heterodimeric α/β integrin as suggested in Ref. 17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar, the sequences encoding the two integrin α4 and β7 TM helices were cloned, and the tendency to form homo- and heterodimers was measured with the GALLEX system. The membrane insertion and orientation of the expressed chimera was tested as described above for the GpA TM helices. The results of the GALLEX measurements shown in Fig. 7 indicate that each integrin TM helix has a tendency to form dimers. Whereas the α4 TM helix shows a slight tendency to form homodimers, the TM helix of the β7 integrin homodimerizes more strongly. The measurement of the formation of α/β heterodimers shows that the two TM helices tend to form heterodimers, although these are relatively unstable compared with the GpA WT homodimer as shown above. The homodimerization of TM helices has been intensively studied in recent years using reporters of homo-oligomerization in the E. coli inner membrane (7Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar, 8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar,27Leeds J.A. Boyd D. Huber D.R. Sonoda G.K. Luu H.T. Engelman D.M. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 181-195Google Scholar). The ToxR-based systems have been used to measure the homo-oligomerization of given TM domains (8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar, 9Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Google Scholar, 10Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Google Scholar) and to select for sequence motifs that drive homo-oligomerization from random libraries (11Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Google Scholar, 28Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Google Scholar). Although useful, these systems are limited to the investigation of homo-oligomerization. The published systems are based on the formation of a homodimeric ToxR DNA binding domain from V. cholerae, which is driven by the interaction of two identical TM helices. The basic principles used are similar to the GALLEX system presented here. Although with GALLEX, the repression of a reporter gene is measured in contrast to its activation, the activity of the reporter gene (lacZ) is directly related to the formation of LexA (hetero-) dimers driven by the association of the TM segments. In contrast to the ToxR-based systems, this system can measure homo-oligomerization of TM helices (using E. coli SU101) as well as hetero-oligomerization (using E. coli SU202) even if one or both of these helices homo-oligomerize. It was recently shown that the expression of chimeric soluble proteins from different plasmids can result in conflicting results (21Daines D.A. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5267-5270Google Scholar) and that the rate of repression seems to depend on the plasmid from which each TM helix is expressed. Since controlling the level of protein expression from the two different plasmids (pALM and pBLM) simultaneously is difficult and the slightly different expression levels can obviously cause some variations, comparison of experiments with the reciprocal fusions of the TM helices is always recommended. Other possible limitations of the system include the potential inhibition of DNA binding of the LexA DNA binding domain caused by its fusion to nonnative proteins as discussed in Ref. 29Golemis E.A. Brent R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Google Scholar. Also, the length of the TM helices and the localization of the oligomerizing interface seem to be a critical factor. The results shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the relative orientation of the soluble domains is important. Whereas a high β-galactosidase activity is seen for the GpA TM helices of 18 or 19 residues, the TM helices of 16 or 17 residues seem to place the two DNA binding domains in the right orientation for optimal DNA binding. The 10-fold difference in the β-galactosidase activity of the different TM lengths seen in Fig. 3 is not to be directly compared with the 2-fold changes observed in the later experiments (Figs. 4, 6, and7), since a higher concentration of IPTG was used for induction (0.5versus 0.005 mm). An optimized orientation of the interaction helical surface relative to the soluble domains was also found in earlier studies with the ToxR DNA binding domain coupled to the GpA TM helix (7Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar). The observation of an optimized spatial orientation of the interaction helical surface relative to the soluble domains may make it necessary for an individual experiment to optimize the length of a TM helix and the orientation of the interacting interface relative to the soluble domains. The analysis of the GpA TM helices that exhibits both homo- and heteroassociation introduces an additional level of complexity to the system, since multiple equilibria must be taken into account. If two single TM helices do not homodimerize, the observed degree of β-galactosidase activity directly reflects the level of heterodimerization of the two TM helices. If one or both helices homodimerize, the observed level of interaction depends on the individual strengths of dimerization, since the tendency of each TM to form homodimers influences the concentration of free monomers for heterodimer formation. In such a case, the measured values of heterodimerization cannot be taken absolutely but demonstrates the ability of two given TM helices to heterodimerize. In any case, the simultaneous expression of the identical TM from both plasmids should always be done to check for homodimerization and to evaluate the results for the heterodimers properly. In the case of the analysis of the heteroassociation of one or two homodimerizing TM helices, the observed strength of the interaction can be taken not as absolute but as a trend. The dimerization of glycophorin A is one of the best characterized TM helix-helix interactions to date. The plethora of data available on the homodimerization of GpA WT and mutants made it possible to optimize the GALLEX system and to compare the results with data obtained by other methods. The results shown in Figs. 4 and 6 clearly show that GpA WT and the two GpA TM domain mutants I76A and L75V strongly homodimerize in the E. coli inner membrane in contrast to the GpA G83I TM helix when tested in E. coli SU101 or SU202. The general trend of homodimerization described under “Results” (WT > I76A > L75V ≫ G83I) (Figs. 4 and 6) is identical to the data obtained using the TOXCAT system (8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that the relative strength of the interaction of the two mutants I76A and L75V is higher than measured with TOXCAT. In GALLEX, even weaker interactions seem to cause a strong response (repression) of the reporter gene. Although the relative stabilities measured by different methods vary, the hierarchy of the stability for GpA sequence variants is conserved, and it was recently shown that this hierarchy is conserved, even if the hydrophobic environment of the TM helices is altered (25Fleming K.G. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14340-14344Google Scholar). The different conditions for measuring the homoassociation in E. coli SU101 and measuring the heteroassociation of the DNA binding domains driven by the homoassociation of the TM domains (expression of the same TM domain from two plasmids) allow only a qualitative comparison of the strength of the interaction but do demonstrate whether heteroassociation exists. The absolute degrees of repression should not be compared directly between different experimental setups. Using GALLEX, the heterodimerization of GpA WT with each of the mutant TMs was also observed, although to a lesser extent than the WT-WT interaction. The GpA L75V and the GpA I76A chimeric proteins seem to interact more strongly with some of the other GpA TM helices than with themselves. Specifically, the pair GpA L75V/GpA I76A shows an interaction that is remarkably strong. In earlier work, the heterodimer formation between L75V and I76A was already observed on SDS gels (23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar). Using SDS-PAGE for the identification of heterodimerizing GpA pairs did not lead to the observation of any pair besides L75V/I76A, whereas an interaction between virtually all of the GpA variants with the exception of the G83I TM is seen in the present assay. The fact that GALLEX measures the interaction in a biological membrane, in contrast to the relatively harsh conditions of SDS-PAGE, may explain why the other interactions could not be observed on SDS gels. As shown already in the case of the L75I/I76V pair, a point mutation on one TM can be partly compensated by another point mutation on the second GpA TM (23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar). In previous studies with the GpA TM domain, the effect of single point mutations on the homodimerization was monitored (7Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Google Scholar, 8Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar, 23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that the disruptive effects on homodimer formation of the investigated mutations L75V, I76A, and G83I can be reduced by formation of heterodimers with the WT sequence or with other, more stably associating helices. Therefore, some of the stabilizing interactions disrupted in the homodimer of the three mutant GpA TM helices can be compensated to a certain degree by heterodimer formation. This observed compensatory effect is of particular importance, since the interaction of two different TM helices in a GpA-like manner is proposed to play an important role in the formation of heterodimeric complexes (17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar, 30Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 363-378Google Scholar). The destabilizing effect of amino acids on the homodimerization of one TM could be partly compensated by the formation of a heterodimer with an other TM helix. By this mechanism, the formation of homodimeric complexes can be repressed, favoring the formation of the more stable heterodimers. Integrins mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by forming α/β heterodimers. Each subunit of the heterodimer consists of a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic domain (reviewed in Ref.31Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that the formation of heterodimers can be driven by interactions of the large cytoplasmic extracellular domains (18Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Google Scholar), the role of the transmembrane domains in the formation of hetero-oligomers has recently been discussed as an additional factor (17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar, 19Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Google Scholar). Computational studies showed that the TM domains of the αIIb/β3 heterodimer are likely to have a structure similar to the GpA homodimer (17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar). Almost all integrin TM domains show a GG4-like motif similar to GpA, and a global search of helix-helix interactions indicated that this motif could mediate the heterodimer formation of α/β integrins. Protein fragments encompassing the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of the αIIb and β3 integrins showed little or no tendency to form heterodimers; instead, the α2 fragment was found to form a homodimer, and the β3 fragment was found to form a homotrimer (19Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Google Scholar). The analysis presented here shows that, although the α4 and β7 TM domains have a tendency to form homodimers, the integrin TM domains also form heterodimers. Each of these dimers is relatively unstable compared with the GpA homodimer. It has been suggested that the relative orientation of the TM helices to each other may change during signal transduction (17Gottschalk K.E. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Kessler H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1800-1812Google Scholar). If such a mechanism occurs, very strong association of two TM helices would probably prevent such a reorientation. The observed homodimerization of the single TM helices is most likely due to the fact that in this assay no attention was paid to the extracellular domain of the integrins, a region that is known to mediate interaction and that might control the specificity of the heterodimer formation. The results presented here suggest that the interaction of the transmembrane parts of the integrins could contribute to the formation and/or stabilization of heterodimeric α/β integrins. The GALLEX system presented in this study provides a new approach to investigating helix-helix interactions in a biological membrane. By using two versions of the LexA DNA binding domain and a promoter/operator with two different sequences, the association of GpA WT and mutated TM helices was detected using a reporter gene, β-galactosidase. Also, the formation of heterodimers between the integrin α4 and β7 TM domains as well as homodimer formation of the two integrin TM helix alone was shown. In principle, the interaction of any two parallel TM helices should be assessable. As applications emerge, GALLEX should expand our understanding of the chemistry of membrane protein folding and oligomerization."

Receptor tyrosine kinases can be transactivated by G protein-coupled receptors coupling to Gi and Gq. The human G protein-coupled serotonin receptors 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) couple to Gs and elevate intracellular cAMP. Certain Gs-coupled receptors have been shown to activate MAP kinases through a protein kinase A- and Rap1-dependent pathway. We report the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 (p44 and p42 MAP kinase) through the human serotonin receptors 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) in COS-7 and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. In transfected HEK293 cells, 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 is sensitive to H89, which indicates a role for protein kinase A. The observed activation of ERK1/2 does not require transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors. Furthermore, 5-HT induced activation of both Ras and Rap1. Whereas the presence of Rap1GAP1 did not influence the 5-HT-mediated activation of ERK1/2, the activation of ERK1/2 was abolished in the presence of dominant negative Ras (RasN17). ERK1/2 activation was reduced in the presence of “dominant negative” Raf1 (RafS621A) and slightly reduced by dominant negative B-Raf, indicating the involvement of one or more Raf isoforms. These findings suggest that activation of ERK1/2 through the human Gs-coupled serotonin receptors 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) in HEK293 cells is dependent on Ras, but independent of Rap1.

In general, growth factors activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),1whereas most hormones activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Intracellular cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, also called the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cascade, are mainly activated as a consequence of agonist stimulation of RTKs. ERK1/2 are serine/threonine protein kinases activated upon dual phosphorylation by the MAP kinase kinase MEK (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Google Scholar), which is phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase kinase kinases of the Raf family (2Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Google Scholar). In mammals, all three Raf isoforms expressed (A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1) are cytosolic in resting cells and become activated upon recruitment to the plasma membrane by activated, small G proteins of the Ras family (H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras, and Rap1). Ras, in its active, GTP-bound conformation, may activate all isoforms of Raf. The levels of GTP-bound Ras are controlled by the actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The two major Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors are Son of sevenless (SOS) (3Bowtell D., Fu, P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6515Google Scholar) and Ras-GRF1 (CDC25Mm) (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Google Scholar). SOS is mainly thought to activate Ras as a consequence of RTK stimulation, whereas Ras-GRF1 activates Ras in response to Ca2+ signaling and GPCR-mediated signals (5Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Google Scholar, 6Shou C.C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893Google Scholar, 7Zippel R.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) mediates its diverse physiological effects through at least 14 different receptors, of which 13 are GPCRs or so-called seven transmembrane-spanning receptors (9Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203Google Scholar). The 5-HT receptors, each encoded by a separate gene, have been grouped into families called 5-HT1 to 5-HT7, with some of the families containing several members. The human serotonin receptors 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 couple to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs and exist in multiple splice variants (10Bender E. Pindon A. van Oers I. Zhang Y.B. Gommeren W. Verhasselt P. Jurzak M. Leysen J. Luyten W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 478-489Google Scholar, 11Heidmann D.E. Metcalf M.A. Kohen R. Hamblin M.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1372-1381Google Scholar). Stimulation of these receptors leads to activation of adenylyl cyclase and a rapid increase in the formation of the intracellular second messenger cAMP. Elevated levels of cAMP have several intracellular effects, e.g. activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epacs), guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for Rap. Both mechanisms have been claimed to be involved in cAMP-dependent activation of Rap1 (12Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar, 13de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar, 14Kawasaki H.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Google Scholar). The main target for cAMP is PKA, which has cell type-specific effects on the ERK1/2 cascade. In several cell types, Ras-dependent ERK1/2 activation is antagonized by PKA (15Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar, 16Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. Macdonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Google Scholar, 17Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence J.C., Jr. Proc. Natl.

In other cell types, PKA appears to activate the ERK1/2 cascade via Rap1 and B-Raf (12Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar, 19Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Google Scholar). In human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, isoproterenol stimulation of the endogenous Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) activates Ras and Rap1, but only Rap1 is able to mediate activation of ERK1/2 by recruiting B-Raf to the membrane and thereafter activate MEK (20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar). However, at overexpressed levels of β2-ARs, ERK1/2 can be activated through the Gβγ subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, interpreted as a switch in coupling from Gs to Gi due to phosphorylation of the β2-AR by PKA (21Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of Gi- (22van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Google Scholar) and Gq-coupled (23Budd D.C. Rae A. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12355-12360Google Scholar) receptors, activation of MAP kinases is induced by Gβγ subunits that mediate Ras activation through proteins such as the tyrosine kinase c-Src, Grb2, and SOS (24Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Google Scholar). Both phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (25Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Google Scholar) and the calcium-sensitive kinase PYK2 (26Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar) have been implicated in the activation of c-Src. The Gαi and Gαq subunits may also mediate ERK1/2 activation by binding to Rap1GAP1, a selective Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (27Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Google Scholar, 28Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Google Scholar). In these cases, active Rap1 antagonizes the function of Ras, and inhibition of Rap1 by Rap1GAP1 allows Ras to signal to ERK1/2. Furthermore, in several cell types, GPCRs coupling to Gi and Gq have been reported to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and thereby lead to activation of ERK1/2 (29Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Google Scholar, 30Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Google Scholar, 33Michael D. Martin K.C. Seger R. Ning M.M. Baston R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1864-1869Google Scholar). In mouse cortical neurons, several monoamines including 5-HT, as well as forskolin, activated ERK1/2 and increased the level of GTP-bound Ras, but the 5-HT receptor involved was not characterized (34Ambrosini A. Tininini S. Barassi A. Racagni G. Sturani E. Zippel R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 54-60Google Scholar). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, 5-HT activated ERK1/2 through 5-HT7 receptors, but the mechanism was not characterized (35Errico H. Crozier R.A. Plummer M.R. Cowen D.S. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 361-367Google Scholar). In mammalian brain, both 5-HT4 and 5-HT7receptors are found in the hippocampus (36Markstein R. Matsumoto M. Kohler C. Togashi H. Yoshioka M. Hoyer D. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 454-459Google Scholar, 37Thomas D.R. Middlemiss D.N. Taylor S.G. Nelson P. Brown A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 158-164Google Scholar), and these receptors are both believed to be important in learning and memory (38Barnes N.M. Sharp T. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Google Scholar). Thus, there is a need to determine whether 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 receptors can activate ERK, as well as the mechanism for such activation. We have previously characterized activation of adenylyl cyclase by different splice variants of the human Gs-coupled 5-HT4 (39Bach T. Syversveen T. Kvingedal A.M. Krobert K.A. Brattelid T. Kaumann A.J. Levy F.O. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 146-160Google Scholar) and 5-HT7(40Krobert K.A. Bach T. Syversveen T. Kvingedal A.M. Levy F.O. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 620-632Google Scholar) receptors. We now demonstrate that both the human Gs-coupled serotonin receptors 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a), when transiently expressed in HEK293 and COS-7 cells, activate ERK1/2 through a mechanism dependent on Ras and independent of Rap1.

COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 mg/liter gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and transfected at 60–70% confluence with the 5-HT4(b) or 5-HT7(a) receptors using DEAE-dextran according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293 cells were cultured in UltraCULTURE™ general purpose serum-free medium with 2 mml-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and transfected at 60–70% confluence with the indicated cDNA(s) using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. When necessary, empty vector (pcDNA3.1(−); Invitrogen) was included to assure that each dish received the same amount of DNA (1.0 and 2.9 μg of plasmid DNA per 35-mm and 60-mm dish, respectively). If not otherwise indicated, cells were kept in serum-free medium as described until treatment and lysis, ∼48 h after transfection. When indicated, cells were preincubated with 20 μm H89 for 25 min, 5 μm PD98059 for 20 min, or 1 μm PD153035 for 18 h. Cells were stimulated with agonist (10 μm 5-HT or 5 nmEGF) for 5 min, if not otherwise indicated. All experiments were carried out in doublets with at least three replicates, if not otherwise indicated. Equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-ERK1/2, 1:2,000; anti-Ras, 1:1,000; anti-Rap1, 1:500) in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline-0.05% Tween and thereafter incubated with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The immobilized horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized with Bio West chemiluminescent substrate and analyzed with a UVP BioChemie system. After detection of phospho-ERK1/2, membranes were stripped by treatment with 0.5 m NaOH for 5 min at room temperature and extensive washing with distilled H2O and reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (1:10,000) to confirm equal loading. The cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes, transfected and stimulated with agonist as described, lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at room temperature), scraped with a rubber policeman, sheared through a 25-gauge syringe, and immediately snap frozen in liquid N2. The thawed cell lysates were cleared at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations in the supernatants were quantified using the BC assay protein quantitation kit using BSA as standard. Equal amounts of protein were prepared for separation by SDS-PAGE. The cells were assayed as described by van Triest et al. (43van Triest M. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 343-348Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were maintained in 60-mm dishes, transfected, and stimulated as described. The cells were lysed in ice-cold pull-down lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 at room temperature, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Equal amounts of cleared cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C on a tumbler for 1 h with GST-Raf1-RBD or GST-RalGDS-RBD constructs precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads for Ras or Rap1 pull-down experiments, respectively. The beads were pelleted and washed four times with ice-cold pull-down lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 1× loading buffer. The protein samples were loaded and resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed as described. Initial experiments indicated that treatment of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with Gs-coupled human 5-HT4(b) or 5-HT7(a) receptors with 10 μm 5-HT induced dual phosphorylation and thus activation of ERK1/2. Similar results were obtained with HEK293 cells. Because HEK293 cells do not express endogenous 5-HT receptors and had a lower background of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, these cells were selected for further study. Based on the potency of 5-HT to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity through human 5-HT4(b) (39Bach T. Syversveen T. Kvingedal A.M. Krobert K.A. Brattelid T. Kaumann A.J. Levy F.O. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 146-160Google Scholar) or 5-HT7(a) (40Krobert K.A. Bach T. Syversveen T. Kvingedal A.M. Levy F.O. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 620-632Google Scholar) receptors and 5-HT concentration-response experiments with ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown), a concentration of 10 μm 5-HT was chosen for the remaining experiments. A high resolution time course showed that the maximal 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) receptors occurred after 5 min (Fig. 1 A). Time courses with more extended periods of stimulation showed that 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) (data not shown) and 5-HT7(a) (Fig. 1 B) receptors peaked after ∼5 min and then decreased. There was no second peak or sustained activation of ERK1/2. All splice variants of the human serotonin receptors 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 are Gs-coupled receptors that upon agonist stimulation induce a rapid increase in the formation of cAMP, leading to activation of PKA or Epac. To examine the role of PKA in the signaling pathway, HEK293 cells transiently transfected with either 5-HT4(b) or 5-HT7(a) were preincubated with the PKA inhibitor H89. Pretreatment with H89 led to a partial inhibition of 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2, as shown in Fig. 2 A for the 5-HT4(b) receptor. However, a more efficient inhibition was observed when the transiently transfected cells were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16–18 h before treatment with 5-HT, as shown in Fig. 2 B for the 5-HT7(a) receptor. MEK plays a central role in the classical signaling pathway from cell surface receptors to ERK1/2. Pretreatment with the selective MEK inhibitor PD98059, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” blocked 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 in cells transfected with 5-HT4(b) receptors (data not shown) or 5-HT7(a) (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, the above data show that 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 by human 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a)receptors is mediated through a pathway dependent on MEK and at least partially dependent on PKA. Several studies have shown that Gs-coupled receptors may transactivate RTKs (29Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Google Scholar, 30Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Google Scholar, 31Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were preincubated with the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035 to determine possible involvement of EGFR transactivation. The presence of PD153035 did not influence the 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) (data not shown) or 5-HT7(a) receptors (Fig. 3 A). As a positive control, the presence of PD153035 was shown to completely eliminate activation of ERK1/2 by EGF in nontransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 B). The above data suggest that activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors does not require transactivation of EGFRs. Activation of ERK1/2 by endogenous β2-ARs in HEK293 cells has been reported to be PKA-dependent and mediated through a pathway independent of Ras. Although both Ras and Rap1 were activated by isoproterenol treatment, only Rap1 was capable of coupling to a Raf isoform and activating ERK1/2 (20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar). The Rap1 interfering mutant, Rap1N17, and the Rap1-specific GTPase-activating protein, Rap1GAP1, were used to investigate the role of Rap1 in the activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors in co-transfection experiments. The presence of Rap1N17 (data not shown) or Rap1GAP1 (Fig. 4 A) did not influence the 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2, although activation of Rap1 was abolished, as evidenced by pull-down of activated Rap1 (Rap1-GTP) with the RBD of RalGDS (Fig. 4 B). GPCRs may activate the small GTPase Ras, which plays a central role in the activation of ERK1/2 through several different types of receptors. Therefore, the RBD of Raf1, which only binds activated (GTP-bound) Ras, was used in pull-down experiments to test whether 5-HT could induce activation of Ras. Such experiments documented activation of Ras by 5-HT through both 5-HT4(b) receptors (data not shown) and 5-HT7(a) receptors (Fig. 5 A). Nontransfected HEK293 cells were treated with EGF as a positive control for Ras activation (Fig. 5 A). Dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of Ras were used to further investigate the role of Ras in the 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors was highly reduced in the presence of the dominant negative variant of Ras, RasN17 (Fig. 5 B). The data in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that the 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 is dependent on Ras, but independent of Rap1. When cells co-transfected with 5-HT4(b) receptors and the constitutively active variant of Ras, RasV12, were treated with 5-HT, an additional activation of ERK1/2 was observed compared with the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 in these cells. HEK293 cells express several effectors of activated Ras, e.g. different isoforms of Raf. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a point-mutated variant of Raf1, RafS621A, which interferes with Raf1-mediated signaling, or with the constitutively active variant RafCAAX to investigate the role of Raf1 in the activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors. The cells were incubated for 16–18 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before stimulation with 5-HT, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of RafS621A suppressed the activation of ERK1/2 mediated through 5-HT4(b) (Fig. 6 A,top panels) and 5-HT7(a) (Fig. 6 A,bottom panels) receptors. When cells co-transfected with RafCAAX and 5-HT4(b) (data not shown) or 5-HT7(a) (Fig. 6 B) receptors were treated with 5-HT, increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed compared with the constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation in these cells. To determine the role of B-Raf, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with 5-HT7(a) receptors and dominant negative (N-B-Raf) or constitutively active (CAAX-B-Raf) B-Raf. The dominant negative mutant of B-Raf corresponds to the N-terminal region of quail B-Raf (amino acids 1–443) (42Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Google Scholar). In several experiments, the presence of N-B-Raf had only a weak inhibitory effect on 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7 A). In general, the inhibitory effect of N-B-Raf was weaker than that of RafS621A. Additional activation of ERK1/2 was induced by 5-HT in the presence of CAAX-B-Raf, as was the case with RafCAAX (Fig. 7 A). Overexpression of RafS621A and N-B-Raf was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-Raf1 (Fig. 6 C) and anti-B-Raf (Fig. 7 B) antibodies, respectively. In this paper, we report the activation of ERK1/2 by 5-HT through the human Gs-coupled serotonin receptors 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) transiently expressed in COS-7 and HEK293 cells. We also demonstrate that the pathway in HEK293 cells involves Ras but not Rap1. Pretreatment of transiently transfected HEK293 cells with H89 suppressed 5-HT-induced dual phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating a role for PKA. Intracellular signals from the large family of G protein-coupled receptors are conveyed by α subunits (Gα) or β and γ subunits (Gβγ) of heterotrimeric G proteins. Of the four main classes of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12/13), Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors have been shown to mediate activation of ERK1/2 through free Gβγ subunits (44Crespo P., Xu, N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Google Scholar, 45Pace A.M. Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1685-1695Google Scholar). Gβγ subunits released upon stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors have not been shown to mediate activation of ERK1/2, possibly because cells contain far less Gs than Gi or Gq. However, Gαs activates adenylyl cyclase and thereby PKA, which has been proposed to play an essential role in the ERK1/2 cascade (12Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar, 20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar, 34Ambrosini A. Tininini S. Barassi A. Racagni G. Sturani E. Zippel R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 54-60Google Scholar). In line with this, we found that ERK1/2 activation through the Gs-coupled receptors 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) was inhibited in cells pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H89. In addition to activation of PKA, cAMP may lead to activation of Rap1 through the Rap1-selective exchange factors Epac1 or Epac2 (13de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar, 14Kawasaki H. Sprihtgett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Google Scholar,46Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Google Scholar). The small GTPase Rap1 is a Ras analogue, which upon isoproterenol stimulation of HEK293 cells has been reported to recruit B-Raf to the membrane and thereby activate the ERK1/2 cascade (20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar). We determined the role of Rap1 in the observed 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with either Rap1GAP1 or Rap1N17 and 5-HT receptors. Even though Rap1N17 is not a true dominant negative (47van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Google Scholar,48Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Google Scholar), it has been used to inhibit Rap1 activity in several studies (12Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar,20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar, 49Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1001-1015Google Scholar). Therefore, we used Rap1N17 to support the data obtained with Rap1GAP1. The observed 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells was not influenced by co-expression of either Rap1GAP1 or Rap1N17, although Rap1 activation was eliminated. Thus, the Gs-coupled 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a)receptors mediate activation of ERK1/2 through a Rap1-independent pathway, in contrast to what was reported for β2-ARs (20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar). The small GTPase Ras is the best characterized and serves as the main activator of the ERK1/2 cascade by linking RTKs and all isoforms of Raf. RTK-mediated activation of Ras involves a series of SH2- and SH3-dependent protein-protein interactions between tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor, the adapter proteins Shc and Grb2, and the Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS (50Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Google Scholar, 51Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Barsagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Google Scholar). Certain GPCRs coupling to Gi and Gq mediate activation of Ras through free Gβγ subunits, e.g. by stimulation of Shc (44Crespo P., Xu, N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Google Scholar, 45Pace A.M. Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1685-1695Google Scholar, 52van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Google Scholar). Isoproterenol stimulation of endogenous β2-ARs in HEK293 cells was reported to activate both Rap1 and Ras, but only Rap1 was implicated in the activation of ERK1/2 (20Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Google Scholar). The mechanism of Ras activation was not addressed. Stimulation of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with 5-HT4(b) or 5-HT7(a) receptors also increased the amount of GTP-bound Ras, and, in addition, 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 was inhibited by expression of the dominant negative mutant of Ras, RasN17. Thus, activation of ERK1/2 through Gs-coupled 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a)receptors in HEK293 cells is Ras-dependent. Since the original manuscript was submitted for publication, two papers have been published that support the finding of Rap1-independent activation of ERK1/2 through Gs-coupled receptors (53Klinger M. Kudlacek O. Seidel M. Freissmuth M. Sexl V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32490-32497Google Scholar, 54Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Google Scholar). Furthermore, in accordance with our finding in HEK293 cells of a Ras-dependent mechanism for activation of ERK1/2, Enserinket al. (54Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Google Scholar) report a Ras-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells subsequent to elevation of intracellular cAMP. Transactivation of RTKs has been proposed as an alternative mechanism for activation of Ras through GPCRs (55Leserer M. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Life. 2000; 49: 405-409Google Scholar). The signal will pass the membrane three times, and activation of Ras and the ERK1/2 cascade will subsequently take place as by direct stimulation of RTKs,e.g. EGFR. Activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b)and 5-HT7(a) receptors was not inhibited in the presence of the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035, indicating that EGFR transactivation is not required. The effects of cAMP on the ERK1/2 cascade are cell type-specific. In some cell types, PKA was found to inhibit RTK-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (15Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar, 16Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. Macdonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Google Scholar, 17Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence J.C., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Google Scholar, 18Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Google Scholar). Raf is the main target for cAMP-mediated regulation of the ERK1/2 cascade. The serine residues 43, 259, and 621 have all been suggested to be involved in the regulation of Raf1 activity (56Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 43 does not inhibit the catalytic activity of Raf1, but it has been proposed to disrupt the normal Ras-Raf association and Raf1 activation (15Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar). Furthermore, even though B-Raf does not have a phosphorylation site analogous to serine 43 in Raf1, elevation of intracellular cAMP levels by forskolin inhibited the EGF-dependent activation of B-Raf (57Sidovar M.F. Kozlowski P. Lee J.W. Collins M.A., He, Y.Q. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28688-28694Google Scholar). The serine 621 residue of Raf1 has been suggested as PKA phosphorylation site. Raf1 phosphorylated at this site exhibited reduced affinity for activated Ras as well as impaired catalytic activity (58Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of serine 621 to alanine resulted in loss of catalytic activity. Thus, a serine 621 to alanine mutant, RafS621A, has been used as a “dominant negative” variant of Raf1. However, recent reports have shown that the list of residues involved in the PKA-dependent regulation of Raf1 activity may also include serine residues 233 and 338 (59Dumaz N. Light Y. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Google Scholar, 60Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Google Scholar). Based on the literature concerning cAMP-mediated regulation of Raf1, RafS621A cannot be considered a true dominant negative. Still, we found that the Ras-dependent, 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 was partly inhibited by co-expression of the Raf1 interfering mutant RafS621A, implicating Raf1 in the pathway. In melanocytes, dominant negative B-Raf has been used to show that Ras and B-Raf were involved in cAMP-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (42Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Google Scholar). We found only little or no effect of co-expression of dominant negative B-Raf under conditions where RafS621A caused more pronounced reduction of ERK1/2 activation by 5-HT. Whether RafS621A is a true dominant negative or only a partial inhibitor of Raf1 activation, these data suggest that one or more isoforms of Raf are involved in the activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors in HEK293 cells. The immediate upstream activator of ERK1/2 is MEK (61Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Google Scholar), which is involved in most pathways described for activation of ERK1/2. The presence of the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors. These results suggest that the 5-HT-induced activation of ERK1/2 is MEK-dependent. The high number of publications concerning activation of MAP kinases via Gs-coupled receptors illustrates the complexity of this field. Several publications have shown that activation of Ras may occur after stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors. However, little is known about how these receptors or agents that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP mediate activation of Ras. Src or a Src-like kinase has been suggested to be involved in the activation of ERK1/2 subsequent to stimulation of the Gs-coupled A2A-adenosine receptor (53Klinger M. Kudlacek O. Seidel M. Freissmuth M. Sexl V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32490-32497Google Scholar). However, this may not account for the 5-HT-induced Ras-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells because the Src-dependent mechanism was observed in Chinese hamster ovary, PC12, and NIH3T3 cells, but not in HEK293 cells. To our knowledge, a Ras-specific exchange factor activated by cAMP, analogous to Epac for Rap1, has not been published. This does not mean that a Ras-specific exchange factor directly activated by cAMP or PKA phosphorylation does not exist. Alternatively, there may be more indirect actions of PKA via known or unknown proteins that mediate activation of Ras. The biological significance of the observed activation of ERK1/2 by 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 receptors is unknown. The biological effects of 5-HT are mediated by at least 14 different receptors, and there is hardly a target cell for 5-HT that expresses only one type of 5-HT receptor. Based on current knowledge about signal transduction mechanisms and ERK activation, other 5-HT receptors than 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 would be expected to play a more important role in ERK activation. However, examples of biological systems exist where ERK activation by Gs-coupled serotonin receptors may be important. In Aplysia, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by serotonin is implicated in memory formation and occurs through a Gs-coupled 5-HT receptor (32Martin K.C. Michael D. Rose J.C. Barad M. Casadio A. Zhu H. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Google Scholar, 33Michael D. Martin K.C. Seger R. Ning M.M. Baston R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1864-1869Google Scholar). In mammalian brain, 5-HT4 and 5-HT7receptors are both found in the hippocampus (36Markstein R. Matsumoto M. Kohler C. Togashi H. Yoshioka M. Hoyer D. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 454-459Google Scholar, 37Thomas D.R. Middlemiss D.N. Taylor S.G. Nelson P. Brown A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 158-164Google Scholar), and 5-HT7 receptors were recently shown to activate ERKs in cultured hippocampal neurons (35Errico H. Crozier R.A. Plummer M.R. Cowen D.S. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 361-367Google Scholar). The importance of ERK activation for the involvement of these receptors in learning and memory (38Barnes N.M. Sharp T. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Google Scholar) remains to be determined. In conclusion, we demonstrate activation of ERK1/2 by 5-HT through the human Gs-coupled 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors in COS-7 and HEK293 cells. In HEK293 cells, the observed ERK1/2 activation was Ras-dependent but Rap1-independent and involved one or more Raf isoforms. Therefore, we suggest the following pathway for activation of ERK1/2 by 5-HT through 5-HT4(b) and 5-HT7(a) receptors: Gs-coupled 5-HT receptor→→ cAMP→ PKA→→ Ras→ Raf→ MEK→ ERK1/2. The unknown pathway from cAMP/PKA to Ras activation remains a challenge for future research. We thank Drs. Johannes L. Bos, Philip J. S. Stork, Roser Buscà, and Alain Eychene for generating and providing necessary plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W1968930573,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in the development, proliferation, and differentiation of cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin. These EGFR-dependent cellular processes are mediated by a repertoire of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by the activation of the EGFR cytoplasmic domain, which originates from ligand binding of its extracellular domain. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which the intracellular domain of EGFR transmits mitogenic messages to the downstream signaling pathways, we used the cytoplasmic region of EGFR as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that ADP-ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4) interacts with the intracellular part of EGFR and mediates the EGF-dependent cellular activation of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) but does not mediate the activation of PLD1. In addition, ARF4-mediated PLD2 activation leads to dramatic activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1), and, importantly, ARF4 activity is required for EGF-induced activation of cellular AP-1. Our findings indicate that ARF4 is a critical molecule that directly regulates cellular PLD2 activity and that this ARF4-mediated PLD2 activation stimulates AP-1-dependent transcription in the EGF-induced cellular response. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in the development, proliferation, and differentiation of cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin. These EGFR-dependent cellular processes are mediated by a repertoire of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by the activation of the EGFR cytoplasmic domain, which originates from ligand binding of its extracellular domain. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which the intracellular domain of EGFR transmits mitogenic messages to the downstream signaling pathways, we used the cytoplasmic region of EGFR as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that ADP-ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4) interacts with the intracellular part of EGFR and mediates the EGF-dependent cellular activation of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) but does not mediate the activation of PLD1.

Druker B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F217-F248PubMed Google Scholar). The EGF receptor is the prototypical receptor with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

Upon ligand binding by its extracellular domain, EGFR forms homodimers or heterodimers with the closely related ErbB receptors (such as ErbB2/Her2) and begins tyrosine autophosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

This autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of EGFR is critical for signal transduction, since it creates docking sites for various signaling molecules, such as molecules containing Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains. These interactions with downstream molecules create signaling complexes that lead to oncogenic responses by linking EGFR activation to numerous cytoplasmic signaling pathways (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Salomon D.S. Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

In cancer cells, the signaling domain of EGFR mediates and regulates the proliferative signals generated from this receptor. Therefore, identifying molecules that interact with the signaling domain of EGFR will contribute not only to the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of EGFR in cancer progression but also to the development of new treatments for uncontrolled growth of human cancers. To further understand the molecular mechanisms by which the intracellular region of EGFR transmits signals to various intracellular signaling pathways, we used the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening of a human carcinoma cDNA library. Here we identify an intracellular protein ARF4 that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR. ARFs, members of the Ras superfamily, are small 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. The inactive GDP-bound form of ARF is soluble, although it can weakly associate with the cell membrane. On the other hand, the active GTP-bound form binds tightly to the membrane (5Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the basis of deduced amino acid sequences and phylogenetic analysis, ARFs have been divided into three classes: class I (ARF1, -2, and -3), class II (ARF4 and -5), and class III (ARF6) (6Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although all three classes of ARF proteins are capable of activating cellular phospholipase D, the specific roles of each ARF seem to be different. Class I is involved in the trafficking pathway that links the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and endosomal systems, and class III, instead, takes part in the trafficking pathway that links the endosome and plasma membrane system (7Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Many researchers believe that class II ARFs are only supplementary to class I ARFs and, as such, have focused their attention on class I ARFs while nearly ignoring the cellular functions of the class II ARF4 and ARF5 proteins. Here, we show that EGF does not activate PLD1 but does activate cellular PLD2 through the activation of ARF4. Moreover, this ARF4-dependent activation of PLD2 is required for inducing the EGF-induced transcriptional activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1). The EcoRI fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR was fused in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) of the pGBKT7 fusion vector (Clontech) to create the BD/EGFR construct. A human epithelial carcinoma cDNA library was separately fused with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) of the pGAD-GH vector (Clontech). The yeast strain pJ69–2A was co-transformed, by a lithium acetate-based method, with this library and the BD/EGFR construct. The transformed yeast cells were screened, according to the manufacturer's protocols, for their ability to grow on plates lacking histidine and adenine. PCR was used to obtain full-length cDNAs encoding ARF4, PLD1, PLD2, and EGFR by use of the Rapid-ScreenTM arrayed human placenta cDNA library, which is constructed in the pCMV6-XL4 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD) vector. The ARF4 wild-type and mutant cDNA fragments were cloned either into the mammalian expression vector pEBG, which also encodes the glutathione S-transferase tag (8Hayashi M. Tapping R.I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), or into the multiple cloning site of the vector pRK5, which encodes three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at its carboxyl terminus (9Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All mutations in the ARF4 gene were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis as previously described (9Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 293T cells overexpressing EGFR (293T/EGFR) were obtained by transfecting, via the calcium phosphate method, the hygromycin selection vector pCMV6-XL4 into 293T cells, which express undetectable levels of endogenous EGFR. Transfected cultures were selected with hygromycin (300 μg/ml) for 10–14 days at 37 °C. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) as described previously (10Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to subconfluence and then starved overnight by replacing medium with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and nonessential amino acids before initiating the 30-min stimulation with EGF (50 ng/ml). Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as described (10Kato Y.

Cell lysates were then incubated with protein G-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, after which the beads were discarded, and the supernatants were incubated with specific antibodies (2 μg/ml anti-EGFR antibody or IgG from preimmune serum) for 1 h followed by overnight incubation with protein G-agarose at 4 °C. Samples were collected and washed four times with lysis buffer. The precipitated samples were analyzed by Amersham Bioscience's ECL blotting system with specific antibodies (200 ng/ml unless mentioned). The R891 anti-ARF4 antiserum and monoclonal 1D9 antibody against the other ARFs (ARF1, -3, -5, and -6) were kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Kahn (7Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C.

After transient transfection experiments, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The anti-EGFR antibody and anti-HA antibody were added to cells in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, washed four times with PBS, then incubated 1 h with Alexa Fluor 568 goat-anti-rabbit (red-orange) or Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (green) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were washed and mounted on coverslips with Prolong (Molecular Probes) mounting medium for immunofluorescence. Briefly, 293T/EGFR cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing wild-type ARF4 with three HA tags at its C terminus. After serum starvation, cells were scraped gently and resuspended in PBS. The samples were treated with 8 μm digitonin (WAKO Chemicals, Richmond, VA), in the presence of GTPγS (100 μm) with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. ATP (1 mm) and magnesium (2 mm) were included in all experiments. Intracellular proteins were released from digitonin-treated cells by microcentrifugation for 20 min. Supernatants and pellets were collected separately and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The ARF4-HA3 protein was detected by probing immunoblots with the anti-HA antibody. Cell membranes were prepared from ten 150-mm dishes of confluent cells. Cells were washed in PBS, scraped, and centrifuged. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 8% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then disrupted with a glass homogenizer. Cell extracts were layered onto a 41% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 90 min. Membrane material at the interface was collected, diluted to 10 ml, and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 60 min. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES for the following ARF activation assays. For the nucleotide binding assay, recombinant human ARF4 (2.5 μg) was incubated at 37 °C with [35S]GTPγS, with or without EGF, in the presence of membranes as previously described (5Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein-bound nucleotides were separated by filtration through nitrocellulose filters. Bound nucleotide was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by using excess, unlabeled GTPγS. Cells were starved and labeled overnight with [3H]palmitate (5 μCi/ml) in 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) in the presence of 0.3% butanol for 30 min. PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation was performed as described previously (5Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G.

The lipid phase was extracted and developed by TLC on silica gel 60 plates by using the upper phase of a mixture of ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid (9:5:2) as the solvent. PhosphorImager technology (Molecular Dynamics) was used to determine the amount of labeled phosphatidylbutanol and total lipids. Reporter plasmids (Stratagene) encoded a luciferase gene whose expression was driven by one of the followingcis-acting elements: seven tandem repeats of the AP-1 binding site; four tandem repeats of interferon γ-activated sequence (GAS), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), or serum response element (SRE). Cells were grown on 35-mm multiwell plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and transiently transfected with 8 μg of total plasmid DNA as described previously (10Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J.

Briefly, in each transfection, 0.05 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCMV-βGal; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was included to determine the transfection efficiency. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were starved overnight and treated with or without stimuli as described in the figure legends. Cell extracts were prepared, and the activities of β-galactosidase and luciferase were measured as described previously (10Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 11Kato Y. Zhao M. Morikawa A. Sugiyama T. Chakravortty D. Koide N. Yoshida T. Tapping R.I. Yang Y. Yokochi T. Lee J.D. J. Biol.

The luciferase activity in each experiment was divided by the activity of β-galactosidase to correct for transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (14Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.-M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14928-14934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The AP-1 oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min by using the gel shift assay system kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The specificity of binding was determined by adding homologous or mutated unlabeled synthetic oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For gel supershift assays, rabbit affinity-purified antibodies (2 μg) to Jun and Fos families of nuclear factors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated for 30 min with nuclear extracts and with synthetic oligonucleotides at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing, nonreducing 4% acrylamide gels, and the complexes were visualized by PhosphorImager technology. To identify molecules that act as mediators of EGFR-dependent signaling, we used the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. From a human carcinoma cDNA library, 2 × 107 transformants were screened, and 102 positive clones were selected for sequence analysis based on their potential interaction with EGFR. In this GAL4 system, growth of transformed yeast in medium lacking histidine and adenine is completely dependent on the presence of sequences from both ARF4 and EGFR (Fig. 1 A). Using the BLAST algorithm and the nucleotide data base at the National Library of Medicine, we found one clone that encoded the small GTPase ARF4. To study the interaction between EGFR and ARF4 in mammalian cells, we transfected expression vectors encoding either wild-type or mutant ARF4 with three C-terminal HA epitope tags (ARF4-HA3) into 293T/EGFR cells (Fig. 1 B). These transfected cells were treated with or without EGF and later lysed to prepare total cell lysates. From these cell lysates, anti-HA antibody was used to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged ARF4s and other cellular molecules complexed with these ARF4s. The ARF4-HA3 complex was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellets were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-EGFR antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, EGFR co-purified with wild-type ARF4 only in lysates from EGF-treated cells but not from cells without EGF stimulation. In contrast, EGF treatment was not required for the co-purification of EGFR with the active form of the ARF4 mutant, ARF4(Q71L), which theoretically constitutively binds to GTP (Fig. 1 B). The inactive form of ARF4, ARF4(T31N), which constitutively binds to GDP, did not co-immunoprecipitate with EGFR regardless of EGF stimulation of the cells (Fig. 1 B). In order to test whether EGFR interacts with endogenous ARF4 or other members of the ARF family, extracts from cells stimulated with or without EGF were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR or control antibodies. The resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with R891 anti-ARF4 antiserum to detect endogenous ARF4 or with the 1D9 monoclonal antibody to detect the other ARF family members (ARF1, -3, -5, and -6) (7Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that ARF4 was present in the immunocomplex derived from EGF-stimulated cells, whereas other ARFs (ARF1, -3, -5, and -6) were not detected in the immunocomplex from EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 C). In cells without EGF stimulation, we were unable to detect any endogenous ARFs (ARF1, -3, -4, -5, and -6) that co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that in mammalian cells, EGFR or the EGFR complex preferentially interacts with GTP-bound ARF4 but does not interact with GDP-bound ARF4. We next tried to determine whether the interaction between EGFR and activated ARF4 as well as the activation of ARF4 could potentially affect the EGFR activation by EGF. We examined tyrosine autophosphorylation of the EGFR signaling domain before or after stimulation of EGF in 293T/EGFR cells expressing wild-type ARF4 or ARF4(Q71L) (Fig. 1 D). No difference in the tyrosine autophosphorylation of EGFR was detected in the presence of the wild-type or constitutively active form of ARF, indicating that the association of ARF4 with EGFR and ARF4 activation do not have a detectable effect on EGFR activity before or after EGF induction. After we demonstrated that the affinity between ARF4 and EGFR is induced by EGF treatment and that association of ARF4 with GTP is critical for this EGF-induced interaction of EGFR and ARF4, we next examined whether ARF4 translocates to cell membranes and colocalizes with EGFR after EGF stimulation. Before and after EGF induction, the subcellular localization of ARF4-HA3 and EGFR in 293T/EGFR cells was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). Without the addition of EGF, cellular AFR4 was mainly localized in the cytosol, whereas, after EGF induction, cells expressing ARF4 formed membrane ruffles and ARF4 together with EGFR became concentrated in the ruffles. This result suggests that, after EGF induction, ARF4 translocates to membrane ruffles and colocalizes with EGFR. Next, we examined whether EGF-dependent cell activation would enhance the GTP binding of ARF4. The purified recombinant ARF4 protein was separately incubated with membranes prepared from 293T/EGFR or 293T cells together with GTPγS and treated with or without EGF. The amount of GTPγS binding to the ARF4 protein was analyzed by a reconstitution assay as previously described (5Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell membranes were prepared from 293/EGFR or 293 cells followed by incubation with EGF and/or recombinant ARF4 in the presence of GTPγS. Protein-bound GTPγS was separated by filtration through nitrocellulose filters and was quantitated by scintillation counting. In comparison with the GTPγS binding to the 293T/EGFR cell membranes alone, no significant enhancement of GTPγS binding to cell membranes occurred by incorporating either ARF4 or EGF proteins in these assays (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, treating this membrane preparation in the presence of both ARF4 and EGF notably increased the level of GTPγS association with ARF4 (Fig. 3 A), indicating that EGF treatment of membranes boosted the binding of GTPγ to ARF4. In similar experiments, we used membranes obtained from 293T cells, in which EGFR expression is undetectable. Fig. 3 B shows that with these EGFR-deficient membranes, there was no increase of GTPγS binding to ARF4, neither by adding ARF4 nor by adding ARF4 and EGF. These results demonstrate that EGF enhances the binding of GTPγS to ARF4. We then examined whether the active GTP-bound form of ARF4 proteins attaches to EGFR-enriched membranes and whether the inactive GDP-bound form of ARF4 remains cytosolic. ARF4 with three C-terminal HA tags (ARF4-HA3) was expressed in 293T/EGFR cells. After serum starvation, cells were collected and incubated with GTPγS in the presence or absence of EGF. These cells were then treated with digitonin, a detergent that permeabilizes cell membranes and allows cytosolic ARF4-HA3 to leak out of the cells. The cytosolic and membrane-containing cell pellet fractions of these cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody to examine the distribution of ARF4-HA3 between these two fractions. The digitonin-treated cells released most of their ARF4-HA3 into the supernatant, indicating that most ARF4-HA3 proteins were cytosolic, whereas without digitonin treatment, ARF4-HA3 remained inside the cells (Fig. 3 C). In the presence of either GTPγS or EGF, digitonin-treated cells only partially released ARF4-HA3 into supernatant (Fig. 3 C). However, when these cells were treated with EGF in combination with GTPγS, almost all ARF4-HA3 was retained in the cell membrane-containing cell pellet fraction. These data, together with the EGF-induced ARF4 translocation data shown in Fig. 2, indicate that the activation of ARF4 either by EGF or by association with GTPγS induces the translocation of ARF4 from the cytosol to EGFR-enriched cell membranes. Previous studies have shown that agonist-induced ARF activation and its consequent translocation to cell membranes stimulate PLD activity (13Slaaby R. Jensen T. Hansen H.S. Frohman M.A. Seedorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33722-33727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Houle M.G. Kahn R.A. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30836-30841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate whether EGF-induced ARF4 activation is able to stimulate PLD activity in cells, we transiently co-expressed PLD1 or PLD2 together with ARF4 or its mutants in 293T/EGFR cells, followed by EGF stimulation of particular samples. Activation of cellular PLD was determined by the unique ability of PLD to produce, in the presence of butanol, phosphatidylbutanol, which cannot be further metabolized. In cells overexpressing PLD2 and ARF4, PLD activity was dramatically stimulated by EGF treatment (Fig. 4 A). However, in cells overexpressing PLD1 and ARF4, this EGF-induced up-regulation of PLD activity was not observed (Fig. 4 B). In addition, overexpressing ARF4(Q71L), the dominant active form of ARF4, constitutively stimulated the activity of PLD2 but did not have the same effect on PLD1 (Fig. 4, A and B). These data suggest that ARF4 mediates EGF-induced cellular activation of PLD2 but does not mediate activation of PLD1. As a positive control in these experiments, we used the small GTPase RalA, which mediates EGF-induced PLD1 activity and, to a lesser extent, PLD2 activity (17Lu Z. Hornia A. Joseph T. Sukezane T. Frankel P. Zhong M. Bychenok S., Xu, L. Feig L.A. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4,A and B). PLD activity, in cooperation with EGFR, has been reported to be involved in the transformation of cells (17Lu Z. Hornia A. Joseph T. Sukezane T. Frankel P. Zhong M. Bychenok S., Xu, L. Feig L.A. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One of the major causes of EGFR-dependent cell transformation is the altered expression of specific target genes that results from changing the activities of certain transcriptional factors by unrestrained signaling effectors. The role of PLD2 in the EGF-mediated modulation of gene expression through transcriptional activation has not been thoroughly examined. We tested whether ARF4-mediated PLD2 activation regulates gene transcription through specific enhancer elements, such as AP-1, interferon GAS, NFAT, or SRE. For these experiments, we used expression plasmids encoding the luciferase gene, driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) joined to tandem repeats of AP-1, GAS, NFAT, or SRE binding elements. These plasmids were individually transfected into 293T/EGFR cells. Expression of activated PLD2 significantly induced luciferase expression driven by the promoter containing AP-1; in contrast, luciferase expression was not induced by promoters containing GAS, NFAT, and SRE binding sites (Fig. 5 A). These data suggest that PLD2 activation stimulated by the active form of ARF can enhance AP-1 activity. We further tested whether this ARF4-mediated PLD2 activation is involved in EGF-induced cellular AP-1 activation. 293T/EGFR cells were transiently transfected with the AP-1- or SRE-driven luciferase reporter constructs and, in some cases, cotransfected with the expression vector encoding ARF4(T31N), followed by EGF treatment (Fig. 5 B). EGF induced AP-1−dependent reporter gene expression more than 3-fold, and this induction of luciferase expression was inhibited considerably by dominant negative ARF4(T31N). In contrast, SRE-dependent reporter gene expression stimulated by EGF was not blocked by ARF4(T31N) (Fig. 5 C). To further confirm and characterize the AP-1 activation by ARF4-mediated PLD2 activation, we used nuclear extracts generated from cells transfected with the combination of expression plasmids as indicated in Fig. 5 for electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, and the resultant nuclear extracts were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing AP-1 sequences. Binding studies revealed that the AP-1/nuclear protein complex increased dramatically in cells containing activated PLD2 due to the co-expression of the ARF4 active form, ARF4(Q71L) (Fig. 6 A). Unlabeled homologous AP-1 oligonucleotides prevented the binding of the radiolabeled AP-1 sequences to nuclear proteins, whereas mutated AP-1 oligonucleotides did not prevent this binding (Fig. 6 A). In addition, to examine the individual components within the AP-1-nuclear protein binding complex, we included antibodies against c-Jun or c-Fos in some of these electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (Fig. 6 B). We found that these antibodies significantly up-shifted the binding of nuclear proteins from cells containing activated PLD2 to the AP-1 consensus sequence, suggesting the presence of c-Jun and c-Fos in these DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 6 B). In 293T/EGFR cells, EGF induces the binding of nuclear proteins to AP-1 (Fig. 6 C). We tested whether ARF4 activity is required for EGF-dependent AP-1 activation. We found that the cellular expression of dominant negative forms of ARF4, ARF4(T31N), dramatically reduced this EGF-mediated binding of nuclear proteins to AP-1 oligonucleotides (Fig. 6 C), suggesting a critical role of ARF4 activity in EGF-induced AP-1 activation. Taken together, these results suggest an important function of both ARF4 and PLD2 in regulating the transcriptional activity of AP-1 in the EGF-induced cell activation. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been implicated in the regulation of AP-1 activity (18Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 19Karin M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To explore the possible involvement of two MAP kinase pathways, BMK1/ERK5 and ERK1/2, in mediating PLD2-induced AP-1 activation, we transfected expression vectors encoding ARF(Q71L) and PLD2 into 293T/EGFR cells and examined the activity of endogenous BMK1/ERK5 and ERK1/2. We found that the activation of PLD2 by ARF4(Q71L) had no detectable effect on endogenous BMK1/ERK5 and ERK1/2 activities (Fig. 7). MEK5(D) and MEK1(E), dominant active forms of MEK5 and MEK1, are known to specifically activate BMK1/ERK5 and ERK1/2, respectively. When MEK5(D) or MEK1(E) were expressed in 293T/EGFR cells, the endogenous BMK1/ERK5 or ERK1/2 was activated correspondingly (Fig. 7). These results suggest that these two MAP kinase cascades are not critically involved in AP-1 activation by the ARF4/PLD2 pathway. In this study, we have identified ARF4 as an intermediate molecule that interacts with EGFR and have shown that EGFR-mediated ARF4 activation specifically up-regulates cellular PLD2 but does not up-regulate PLD1, activity. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this ARF4-dependent PLD2 activation significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of AP-1. EGFR is known to cooperate with PLD in cellular transformation, yet the molecular mechanism of this oncogenic process is unknown. One possible route, as indicated by our findings, is via the dramatic enhancement of the activity of the AP-1 oncoprotein, resulting from EGFR-dependent PLD activation. ARFs are usually modified by myristoylation at Gly2 through the action of N-myristoyltransferase (20Kahn R.A. Goddard C. Newkirk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8282-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Kanoh et al. (21Kanoh H. Williger B.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5421-5429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that a mutant form of ARF3, which is mutated at Gly2 to eliminate myristoylation, does not abolish its interaction with arfaptin 1. In our yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 1 A), affinity between the EGFR cytoplasmic domain and ARF4 does not seem to require N-terminal myristoylation. In yeast two-hybrid-based assay, the ARF4 fusion protein that we used contained an N-terminal GAL4-activating domain, which should have prohibited the ARF4 part of this GAL4-AD/ARF4 fusion protein from being modified by N-myristoyltransferase, an enzyme that can act only at the N-terminal end of a protein (22Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Without its N-terminal myristoylation, ARF4 appears to have some affinity with the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR; however, drawing any conclusion is difficult without obtaining additional information about the N-terminal modification of GAL4/ARF4 fusion proteins in yeast. More detailed studies are needed to decipher the contribution of N-terminal myristoylation of ARF4 in its binding to the cytoplasmic domain of activated EGFR. In general, ARF proteins are involved with vesicle transport within the Golgi complex, between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex (23Goud B. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), with endosome fusion (24Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with several other processes related to intracellular membrane transport. ARF proteins, with the exception of ARF6, are found either dispersed in the cytosol or associated with Golgi membranes (25D'Souza-Schorey C., Li, G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); ARF6 is permanently bound to plasma membranes. Our discovery indicates that the ARF4 protein is activated by EGFR-mediated cellular activation and is simultaneously translocated from the cytosol to the cellular membrane. Similarly, ARF1 is known to be activated and translocated to the cell membrane by activation of another receptor tyrosine kinase, the insulin receptor (5Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since ARF1 and ARF4 belong to class I and II ARFs, classes that appear to be similar in both their cellular localization and functions, it is not surprising that both ARF1 and ARF4 are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated cellular activation and translocated to cellular membranes. However, it would be interesting to know whether the other members of class I and II ARFs behave similarly in receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent stimulation of cells. PLD, consisting of PLD1 and PLD2 isoforms, hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to choline and to the second messenger, phosphatidic acid, which can serve as a signal transducer. PLD2 is a 106-kDa protein that shares 50−55% homology with PLD1 but lacks the 116-amino acid loop region following the first HKD motif, a highly conserved catalytic motif (HXKX 4D) that is essential for the enzymatic activity of phosphatidyltransferase (26Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PLD2 localizes primarily to plasma membranes, in contrast to PLD1, which localizes solely to perinuclear regions (the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and late endosomes) (27Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In comparison with PLD1, the membrane localization of PLD2 makes it a logical mediator for delivering signals generated from receptors that reside in the cellular membrane. Indeed, other than mediating signaling from activated EGFR, as we have demonstrated, PLD2 can also relay intracellular signals descended from activation of the insulin receptor. AP-1 activity is modulated by a variety of dimers that are composed of members of the Fos, Jun, and ATF families (28van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Whereas the Fos proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) can only form heterodimers with members of the Jun family, the Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) can form both homodimers and heterodimers with Fos members to form transcriptionally active complexes. Moreover, AP-1 activity has been implicated in many biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and oncogenic transformation (29Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3266) Google Scholar, 30Reichmann E. Schwarz H. Deiner E.M. Leitner I. Eilers M. Berger J. Busslinger M. Beug H. Cell. 1992; 71: 1103-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 31Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathways regulate both the amounts and transactivating capacities of the component Fos, Jun, and ATF proteins of AP-1 in a stimulus-specific manner. For instance, treatment of HeLa cells with platelet-derived growth factor, serum, or phorbol esters predominantly activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members of the MAP kinase family, leading to strong stimulation of Jun and Fos activity. On the other hand, treatment with stress-inducing stimuli, such as ultraviolet light, activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase members of the MAP kinase family, which preferentially enhance Jun and ATF activity via phosphorylation of c-Jun serines 63 and 73 and ATF2 threonines 69 and 71, which are located in their respective transactivation domains (32Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of protein kinase A by cAMP strongly enhances only de novo synthesis of JunB and c-Fos (33Flint K.J. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2019-2026PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that AP-1 activity is up-regulated by EGF-induced PLD2 activation (Fig. 5). Still, the intermediate signaling pathways by which PLD2 induces the activation of AP-1 are presently unknown. We have explored the possible involvement of two MAP kinase pathways, ERK1/2 and BMK1/ERK5, in mediating PLD2-induced AP-1 activation and have found that the ARF4-dependent activation of PLD2 has no effect on endogenous BMK1/ERK5 and ERK1/2 activities (Fig. 7), indicating that these two kinase cascades have no involvement in AP-1 activation by the ARF4/PLD2 pathway. We are currently evaluating other signaling pathways to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for mediating PLD2-dependent AP-1 activation."

The position of the native ligand-binding pocket for prostacyclin as well as other derivatives of the 20-carbon eicosanoid, arachidonic acid, has yet to be determined. Through the use of prostanoid receptor sequence alignments, site-directed mutagenesis, and the 2.8-Å x-ray crystallographic structure of bovine rhodopsin, we have developed a three-dimensional model of the agonist-binding pocket within the seven-transmembrane (TM) domains of the human prostacyclin receptor. Upon mutation to alanine, 11 of 29 candidate residues within TM domains II, III, IV, V, and VII exhibited a marked decrease in agonist binding. Of this group, four amino acids, Arg-279 (TMVII), Phe-278 (TMVII), Tyr-75 (TMII), and Phe-95 (TMIII), were identified (via receptor amino acid sequence alignment, ligand structural comparison, and computer-assisted homology modeling) as having direct molecular interactions with ligand side-chain constituents. This binding pocket is distinct from that of the biogenic amine receptors and rhodopsin where the native ligands (also composed of a carbon ring and a carbon chain) are accommodated in an opposing direction.

G-protein coupled receptor prostacyclin 5′-guanlyl-imidodiphosphate analysis of variance human prostacyclin receptor transmembrane Vascular smooth muscle relaxation and inhibition of platelet aggregation are two key physiological processes mediated by human prostacyclin. Dysfunctional prostacyclin activity has been implicated in the development of a number of cardiovascular diseases including thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and systemic and pulmonary hypertension (1Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast to other members of the rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)1 subfamily such as the adrenergic receptors or other members of the prostanoid family, there are currently no high affinity selective antagonists for the prostacyclin receptor. This finding suggests that the prostacyclin receptor may possess a unique ligand-binding pocket.Receptor activation is contingent upon ligand binding interactions, which initiate a conformational change in protein structure that is subsequently transmitted to the G-protein. Determining the exact nature and location of receptor-ligand binding interactions at the molecular level is essential for understanding the functions of prostanoid receptor physiology. Moreover, such insights would lend to the development of novel and highly specific modes of treatment for prostanoid-related disorders. Based upon the position of the chromophore (covalently bound 11-cis-retinal) within the binding pocket of rhodopsin along with the location of other ligands within similar rhodopsin-type GPCRs (2Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), the putative binding pocket for GPCRs with small nonpeptide ligands is believed to be located predominantly within the hydrophobic core of the transmembrane domain in close proximity to the extracellular boundary of the receptor. However, the crucial anchoring points that comprise the fundamental structure of the binding pocket, securing important receptor-ligand associations between prostacyclin and its receptor, have yet to be determined.As is the case with all prostanoids, prostacyclin (PGI2) is a derivative of the C20 unsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) (Fig. 1). The general structure of prostanoid molecules consists of a centralized cyclopentane ring (thromboxane has an oxane ring) flanked by two hydrocarbon chains, the α- and ω-chains, whose configuration and functional groups determine further classification (Fig. 1). In particular, the prostacyclin molecule contains an additional oxolane (cyclic ether) ring fused to the cyclopentane ring as well as two hydroxyl groups located at C11 and C15. A characteristic terminal carboxylate group is present at the C1 position as well as carbon-carbon double bonds linking C5 to C6 and C13 to C14. Similar molecular features can be seen in synthetic prostacyclin analogues such as iloprost, a stable high affinity agonist that substitutes a secondary cyclopentane ring in place of the PGI2 oxolane ring, carries an additional C16-methyl group and a ω-chain triple bond (Fig. 1). Side chains of certain amino acids have been shown in receptors to interact directly with substituents of ligands, conferring binding affinity (3Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23189-23195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) through major forces such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic interactions. Thus, structural similarities and differences between both prostanoid receptors and prostanoid ligands play an important role in determining sites of interaction between receptor and ligand. For example, conserved serine residues found in TMV of the adrenergic receptors have been shown to interact with the conserved hydroxyl groups extending from the catechol ring of the biogenic amines (4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Recent studies have begun to identify generalized regions within the prostacyclin receptor and other prostanoid receptors that appear crucial for ligand-binding specificity and affinity. Studies using chimeric combinations of mouse prostaglandin D and prostaglandin I receptors have shown that protein segments within transmembrane domains VI and VII (TMVI and TMVII) are involved in distinct binding interactions with prostacyclin side chains, whereas TMI along with a portion of the first extracellular loop confers broader binding functions, incorporating recognition and interaction with the cyclopentane ring (5Kobayashi T. Kiriyama M. Hirata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15154-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi T. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24294-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally, glycosylation at Asn-7 and Asn-78 (7Zhang Z. Austin S.C. Smyth E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 480-487PubMed Google Scholar) and proline residues within the transmembrane domains (8Stitham J. Martin K.A. Hwa J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have also been shown to be essential for proper binding and activation. Although neither of the two recently identified naturally occurring polymorphisms (i.e. V25M and R212H) have revealed inherent effects on binding, R212H in the third intracellular loop has been shown to exclusively effect activation and exhibits defective binding only under acidic conditions (9Stitham J. Stojanovic A. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15439-15444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Using site-directed mutagenesis, prostanoid ligand and receptor comparisons, and a three-dimensional computer-generated homology model of the hIP receptor derived from the recently published crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (10Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar), four crucial points of interaction between prostacyclin and the upper perimeter of the transmembrane domain of the hIP were identified. These crucial points include Arg-279 (TMVII), Phe-278 (TMVII), Tyr-75 (TMII), and Phe-95 (TMIII), which interact with the C1-COOH, oxalane ring and α-tail, C11-OH, and ω-tail of prostacyclin, respectively. This agonist-binding pocket is quite distinct from that of the biogenic amine receptors and rhodopsin.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe prostacyclin receptor serves important roles in vascular smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation, and inflammation (13Armstrong R.A.

More recently, it has also been suggested that prostacyclin may also be useful as a therapeutic agent in treating lung (21Keith R.L. Miller Y.E. Hoshikawa Y. Moore M.D. Gesell T.L. Gao B. Malkinson A.M. Golpon H.A. Nemenoff R.A. Geraci M.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 734-740PubMed Google Scholar) and colon cancers (22Schneider M.R. Schirner M. Lichtner R.B. Graf H. Breast Cancer Res.

Our current knowledge of the hIP receptor is very limited with only a handful of studies addressing the structure-function characteristics of this important receptor. Currently, there are no commercially available high affinity antagonists and only a few stable high affinity agonists. An understanding of the particular residues that constitute the ligand-binding pocket would be useful in determining any unusual features this receptor may contain and assist in the development of more functionally specific hIP ligands, particularly selective antagonists.11 of 29 Candidate Residues When Mutated to Alanine Had a Significant Decrease in Binding Affinity for IloprostCandidate residues were first individually mutated to alanine (alanine scanning) to determine those that had an affect on binding affinity (TableI). These amino acids were selected based upon their potential to interact with prostacyclin side chains. To avoid preconceived bias with regard to the binding pocket position within the seven-transmembrane domains, all prospective binding pocket residues such as charged, polar, and large side-chain amino acids (e.g. phenylalanines and tyrosines) in the upper half of the TM domain were mutated. The wild-type prostacyclin receptor expressed well (1.8 pmol/mg membrane protein) with a binding affinity (K i) for iloprost of 7.9 ± 1.7 nm(n = 9) (Table I). The competition binding best fitted to a one-site competition binding curve. In the absence of a high affinity antagonist, the labeled agonist iloprost was used for competition binding. Further studies were performed on the wild-type receptor in the presence of Gpp(NH)p, a non-hydrolyzable form of GTP, to effectively uncouple G-protein from the receptor. The presence of 100 μm Gpp(NH)p had no significant effect on binding affinity for wild-type protein (7.9 ± 0.1 nm(n = 3)), establishing that this affinity was not the result of G-protein coupling. Of the 29 residues mutated, 11 had a significant effect on binding (Table I) (Fig. 2, squares). These were located in TMII (D60A, S68A, and Y75A), TMIII (F95A and F97A), TMIV (F150A), TMV (S185A and Y188A), and TMVII (D274A, F278A, and R279A). In the absence of a high affinity antagonist for ligand binding, only those mutant receptors with significant differences of 0.5–1.7 log in binding affinity (S68A, F95A, F97A, S185A, and F278A) compared with wild-type receptor were able to yield a competition binding curve (Fig. 3). For those remaining mutants with extremely low binding affinity (>500 nm) (D60A, Y75A, F150A, Y188A, D274A, and R279A), little iloprost binding was observed despite adequate amounts of protein being present. Both Western analysis (Fig. 4) and saturation binding (Table I) showed detectable yet significantly reduced amounts of protein expression for these severely affected mutant receptors. Moreover, Western analysis also revealed the complex-glycosylated states (multiple bands) that are typically observed with these receptors (8Stitham J. Martin K.A. Hwa J. Mol.

Highly conserved ligand substituents on prostaglandins are likely to interact with conserved amino acids on the prostaglandin receptor. This principle has been used and confirmed in the investigation of many GPCRs including the adrenergic receptors (4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and rhodopsin (24Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9746-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Independently, the computer-generated homology model of the hIP transmembrane domain (minus ligand) was evaluated and visualized using the Swiss PDB Viewer program. Initial superimposition of the model with the crystal structure of rhodopsin yielded significant structural similarity. To further determine the validity of our hIP model, a Ramachandran plot analysis was employed. Of the 182 amino acids formulating the transmembrane helices, 180 (99%) were within the allowable region for a right-handed α-helix, whereas 171 (94%) were within the preferred region. This corresponded well with the expected seven-transmembrane α-helical secondary structure of the hIP receptor. It was also determined (via Swiss PDB Viewer) that none of the residues was involved in any intramolecular or intermolecular clashes with the protein backbone or other side-chain constituents, nor were there any signs of global inconsistencies. By inserting prostacyclin into the model of the hIP, identification of distinct receptor-ligand interactions was possible. The major determinant for the final receptor-bound position of prostacyclin was based upon the experimentally observed requirement for the C1-carboxylate to interact with Arg-279.Arg-279 (TMVII) Forms Ionic Interaction with the C1-Carboxylate GroupThe most significant binding pocket amino acid is the highly conserved (100%) Arg-279 found within the seventh transmembrane domain (TMVII) of the hIP receptor. Upon mutation to alanine (R279A), a significant decrease in agonist binding affinity was observed (K i > 500 nm iloprost,p < 0.001) (Table I) as compared with the hIP1D4 wild-type receptor (K i = 7.9 ± 1.7 nm iloprost). In addition, R279A protein expression was decreased greater than 3-fold in comparison with the wild-type construct (R279A B max = 0.5 pmol/mg membrane protein versus hIP1D4 B max = 1.8 pmol/mg membrane protein). Previous mutagenesis studies performed on the EP3 (25Chang C. Negishi M. Nishigaki N. Ichikawa A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Boie Y. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18910-18916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and EP2 (27Kedzie K.M. Donello J.E. Krauss H.A. Regan J.W. Gil D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) receptors have highlighted the impact of this residue in both ligand binding as well as receptor activation. Moreover, it has been shown that this residue has the capacity to not only form an ionic bond with the C1-carboxylate group of various ligands but serves as a hydrogen donor for carbonyl groups as well. EP1 receptor studies have confirmed that the primary interaction between this residue and ligand constituents is ionic (electrostatic) rather than hydrogen bonding since modification to various esters resulted in a greatly reduced affinity and potency (28Ungrin M.D. Carriere M.C. Denis D. Lamontagne S. Sawyer N. Stocco R. Tremblay N. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the complete level of conservation of Arg-279 across all of the prostanoid receptors, marked effect on ligand binding (when mutated to alanine), and complete conservation of the C1-carboxylate among all of the native prostanoid agonists strongly supports a direct ionic interaction between Arg-279 and the C1-carboxylate of prostacyclin (Fig. 5).Figure 5Molecular model of receptor-bound prostacyclin and important binding pocket residues. Homology-based model of hIP receptor transmembrane domains with bound prostacyclin ligand is shown. An extracellular view of the critical contacts made between receptor residues within transmembrane domains II, III, and VII, and prostacyclin is shown. Green-dashed lines represent interactions, either hydrogen bonding or electrostatic attractions. The major sites of interactions are electrostatic interaction (green-dashed lines) between Arg-279 and the negatively charged C1-carboxylate group of prostacyclin; hydrophobic ring-ring interaction between Phe-278 and the oxolane ring of prostacyclin; and hydrogen bond (green-dashed line) and hydrophobic interactions between Tyr-75 and the C11-hydroxyl group of prostacyclin and hydrophobic stabilizations among Phe-95, Leu-67, and the ω-chain of prostacyclin. Phe-97, although not directly interacting with the ligand, forms an important interhelical interaction with TMIV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phe-278 (TMVII) Provides Supplemental Hydrophobic Interaction with Oxolane Ring and α-ChainDirectly adjacent to the crucial Arg-279 residue is Phe-278, an exclusive residue found only in the IP receptor at this position. The distinctiveness of this residue seems to directly correlate with unique structural features found on IP receptor ligands, in particular the additional oxolane (cyclic ether) ring found on the native prostacyclin ligand. Some synthetic IP ligands such as iloprost and carbacyclin contain secondary cyclopentane rings at this position, whereas other naturally occurring prostaglandins (e.g. PGE1) do not (Fig. 1). A drastic reduction in binding affinity was observed in the F278A mutation withK i = 351.3 ± 88.9 nm(n = 5) iloprost (p < 0.001) (TableI). Expression was also diminished as indicated by the loweredB max value of 0.8 pmol/mg membrane protein. Unlike the positively charged Arg-279, the Phe-278 residue contains a completely non-polar side chain. Thus, the most likely association between this residue and prostacyclin involves a hydrophobic ring-ring interaction between the oxolane ring of prostacyclin (cyclopentane ring of iloprost) and the Phe-278 phenyl constituent. As observed with our model (Fig. 5), there may be an additional interaction with the α-chain. It is our belief that both of these ring structures serve as unique yet corresponding elements that are crucial for proper ligand binding and help to supplement the main electrostatic bond at Arg-279. The combination of Phe-278 and Arg-279 facilitate key anchoring points at the C1-carboxylate chain and secondary oxolane ring of prostacyclin, accommodating the α-chain such that it remains in a “bent” state (Fig. 5) as observed with the energy-minimized configurations of prostacyclin.Tyr-75 (TMII) Exhibits Functional Duality with C11-Hydroxyl and Cyclopentane RingThe Tyr-75 residue on TMII is conserved throughout the majority of the prostanoid receptors with the exception of the thromboxane receptors, which contain a histidine residue. Interestingly, a C11-hydroxyl group is present on all native prostanoids with the exception of thromboxane. In the prostaglandins, this hydroxyl is attached to C11, a member of a cyclopentane ring; however, in thromboxane, the equivalent oxygen is incorporated as part of a six-membered oxane ring (Fig. 1). Furthermore, from energy minimization, the C11-hydroxyl group on prostacyclin is in close proximity with the C1-carboxylate moiety. This is closely paralleled by the close proximity between Arg-279 and Tyr-75, adding further support for our model. Thus, our mutagenesis and modeling results predict a direct interaction between Tyr-75 and the C11-hydroxyl group as binding of agonist with the Y75A mutant revealed a greater than 50-fold decrease in affinity (p < 0.001) with little specific binding (K i > 500 nm iloprost) (TableI) as compared with the hIP1D4 wild-type receptor (K i = 7.9 ± 1.7 nm iloprost). To determine the precise structural features involved in this residue-ligand interaction (i.e. the presence of a phenyl ring, a hydroxyl group, or both), further mutagenesis (Y75F and Y75S) was performed. Unexpectedly, no significant defects in binding were observed with either of the additional mutations withK i values comparable with wild type (Y75FK i = 10.5 ± 4.1 nm iloprost (n = 5) and Y75S K i = 13.3 ± 2.8 nm iloprost (n = 4)). Expression was decreased to roughly 30% for all three mutations withB max values of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.5 pmol/mg membrane protein for Y75A, Y75F, and Y75S, respectively. From our modeling, hydrogen bonding appears to be the major means for interaction (Fig. 5); however spatial flexibility (by angstroms) in either the ligand or the receptor may allow for the formation of hydrophobic ring-ring interactions between the centralized (non-oxolane) cyclopentane ring of prostacyclin and the Tyr-75-phenyl ring. Thus, either interaction alone (i.e. Y75F hydrophobic ring-ring association or Y75S hydrogen bond) is sufficient in maintaining efficient receptor-ligand affinity. Possessing a high level of conservation across all prostanoid receptors (apart from the thromboxane receptor), shared common structural C11-hydroxyl groups with ligands (apart from thromboxane), close proximity to the critical Arg-279 residue, and reduced affinity upon mutagenesis to alanine supports Tyr-75 as an anchoring point to the C11-hydroxyl of prostacyclin.Phe-95 (TMIII) Is a Key Element in Accommodating the ω-ChainThe Phe-95 residue is part of a phenylalanine-rich area within TM domain III. According to our model and binding analyses, Phe-95 plays a crucial role in accommodating the mainly hydrophobic ω-chain of prostacyclin. A cluster of hydrophobic residues is present in TMIII on all prostanoid receptors in the region of the putative binding pocket. The binding affinity for the F95A mutation differed significantly from the wild-type hIP1D4, revealing a considerable binding deficit (F95A K i = 143.6 ± 98 nm iloprost (n = 6); p < 0.05) (Table I). The B max value for F95A was 0.8 pmol/mg membrane protein. The Phe-95 side chain provides a planar hydrophobic “sidewall” that helps to secure the freely rotating ω-chain constituent (Fig. 5).

In this study we show that Tyr-341 participates in the recruitment of Raf-1 to specialized membrane domains called “rafts,” which are required for Raf-1 to be phosphorylated on Ser-338. Raf-1 is also thought to be recruited to the small G protein Rap1 upon GTP loading of Rap1. However, this does not result in Raf-1 activation. We propose that this is because Raf-1 is not phosphorylated on Tyr-341 upon recruitment to Rap1. Redirecting Rap1 to Ras-containing membranes or mimicking Tyr-341 phosphorylation of Raf-1 by mutation converts Rap1 into an activator of Raf-1. In contrast to Raf-1, B-Raf is activated by Rap1. We suggest that this is because B-Raf activation is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, mutants that render B-Raf dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation are no longer activated by Rap1.

Activation of one of these MAP kinases (the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or ERK) is initiated by the recruitment of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf-1 to the small G protein Ras, a resident plasma membrane protein. The Ras family consists of three members (Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, and N-Ras) (1Ehrhardt A. Ehrhardt G. Guo X. Schrader J. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 1089Google Scholar) that display overlapping but distinct patterns of expression and function (2Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Google Scholar). Ras is tethered to the membrane via a carboxyl CAAX motif containing a cysteine followed by two aliphatic amino acids (A) and a carboxyl-terminal amino acid (X) that directs the attachment of a farnesyl moiety (3Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Google Scholar, 4Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Google Scholar). In addition to farnesylation, a second signal assists in correct membrane targeting. For Ha-Ras and N-Ras, this second signal is a palmitoyl moiety that is introduced on a neighboring cysteine. In Ki-Ras, this second site is a polybasic domain. The requirement of Ras membrane localization for Raf-1 activation has been confirmed by mutating the terminal cysteine in a constitutively active Ras mutant, RasV12, resulting in a mutant that cannot activate Raf-1 (5Kato K.

A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Google Scholar).Membrane regions rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, termed “rafts” or detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes have been proposed to participate in signaling events by organizing additional molecules, such as c-Src, G protein subunits, and phospholipases, into discrete membrane domains (6Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Google Scholar). Recent attention has focused on the role of these specialized microdomains in Ras signaling (7Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Google Scholar). Others have suggested that Ha-Ras, but not Ki-Ras, can be targeted to raft microdomains (10Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar, 15Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar). Targeting of Ras isoforms to specific membrane domains may be determined by the characteristics of the lipid modifications on Ras, as well as other sequences found within the hypervariable region (hvr) (10Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar). Localization of Ras isoforms to distinct membrane microdomains may influence selectivity of signaling among the Ras isoforms (2Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Google Scholar). For example, Ki-Ras is thought to couple well to Raf-1 but unlike Ha-Ras, couples poorly to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (16Jaumot M. Yan J. Clyde-Smith J. Sluimer J. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 272-278Google Scholar, 17Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Google Scholar). Differences between Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras in their promotion of cell survival have also been noted (18Walsh A.B. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15609-15615Google Scholar), suggesting that distinct localization of Ras isoforms dictate signaling pathways, as recently proposed (19Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Google Scholar). Ras isoforms have been reported to display distinct dependences on caveolin in their coupling to Raf-1 (9Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Google Scholar,15Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar).Raf-1 recruitment to the membrane can be achieved independently of Ras by the addition of Ras carboxyl-terminal sequences to the carboxyl terminus of Raf-1. The addition of twenty amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Ki-Ras onto Raf-1 (Raf-KiCAAX) is sufficient to redirect Raf-1 to the membrane where it is constitutively active (20Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Google Scholar,21Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallaser K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Google Scholar). Maximal activity of this chimera, however, requires additional phosphorylation events (22Mineo C. Anderson R.G. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Google Scholar, 23Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Google Scholar), consistent with the requirement of specific kinases for full activation for wild type Raf-1 (24Li W. Chong H. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34728-34737Google Scholar, 25Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Google Scholar, 26Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Google Scholar). In particular, two phosphorylations on Ser-338 and Tyr-341 have been shown to be required for full activity (27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar). Recently, two additional sites within the kinase activation loop have also been shown to be required (28Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 338 may be mediated by the serine/threonine kinase PAK (p21-associated protein) (29Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. Macdonal S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of tyrosine 341 can be carried out by Src family tyrosine kinases (23Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Google Scholar, 27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar, 30Fabian J.R. Darr I.O. Morrision D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Google Scholar). The participation of specific membrane microdomains in these modifications is not known.In this study, we examined the membrane requirements for the post-translational modification of Raf-1. In addition, we took advantage of chimeric Raf-1 molecules that are targeted to specific membrane domains to determine the specificity of these domains for raft localization, phosphorylation, and constitutive activation of Raf-1. Understanding the molecular basis for Raf-1 activation by Ras may also help explain the actions of the related small G protein Rap1, which recruits Raf-1, but unlike Ras, cannot activate it. In the present study we address whether membrane localization also plays a role in Rap1-mediated inhibition of Raf-1 activation by Ras. We found that Raf-1 phosphorylation was intimately linked to proper membrane targeting and that the ability of Ras and Rap1 to support Raf-1 phosphorylation dictated the biochemical actions of both Ras and Rap1 on Raf-1. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase family regulates diverse physiological processes including cell growth, differentiation, and death. Activation of one of these MAP kinases (the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or ERK) is initiated by the recruitment of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf-1 to the small G protein Ras, a resident plasma membrane protein.

Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar, 15Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar). Targeting of Ras isoforms to specific membrane domains may be determined by the characteristics of the lipid modifications on Ras, as well as other sequences found within the hypervariable region (hvr) (10Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar). Localization of Ras isoforms to distinct membrane microdomains may influence selectivity of signaling among the Ras isoforms (2Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Google Scholar). For example, Ki-Ras is thought to couple well to Raf-1 but unlike Ha-Ras, couples poorly to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (16Jaumot M. Yan J. Clyde-Smith J. Sluimer J. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 272-278Google Scholar, 17Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Google Scholar). Differences between Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras in their promotion of cell survival have also been noted (18Walsh A.B. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15609-15615Google Scholar), suggesting that distinct localization of Ras isoforms dictate signaling pathways, as recently proposed (19Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Google Scholar). Ras isoforms have been reported to display distinct dependences on caveolin in their coupling to Raf-1 (9Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Google Scholar,15Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar). Raf-1 recruitment to the membrane can be achieved independently of Ras by the addition of Ras carboxyl-terminal sequences to the carboxyl terminus of Raf-1. The addition of twenty amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Ki-Ras onto Raf-1 (Raf-KiCAAX) is sufficient to redirect Raf-1 to the membrane where it is constitutively active (20Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Google Scholar,21Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallaser K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Google Scholar). Maximal activity of this chimera, however, requires additional phosphorylation events (22Mineo C. Anderson R.G. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Google Scholar, 23Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Google Scholar), consistent with the requirement of specific kinases for full activation for wild type Raf-1 (24Li W. Chong H. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34728-34737Google Scholar, 25Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Google Scholar, 26Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Google Scholar). In particular, two phosphorylations on Ser-338 and Tyr-341 have been shown to be required for full activity (27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar). Recently, two additional sites within the kinase activation loop have also been shown to be required (28Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 338 may be mediated by the serine/threonine kinase PAK (p21-associated protein) (29Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. Macdonal S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of tyrosine 341 can be carried out by Src family tyrosine kinases (23Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Google Scholar, 27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar, 30Fabian J.R. Darr I.O. Morrision D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Google Scholar). The participation of specific membrane microdomains in these modifications is not known. In this study, we examined the membrane requirements for the post-translational modification of Raf-1. In addition, we took advantage of chimeric Raf-1 molecules that are targeted to specific membrane domains to determine the specificity of these domains for raft localization, phosphorylation, and constitutive activation of Raf-1. Understanding the molecular basis for Raf-1 activation by Ras may also help explain the actions of the related small G protein Rap1, which recruits Raf-1, but unlike Ras, cannot activate it. In the present study we address whether membrane localization also plays a role in Rap1-mediated inhibition of Raf-1 activation by Ras. We found that Raf-1 phosphorylation was intimately linked to proper membrane targeting and that the ability of Ras and Rap1 to support Raf-1 phosphorylation dictated the biochemical actions of both Ras and Rap1 on Raf-1.

https://openalex.org/W2085314336,"The Disabled-1 (Dab1) gene encodes a key regulator of Reelin signaling. Reelin is a large glycoprotein secreted by neurons of the developing brain, particularly Cajal-Retzius cells. The DAB1 protein docks to the intracellular part of the Reelin very low density lipoprotein receptor and apoE receptor type 2 and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following binding of Reelin to cortical neurons. In mice, mutations of Dab1 andReelin generate identical phenotypes. In humans,Reelin mutations are associated with brain malformations and mental retardation; mutations in DAB1 have not been identified. Here, we define the organization of Dab1, which is similar in human and mouse. The Dab1 gene spreads over 1100 kb of genomic DNA and is composed of 14 exons encoding the major protein form, some alternative internal exons, and multiple 5′-exons. Alternative polyadenylation and splicing events generate DAB1 isoforms. Several 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) correspond to different promoters. Two 5′-UTRs (1A and 1B) are predominantly used in the developing brain. 5′-UTR 1B is composed of 10 small exons spread over 800 kb. With a genomic length of 1.1 Mbp for a coding region of 5.5 kb, Dab1 provides a rare example of genomic complexity, which will impede the identification of human mutations.

Neuronal migration is a complex process that is affected in a variety of human disorders such as periventricular heterotopias and different types of lissencephalies (1Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Google Scholar, 2Monuki E.S. Walsh C.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4 (suppl.): 1199-1206Google Scholar, 3Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Mech.

Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Google Scholar, 5Rice D.S. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1005-1039Google Scholar, 6Feng Y. Walsh C.A. Nat. Rev.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 239-249Google Scholar), generates a phenotype similar to that of Reelin-deficient mice. This phenotype is characterized by a poor organization of architectonic patterns at the end of radial neuronal migration (reviewed in Ref. 10Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1998; 150: 1-106Google Scholar). The neurons that are the most affected include those of the cortical plate in the cortex and hippocampus, Purkinje cells, and inferior olivary neurons. In human, mutations in Reelin result in a specific lissencephaly with mental retardation and severe abnormalities of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and brain stem (Norman-Roberts type, OMIM257320) (11Hong S.E. Shugart Y.Y. Huang D.T. Shahwan S.A. Grant P.E. Hourihane J.O. Martin N.D. Walsh C.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 93-96Google Scholar), a phenotype that shows similarity to its mouse counterpart. Cognitive development is delayed, with little or no language acquisition and no ability to sit or stand unsupported. Thus far, no human disease associated with mutations in DAB1 or other genes in the Reelin pathway has been identified. Reelin is an extracellular protein secreted by some neurons such as Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the embryonic cerebral cortex and hippocampus, external granule cells in the cerebellum, olfactory mitral cells, and ganglion and amacrine cells in the mouse retina (10Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1998; 150: 1-106Google Scholar, 12Rice D.S. Curran T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 424: 327-338Google Scholar) and in the spinal cord (13Carroll P. Gayet O.

The response of target neurons to Reelin requires the expression of at least one of two surface receptors that belong to the lipoprotein receptor family,viz. the very low density lipoprotein receptor and apoE receptor type 2, as well as the presence of the intracellular adaptor DAB1. The DAB1 protein contains a 180-amino acid N-terminal protein interaction/phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) 1The abbreviations used are: PTB, phosphotyrosine-binding; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; P, postnatal day; E, embryonic day; PAC, P1 artificial chromosome; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; contig, group of overlapping clones; UTR, untranslated region; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; RT, reverse transcription; IAP, intracisternal A particle; ORF, open reading frame; uORF, upstream open reading frame; EST, expressed sequence tag domain that docks to the short cytoplasmic tail of the very low density lipoprotein receptor or apoE receptor type 2 at the level of NPXY motifs, with a preference for unphosphorylated motifs (15D'Arcangelo G.

Potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a 310-amino acid C-terminal region of unknown function follow the PTB domain. The binding of Reelin to the extracellular part of both receptors induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of DAB1, particularly Tyr198 and Tyr220 (20Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Google Scholar, 21Keshvara L. Benhayon D. Magdaleno S. Curran T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16008-16014Google Scholar). Mice expressing a mutant form of DAB1 in which all the potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites are mutated have a phenotype similar to reeler mice (4Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Google Scholar), and mice expressing a truncated DAB1 protein missing the C-terminal part have an almost normal phenotype (22Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Development. 2002; 129: 787-796Google Scholar). This shows that the PTB domain and tyrosine phosphorylation are both necessary and sufficient to fulfill most of the DAB1 functions. Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Src family are able to phosphorylate DAB1 in vitro, but the kinase(s) involved in DAB1 phosphorylation in vivo remain to be identified (23Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Google Scholar). Similarly, the other downstream effectors of the Reelin signal are not known. Various isoforms of the mouse DAB1 protein have been described. The main form contains an open reading frame of 555 amino acids encoding a 80-kDa protein, the predominant form expressed in the brain. Another form, 555*, contains an additional exon inserted in-frame between codons 241 and 242. Form 217 results from alternative polyadenylation, whereas isoform 271 is similar to form 555, except that an additional exon of 270 bp containing a stop codon is inserted between codons 241 and 242. Upon Northern blotting, three transcripts of 5.5, 4.0, and 1.8 kb have been detected with a probe covering the PTB domain, and protein isoforms of 36, 45, 60, 80, and 120 kDa have been observed on Western blots (23Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Google Scholar). In this work, we defined the genomic organization of the human and mouse Dab1 genes. The structure is highly complex and similar in both species. The gene extends over >1 Mbp of genomic DNA due to the presence of large introns and the wide dispersion of several alternative transcription initiation sites. The presence of several alternative promoters and alternatively spliced forms points to a fine regulation of Dab1 expression and further emphasizes the key position of this gene as a switch in the Reelin signaling pathway. The complexity of the gene may explain why no human disease associated withDAB1 mutations could be identified thus far. Information on the primers used is provided in Table I. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed at 60 °C on 1 μg of DNase I-treated RNA (embryonic human brain and P0 mouse brain) usingDab1-specific primer in exon 2 (TableI) and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After RNase H digestion, the cDNA was purified with a GlassMAX spin cartridge (Invitrogen) and modified by adding a polydeoxycytidine sequence to the 5′-end using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Invitrogen). cDNAs were amplified by PCR with an abridged anchor primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′), which hybridized to the poly(dC) sequence, and antisense Dab1-specific primer 2 using Taq DNA polymerase (Biotools). Nested PCRs were performed with the abridged universal amplification primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) and antisenseDab1-specific primer 3. The PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 377 sequencer.Table IPrimers used in this study5′–3′ sequenceOrientationExonPosition on mouse contig NW_000211.1Position on Y083791GATCCTGACCTTTCTTCCTGGAGAntisense2 and 34683618–4683610 and 4557515–4557502339–3172TTCTGTCTCAGTTGACATCCTACTAntisense24557466–4557443281–2583TCTCCAAGAGAAAGGCTCCTAntisense24557385–4557366200–1814AATCAACAGACCTAAGAAATAGCSense154820540–48205621971–19925GGCAGATACCTATGGCAGCACASense154820721–48207432151–21726CGGACACTTCATCAATCCCAATCAGAntisense34683702–4683678423–3997CCCATCAGCATTTCGCCACCTAACAntisense1B13690493–3690470Not present8CAGAAAGGACACCCAACACCGTGCAntisense24557360–4557337175–1529ACTCCCTCCTAAATCACCACAGCATCAntisense1B13690379–3690354Not present10GAGCATCCTCCTTGGCTGCCGCAAntisense1A4445613–4445591115–9311AGACCGATCGGAGCGAAGAGCTTGAntisense1D4445169–4445146Not present12ACTTCAACAAAGTCGGGGTTGSense124806938–48069561600–161813TGAAGTCAGATGTGTGAGAGGAntisenseNot presentNot present14TCGGGGAGACAAGTTATGTCSense34683707–4683726428–44715GATTCCTCCAAAGGAGATGGAntisense44691555–4691536545–52616AGGGAGGAGCCTTTCTCTTGSense24557362–4557381177–19617TTTGGCACTGGGAGGCATTGTAntisense1C4447139–4447139Not present18GAAGGGAGGGAGGAGAGAAASense1C4446989–4447008Not present19TAGCCCATTGACTCTAGAGGTSense4444294–4444314Not present20GGTTCTAATTTACAGGAGGGTCSense4444731–4444752Not present21CACTCAAACGCGCTCTCCAGAntisense1A4445550–444553152–3322CGGCGCTCACCCGGGCTTSense1A4445506–44455238–2523TCTACTTACTGACCTCTGTGGSense3689101–3689121Not present24GTGTGGGCTCTGCTCAGGAAAntisense1B13690422–3690403Not present25GGGGAGGATGGACCCAGCTCSense1A4445487–4445506Not present26GGAGCATCCTCCTTGGCTGCAntisense1A4445614–4445595116–9727TTCCTGAGCAGAGCCCACACSense1B13690403–3690422Not present28CTCCACCATCACGAGTGACATAntisense1B84357551–4357531Not present29CACTGAGCGTCCCAAGCCCTTAntisense1D4445374–4445355Not present30AATTAGCAGAGTCCTAGAGGGSense1D4445039–4445059Not present31AGAAGGAAGGTGTTTATGATGSense94767121–4767141943–96332CAGGAGGGGTGGACATGTCTAntisense104797192–47971731032–101333TGGCCACAAATCTGTGATTCCAntisense54757538–4757518684–66434AGGAACCGAACCCACGGAGTAAntisense154823607–4823587Not present35CTGGTACAATTCTGGTAATGTGSense154821574–4821595Not present36TGGAGAAGGCCTCTGAGGTAAntisense124806934–48069151596–157737ACTAGAGCTGCCGGGAGTGASense1B13690622–3690641Not present38ACTCCGCTGAGCTGTCGCTSense1D4445279–4445297Not present39TGGCCCTGGCAATCTCAGAASense1B24026628–4026647Not present Open table in a new tab 3′-RACE was carried out on 2 μg of total RNA from E15 mouse brain. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an adaptor oligo(dT) primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified using Dab1-specific primer 4 in exon 15 and the abridged universal amplification primer. An aliquot of the reaction was subjected to nested PCR using downstream Dab1-specific primer 5 and the adaptor primer. The 3′-RACE products were subcloned into the pCRII vector for sequencing. 5′-RNA ligase-mediated RACE was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). 250 ng of mRNA from E17 mouse brain was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase and decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to target full-length mRNAs. An RNA oligonucleotide was ligated to the decapped mRNA, and reverse transcription was performed at 60 °C using random primers and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase. PCR was done to amplify the resultant cDNAs using the GeneRacer 5′-primer andDab1-specific primer 6 in exon 3 orDab1-specific primer 7 in exon 1B1. Nested PCR was done using the GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and Dab-specific primer 8 in exon 2, primer 9 in exon 1B1, primer 10 in exon 1A, and primer 11 in exon 1D. Products were cloned into pCRII and sequenced. PACs containing parts of the human and mouseDab1 genes were obtained by PCR screening of the RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung libraries 711 (RPCI21; constructed by Dr. Pieter de Jong, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) and 709 (RPCI6). Human PACs were isolated as follows: PACs RPCI6-239D12 and RPCI6-225E22 with primers 12 and 13; PAC RPCI6-65F20 with primers 14 and 15; and PAC RPCI6-102O10 with primers 16 and 1. Mouse PACs RPCI21-97L11 and RPCI21-31E11 were isolated with primers 17 and 18. Intron sizes were determined by PCR on genomic or PAC DNA. Amplification of large fragments was carried out with the Elongase amplification system (Invitrogen). The sequences of the exon-intron junctions and of upstream genomic regions were determined by direct sequencing of PAC DNA or of PCR products. Exon-intron boundaries were determined by aligning cDNA and genomic sequences. Results were confirmed by comparison with the human and mouse genome sequences (human contig, NCBI accession number NT_029223.8 (build 30); and mouse contig, NCBI accession number NW_000211.1). Fragments were cloned into the pGL3-Basic promoterless vector (Promega). A 2.9-kb mouse fragment named ACD (containing exons 1A–1D) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers 19 and 17. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII and cloned in the forward and reverse orientations into the SacI site of pGL3-Basic. Fragment AD (821 bp) was amplified using primers 20 and 21, cloned into pCRII, and cloned (SpeI-XbaI) in the forward and reverse orientations into the NheI site of pGL3-Basic. Construct A (248 bp) was derived from construct AD byMluI digestion and ligation. To obtain construct D (574 bp), fragment AD in pCRII was digested with KpnI andMluI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGL3-Basic for the forward construct and digested with HindIII andMluI and cloned into the corresponding sites for the reverse construct. Fragment C (1641 bp) was amplified from genomic DNA using primers 22 and 17, cloned into pCRII, and cloned in the forward and reverse orientations into the SacI site of pGL3-Basic. Fragment B (1.3 kb) was amplified with primers 23 and 24, cloned into pCRII, and cloned into the KpnI-XhoI site of pGL3-Basic. A PmlI-EcoRV digestion/ligation of this construct was carried out to remove three ATG codons present in the 5′-UTR. Undifferentiated P19, HepG2, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Confluent cells (80–90%) were plated into 24-well tissue culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. Recombinant pGL3-Basic reporter constructs (950 ng/well) containing the firefly luciferase gene and a pRL-TK vector containing the Renilla luciferase reporter (50 ng/well; to normalize for transfection efficacy) were introduced into cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) at 1 μl/well according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent measurements. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic brain hemispheres of 15-day mouse fetuses of the BALB/c strain. The cortex was dissected on ice in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Tissue fragments (1 mm3) were added to 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% trypsin and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with occasional shaking. Trypsin digestion was terminated by three washes in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) and suspension in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) and 0.25 mg/ml DNase I. Cells were dissociated by gentle pipetting, filtered through Falcon cell strainer sieves (70 μm), and counted. Following a final centrifugation, cells were seeded in poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 8 × 105 cells/well in Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 500 μm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. P19 embryonic carcinoma cells were cultivated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10 ml of medium in non-adhesive 10-cm diameter dishes in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum and all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma R 2625) at a final concentration of 5 × 10−7m. After 2 days, the medium was replaced, and fresh RA was added. At day 4, aggregates were harvested, washed once in DMEM without serum, and suspended in 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and DNase I (50 μg/ml). Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 5 ml of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. They were triturated to yield a single cell suspension and counted. Dissociated cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells in 1 ml of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum in 12-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates. The day following plating, arabinosylcytosine (Sigma C 1768) was added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Both primary cortical neurons and P19 cells were transfected on day 4 after plating. 1 day prior to transfection, one-half of the medium was replaced. For transfection, 4 μg of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen)/well in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was mixed with 1 μg of DNA in 50 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to addition to cells in 400 μl of culture medium. Following 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was removed and replaced with 1 ml of medium. Assay for luciferase activity was done 24 h after transfection. The probe for exon 1A (130 bp) was amplified with primers 25 and 26. The probe for exon 1B was amplified by RT-PCR from E15 mouse brain using primers 27 and 28 and cloned into pBluescript. This 713-bp fragment contains four exons of 5′-UTR 1B (see Fig. 1): 1B1, 1B2, 1B4, and 1B8. The probe for exon 1D (343 bp) was amplified with primers 29 and 30. The probe for alternative exon 555* was a 189-bp fragment amplified with primers 31 and 32 and cloned into pCRII. It contains both exons 555* plus 27 bp of exon 9 and 47 bp of exon 10. A 480-bp probe covering most of the PTB region was amplified with primers 16 and 33 and cloned into pCRII. In situ hybridization was carried out as explained in the legend to Fig. 5. The probe for the mouse Dab13′-UTR was a 2-kb fragment amplified with primers 34 and 35.Figure 5Expression of Dab1isoforms: in situ hybridization. 33P-Labeled riboprobes were hybridized to cryostat sagittal sections of E14 (A, B, D,E, and G, and H) and P0 (C,F, and I) mouse brain, and the signal was revealed by dipping in LM1 emulsion (Amersham Biosciences) as described (40Bernier B. Bar I. Pieau C. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 463-479Google Scholar, 41Simmons D. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Google Scholar). The three following probes were used. The PTB probe (A–C) covers most of the Dab1 PTB coding region and is expected to reveal all Dab1 isoforms. Probe 1B (D–F) corresponds to exons 1B1, 1B2, 1B4, and 1B8 (see Fig. 1) and revealed expression of alternative 5′-exon 1B. Probe 555* (G–I) covers alternative exons 555* plus some flanking cDNA sequences. The PTB probe (A–C) confirmed very strong expression in the cortical plate at E14 and P0. At P0, the signal was stronger in the outer than in the inner tiers of the cortical plate (CP). There was also moderate expression in the ventricular zone (VZ), which was more evident at E14 than at P0. The probe covering exons 1B (D–F) revealed an expression similar to that obtained with the PTB probe, with maximal expression in the cortical plate and weak expression in the ventricular zone. Probe 555* (G–I) revealed a pattern different from that obtained with the PTB probe. The signal was the strongest in the ventricular zone, particularly at early stages (E14), and decreased at P0. This probe also revealed a signal in the cortical plate, but part of this signal may be related to the parts of the probe that correspond to Dab1 cDNA sequences adjacent to exons 555*.V, ventricle.

We therefore reconsidered the physical map and genomic organizations of the human and mouseDab1 genes as summarized in Fig.1 and TableII.Table IINucleotide sequences of exon-intron boundaries of the human and mouse Dab1 genesThe upper part concerns the 5′-UTRs for the mouse (Mm) and human (Hs) genes.

The lower part indicates the exon-intron organization of the conserved part, with human and mouse in the top and bottom lines, respectively. RLM, RNA ligase-mediated. The mouse Dab1 gene maps to chromosome 4 at 52.7 centimorgans, whereas human DAB1 maps to chromosome 1p32-p31 (24Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Genomics. 1998; 53: 246-247Google Scholar). In both species, the 5′-end is located on the centromeric side. The gene is flanked by the mouseAK008020 locus (identical to human XM_055482 or LOC115209) on the centromeric side and by the complement factor 8B (C8B) gene on the telomeric side. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Dab1is located between microsatellites D4Mit118 andD4Mit75, but is at least 3 Mbp away from markerD4Mit176, confirming the data published by Ware et al. (9Ware M.L. Fox J.W. Gonzalez J.L. Davis N.M. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Russo C.J. Chua Jr., S.C. Goffinet A.M. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 239-249Google Scholar). D4Mit331 is located between Dab1exons 1B1 and 1B2 (described below), 565 kb upstream of theDab1 ATG codon and 700 kb centromeric to D4Mit29, in agreement with the reported genetic distance of 0.6 centimorgans between D4Mit29 and D4Mit331 (9Ware M.L. Fox J.W. Gonzalez J.L. Davis N.M. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Russo C.J. Chua Jr., S.C. Goffinet A.M. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 239-249Google Scholar).D4Mit29 is located in intron 4, 1.5 kb from exon 4 ofDab1 (Fig. 1 B). D4Mit75 maps 440 kb distal to the ATG codon and 300 kb telomeric to D4Mit29. In scrambler mutant mice, a portion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) sequence is inserted in the antisense orientation in theDab1 mRNA by aberrant splicing. The mutation results in production of an enlarged transcript of ∼7 kb, with the introduction of multiple stop codons. The defect results from the use of a cryptic splice acceptor site in intron 4 coupled with a cryptic donor site in the IAP element. In the scrambler mRNA, 28 bases unrelated to Dab1 or to the IAP are inserted betweenDab1 exon 4 and the IAP sequence. BLAST alignment against the mouse genome localized these 28 bases in intron 4, 11 kb distal to exon 4. No IAP sequence is present in this region in the C57BL/6 DNA. Although we cannot exclude that the IAP element was present in the DC/le strain in which the scrambler mutation arose, it appears more likely that an IAP insertion caused the mutation. Inyotari mutant mice, 357 nucleotides corresponding to exons 5–8 are missing from the Dab1 mRNA, and the open reading frame is maintained. At the genomic level, this deletion in the mRNA is due to the insertion of a 962-bp L1 element. This insertion starts at the junction of exon 5-intron 5 and ends in the middle of exon 8 (25Kojima T. Nakajima K. Mikoshiba K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 121-127Google Scholar). The mouse genomic organization was derived from direct sequencing on PACs and sequencing of PCR products derived from YACs and genomic DNA. Data from the NCBI mouse genome sequence (accession number NW_000211.1) confirmed the structure of the gene. The human genomic organization was defined by direct sequencing on PAC clones and confirmed by the NCBI human genome sequence (accession number NT_029223.8). As explained below, several alternative first exons named A–F were identified in both the mouse and human genes and are dispersed over large genomic regions. Genomic YAC clones covering the mouse Dab1 region were described previously (9Ware M.L. Fox J.W. Gonzalez J.L. Davis N.M. Lambert de Rouvroit C. Russo C.J. Chua Jr., S.C. Goffinet A.M. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 239-249Google Scholar) and are shown in Fig. 1 B. YAC 37G4 (500–800 kb) contains exons 2–15, and YAC 175A2 (1220–1500 kb) extends from the complex 5′-UTR 1B to exon 9. Mouse PACs RPCI21-97L11 and RPCI21-31E11 contain upstream exons 1A–1D and 1B8. The sequence-tagged site content of PACS and YACs was not analyzed in detail. However, the fact that the mouse and human genomic organization is similar suggests that the clones were not rearranged. The entire human DAB1 ORF (Fig. 1 B) is contained in four PAC clones covering ∼300 kb of genomic DNA. Clone RPCI6-102O10 (132 kb; accession number AL390243) contains 120 kb of intron 1, exon 2, and 15 kb of intron 2; clone RPCI6-65F20 (107 kb; accession number AL138779) contains exons 3–6; clone RPCI6-239D12 (175 kb; accession number AL161740) contains exons 10–15 and the C8B gene; and clone RPCI6-225E22 (not sequenced) contains exon 5 up to at least exon 15. The human PACs have been characterized by the Sanger Center using fluorescent in situhybridization and sequence determination and are not chimeric. The Dab1 coding regions (from exon 2 containing the ATG codon to exon 14 containing the stop codon) are spread over 254 kb of genomic DNA for the mouse gene and over 294 kb for the human gene. The size of the major DAB1 protein is 555 amino acids, which corresponds to a coding capacity of 0.2% compared with a mean genomic coding density of ∼10%. The organization of the mouse and human genes is conserved, and all exon-intron splice junctions conform to the GT/AG rule (Fig.1 C and Table II). With the exception of exons 12 and 15 (549 and >3300 bp, respectively), exons are relatively small, ranging in size from 39 to 140 bp. Introns in the ORF region range in size from 89 bp to 146 kb. The PTB domain is encoded in exons 3–6. Impo"

Both proteins are capped with a unique region at the amino terminus as well as a serine-rich linker domain and SH3 domains at the COOH terminus. Their significant size difference is attributed to the length of the central region wherein both proteins are primarily composed of ∼35 amino acid repeats termed nebulin-like repeats or motifs. These motifs are marked by a conserved SXXY sequence and high affinity binding to F-actin. To further characterize the effects that nebulin-like proteins may have on the striated muscle thin filament, we have cloned, expressed, and purified a five-motif chicken nebulette fragment and tested its interaction with the thin filament regulatory proteins. Both tropomyosin and troponin T individually bound the nebulette fragment, although the affinity of this interaction was significantly increased when tropomyosin-troponin T was tested as a binary complex. The addition of troponin I to the tropomyosin-troponin T complex decreased the binding to the nebulette fragment, indicating an involvement of the conserved T2 region of troponin T in this interaction. F-actin cosedimentation demonstrated that the nebulette fragment was able to significantly increase the affinity of the tropomyosin-troponin assembly for F-actin. The relationships provide a means for nebulin-like motifs to participate in the allosteric regulation of striated muscle contraction.

Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 205-225Google Scholar, 3Labeit S. Kolmerer B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 308-315Google Scholar). Both nebulin and nebulette are capped by a unique region at the amino terminus in addition to serine-rich linker and SH3 domains at the carboxyl terminus (2Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil.

Immunoelectron microscopy has demonstrated that a single nebulin molecule extends from the Z-line (COOH terminus of the protein) to the pointed ends of the thin filament at its NH2terminus (7Wang K. Wright J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2199-2212Google Scholar). Nebulette is similarly anchored to the Z-line through its COOH terminus, but because of its relatively smaller size, it does not extend as far as the pointed ends of the actin filament. Experiments using in vitro systems have formed a consensus that nebulin-like motifs from both nebulin and nebulette associate with F-actin (4Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.-Q. van Heerden A. Hsu L.C. Gutierrez G. Qian X.L. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4304-4314Google Scholar, 6Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 1-22Google Scholar, 8Jin J.-P. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21215-21223Google Scholar). Additional experiments have extended this observation to demonstrate that nebulin-like motifs may interact directly with tropomyosin (Tm)1 and troponin (Tn) (4Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.-Q. van Heerden A. Hsu L.C. Gutierrez G. Qian X.L. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4304-4314Google Scholar) along the striated muscle thin filament. At the Z-line, the nebulin/nebulette interactions are probably mediated by contributions from the linker domain as well as interactions of the SH3 domains with α-actinin (6Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 1-22Google Scholar, 9Nave R. Furst D.O. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 163-166Google Scholar). However, results from Ojima and coworkers (10Ojima K. Lin Z.X. Bang M.-L. Holtzer S. Matsuda R. Labeit S. Sweeney H.L. Holtzer H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 553-566Google Scholar) suggest that neither the serine-rich linker domain nor the SH3 domain are obligatory elements for the incorporation of nebulin and presumably nebulette into the Z-line of striated muscle sarcomeres. Although both proteins are anchored at the Z-line in vivo, the primary sequence regions responsible for this interaction remain unclear. Recent experiments have also shown an association between the NH2 terminus of nebulin and tropomodulin, a protein known to cap actin-Tm filaments (11McElhinny A.S. Kolmerer B. Fowler V.M. Labeit S. Gregorio C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 583-592Google Scholar). Therefore, emerging data demonstrate that the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of nebulin and nebulette form unique interactions at both the pointed end of the thin filament and the Z-line of sarcomeres, complementing the established actin binding properties of these proteins. Although the majority of experiments to date have focused on the binary interactions between nebulin/nebulette and other sarcomeric proteins, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that nebulin-like motifs may serve a role in the regulation of striated muscle contraction. These investigations have concentrated on the role that nebulin may play in regulating interactions within the framework of the isolated acto-S1 myosin system. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that nebulin fragments of varying lengths are able to inhibit the acto-S1 myosin ATPase, an inhibition that can be reversed by calmodulin (12Root D.D. Wang K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12581-12591Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments by this group have suggested that nebulin fragments affect the acto-S1 myosin complex by optimizing the alignment of actomyosin interactions (13Root D.D. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1171-1186Google Scholar). To further clarify the interactions that nebulin-like repeats may have along the thin filament, we have characterized the binding of a chicken nebulette fragment to Tm and the Tn subunits. Our data suggest that Tm and troponin T (TnT) both contain interaction sites for the nebulin-like motifs. These interactions were strengthened when Tm and TnT were present as a binary complex and weakened by the addition of troponin I (TnI). Furthermore, the nebulette fragment was able to significantly increase the affinity of Tm·Tn for F-actin, demonstrating that nebulin-like motifs contribute to the assembly and allosteric property of the striated muscle thin filament. To clone mouse nebulin (MSN) and chicken nebulette (CN5) cDNAs, a partial sequence of nebulin cDNA from BALB/c strain mice (14Muller-Seitz M. Kaupmann K. Labeit S. Jockusch H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 559-561Google Scholar) and a partial cDNA sequence from chicken nebulette (2Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 205-225Google Scholar) were used to design oligonucleotide primers suitable for RT-coupled PCR. Total RNA was prepared from 129 Sv/J mouse gastrocnemius muscle or white Leghorn chicken heart by the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using 5 μg of total RNA as template and 20 pmol of a reverse primer (mouse: Neb-R, 5′- CGGCATACTATGCCTTATACTGATTATCAC-3′, and chicken: CCN-R2, 5′-CCTTTGAATTCTCAAAATCTTAATGGTA-3′ (mismatches are in bold to introduce restriction enzyme recognition sites and translation stop codons)), 20 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was used for an RT reaction that was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Subsequently, a PCR was set up using one-tenth of the RT products and 20 pmol each of two pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides, Neb-F/Neb-R and CCN-F/CCN-R2 (Neb-F, 5′-TCTCCAGAGTAAACCAGATCCATATGAGTG-3′, and CCN-F, 5′-AGCACTCATATGAACATC-3′ (mismatches are in bold to introduce restriction enzyme recognition sites and translation initiation codons)). The PCR was done with a program of 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Aliquots of the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm amplified cDNA fragments at the expected sizes of 470 bp (MSN) and 540 bp (CN5). The amplified mouse nebulin cDNA was precipitated with ethanol and cloned into theSmaI site of pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene). The amplified chicken nebulette cDNA was precipitated, digested byNdeI and EcoRI endonucleases, and resolved by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis with Tris acetate-EDTA buffer (0.04m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The DNA band of interest was excised from the agarose gel and recovered using the Prep-A-Gene DNA recovery kit (Bio-Rad). The recovered cDNA was cloned into NdeI- and EcoRI-digested pAED4 expression vector (15Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6908-6916Google Scholar). The insert sequences of the two constructs as well as the translation reading frame of the pAED4-CN5 construct were confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (15Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6908-6916Google Scholar). To isolate nebulin genomic DNA, a λ-DASHII 129 SvJ mouse genomic DNA phage library was screened by radioactive probe hybridization (16Gao J. Hwang J.M. Jin J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 292-297Google Scholar). The MSN cDNA was cut from the pBluescript II SK plasmid by BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme digestion, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and recovered as described above. The purified DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming synthesis for use as a radioactive probe in screening nylon filter replicas of the phage library plated on agar plates. Based on the average insert size of the mouse genomic DNA library (12–15 kb pair), an aliquot of phage harboring inserts totaling 1.5× the mouse genome (∼4.5 × 109 bp) was plated out on twelve 150-mm agar plates. The nylon replicas were prehybridized in 100 ml of 30% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSPE (0.9 m NaCl, 0.05 mNaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.7), 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 50 °C for 6 h after which time the heat-denatured radioactively labeled probe was added and incubated at 50 °C for 16 h. Following the hybridization period, the filters were washed successively at room temperature with 1× SSPE, 0.5× SSPE, and 0.1× SSPE followed by washing with 0.1 × SSPE at 50 °C. The filters were exposed to x-ray film overnight to reveal hybridization signals. A small agar plug was recovered from the plate corresponding to the area of each putative positive signal. The hybridization screening was then used in plaque purification to isolate the positive phage clones. The positive phage DNA was prepared in large quantity using the Qiagen Lambda Midi Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). An ∼15-kb mouse genomic DNA insert was excised from the λ-phage arms by EcoRI digestion, and the EcoRI fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK II vector. One subclone containing a 3.2-kb mouse genomic DNA fragment was sequenced by preparing a set of serial deletions using an exonuclease III-based nested deletion kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with the T7 polymerase-based pAED4-CN5 chicken nebulette expression construct and allowed to grow until the colonies were just visible. Four fresh colonies were randomly picked to inoculate 4 liters of NZ broth (10 g/liter casein hydrolysate, and 5 g/liter NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking untilA 600 = 0.8 at which time protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Following 3 h of growth, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA by three passes through a French press at 1000 p.s.i. Successive ammonium sulfate cuts from 0 to 30% saturation and from 30 to 50% saturation were taken from the cleared bacterial lysate. The pH of the solution was maintained at 7 throughout the ammonium sulfate precipitation procedure. The 30–50% ammonium sulfate precipitation pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed at 4 °C against 4 liters of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol for two changes. To the dialyzed fraction, urea powder was added to 6 m, the pH was adjusted to 7, and the solution was clarified by centrifugation. Urea was used to minimize protein-protein interactions and maximize separation during ion-exchange chromatography. The supernatant was loaded onto a 100-ml (2.5 × 20 cm) CM52 column equilibrated with 6 m urea, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A linear KCl gradient of 0–400 mm in the equilibration buffer was used to elute the CN5 protein from the column. The fractions from the CM52 column were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio of 29 to 1, and fractions containing the protein of interest were collected, dialyzed against 4 liters of 0.1% formic acid, a volatile agent, for three changes, and lyophilized. Amino acid analysis of the purified CN5 protein verified the authenticity of cDNA expression and the effectiveness of protein purification (Molecular Biology Core Laboratory, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). The purification protocols for TnC, TnI, TnT, and α/β-Tm from chicken skeletal muscle have been described previously, and the purity of these preparations have been demonstrated (17Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26089-26095Google Scholar, 18Jin J.-P. Wang J. Ogut O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 540-544Google Scholar). Concentrations for all protein preparations were determined by the Nanoorange protein quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with the exception of TnC, which was determined by absorption, assuming an extinction coefficient of 0.132 at 259 nm for a 1-mg/ml solution. Using the purified chicken nebulette CN5 protein, a female BALB/c mouse was immunized intraperitoneally to generate a specific antiserum. For the primary immunization, 200 μg of the CN5 antigen was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed into a water-in-oil emulsion using an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Subsequent boosts using 100 μg of the purified CN5 protein were given at 3-week intervals using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. To collect the anti-CN5 antiserum, the mouse was sacrificed for terminal bleeding and the blood was recovered and allowed to clot at 4 °C overnight. The serum was separated by centrifugation (2000 ×g for 5 min), an equal volume of glycerol was added, and the antiserum was stored at −20 °C. As described previously (19Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar), a short term immunization procedure was applied to develop a specific anti-CN5 monoclonal antibody (mAb). A 7-week-old female BALB/c mouse was injected intraperitoneally and intramuscularly with a total of 50 μg of the purified CN5 antigen in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Ten days later, the mouse was intraperitoneally boosted twice with 200 μg each of the CN5 antigen in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline without adjuvant on two consecutive days. Two days following the last boost, spleen cells were harvested from the immunized mouse to fuse with SP2/0-Ag14 mouse myeloma cells using 50% polyethyleneglycol4000 containing 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide as described previously (20Jin J.-P. Malik M.L. Lin J.J. Hybridoma. 1990; 9: 597-608Google Scholar). Hybridomas were selected by HAT (0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μmaminopterin, and 16 μm thymidine) media containing 20% fetal bovine serum and screened by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against coated CN5 using horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse total immunoglobulin (Sigma) as the second antibody. The positive hybridoma culture supernatants were verified by Western blotting against the CN5 protein using alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse total immunoglobulin second antibody (Sigma) as described previously (17Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26089-26095Google Scholar). The anti-CN5 antibody-secreting hybridomas were subcloned three times by limiting the dilution using young BALB/c mouse spleen cells as a feeder to establish stable cell lines. A high affinity anti-CN5 mAb (Ne-110) was characterized. Immunoglobulin subclass typing by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a reagent kit from BD Biosciences determined that this mAb is mouse IgG1κ. The hybridoma cells were then cultured to produce high titer supernatant and introduced into 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl pentadecane (Pristane, Sigma) primed peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice to produce mAb-enriched ascites fluids. The hybridoma culture supernatant was used in this study. To monitor nebulette expression, Western blots were done using either the anti-CN5 antiserum or CN5 mAb Ne-110 on fresh SDS extracts of cardiac muscle from various species. The SDS-PAGE samples were prepared in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 20 μm leupeptin (Sigma) to ensure protein integrity. To better resolve large proteins (>100 kDa), 6% SDS-PAGE with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1 was used. However, in this system, the resolving gel does not retain proteins <60 kDa in molecular mass. To ensure that no proteolyic products <60 kDa in molecular mass were present, 14% (180:1) SDS-PAGE was used to present a complete SDS extract profile. After resolving total cardiac muscle extracts by SDS-PAGE, a three-buffer system was used to efficiently transfer the resolved protein bands onto nitrocellulose membranes (21Granzier H.L. Wang K. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 56-64Google Scholar). Following the transfer, the nitrocellulose replicas were blocked by incubation at room temperature for 3 h with Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The blocked membrane was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with either the anti-CN5 antiserum or Ne-110 mAb diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The Western blots were developed via alkaline phosphatase-labeled second antibody as described previously (17Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26089-26095Google Scholar). The relative binding strengths of α/β-Tm and Tn subunits to the chicken nebulette fragment CN5 were determined using affinity chromatography. The purified nebulette fragment was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 9 mg of CN5 protein/0.5 ml of gel for coupling. A 0.4-ml column was packed and equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm K2EGTA, and 0.1 mmtris(carboxyethyl) phosphine. Proteins to be analyzed on the column were dissolved in 3 ml of the column buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of the column buffer to ensure homogenous buffer conditions and complex formation. For binding experiments that test the interaction of α/β-Tm or TnT with the CN5 affinity column, 0.4 nmol of protein was typically used. For experiments involving complexes of Tm with Tn subunits, 0.4 nmol of Tm dimer was used and the Tn subunits were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. After loading the dialyzed protein mixtures, the column was washed with 8 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer and eluted by a step gradient of 120–680 mm NaCl in the equilibration buffer. All of the steps were carried out at room temperature. The fractions were examined by 12% (29:1) SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining to determine the protein peaks (22Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Google Scholar). A control experiment was done by mixing 0.4 nmol of TnT and bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs) and loading onto the CN5 affinity column. Only the TnT bound specifically to the column since the bovine serum albumin was eluted in the flow-through and wash fractions only, indicating that nonspecific interactions in this setting were minimal (data not shown). To determine the binding affinity of the CN5 nebulette fragment to F-actin and the interactions between thin filament regulatory proteins and CN5 in the presence of F-actin, a series of cosedimentation experiments were performed. Purified rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin (0.13 nmol) was incubated with serial concentrations of CN5, Tm, TnT, TnI, or whole troponin in either a 30- or 50-μl volume for 45 min at 4 °C. The cosedimentation buffer contained 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 65 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm K2EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In experiments in which CN5 was present during Tm or Tn subunit titrations, a constant concentration of 1.52 μm CN5 was used. Following incubation, F-actin was sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (45,000 rpm) for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima TL Ultracentrifuge using a TLA100.1 rotor. The supernatant and pellet were separated, and 15 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was used to solubilize the pellet. The supernatant and pellet were examined by either 14% (180:1) or 12% (29:1) SDS-PAGE. Resolved gels were silver-stained as described before and analyzed by gel densitometry. The titration curve was constructed from results of three experiments, and the data are presented as the mean ± S.D. To estimate the binding affinity, the total [CN5] required for 50% maximum binding was obtained by averaging the data calculated from the fits for each individual experiment using single exponential fits. A mouse nebulin cDNA fragment was cloned by RT-PCR according to a published cDNA sequence (14Muller-Seitz M. Kaupmann K. Labeit S. Jockusch H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 559-561Google Scholar). This cDNA was used as a probe to isolate an ∼15-kb mouse nebulin genomic DNA fragment from a phage library, and an ∼3.2-kb EcoRI fragment of the genomic DNA was subcloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence has been submitted to the GenBank Data Base (GenBankTM accession number AF440239). Two consecutive exons of the nebulin gene were found in the genomic DNA fragment encoding 69 amino acids and 35 amino acids, which correspond to two and one of the ∼35 amino acid-repeating motifs, respectively (Fig. 1). Both exons had splice boundaries within the conserved pentapeptide, specifically at SX/XXY, indicating this sequence to be at the boundary between the ∼35 amino acid motifs. Partial sequencing of other EcoRI subclones of the ∼15-kb genomic DNA showed similar exon boundaries (data not shown). Because exon organization reflects the evolutionary and potentially functional units of multi-domain proteins, the genomic structure of the mouse nebulin gene indicates that the single ∼35 amino acid motif (Fig. 1,exon B) represents the fundamental functional unit of nebulin-like proteins. Using oligonucleotide primers designed according to a published partial cDNA sequence (2Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 205-225Google Scholar), a chicken nebulette cDNA encoding a polypeptide beginning and ending with the conserved SXXY pentapeptide was amplified. This frame coincides with the exon boundaries of the nebulin gene (Fig. 1). The chicken nebulette cDNA encodes a 168-amino acid protein spanning five nebulin-like motifs with a theoretical M r of 19398 and an isoelectric point of 9.73 and is shown to be aligned to the area of highest homology within the repeating domain of human nebulette (Fig. 2) (5Millevoi S. Trombitas K. Kolmerer B. Kostin S. Schaper J. Pelin K. Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 111-123Google Scholar, 6Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 1-22Google Scholar). Similar to the human nebulin fragments as reported previously (8Jin J.-P. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21215-21223Google Scholar), CN5 expressed in E. coli at high levels. The CN5 protein was readily purified by standard biochemical procedures. Purified CN5 migrated as a single band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) and was found to be relatively soluble under non-denaturing conditions (solubility >0.5 mm). This was in contrast to the MSN fragment, which was confined to the inclusion bodies upon large scale expression inE. coli (data not shown), similar to previously published data on mammalian nebulin fragments (6Moncman C.L. Wang K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 1-22Google Scholar, 8Jin J.-P. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21215-21223Google Scholar, 24Zhang J.Q. Weisberg A. Horowits R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 349-359Google Scholar). A mouse polyclonal antiserum was generated using the purified CN5 protein as the immunogen. As shown in Fig. 3, the polyclonal antiserum was specifically identified the CN5 protein in Western blot. This finding was also recapitulated by the anti-CN5 mAb Ne-110 (data not shown).Figure 3Expression and purification of the chicken nebulette fragment. The cloned chicken nebulette CN5 fragment was expressed in E. coli at a high level upon induction shown in the total bacterial protein extracts by Coomassie Blue R250 staining of 12% (29:1) SDS-PAGE (left panel). The protein was purified effectively and used to raise a specific antiserum. A Western blot using the antiserum identified the CN5 protein in both the induced bacterial lysate and purified protein lanes (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4, the anti-CN5 mAb strongly identified nebulette proteins from chicken and bovine heart extracts. The monoclonal antibody did not strongly recognize nebulette in mouse, sheep, or rabbit cardiac muscle extracts, implying epitope diversity of nebulette proteins across species. Initially, 14% (180:1) SDS-PAGE was used to resolve the isoforms to ensure that no proteolytic fragments were present. To further increase the resolution of isoforms, 6% (29:1) SDS-PAGE was used. Although the chicken nebulette isoforms were identified as two very closely migrating bands under 14% (180:1) SDS-PAGE, 6% (29:1) SDS-PAGE was better able to resolve the isoform diversity. Using the chicken as a developmental model (total extracts from embryonic days 14 to 20), neonatal and adult chicken hearts were analyzed for nebulette expression (Fig. 5). Multiple bands were identified by the anti-CN5 mAb, suggesting nebulette isoform diversity (5Millevoi S. Trombitas K. Kolmerer B. Kostin S. Schaper J. Pelin K. Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 111-123Google Scholar). A higher M r isoform appeared to be predominant throughout heart development but was down-regulated by 6 weeks post-hatch. This developmental pattern of high to lowM r isoform expression is reflective of the regulation of TnT expression with development (23Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-C1170Google Scholar), suggesting that this type of isoform switch is fundamentally conserved in the myofilament proteins of striated muscle. Two closely migrating isoforms, a predominant lower M r isoform and a less expressed higher M r isoform, were identified in extracts from bovine heart chambers, suggesting that isoform diversity was not confined to the avian heart. It was also noted that the ratio of the isoforms varied between chambers with the lower M r isoform being predominant in the left ventricle. The primary sequence differences between the nebu"

Endothelin-1, a powerful paracrine mediator of myocyte growth, induces similar changes in cultured cardiac myocytes as those seen in hypertrophied heart in vivo. By using rat B-type natriuretic peptide promoter, we identified a novel ETS binding sequence, on which nuclear protein binding is activated in endothelin-1-treated cultured cardiac myocytes. This sequence binds ETS-like gene-1 transcription factor and mediates endothelin-1-specific activation of transcription, but not responses to increased calcium signaling via l-type calcium channels, angiotensin II treatment, or mechanical stretch of myocytes.

Initiation of hypertrophic growth is accompanied by a rapid and transient expression of immediate early genes (e.g. c-jun, c-fos, andEgr-1) followed by activation of a pattern of cardiac genes, including atrial and B-type natriuretic peptide(ANP 1 andBNP) and β-myosin heavy chain(β-MHC), whereas relative expression of a subset of genes is simultaneously decreased (i.e. α-myosin heavy chain, α-MHC) (1Ruskoaho H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 479-602PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Natriuretic peptides, released into circulation by cardiac myocytes, defend the cardiovascular system against increased hemodynamic load and decrease blood pressure by increasing salt and water excretion and by promoting vasodilation (3Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). However, when both mechanical and neurohumoral stress of myocytes are sustained, adaptive mechanisms fail leading to maladaptation and, eventually, cardiac dysfunction (i.e. congestive heart failure) (4Lorell B.H. Carabello B.A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that a number of humoral factors, such as angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), participate in this adaptive process and modify the growth of cardiac myocytes (5Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Production of ET-1 is increased in humans with cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure, and ET-1 plasma concentrations correlate with the clinical severity of the cardiac failure (6Pacher R. Stanek B. Hulsmann M. Koller-Strametz J. Berger R. Schuller M. Hartter E. Ogris E. Frey B. Heinz G. Maurer G. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1996; 27: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). There are two distinct G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subtypes for ET-1, ETA and ETB receptors, both of which are widely expressed in a variety of tissues, including myocardium (7Hori S. Komatsu Y. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Activation of GPCRs catalyzes exchange of GTP for GDP within the heterotrimeric G-protein complex releasing activated Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits, each of which has regulatory functions (8Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Binding of ET-1 to its receptors induces Gq/11-protein-dependent stimulation of phospholipase C, leading to formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (9Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M.

Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), may result in activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) and phosphatase (i.e. calcineurin) pathways (12Nicol R.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15239-15245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, signaling pathways downstream of ET receptors involve small G-proteins (Ras, RhoA, and Rac) accompanied by activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (14Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 64H-69HAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanisms connecting ET-1-induced cytosolic signaling to nuclear targets are poorly understood in cardiac myocytes. ET-1 has been reported to activate nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) transcription factor (15Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and, via MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, GATA-4 transcription factor (16Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Physical and functional interactions of GATA-4 with its cofactors, nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) and serum response factor (SRF), are induced in ET-1-treated cardiac myocytes (17Kakita T.

Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, inhibitory strategies targeted against either GATA-4 protein synthesis or DNA binding affinity have produced different results in ET-1-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes, suggesting an increasing complexity of ET-1-dependent pathways (19Charron F.

To elucidate the nuclear mechanisms of ET-1-activated cell signaling, we studied ratBNP (rBNP) as a cardiac myocyte-specific target gene for ET-1 and identified a novel signaling mechanism initiating from cell membrane ETA receptor and leading to p38 MAPK- and ETS factor-dependent induction of the rBNPgene. Specific antibodies raised against transcription factors of activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex (c-fos, c-jun, jun-B, and jun-D), NFATc3, NFATc4, ETS-like gene-1 (Elk-1), Ser-383-phosphorylated Elk-1, ETS-1/-2 (DNA binding domain), Fli-1, GATA-4, NFκB (p50, p65), Nkx-2.5, and SRF were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Specific antibodies against signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 and -3 (STAT-1 and -3) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). ET-1, Ang II, and Bay K8644 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), BQ610 was from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (San Carlos, CA), and bosentan was a kind gift from Dr. M. Clozel (Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). Anti-rabbit IgG antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, New England BioLabs Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) and ECL+Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) were used for Western blot detection. All oligonucleotides were from Sigma Chemical Co. except the NFκB and shift-inducible element electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) probes were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmid for Rous sarcoma virus-promoter linked to β-galactosidase gene (RSV-βgal) and pGL3-Basic plasmid-expressing luciferase gene were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).

Davis (University of Massachusetts). Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared from 2- to 4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and transfected with liposome-mediated transfection (20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Oulu approved the experimental design. Briefly, after preparation, cells were plated at the density of 2 × 105/cm2 on cell culture plates (Falcon) or on collagen I-coated elastomere plates with flexible bottoms (Bioflex, Flexcell Int.) for stretch experiments and cultured overnight with Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. Transfection of cells (if designated) was performed on the second day in culture. Cells were exposed to 3 μl of FuGENE 6 and 1.5 μg of DNA (1 μg of Luc, 0.5 μg of β-gal plasmids) per milliliter of complete serum-free medium for 6 h and cultured thereafter in complete serum-free medium. Cells on Bioflex plates were exposed to cyclic mechanical stretch. Frequency of cyclic stretch was 0.5 Hz with pulsation of 10–25% elongation of cells for 24 h. Cells were stretched by applying a cyclic vacuum suction under Bioflex plates by computer-controlled equipment (FX-3000, Flexcell Int.). In co-transfection experiments, cells were grown on 24-well plates and transfected with 0.45 μg of intact −534BNP-luc or with −534BNP-luc containing mutation of EBS and 0.05 μg of expression plasmid (see “Plasmids and Oligonucleotides”) of dnMEK1, dnMKK6, dnJNK1, MEK1, p38α, JNK1, or pMT2 plasmids with 0.25 μg of RSV-βgal and 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 per milliliter. Empty control plasmid pMT2 was used to equalize the amount of transfected DNA between experimental groups. All experiments were started subsequently on the third day, and cells were harvested according to the experiment during the third or fourth day in culture. Reporter gene activities were measured by using luciferase and β-galactosidase (to correct transfection efficiency) assays (Promega) with luminometer. Luciferase activity levels were 9.2 ± 1.0 (average ± S.E.)-fold higher than those of β-galactosidase activity. Both luciferase and β-galactosidase levels were at the linear range of the assay measurement scale. RNA was isolated from cardiac myocytes by the guanidine thiocyanate-CsCl method (21Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Northern blots were hybridized with specific cDNA probes for rat BNP, rat ANP, and rat ribosomal 18 S (20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S.

To measure the secretion of BNP, samples of incubation medium were subjected to radioimmunoassay of BNP (20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S.

Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were sticky end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by Klenow enzyme (22Hautala N. Tokola H. Luodonpää M. Puhakka J. Romppanen H. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For each reaction mixture (20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), 6 μg of nuclear protein and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) were used in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Reaction mixtures were incubated with a labeled probe for 20 min followed by gel-electrophoresis (250 V, for 1.5–1.75 h normally and for supershift 2.5 h) on 5% polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, gels were dried and exposed in a PhosphorImager screen and analyzed with ImageQuaNT (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm DNA sequence specificity of the protein-DNA complex formation, competition experiments with 10, 50, and 100 molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotides with intact or mutated binding sites were performed. In addition, DNA binding activity assays of Octamer-1 (Oct-1) transcription factor were run in parallel to control the specificity of the altered DNA binding activity (16Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For competition and supershift experiments appropriate competitor oligonucleotides or antibodies were added to reaction mixture 20 min before labeled probe. Western blot analysis was done using standard reagents and protocol (16Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of nuclear proteins was used for SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting utilizing antibodies against phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) and Elk-1 (binds both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Elk-1). Finally, blots were developed with goat anti-Rabbit IgG-HRP and enhanced luminescence reagents followed by exposure of film for 1–3 min (Hyperfilm ECL, AmershamBiosciences). Cardiac myocytes were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips and exposed to ET-1 (100 nm) for 24 h. α-Actin filaments of fixed myocytes were labeled with Alexa FluorTM 488 Phalloidin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) (20Pikkarainen S.

Representative images were taken with laser confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. To determine the statistical significance between two groups and for analysis of multiple groups, the Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference post hoc test were used, respectively. Differences at the 95% level were considered statistically significant. Cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes serve as a useful experimental model for the study of myocyte growth and the intracellular mechanisms involved. Primary neonatal ventricular myocytes (referred to hereafter as cardiac myocytes) used in this study respond to a variety of stimuli by the activation of hypertrophic growth program virtually identical to that of developing neonatal and the pathologic adult myocardium (5Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). ET-1 activated cardiac genes associated with hypertrophic growth program, such as ANP and BNP (Fig. 1 A), of which BNP synthesis was augmented through an ETA receptor-dependent mechanism (Fig. 1 B) (23Liang F., Lu, S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cardiac myocytes subjected to ET-1 develop hypertrophy, including activation of protein synthesis (16Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and increased cell size accompanied by reorganization of sarcomeres (Fig. 1 C). In the context of the rBNP promoter, previous studies have indicated that the proximal 5′-flanking region of 535 bp is sufficient to confer the induction by GPCR agonists (20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proximal −534 bp of BNP promoter contain multiple potential cis-acting elements (25Tokola H. Hautala N. Marttila M. Magga J. Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) such as GATA elements. Proximal GATA elements participate in the activation ofrBNP gene transcription by α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (24Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but not by ET-1 (20Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized a computer-based search for novel cis-acting elements of the rat BNP gene and identified an ETS binding sequence (EBS) and AP-1 binding sequence at −498 and −373 bp of the rBNP promoter, respectively. To characterize the role of these elements, we introduced site-directed mutations to EBS and AP-1 binding sequences and to −90/−81-bp tandem GATA elements of the rBNP promoter (Fig. 2 A). Endothelin-1 activated proximal −534-bp rBNP promoter dose-dependently via ETA receptor, and the induction was inhibited by mutation of EBS (Fig. 2, B and C). The combination of mutations of AP-1 and/or GATA elements with the mutation of EBS did not further decrease the inhibition seen with rBNP promoter containing mutated EBS (data not shown). Importantly, the induction ofrBNP transcription in myocytes by mechanical stretch or Ang II was unaffected by the mutation of EBS (Fig. 2 D). To investigate this ET-1 responsive element further, we studied the complex formation of cardiac nuclear proteins with EBS of rBNP promoter. Previously, it has been demonstrated that exposure of cardiac myocytes to hypertrophic agonists selectively activate transcription factors followed by specific DNA binding affinity and eventually activation of transcription (16Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Ardati A. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To analyze whether there is specific binding activity on EBS of rBNP promoter by cardiac nuclear proteins, we utilized EMSA, and, when designated, performed the protein-DNA binding reactions in the presence a 100-molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 A). We found that three specific shifts (complexes C1–3) were constantly formed, of which C1 and C2 migrated closely to each other separately from a faster migrating complex C3. Competitor oligonucleotides with mutated nucleotides from −497 bp (mut 2) to −491 bp (mut 8) failed to compete against intact EBS and were found essential for formation of complexes C1–3 (i.e. 5′-cCCGGAAGtg-3′), suggesting similarity of binding proteins in these complexes. Interestingly, a labeled high affinity ETS binding sequence (SC1) (27Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) formed complexes similar to C1–3 (Fig. 3 A). The core sequence for ETS factor binding of SC1 (Table I) is similar to EBS of rBNP promoter. When SC1 oligonucleotide was used as a unlabeled competitor against nuclear protein binding on EBS of rBNP promoter, SC1 dose-dependently inhibited protein binding on EBS, and the competition was abolished by single nucleotide mutation of SC1 (i.e. 5′-CCGaAAGTG-3′) (Fig. 3 B). An NFκB binding oligonucleotide (Table I), as an another potential GGA sequence binding element, was not able to compete against binding on EBS of the rBNP promoter (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, with EBS of rBNP, nuclear proteins extracted from adult rat heart (left ventricle) formed identical complexes C1–3 in EMSA (data not shown), suggesting that ETS factors binding on EBS of rBNP are present in adult heart.Table IComparison of oligonucleotides used in EMSANucleotides corresponding to EBS at −498 bp are indicated byboxes, the point mutations are in boldface, and 5′-overhangs are italic. Open table in a new tab Nucleotides corresponding to EBS at −498 bp are indicated byboxes, the point mutations are in boldface, and 5′-overhangs are italic. In view of specific complex formation of cardiac nuclear proteins with EBS of BNP promoter, we analyzed whether ET-1 treatment of cardiac myocytes had any effect on the nuclear protein binding activity on EBS (Fig. 4, A–D). Initially, a rapid and transient increase in formation of complex C2 was detected at 5 and 15 min. Later, a sustained increase of EBS binding activity was observed at 3 h for complexes C1 and C3, which remained elevated at 24 h. In agreement with our previous studies (16Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), all the nuclear extracts were tested in parallel for Oct-1 binding activity, which was not altered by ET-1 suggesting a specific activation of EBS binding (data not shown). Taken together, ET-1 treatment of cardiac myocytes initiated a biphasic activation of protein binding on the EBS of rBNP, and these specific complexes closely resembled complex formation of nuclear proteins with a high affinity ETS binding sequence. Functional ETS factor binding regulatory cis sequences have been characterized extensively in both viral and eukaryotic genes, but there are exceptionally few reports of the cardiac genes regulated by ETS factors (28Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Gupta et al. (29Gupta M. Zak R. Libermann T.A. Gupta M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7243-7258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported a repressor role for 3′-flanking EBS resulting in myocyte-restricted expression of α-MHC gene, whereas other studies available have described an interaction of serum response element (SRE) with an EBS in the activation of c-fos gene in cardiac myocytes (30Aoyagi T. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27176-27179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Babu G.J. Lalli M.J. Sussman M.A. Sadoshima J. Periasamy M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1447-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). EBS of rBNP differs significantly from those reported previously: (i) −2.2 kb of the 5′-flanking region of rat BNP gene contains no potential SRE for TCF (ternary complex factor)-SRF synergy (18Morin S. Paradis P. Aries A. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and (ii) EBS functions as an activator element of rBNP transcription exclusively by ET-1. To identify the transcription factors binding on EBS, we used specific antibodies added to binding reaction prior radioactively labeled EBS and subsequent EMSA. We utilized antibodies for NFκB (p50 and p65), AP-1 complex (c-fos, c-jun, jun-B, and jun-D), Nkx-2.5, SRF, ETS-1/-2 (DNA binding domain), Fli-1 (a member of ETS transcription factor family), and activated Ser-383-phosphorylated Elk-1 (Phospho-Elk-1). We found that ET-1-activated C2 complex was supershifted by antibody raised against Phospho-Elk-1 (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, none of these antibodies had any effect on GATA-4 binding activity on the −90/−81-bp rBNP GATA binding site in EMSA run in parallel (data not shown). Given the cumulative evidence demonstrating that Elk-1 transcription factor is regulated via site-specific phosphorylation (32Yordy J.S. Muise-Helmericks R.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6503-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we further investigated activation of Elk-1 by using Western blot analysis. The site-specific phosphorylation (Ser-383) of Elk-1 transiently increased at 5 and 15 min in cardiac myocytes treated with ET-1 (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, Elk-1 phosphorylation is temporally related to increased formation of complex C2 in EMSA (Fig. 4 B). In addition, antibodies raised against NFATc3, NFATc4, GATA-4, STAT-1 and -3 and competitor oligonucleotides of AP-1, GATA-4 binding sequences (−373 bp and −90 bp/−81 bp of rBNP) and Nkx-2.5 binding element (at −240 bp of rat ANP gene) or shift-inducible element failed to have any effect on complex formation of cardiac nuclear proteins with EBS (data not shown). In conclusion, ET-1 induces phosphorylation and binding of Elk-1 on EBS of rBNP (complex C2) and likely activates additional ETS related proteins whose identity we were unable to identify by using specific antibodies against ETS related or other tra"

The secondary structures of fibrils and soluble monomers in the site-specific 13C-labeled D15N-hCTs were determined using 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning and dipolar decoupled magic angle spinning NMR approaches, sensitive to detect 13C signals from the fibril and the soluble monomer, respectively. The local conformations and structures of D15N-hCT fibrils at pH 7.5 and 3.2 were found to be similar to each other and those of hCT at pH 3.3 and were interpreted as a mixture of antiparallel and parallel β-sheets, whereas they were different from the hCT fibril at pH 7.5 whose structure is proposed to be antiparallel β-sheets. Thus the negatively charged Asp15 in the hCT molecule turned out to play an essential role in determining the structures and orientations of the hCT molecules. Fibrillation kinetics of D15N-hCT was analyzed using a two-step autocatalytic reaction mechanism. The results indicated that the replacement of Asp15 with Asn15 did not reduce the rate constants of the fibril formation but rather increased the rate constants at neutral pH.

In mammals CT plays a central role in calcium-phosphorus metabolism as a thyroid hormone (1Copp D.H. Cameron E.C. Cheney B.A. Davidson A.G.F. Henze K.G.

Med. 1981; 304: 269-278Google Scholar). In concentrated aqueous solution, human calcitonin (hCT), however, has a tendency to form a fibril precipitate known as a disease-associated amyloidosis (Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.). Resulting fibers of 8 nm in diameter (4Sieber P. Riniker B. Brugger M. Kamber B. Rittel W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1970; 53: 2135-2150Google Scholar) as revealed by electron microscopic studies on hCT fibrils gave rise to a common ultrastructure with clinically and biochemically diverse amyloid fibrils (5Sipe J.D.

Analogous to β-amyloid, calcitonin is another model peptide associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (9Berger G. Berger N. Guillaud M. Troirillas J. Vanzelle J. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1958; 412: 543-551Google Scholar, 10Byard R. Thorner P. Chan H. Griffiths A. Cutz E. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 581-592Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of fibril formation has not yet been well understood. It is therefore important to clarify the fibrillation process and mechanism in hCT not only to contribute to further improvement of aqueous therapeutic formations with a long term stability 2T. Arvinte and K. Ryman, European patent application, publication number 0490549A (1992). 2T. Arvinte and K. Ryman, European patent application, publication number 0490549A (1992).but also to gain insight into a general picture as to molecular mechanism of amyloid formation. It has been shown that an amphiphilic α-helical structure is formed in the central region of hCT in aqueous acidic solution (12Jeon, Y. H., Kanaori, K., Takashima, H., Kosiba, T., and Nosaka, Y. A. (1998) Abstracts of XVIIIth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems, p. 61, TokyoGoogle Scholar). Subsequently, local conformational transitions from an α-helix to a β-sheet structure at the central region and from a random coil to a β-sheet at the C terminus region were induced simultaneously during the fibril formation in the acetic acid solution (pH 3.3) (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). We further noticed that a two-step reaction model can be used to analyze the fibrillation kinetics by the observation of a certain delay time followed by a simultaneous decrease and increase from the DD- and CP-MAS NMR signals, sensitive to detection of 13C NMR signals from the soluble monomer and fibril component, respectively. The first step is a homogeneous association to form the nucleus of fibril, and the second step is an autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation to mature the fibril; the kinetics parameters for the first (k 1) and second (k 2) steps were determined individually (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). As a mechanism of the molecular association in the first nucleation process, it was proposed that the α-helices are bundled together by hydrophobic interaction among the side chains of the amphiphilic α-helices in the central region of hCT (14Kanaori K. Nosaka A.Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12138-12143Google Scholar). It was reported that the rate of fibril formation at neutral pH is much faster than that at acidic pH, because hCT monomer is more stable in an acidic medium in the absence of salts and buffer than in physiological saline solution. Local molecular structures and macroscopic features of the hCT fibrils formed in the sodium acetate solution (pH 7.5) were different from those at pH 3.3 (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). We proposed that the fibril at pH 7.5 is comprised of antiparallel β-sheets because of the favorable electrostatic interaction between side chains of Asp15(−) and Lys18(+) at pH 7.5. On the contrary, the mixture of antiparallel and parallel β-sheet structures is formed at pH 3.3, because the side chains of Lys18 and His20 and the amino group in the N terminus were positively charged and there is no favorable direction among the molecules to associate. Therefore, it is worthwhile to perform further examination using mutant hCT having different local charges whether fibril formation of hCT is affected not only by the hydrophobic interaction but also by the electrostatic interaction among charged side chains (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). 13C chemical shifts of carbonyl and Cα and Cβ carbons in amino acid residues obtained from high resolution solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy have been established to correlate with local secondary structures of polypeptides (15Saitô H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Google Scholar, 16Saitô H. Ando I. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1989; 21: 209-290Google Scholar). These conformation-dependent13C chemical shifts were proven to provide reliable secondary structures for fibrous and membrane proteins (17Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Google Scholar, 18Saitô H. Tuzi S. Naito A. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 36: 79-121Google Scholar). Use of site-specific 13C-labeled carbonyl groups for Gly10 and Phe22 or methyl carbons at Ala26 and Ala31 in hCT provided a clue as to the local conformations at the specific sites over the entire molecule, together with simultaneous observation of local conformational changes of hCT from solution to fibril state by the DD-MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra, respectively, during the fibril formation (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the effect of the electrostatic interaction between the charged side chains in the fibril formation of hCT. In the hCT molecule, there is only one amino acid that charges negatively, Asp15, and there are two amino acids with positive charges (Lys18 and His20 (see SchemeFSI) besides the amino group of N terminus). Therefore an Asn15-hCT mutant, D15N-hCT, was chemically synthesized to examine the effect of electrostatic interaction in the structure and kinetics of the fibril formation. The hydrophilic residue at position 15 of hCT is not required for biological activity (19Moe G.R. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1971-1976Google Scholar), with the expectation of a slow fibrillation rate as a prerequisite for a therapeutic agent. In contrast to this expectation, there is anticipation that the most common type of aging-related damage arising from the neutralization of aspartate leads to an increased β-sheet content to cause an increased propensity for fibril formation (20Orpiszewski J. Benson M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 413-428Google Scholar). Thus the artificial mutation of hCT from Asp15 to Asn15 can serve as a suitable model of the aging-related damage in the β-amyloid formation, too. We prepared three types of isotopically labeled D15N-hCT preparations,I–III (Scheme FSI) by chemical synthesis (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). Note that the Pro residue was not contained for I and II as manifested by matrix-associated laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI MASS) analysis. For the 13C solid state NMR experiments, the lyophilized preparations were dissolved in 15 mm aqueous acetic acid solution and 5 mm phosphate buffer. Immediately after D15N-hCTs were dissolved in the solution, a portion of the solution (80 μl) was placed in a 5-mm outer diameter zirconia rotor and sealed with Araldite® (Vantico) to prevent evaporation of the mother liquor throughout the NMR measurements. The same solution stood in the test tubes at the same temperature as used in the NMR measurements to check the turbidity or viscosity of the solution by visual observation. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Chemagnetics CMX 400 NMR spectrometer at the resonance frequency of 100.6 MHz. The 13C NMR spectra were recorded alternatively by means of 13C CP-MAS and DD-MAS techniques because solid fibril and soluble monomer were preferentially recorded by the former and latter methods, respectively, in view of their cross-polarization times (τCH) and spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1). The 13C chemical shifts were calibrated by using the external carboxyl peak of crystalline glycine at 176.03 ppm from tetramethylsilane. The lengths of π/2 pulse for the carbon and proton nuclei were 5.0 μs, and the recycle delay times were 4 and 5 s for the CP- and DD-MAS studies, respectively. All NMR measurements were performed at 20 °C. Acquisition of the 13C DD- and CP-MAS NMR spectra was started at 20 °C after 6 h from dissolution, because a time delay was necessary to achieve tight enough sealing of the sample rotor by glue. The number of accumulations for the DD- and CP-MAS signals were 1000 and 2000, respectively, in the time course studies. For electron microscopic analyses, D15N-hCT fibrils grown from the solution at pH 3.2 and 7.5 (80 mg/ml), respectively, at room temperature were diluted with each buffer solution after 4 h and 3 days, respectively, from the dissolution and vortexed to reduce their viscosity. 5 μl of the suspension was placed on a Formvar-covered grid and stained with 5 μl of uranyl acetate. The negative stained samples were viewed in a JEOL 1200 EX II electron microscope at 80 kV. CD measurements were performed on an AVIV model 62DS using quartz cuvettes with the path length of 0.2 cm. CD spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 250–200 nm. The concentration of D15N-hCT was 0.2 mg/ml (58.5 μm), and 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 15 mm acetic acid solution (pH 3.3) were used. The temperature was controlled to 25 °C using a thermostatted cell holder throughout the CD measurements. Fig. 1 illustrates the electron micrographs for the two preparations, which clearly indicate the presence of fibrils from D15N-hCT (II) in pH 7.5 and 3.2 solutions (80 mg/ml). The D15N-hCT fibrils at pH 7.5 (Fig. 1 A) were much shorter than those at pH 3.2 (Fig. 1 B). Although the distinct differences in the length of the fibrils were observed between the two samples, the diameters of the fibrils at pH 7.5 were about 15 nm, which was almost the same as those at pH 3.2. The fact that fibrils at the neutral condition are shorter than those at acidic ones is the same as the case of hCT (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). The local secondary structures were determined by observing DD-MAS and CP-MAS 13C NMR spectra in [1-13C]Phe16,[3-13C]Ala31-labeled D15N-hCT (I) and [1-13C]Gly10,[3-13C]Ala26-labeled D15N-hCT (II) for soluble monomer and fibril, respectively. In the 13C DD-MAS spectra of I at pH 7.5, the carbonyl signal of Phe16 at 173.4 ppm and the methyl signal of Ala31 at 17.2 ppm (Fig. 2 A) of liquid-like component were ascribed to species taking a random coil, with reference to the conformation-dependent 13C chemical shifts; α-helix, random coil, and β-sheet are 171.6, 170.9, and 168.5 ppm for [1-13C]Gly, 175.2, 173.2, and 169.0 ppm for [1-13C]Phe, and 14.9, 16.9, and 20.0 ppm for [3-13C]Ala residues (15Saitô H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1986; 24: 835-852Google Scholar, 16Saitô H. Ando I. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1989; 21: 209-290Google Scholar, 17Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol.

The [1-13C]Gly10,[3-13C]Ala26,Ala31signals of I and III at pH 7.5 and 2.6, respectively, observed in DD-MAS spectra are shown in Fig. 2(A and D) and Fig. 3 A, and the 13C chemical shifts are also summarized in TableI with their assignments. In the case of Ala31 of III, we took into account the additional upfield displacement of the peaks by 1.0 ppm arising from the carbonyl carbon directly bonded to the amide nitrogen of a Pro residue (21Torchia D.A. Lyerla J.J. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 97-114Google Scholar, 22Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Google Scholar). Thus, the secondary structures of D15N-hCT monomers were exactly the same among the preparations at different pH values. The 13C CP-MAS NMR signals of the fibrils (Fig. 2,B, C, E, and F, and Fig. 3,B and C) were relatively broader than the corresponding 13C DD-MAS NMR signals of the soluble monomers (Fig. 2, A and D, and Fig. 3 A) because of the shorter spin-spin relaxation times and the conformational heterogeneity. The peak positions of CP-MAS spectra of the most intense one as the most populated conformation are summarized in Table I for D15N fibrils (I–III) at pH 7.5 and 3.2 or 2.6 (for III) together with their assignments. Obviously, the conformational transition from the random coil to β-sheet around Phe16 occurred during the fibril formation, whereas a part of the α-helix and the random coil changed to the β-sheet forms around Gly10, Ala26, and Ala31 residues, respectively. We found that the presence and absence of Pro32 at D15N-hCT does not affect the change of secondary structures of monomer and fibril as for the central region.Figure 313 C DD-MAS and CP-MAS NMR spectra of [1-13C]Gly10,[3-13C]Ala31-labeled D15N-hCT (III).

Open table in a new tab The secondary structure of D15N-hCT (III) monomer was also examined using CD measurements (0.2 mg/ml) at pH 7.2 and 3.3 (Fig. 4). They showed similar spectra as those of hCT in the wavelength between 200 and 250 nm (23Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 633-635Google Scholar, 24Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Google Scholar). This means that the D15N-hCT monomer takes mainly the random coil form as confirmed by the CD data of the hCT solution (23Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 633-635Google Scholar, 24Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the time courses of the variation of the 13C NMR signal intensities at 20 °C for D15N-hCT (III) with the concentration of 25 mg/ml at pH 2.9, because the fibrils were formed in a few minutes under the higher concentration (80 mg/ml) at both pH 7.5 and 3.2. The aqueous solution of III at pH 2.9 became a gel after 8 h from the dissolution. The Gly10 C=O signal in the 13C DD-MAS spectra decreases gradually during the first 40 h (Fig. 5 A). On the contrary, the Gly10 C=O signal (170.1 ppm) in the CP-MAS NMR spectra was visible after 20 h from the dissolution and increased rapidly during the next 20 h. It turned out that the fibrillation mechanism for D15N-hCT was interpreted as a two-step reaction model that is the same as that of wild type hCT (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar) on account of the rate constants, k 1 andk 2, obtained from the fitting to the data points (Fig. 5 B, Table II).Table IIKinetic parameters for the fibril formation of D15N-hCT (III) in acidic and neutral pH solutionsMethodpH conc.k1k 2ak 2s −1s −1 m −1s −1NMR Gly10C=OpH 2.9, 25 mg/ml6.17 (± 1.35) × 10−75.36 (± 1.22) × 10−33.92 (± 0.89) × 10−5CDpH 7.2, 0.2 mg/ml1.55 (± 0.02) × 10−55.46 (± 1.18)3.19 (± 0.69) × 10−4 Open table in a new tab The time course of the fibril formation of D15N-hCT (III) at pH 7.5 was also examined by CD measurements. The monomeric component assigned to random coil (205 nm) was decreased gradually as a result of fibril formation after 2 h from dissolution (Fig. 6 A). The fitting plot is shown in Fig. 6 B, and the rate constants obtained by fitting to the data points are summarized in Table II. The characters ofk 1 and k 2 will be discussed later. It was found that the D15N-hCT (I, II) monomer forms the local α-helical structure in the vicinity of Gly10 and random coil around Phe16, Ala26, and Ala31residues in the neutral and acidic solutions, showing the same structures as those of hCT in view of their conformation-dependent 13C chemical shift data (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the D15N-hCT (III) solution (Fig. 4) also showed similarities to that of hCT, which indicated disordered secondary structure in solution (24Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Google Scholar, 25Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Schlueter R.J. Boni L.T. Hui S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5074-5084Google Scholar). Although the chemical shift values indicate that the vicinity of Phe16 forms a random coil, the central region of D15N-hCT monomer might be in equilibrium between the α-helix structure and random coil in solution as suggested for hCT that could form partially an α-helix in the central region (Thr13-Phe19) and undergo exchange with another structure to show the random coil form (12Jeon, Y. H., Kanaori, K., Takashima, H., Kosiba, T., and Nosaka, Y. A. (1998) Abstracts of XVIIIth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems, p. 61, TokyoGoogle Scholar). The methyl signal from Ala31 (I) was observed at 17.2 ppm, which is shifted from the standard value of random coil (16.9 ppm). This discrepancy indicates that the C terminus may form a turn structure as suggested by a solution NMR study (12Jeon, Y. H., Kanaori, K., Takashima, H., Kosiba, T., and Nosaka, Y. A. (1998) Abstracts of XVIIIth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems, p. 61, TokyoGoogle Scholar), because the chemical shift is similar to that of loop structure of bacteriorhodopsin (18Saitô H. Tuzi S. Naito A. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1998; 36: 79-121Google Scholar). During fibril formation, it was shown that the local random coil formed around the Phe16 residue in D15N-hCT was converted into the β-sheet structure (Figs. 2 and 3). Although 13C chemical shifts of [1-13C]Phe16 can be assigned to β-sheet structure, the deviation from the standard value is 2.7 ppm. This large discrepancy may be because of the formation of β-turn/β-sheet structure in the Asn17-Thr21region (26Kazantzis A. Waldner M. Taylor J.W. Kapurniotu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 780-791Google Scholar). Because this structure is crucial for bioactivity, it is expected that the bioactivity of D15N-hCT will be the same as that of hCT. A part of the α-helical component around Gly10residue is also changed to the β-sheet structure, although the local α-helical structure remains as the major component around Gly10 in the D15N-hCT fibril. The chemical shifts of 169.7–170.0 ppm and 18.9–19.9 ppm for [1-13C]Gly and [3-13C]Ala, respectively, in D15N-hCT fibrils are quite similar to those of silk fibroin (type II), distinguished from the polymorphic form, silk I (27Saitô H. Tabeta R. Asakura T. Iwanaga Y. Shoji A. Ozaki T. Ando I. Macromolecules. 1984; 17: 1405-1412Google Scholar, 28Ishida M. Asakura T. Yokoi M. Saito H. Macromolecules. 1990; 23: 88-94Google Scholar), and of the native dragline silk fibroin (29Hijirida D.H. Gian Do H. Michal C. Wong S. Zax D. Jelinski L.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3442-3447Google Scholar). Interestingly, two conformations exist also in the C terminus region as viewed from the 13C NMR peaks of [3-13C]Ala26 and [3-13C]Ala31 in the D15N-hCT fibril except for those of D15N-hCT fibril (III) at pH 7.5. These conformations are similar to the case of hCT fibrils at pH 3.3 (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). These results led to a model of the fibril formation of D15N-hCT that indicates the fibrils form the mixture of antiparallel and parallel β-sheet structures at pH 7.5 and 3.3 as depicted in Fig. 7. It is emphasized that the conformation of D15N-hCT fibrils is almost the same as those grown at pH 3.2 and 7.5 and those of hCT at pH 3.0 except for the existence of the α-helix component around Gly10 in the D15N-hCT fibrils. These structures, however, were quite different in the case of hCT at pH 7.5 (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). Artificially mutated β-amyloid peptides changed from an ionic side chain to a neutral one have been investigated by means of electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fiber x-ray diffraction, and NMR spectroscopy (30Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Surewicz W.K. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1190-1201Google Scholar, 31Fraser P.E. McLachlan D.R. Surewicz W.K. Mizzen C.A. Snow A.D. Nguyen J.T. Kirschner D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 64-73Google Scholar, 32Wood S.J. Maleeff B. Hart T. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 870-877Google Scholar). The previous studies in the formation of amyloid fibrils from the fragments of amyloid β peptides showed that the charge to charge interactions stabilize the β-sheet conformation and promote the assembly of protofibrils into longer amyloid fibers (30Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Surewicz W.K. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1190-1201Google Scholar). In contrast to the β-amyloid peptides, hCT has a limited number of ionic charged amino acids, such as Asp15, Lys18, and His20, and the present study of the hCT fibril formation could be served as a more straightforward means to elucidate the effect of the electrostatic interaction on the formation of amyloid fibril. The local charges in the hCT and D15N-hCT molecules are as follows: hCT at pH 7.5: Asp15(−), Lys18(+), NH3(+);hCT at pH 3.3: Lys18(+), His20(+), NH3(+); D15N-hCT at pH 7.5: Lys18(+), NH3(+); D15N-hCT at pH 3.3: Lys18(+), His20(+), NH3(+). As for the molecular association, we suggested that hCT fibril at pH 7.5 forms the antiparallel β-sheet by a favorable electrostatic interaction between Asp15 and Lys18, in addition to the hydrophobic interaction among the amphiphilic helices of the core region of hCT during the nucleation process (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). This kind of electrostatic interaction is also important for the stabilization of the coiled-coil structure (11Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1999: 35-37Google Scholar). The hCT fibril formed the mixtures of antiparallel and parallel β-sheets up to the most C-terminal region at pH 3.3 because of the absence of an attractive ionic interaction to determine the direction for molecular association (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). On the other hand, the molecular structure of D15N-hCT fibril at pH 7.5 was similar to that of D15N-hCT fibril at pH 3.3. They are also similar to that of the hCT fibril at pH 3.3 and are quite different from that of the hCT fibril at pH 7.5. This result clearly shows that the presence of a negative charge at Asp15 determines the direction to lead the antiparallel β-sheet during molecular association (Fig. 7). Fibril formation of D15N-hCT also showed the same two-step autocatalytic reaction mechanism as hCT. In the reaction, we can compare the rates for samples of one concentration with those of different concentrations, because the rate constantk 1 (s−1) is independent of sample concentration and ak 2 (s−1) is the comparative value where a is the initial sample concentration (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). The rate constant, k 1, obtained for D15N-hCT in the acidic condition showed a smaller value by 5-fold as compared with that of hCT at pH 3.3, although thek 2 values are comparable (k 1 = 3.28 × 10−6s−1; ak 2 = 4.10 × 10−5 s−1 for hCT) (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). Interestingly, bothk 1 and k 2 values of D15N-hCT at neutral condition are larger than those of hCT at pH 7.5 (k 1 = 2.79 × 10−6s−1, ak 2 = 1.34 × 10−4 s−1) (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). Fig. 8 A summarizes the local and the net charges in the central core region of hCT and D15N-hCT at various pH values as compared with their rate constants (Table II) (13Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Google Scholar). The fraction of charged groups is obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for pH using the pK avalues of free amino acids and summarized in Fig. 8 A. Apparently, smaller net charges of Lys18 and His20 side chains (Net*) lead to relatively larger k 2 values. This observation can be rationalized by considering that the side chains of Lys18and His20 are standing in the neighborhood of the β-strand structure. It is emphasized from this analysis that this arrangement of two positive charges in one side prevent monomers from associating with the β-sheet (Fig. 8 B) because of repulsive electrostatic interaction. On the other hand, the order ofk 1 values is not correlated to the net charge of the side chains but rather related to the hydrophobic nature of the side chains. It is interesting to note that the absence of the negative charge at the Asn15 does not reduce both thek 1 and k 2 values. It is therefore concluded that the rate of fibril formation does not depend on the favorable electrostatic interaction among the charged side chains. It is stressed that the mutation from Asp15 to Asn15 causes even faster fibril formation at neutral pH. The result supports the evidence that aging-related damage accompanied by such mutation to Asn leads to faster fibril formation (20Orpiszewski J. Benson M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 413-428Google Scholar). It is suggested that the propensity and stability for β-sheet formation increase by the mutation from Asp to Asn. We demonstrate by using D15N-hCT that absence of the negatively charged group in hCT leads to the fibril structure as a mixture of parallel and antiparallel β-sheets. This result demonstrates that the favorable electrostatic interaction among the charged side chains of Asp15, Lys18, and His20 residues or amide nitrogen in hCT plays an important role to determine the direction of the molecular association to form the antiparallel β-sheet structure. It was found that the absence of a negative charge at Asp15 does not reduce the ability of fibril formation, as D15N-hCTs form the amyloid fibrils even faster than hCT does. On the contrary, positively charged side chains of Lys18 and His20 residues standing near the β-strand structure delay the maturation of the fibril formation."

Recently, c-Myc-binding proteins, which bind either to the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal domain of c-Myc, have been proposed as the key molecules to realize the mechanisms of these multiple c-Myc functions. We report in the present study on another protein, Tiam1, which is a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Rac1 and which binds to c-Myc and modulates several of its biological functions. We were able to detect the direct binding and in vivo association between c-Myc and Tiam1. The necessary role in this interaction of the Myc box II of c-Myc was revealed in the cell extracts. The additional discovery of the intranuclear localization of Tiam1 in Rat1 cells and in neuronal cells of the mouse brain suggests this interaction may occur in the nucleus. Overexpression of Tiam1 repressed the luciferase activity of c-Myc and also inhibited the c-Myc apoptotic activity through this protein-protein interaction. Taken together, we concluded that Tiam1 is another c-Myc regulator, working in the nuclei to control c-Myc-related apoptosis.

The c-Myc gene was discovered as the cellular homologue of the retroviral v-Myc oncogene and has been proven to have a crucial role in various pathological and physiological events in cellular biology. In human cancers, alterations of the c-Myc gene have in fact been reported, which have included chromosomal translocation, point mutation, gene amplification, and heterotopic expression (1Cole M.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the levels of c-Myc oncoprotein increase and remain elevated in normal cells that have been induced to divide, indicating it is required throughout the cell cycle for proliferation. Deregulated c-Myc expression is asserted to be sufficient to drive quiescent cells into the S phase to prevent cell cycle exit (2Steiner P. Philipp A. Lukas J. Godden-Kent D. Pagano M. Mittnacht S.

Previous studies have revealed one of these actions is through the modulation of transcription of various genes, i.e. c-Myc recognizes the E-box sequence in the genome together with Max as a partner and activates transcription. In this case the C-terminal basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (B-HLH-LZ) 1The abbreviations used are: B, basic; HLH, helix-loop-helix; LZ, leucine zipper; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MB, Myc box; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild-type domain of c Myc mediates binding to a specific area of DNA. c-Myc also interacts directly with a wide variety of other proteins through this C-terminal B-HLH-LZ domain.

In addition, the C-terminal domain of c-Myc binds to other transcription factors, TFII-I, YY1, and AP-2, which regulate the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of c-Myc (reviewed in Ref. 6Sakamuro D. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2942-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-terminal domain of c-Myc (amino acids (aa) 1–144) has both transcriptional activation and repression activities. This domain contains two evolutionarily conserved regions termed Myc box (MB) I (aa 47–62) and MB II (aa 106–143). A c-Myc mutant deleted within MB I has been shown to diminish Myc-mediated transactivation (7MacGregor D. Li L.H. Ziff E.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MB II has been reported to mediate several functions, including transformation, induction of apoptosis, blocking differentiation, and transcriptional repression (8Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 9Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C.

These studies show MB II is a crucial domain for diverse c-Myc functions. Along these lines, there is a growing interest in c-Myc-binding proteins to realize the mechanisms of multiple c-Myc functions. In this paper, we report on Tiam1, which has been already reported as a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1, a Rho family p21 low molecular weight G protein, which also binds to c-Myc (14Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Tiam1 can modify actin cytoskeleton and cell migration, and can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade through activating Rac1. Although some papers have recently reported that Tiam1 or Rac1 is also related to apoptosis, both these proteins show various effects for apoptosis depending on the cell type (15–26). As far as we know, no previous paper has ever addressed a potential interaction between Tiam1 and c-Myc. We here report the direct interaction between c-Myc and Tiam1, and the negative regulation of Tiam1 of c-Myc transactivation and its apoptosis activity. This interaction with c-Myc may provide a new facet of Tiam1, demonstrating various unexpected functions. A full-length human c-Myc was cloned in pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences), and that with a flag epitope at the C terminus was cloned in pCS2+ (provided by D. Turner, Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) for transfection into 293T cells. Full-length human Tiam1 cDNA (a gift from K. Nakaya, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan) was generated as described (15Kawazoe N. Watabe M. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and cloned into pCS2+. Deletion mutants of c-Myc (1–142, 1–128, 129–439, and 143–355; these numbers refer to the amino acids included in the encoded c-Myc protein) and those of Tiam1 (C1199, C682, and N392; nomenclature refers to the number of C-terminal or N-terminal amino acids of the encoded Tiam1 proteins) were generated by two-step PCR mutagenesis, as previously described (27Otsuki Y.

Tiam1(N392) was tagged by hemagglutinin (HA) at the C terminus. Plasmids encoding c-DNAs of human β-Pix CH domain deleted mutant and human Vav1 were gifts from T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan) and M. Shibuya (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Oncogenic Vav1 was generated by two-step PCR mutagenesis (28Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (N17Rac1), tagged with HA and cloned into pCS2+, was provided by B. J. Mayer (University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT) (29Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies for the HA epitope tag, c-Myc, and nucleoporin p62 were from Berkeley Antibody (Richmond, CA), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. The monoclonal antibodies for the flag tag and β-tubulin were from Sigma. The polyclonal antibodies for Tiam1(C-16) and Tiam1(N-15) (Tiam1C and Tiam1N, respectively) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The polyclonal antibody anti-c-Myc was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated or unconjugated with alkaline phosphatase and TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO (Copenhagen, Denmark). Rat1/CM cells were kindly supplied by Y. Kuchino (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan) (30Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 293T human embryonal kidney cells and Rat1 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat-1/CM cells were maintained as previously described (30Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For transient expression assays, 293T cells were transfected with a maximum of 5 μg of plasmid DNA/6-cm diameter dish by a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with concurrent treatment with 25 μm chloroquine, essentially as described previously (27Otsuki Y. Tanaka M. Yoshii S. Kawazoe N. Nakaya K. Sugimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 293T cells and Rat1 cells were also transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with a maximum of 3.5 μg of plasmid DNA/3.5-cm diameter dish. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. To monitor the effect of fibronectin on the interaction of the following molecules, we harvested Rat1 and Rat1/CM after 20 or 50 min after their placement on fibronectin-coated dishes with a diameter of 6.0 cm. Cell lysates were prepared using protease inhibitors in TXB buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100). Whole brain tissue from 5-week-old ICR mice was also lysed in TXB buffer with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at 4 °C. To purify the protein, 1 μg of monoclonal or affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was incubated with 500 μl of cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C and precipitated with protein G-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with TXB buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (27Otsuki Y. Tanaka M. Yoshii S. Kawazoe N. Nakaya K. Sugimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 293T cells lysates transiently expressing Tiam1 and its deletion mutants were prepared as described above. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Myc, GST deletion mutants of c-Myc, and GST were purified from Escherichia coli transformed with wild-type and deletion mutants of c-Myc cloned into pGEX-4T3 and pGEX-4T3 alone, incubated, and analyzed as described in Ref. 31Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Wang D.Y. Guo R.J. Zhu Y. Takeda R. Hanai H. Kaneko E. Sugimura H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5680-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar. The proteins of Tiam1(FL) and Tiam1(N392) were produced in in vitro reticulocyte lysate, by TnT quick-coupled translation/transcription systems (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the instructions from the manufacturer, and incubated with wild-type and deletion mutants of GST-c-Myc, and GST alone as described above. The solution was purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), separated by SDS-PAGE. The results were visualized and quantitated with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (BAS1000, Fuji). The purification of the nuclei and cytoplasm from Rat1 cells and Rat1/CM cells was carried out as described (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Whole brain tissue from 5-week-old ICR mice was fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm thickness) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain. An immunohistochemical study was with the Histofine Simple Stain PO (multi) kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Antigen retrieval was achieved with trypsin digestion. The primary antibodies used are described under “Results.” For immunohistochemical analysis, cells were plated on uncoated slides or fibronectin-coated slides (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30, 50, 70, or 90 min, and fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C, and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were preincubated in 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min and incubated with an anti-Tiam1 (Tiam1N) antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. The cells were then rinsed in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were further incubated with a TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were examined with an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). 293T cells in a 3.5-cm dish were transiently transfected with 0.02 μg of pRL-TK (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan), 1 μg of p4x(WT)E-SVP-Luc (a gift from H. Ariga, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan), and various plasmids described under “Results” using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared and the luciferase activity caused by the reporter plasmid was determined by using the Pica Gene dual kit (Toyo Ink). To induce apoptosis in Rat-1 cells and their transfectants, 2 days after transfection, the cells were seeded 24 h before serum deprivation and then transferred to medium containing 0.3% FBS unless otherwise indicated, after treatment or no treatment of transient transfection. The cells were judged to be apoptotic when they were nonadherent and showed typical nuclear changes (definite chromatin condensation and/or nuclear fragmentation) (30Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K.

After photography, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C. The cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and observed as described in Ref. 33Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Fujiyama T. Kataoka H. Arai H. Hanai H. Sugimura H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6796-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. We explored the binding between c-Myc and a GEF of Rac1, Tiam1. First, to determine the location of the Tiam1 binding site in the c-Myc protein, we made truncated c-Myc cDNA constructs (Fig. 1 a). Bacterially extracted GST fusioned wild-type (WT) and the truncated form of c-Myc, which were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads, were incubated with the cell lysate of Tiam1(WT)-transfected 293T cells. In this in vitrocondition, Tiam1(WT) could associate with some of these c-Myc constructs that contain the intact N-terminal MB II domain (Fig. 2 a). We also prepared truncated Tiam1 cDNA constructs to determine the c-Myc-binding region in Tiam1 (Fig. 1 b). GST-c-Myc(WT) extracted from bacteria could associate only to the WT and N392 (aa 1–392) truncated mutants of Tiam1, but not to the C1199 and C682 mutants in the in vitro condition described above (Fig. 2 b). These observations imply that MB II in the N-terminal domain of c-Myc and N-terminal 1–392 amino acids of Tiam1 may be the principal regions for binding in vitro with each other.Figure 2c-Myc specifically associates with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1. A, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Tiam1(WT) construct. Bacterially purified GST-fusioned wild-type and truncated c-Mycs were incubated with the 293T cell lysates and affinity-precipitated (AP) by glutathione beads, according to the in vitro binding assay. Bound proteins were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-Tiam1C (lanes 1–6), which reacted with epitopes located at the C terminus of Tiam1. GST fusion proteins are shown at thebottom. 293T cell total lysates are shown in lane 7. B, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Tiam1(WT), Tiam1(C1199), Tiam1(C682), and HA-tagged Tiam1(N392) constructs. Bacterially purified GST-fusioned wild-type c-Myc was incubated with the 293T cell lysates, according to the in vitro binding assay. Bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Tiam1C (lanes 1–3) and anti-HA (lane 4). GST-c-Myc is shown at theright. Expressions of Tiam1s are shown at the bottom. C, 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid encoding flag-tagged c-Myc together with Tiam1(WT) construct. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Tiam1C and anti-flag, and immunoblotted with anti-flag and anti-Tiam1C, respectively. Expression of c-Myc and Tiam1 is shown at the bottom. D, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Tiam1(WT) and -(C1199), and plasmid encoding HA-tagged Vav1 and β-Pix Pix CH domain deleted mutant together with c-Myc(WT) construct. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc, and immunoblotted with anti-HA and Tiam1C. Expression of c-Myc and Tiam1 are shown at thebottom. E, bacterially purified GST-fusioned wild-type and truncated c-Mycs were incubated with Tiam1(N392) translated and transcribed in vitro. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by imaging analyzer (BAS 1000; Fuji) (lanes 1–3). Lane 4 was the expression of Tiam1s. GST fusion proteins are shown at the bottom. F, whole brains of ICR mice were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Tiam1C antibody, preimmune rabbit immunoglobulin, and anti-Myc (polyclonal) antibody. Precipitants were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. These experiments were performed at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined the Tiam1 association with c-Myc under another condition. Coexpression and coprecipitation analyses in 293T cells revealed that immunoprecipitated Tiam1(WT) could associate to c-Myc(WT) tightly in vivo, but not to the aa 143–355 truncated mutant of c-Myc, which could not associate to Tiam1(WT) in vitro(Fig. 2 c). Conversely, immunoprecipitated c-Myc(WT) could also associate to Tiam1(WT), but c-Myc(143–355) could not (Fig. 2 c). Then we were interested in whether the other Rac1-GEFs, including α-Pix and Vav1, could associate to c-Myc in vivo. Immunoprecipitated c-Myc(WT) overexpressed in 293T cells could specifically associate to Tiam1(WT), but not to the C1199 truncated mutant of Tiam1, other Rac1-GEFs and their mutants; the wild-type Vav1 and CH domain truncated α-Pix (Fig. 2 d). Next we tested the direct binding between Tiam1 and c-Myc by thein vitro translation and transcription reticulocyte lysate system (described under “Materials and Methods”). GST-fusioned c-Myc(WT) could directly bind to in vitro transcribed Tiam1(N392) constructs, but GST fusion mutated c-Myc(143–355) and GST alone could not directly bind them (Fig. 2 e). Among native mouse tissues, Tiam1 has been reported to be highly expressed in the brain and the testis (14Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The expression of c-Myc is also reported to be detected in the mouse brain and to be enhanced by methamphetamine-induced apoptotic processes in neurons (34Thiriet N. Jayanthi S. McCoy M. Ladenheim B. Lud Cadet J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the protein extracted from mouse brain, c-Myc was coprecipitated with immunoprecipitated Tiam1 by the specific Tiam1 antibody but was not coprecipitated by preimmune rabbit immunoglobulins (Fig. 2 f). Despite the weak expression of c-Myc in the brain, we believe we could prove the considerable interaction between c-Myc and Tiam1 in the mouse brain. We next attempted to investigate the intracellular location of both proteins. A transcription factor c-Myc is known to be present in the nucleus (34Thiriet N. Jayanthi S. McCoy M. Ladenheim B. Lud Cadet J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We tested whether Tiam1 is mainly present in the same location as c-Myc. First, we applied the immunohistochemical technique for the mouse brain tissue in which c-Myc and Tiam1 associated with each other (Fig. 2 f). As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of c-Myc was mainly and diffusely located at the nucleus of the cerebral neuronal cells in the cortex and the basal ganglia by the c-Myc-specific antibody. The immunoreactivity of Tiam1 was also demonstrated in the nuclei of cerebral neuronal cells, but only in those of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and dentate nucleus (Fig. 3). That immunoreactivity disappeared by absorption with peptide used as the immunogen for the Tiam1-specific antibody (Fig. 3). Previously, several investigators including us reported that an F-actin-containing membrane ruffle was observed at 15 min after stimulation (adherence of Rat-1 fibroblasts to the extracellular matrix, fibronectin) and a Tiam1 localization on that membrane ruffle was detected (27Otsuki Y. Tanaka M. Yoshii S. Kawazoe N. Nakaya K. Sugimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 35Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). When Rat-1 cells cultured on uncoated slides were analyzed, we found that endogenous Tiam1 was demonstrated in the nucleus, but endogenous c-Myc was barely detectable by immunofluorescence with the specific antibody (Fig. 4, a and b). On the other hand, both endogenous Tiam1 and stably transfected c-Myc were detected clearly and abundantly in the nucleus, when Rat-1/CM (Rat-1 cells stably transfected with c-Myc), were used in the same conditions as Rat-1 cells (Fig. 4, d and e). A negative control against anti-Tiam1 antibody using preimmune rabbit immunoglobulins as the primary antibody revealed no immunoreactivity in both Rat-1 and Rat-1/CM (Fig. 4, c and f). We next attempted to record the time-course profile of Tiam1 localization in Rat-1 and Rat-1/CM placed on fibronectin-coated slides. In this experiment, we observed immunofluorescence with a specific antibody in these cells after various periods from plating, as described under “Materials and Methods.” In Rat1 cells, endogenous Tiam1 was localized both in the nucleus and in the cell membrane ruffle at 30, 50, and 70 min after cells were placed on fibronectin (Fig. 4,g–i). However, by 90 min, endogenous Tiam1 gradually localized in the nucleus and disappeared from the membrane ruffle (Fig. 4 j). In the case of Rat-1/CM, endogenous Tiam1 was also localized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasmic membrane ruffle at 50 and 70 min, and mainly in the nucleus but not in the membrane ruffle at 90 min after plating (Fig. 4, l–n). In Rat-1/CM, granular expression of endogenous Tiam1 in cytoplasm was detected but was weak in nucleus for the first 30 min (Fig. 4 k). During the course of these experiments, c-Myc expression was constantly detected in the nucleus in Rat-1/CM (data not shown). The influence of fibronectin stimulation on the interaction between c-Myc and Tiam1 was examined using a time-course experiment as described under “Materials and Methods.” The in vivobinding between Tiam1 and c-Myc in Rat1/CM cells was detected at 50 min (Fig. 4 p, lane 2) but not at 20 min (Fig. 4 p, lane 1) after the plating on fibronectin. To confirm these results, we examined and checked the intracellular localization of both Tiam1 and c-Myc in Rat-1 and Rat-1/CM by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting. We could also detect Tiam1 expression in the nuclear fraction, but weakly in the cytoplasmic fraction in both Rat-1 and Rat-1/CM (Fig. 4 o). In contrast, c-Myc expression of Rat-1/CM was detected only in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4 o, lane 1). In Rat-1 cells, endogenous c-Myc was not detected by this method (Fig. 4 o,lanes 4–6). In addition, stably overexpressed c-Myc did not affect the location of endogenous Tiam1 in Rat-1 cells in this subcellular fractionation assay. Tiam1 represses the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. To determine whether the association with Tiam1 affects the transcription properties of c-Myc, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors harboring c-Myc and Tiam1 together with the reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene linked to the tetramerized E-box sequence (4XE) followed by the SV40 promoter, using a cationic lipid (36Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). First, we examined the single luciferase activity of c-Myc or Tiam1. As shown in Fig. 5 a, c-Myc stimulated the E-box-dependent luciferase activity. The relative luciferase activity of c-Myc is ∼3 times that of pCS2 mock control vector (Fig. 5 a, lane 3). On the other hand, Tiam1 showed no effect on the luciferase activity by transfection of Tiam1 with the reporter plasmid (Fig. 5 a,lane 4). We next checked the influence of Tiam1 toward c-Myc luciferase activity. When 293T cells were transfected with c Myc, pCS2 mock control vector and reporter plasmid, the luciferase activity was stimulated (Fig. 5 b, lane 2), whereas the mock vector alone showed no effect on that activity (Fig. 5 b, lane 1). The luciferase activity was enhanced by c-Myc, and was repressed by co-transfection of Tiam1 with c-Myc and the reporter plasmid, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 b, lanes 4 and 5). Co-expression of N17Rac1, a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, under the same conditions as in Fig. 5 b (lane 4) had no Tiam1-mediated suppression of the transcriptional activity of c-Myc (Fig. 5 b, lane 3). In the case of Tiam1(C682), Vav1, and oncogenic Vav1, which is constitutive active mutant of Vav1, none of these constructs showed any effect on the c-Myc-enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 5 b,lanes 6–8). Because the Tiam1 deletion mutant (C682), which could not associate with c-Myc, did not affect the luciferase activity in this experimental system, and because another Rac1-GEF (here Vav1) did not, either, the repression activity of Tiam1 that we observed here is dependent on its binding capability to c-Myc and may be specific to Tiam1. As mentioned above, c-Myc has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis in certain settings. To clarify the effect of Tiam1 on the apoptotic activity of c-Myc, we used Rat-1 cells and Rat-1/CM cells, which were stably expressed with c-Myc. In this experimental system, Rat-1/CM causes c-Myc-related apoptosis in a serum-deprived cultured medium (30Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Beforehand, we checked the ratio of apoptotic cells in Rat-1 and Rat-1/CM. As previously reported, both Rat-1 and Rat-1/CM were cultured in 10 or 0.3% FBS-containing medium for 24 h, respectively (30Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and we counted cells with apoptotic phenotypes. When Rat 1/CM were harvested in 10 and 0.3% FBS, approximately 8 and 46% cells showed apoptotic phenotypes, respectively (Fig. 6 a,lanes 3 and 4). Rat-1 in 10% FBS grew normally and showed the low apoptotic ratio (Fig. 6 a,lane 1). Rat-1 in 0.3% FBS exhibited a ratio of ∼14% apoptotic cells (Fig. 6 a, lane 2). These results showed c-Myc-induced apoptosis is related to"
https://openalex.org/W2172125676,"The goal of this study was to provide structural information about the regulatory domains of double-headed smooth muscle heavy meromyosin, including the N terminus of the regulatory light chain, in both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states. We extended our previous photo-cross-linking studies (Wu, X., Clack, B. A., Zhi, G., Stull, J. T., and Cremo, C. R. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20328–20335) to determine regions of the regulatory light chain that are cross-linked by a cross-linker attached to Cys108 on the partner regulatory light chain. For this purpose, we have synthesized two new biotinylated sulfhydryl reactive photo-cross-linking reagents, benzophenone, 4-(N-iodoacetamido)-4′-(N-biotinylamido) and benzophenone, 4-(N-maleimido)-4′-(N-biotinylamido). Cross-linked peptides were purified by avidin affinity chromatography and characterized by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry. Labeled Cys108 from one regulatory light chain cross-linked to71GMMSEAPGPIN81, a loop in the N-terminal half of the regulatory light chain, and to4RAKAKTTKKRPQR16, a region for which there is no atomic resolution data. Both cross-links were to the partner regulatory light chain and occurred in unphosphorylated but not phosphorylated heavy meromyosin. Using these data, data from our previous study, and atomic coordinates from various myosin isoforms, we have constructed a structural model of the regulatory domain in an unphosphorylated double-headed molecule that predicts the general location of the N terminus. The implications for the structural basis of the phosphorylation-mediated regulatory mechanism are discussed. The goal of this study was to provide structural information about the regulatory domains of double-headed smooth muscle heavy meromyosin, including the N terminus of the regulatory light chain, in both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states. We extended our previous photo-cross-linking studies (Wu, X., Clack, B. A., Zhi, G., Stull, J. T., and Cremo, C. R. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20328–20335) to determine regions of the regulatory light chain that are cross-linked by a cross-linker attached to Cys108 on the partner regulatory light chain. For this purpose, we have synthesized two new biotinylated sulfhydryl reactive photo-cross-linking reagents, benzophenone, 4-(N-iodoacetamido)-4′-(N-biotinylamido) and benzophenone, 4-(N-maleimido)-4′-(N-biotinylamido). Cross-linked peptides were purified by avidin affinity chromatography and characterized by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry.

Novel Sensors of the Regulatory Switch on the Regulatory Light Chain of Smooth Muscle MyosinJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 38PreviewSmooth muscle myosin can be switched on by phosphorylation of Ser-19 of the regulatory light chain. Our previous photocross-linking results suggested that an element of the structural mechanism for the regulatory switch was a phosphorylation-induced motion of the regulatory light chain N terminus (Wahlstrom, J. L., Randall, M. A., Jr., Lawson, J. D., Lyons, D. E., Siems, W. F., Crouch, G. J., Barr, R., Facemyer, K. C., and Cremo, C. R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5123-5131). Here we used three different approaches to test this notion, which are reactivity of cysteine thiols, pyrene and acrylodan spectral analysis, and pyrene fluorescence quenching.

The RLC is a subunit of the two head domains (S1) with each S1 containing one motor domain, ELC and RLC. The two S1 domains are attached to a long α-helical coiled-coil domain (tail or rod). The regulatory domain is defined as an RLC and ELC attached to the portion of the heavy chain to which they bind. The unphosphorylated forms of these regulated myosins have low ATPase activity and are unable to move actin filaments, whereas the phosphorylated forms are activated in both respects. Domain requirements for regulation have been elucidated through studies of various proteolytic and expressed subfragments of SMM. HMM, which lacks the C-terminal two-thirds of the tail, is double-headed and regulated (5Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but expressed HMMs with truncated tails failed to form double-headed structures and were found to be unregulated (6Trybus K.M.

Two motor domains were found to be required for regulation of a nonmuscle myosin (14Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most mutant constructs that have altered regulation, appear to have not only an increased ATPase activity in the unphosphorylated state but a decreased ATPase activity in the phosphorylated state. This suggests that the phosphorylated state does not reflect a simple case in which the inhibitory mechanism inherent to the native unphosphorylated state has been removed. The structural basis of the regulatory mechanism is unknown. There are no crystal structures of double-headed, and therefore, regulated constructs. There are no atomic resolution data for the N terminus of the RLC (residues 1–24), which includes the phosphorylated serine at position 19 (smooth muscle isoform). The N terminus of the RLC is highly conserved in myosins that are regulated by phosphorylation and has been shown to be critical to the regulatory properties of the molecule (15Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R. Matsuura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the mechanism whereby phosphorylation controls the motor ATPase activity is common and important to other isoforms that are only modulated by phosphorylation or that accomplish regulation through Ca2+ binding. For example, a class of mutations found in the β-myosin isoform from cardiomyopathy patients are found clustered near the N terminus of the RLC (16Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R.

Biol. 1998; 453: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and myosin RLC phosphorylation is a key determinant of the stretch activation response in Drosophila muscles (19Tohtong R. Yamashita H. Graham M. Haeberle J. Simcox A. Maughan D. Nature. 1995; 374: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to the ELC turns on molluscan myosins. The Ca2+ ion mediates interactions between the RLC and the ELC in addition to the heavy chain (20Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Science. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar, 21Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Molluscan myosins, like the smooth and nonmuscle isoforms, require two heads for regulation. It is likely that the Ca2+-mediated regulatory mechanism and the phosphorylation-mediated regulatory mechanism will have many structural parallels. The goal of this study was to provide structural information about the regulatory domains of double-headed smooth muscle HMM, including the N terminus of the RLC. In previous work (22Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) we used a photo-cross-linker, BPIA, to label cysteines in a set of single-cysteine mutants of the RLC, exchange the labeled RLC mutants onto native HMM, and compare the ability of the protein to be photo-cross-linked in two states, unphosphorylated, and thiophosphorylated. For A23C, Q15C and Cys108 we found cross-linking between the two RLC but only in the unphosphorylated state. This result means that the cysteine sulfur atoms can approach within ∼8–9 Å of the RLC of the other head, suggesting that they are oriented toward the partner head. For the other mutants, S59C and T134C, no cross-linking was observed for either state suggesting that these residues are probably not oriented toward the surface of the partner head and cannot approach the other head within 8–9 Å at any time. Here we have extended our previous photo-cross-linking studies (22Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to determine sites on one RLC that can be cross-linked by a cross-linker attached to Cys108 of the other RLC. Previously, we used the photo-cross-linker BPIA, but for the present work we have synthesized two new photo-cross-linking reagents, BBPIA and its respective maleimide derivative, which use the same photochemical mechanism as BPIA, but contain a biotin affinity tag to facilitate purification of cross-linked peptides. BBPIA-cross-linked peptides were purified by avidin affinity chromatography and characterized by Edman sequencing and MALDI-MS. BBPIA-labeled Cys108 was found to cross-link to both 71GMMSEAPGPIN81 and to 4RAKAKTTKKRPQR16 of the RLC in smooth u-HMM. Likely targeted residues within these sequences were identified. Both of these cross-links were between the two RLC. Using these data, data from our previous study, and atomic coordinates from various myosin isoforms (21Houdusse A. Cohen C.

The implications for the structural basis of the phosphorylation-mediated regulatory mechanism are discussed. IAA (Sigma) was recrystallized from hexanes before use. Reactions did not proceed smoothly without this precaution. Flash chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (EM Reagents; 230–400 mesh). TLC was performed with aluminum-backed TLC plates (5 × 10 cm; 0.2 mm) coated with silica gel 60 F254 (E. Merck, EM Separations). All reactions were protected from room light. The following is a modification of the method of Gilbert and Rando (25Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8061-8066Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To a solution of biotin (Sigma, free acid, 142 mg, 0.58 mmol), 4,4′-diaminobenzophenone (161 mg, 0.76 mmol), diisopropylethylamine (106 mg, 0.82 mmol), and 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (120 mg, 0.88 mmol) in DMF (5 ml) were added to DCC (134 mg, 0.70 mmol) and stirred for 12 h. The reaction was quenched with H2O (50 ml), and the solution was extracted with n-butanol (3 × 25 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (2 × 20 ml), dried using MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give a tan solid.

Syntheses were performed in a standard 2.0-ml plastic microcentrifuge tube. DCC (12.3 mg, 58 μmol) was added to a solution of recrystallized IAA (Sigma, 16.2 mg, 86 μm) in THF (200 μl), and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0 °C. To this solution was added 1 (10.1 mg, 23 μmol) in DMF (400 μl) and stirred for 30 min. The progress of the reaction was monitored by analytical TLC (MeOH/CCl3(20:80)). The mixture was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was removed, and the product was precipitated by addition of cold H2O (1.5 ml). The precipitated product was dissolved in DMF (400 μl) and precipitated again by adding cold H2O (1.5 ml). The supernatant was removed to give2 (11.8 mg, 86%) as a tan solid.

TheRf was 0.65 on TLC in MeOH/CCl3(20:80). The product reacted with cysteine (pH 8), and the cysteine adduct did not migrate on TLC. All steps were performed in a hood. IAA (17.6 mg, freshly recrystallized) was placed into a tared 3-ml flat-base conical vial equipped with a stir bar. A positive pressure micropipette (Rainin Microman) was used to transfer [3H]IAA (3 mCi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; ∼100–200 mCi mmol−1) from the original vessel to the conical vial with dry THF. THF was removed with a stream of argon. After adding hexanes (250 μl), the vial was warmed to 60 °C with an aluminum block hot plate until the IAA just dissolved. The vial was cooled to room temperature and then placed on ice for 30 min. The mother liquor was removed with a drawn glass pipette, and the crystals were washed with ice-cold hexanes. Crystals were dried overnight under a stream of argon and quantitated by weight. The coupling reaction was carried out as described above. To a solution of 1 (151 mg, 0.34 mmol) in DMF (1.5 ml) was added maleic anhydride (Sigma, 67.2 mg, 0.68 mmol) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Sodium acetate (30.0 mg, 23 μmol) and acetic anhydride (1 ml) were added with stirring for 1 h at 100 °C. The mixture was poured into H2O (50 ml), and the resulting precipitate purified using flash chromatography (CHCl3/MeOH (80:20)) to give3 (105 mg, 59%) as a tan solid; 1H NMR (CD3OD) δ 7.91–7.76 (m, 2H, phenyl), 7.02 (s, 2H, maleimide), 4.50 (dd, J = 4.5, 7.8 Hz, 1H, H-4), 4.32 (dd, J = 4.2, 6.9 Hz, 1H, H-3), 3.22 (ddd,J = 4.9, 6.3, 9.0 Hz, 1H, H-2), 2.95 (dd,J = 4.5, 12.2 Hz, 1H, H-5A), 2.71 (d, J= 12.6 Hz, 1H, H-5B), 2.45 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H, H-α), 1.84 -1.49 (m, 6H, H-δA, H-δB, H-β, H-γ); 13C NMR (DMF-d7) δ 194.5 (PhCOPh), 172.8 (C-10), 170.4 (maleimide-CO), 163.8 (C-2′), 144.8 (phenyl), 137.5 (phenyl), 136.1 (phenyl), 135.7 (alkenyl-H), 132.2 (phenyl), 132.0 (phenyl), 130.9 (phenyl), 126.9 (phenyl), 119.1 (phenyl), 62.5 (C-3), 60.8 (C-4), 56.7 (C-2), 41.1 (C-5), 37.6 (C-α), 29.5 (C-γ), 29.4 (C-δ), 26.3 (C-β); MALDI-MS (M + 1)+ calculated 519.170, found 519.164.

[3H]BBPIA-labeled u-HMM was dialyzed to 10 mmMOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.05 mm DTT, centrifuged (350,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, and filtered through a 0.45-micron filter prior to irradiation. Ten percent of the sample was retained, and 90% was irradiated as described (29Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Samples were lyophilized, dissolved in 6 m GndHCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.5), 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, heated to 50 °C for 30 min, and filtered. RLC-RLC dimers (40 kDa) were separated from uncross-linked RLC and heavy chains by gel filtration in the above buffer (two TSK SW4000 columns (Tosohaas) in series at 0.2 ml/min at 25 °C). The RLC-RLC dimer was identified on SDS gels and by scintillation counting. In experiment 1, RLC-RLC dimer (11.4 nmol) was digested with 6 μg of endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals sequencing grade) for 48 h in 0.1 mGndHCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5) at 34 °C, after which another 6 μg of endoproteinase Asp-N was added and allowed to react at 4 °C for another 48 h. NaCl (0.5 m) was added to the sample prior to loading onto a 1-ml neutravidin column (Pierce) equilibrated in 0.1 m GndHCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with the above buffer and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mm DTT. During this wash, 40–45% of the loaded tritium eluted from the column, as was found for all experiments. Further binding could not be achieved with fresh avidin. Biotinylated peptides were eluted with 70% formic acid as buffers recommended by the manufacturer were ineffective. The sample (2.2 nmol) was lyophilized and applied to a C8 reversed-phase column (Brownlee Aquapore, narrowbore) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O versus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/80% ACN. Radiolabeled peptides (2.4 nmol) eluted over one-third of the gradient. Fractions were lyophilized to near dryness and analyzed by MALDI-MS (Table I).Table IAnalysis of MALDI-MS data from experiment #1#Observed1-aObserved masses from column fractions from experiment 1.
