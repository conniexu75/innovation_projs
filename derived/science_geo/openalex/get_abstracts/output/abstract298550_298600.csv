https://openalex.org/W2029717983,"The electric discharge of Sternopygus macrurus is distinctly different from the discharges of ten sympatric species of electric fish in Guyana, South America. Sternopygus is the first known example of a fish with sexually different electric discharges. Males and females differ in the steady-state frequency of their discharges, and males produce variations in their discharge during courtship. Playback experiments demonstrate that species and sex differences in electric discharges have communicative significance."

https://openalex.org/W2080110133,"A new photoreversible pigment has been isolated from the blue-green alga Tolypothrix tenuis. This pigment bears certain resemblances to phytochrome, except that absorption maxima for the two forms are in the green and red portions of the spectrum instead of the red and far-red. The pigment may control diverse differentiative processes in blue-green algae."
https://openalex.org/W2086930658,"Lunar seismic data from artificial impacts recorded at three Apollo seismometers are interpreted to determine the structure of the moon's interior to a depth of about 100 kilomneters. In the Fra Mauro region of Oceanus Procellarum, the moon has a layered crust 65 kilometers thick. The seismic velocities in the upper 25 kilometers are consistent with those in lunar basalts. Between 25 and 65 kilometers, the nearly constant velocity (6.8 kilometers per second) corresponds to velocities in gabbroic and anorthositic rocks. The apparent velocity is high (about 9 kilometers per second) in the lunar mantle immediately below the crust."
https://openalex.org/W2090927885,"The crystal structure of pyridinium hexaiodopentaargentate, (C(5)H(5)NH) Ag(5)l(6), is unique among those of the halide and chalcogenide solid electrolytes in that face-sharing iodide octahedra as well as face-sharing tetrahedra and face-sharing between octahedra and tetrahedra provide the paths for silver ion transport. There are two formula units in a hexagonal cell, space group P6/mcc (D6h(2)). At -30 degrees C, the lattice constants are a = 11.97 +/- 0.02, c = 7.41 +/- 0.01 A. The structure has three sets of sites for the silver ions. At -30 degrees C two of these sets are apparently filled with the ten silver ions per unit cell, while the third set of tetrahedrally coordinated general positions is empty. Therefore, the conductivity at this temperature is limited by the thermal excitation of the silver ions into the empty tetrahedra."

https://openalex.org/W2041254532,"Polystyrenes with molecular weights up to 44 x 10(6) grams per mole have been characterized by light-scattering and equilibrium ultracentrifugation methods. The Mark-Houwink equation, which relates the molecular weight and the intrinsic viscosity of flexible polymers, can be used only if the measurements are made in a theta solvent at the theta temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2005157469,"The observed linear correlation of surface heat flux in continental regions with the radioactive heat release in the surface rocks is consistent with an exponential depth dependence of the concentration of the heat sources. We suggest that this depth dependence can be explained as an equilibrium distribution of the heat-producing elements in a gravitational field. The eflective mean mass range of the elemental assemblies being differentiated is predicted, and it appears that potassium, uranium, and thorium diffuse upward in ionic complexes with other elements. Similar considerations should apply to the distribution of other elements in the crust and mantle."
https://openalex.org/W1646827516,"Two years ago the first scientific investigations of returned lunar samples were reported at the Apollo 11 Lunar
Science Conference (1). Samples from the first mission to the moon had been in the hands of investigators for 3
months or less, and the picture of the moon that emerged at that time was necessarily restricted in scope. We
learned that Tranquillity Base is underlain
by basaltic rock that erupted onto
the mare surface 3.7 X 10^9 years ago,
rock that is generally similar to terrestrial
basalts but with important differences:
titanium and other refractory
elements are enhanced in abundance,
sodium and other volatile elements are
depleted, and the water content and
oxidation potential o!f the lunar basalt
lava are orders of magnitude lower
than those of analogous terrestrial lavas.
The existence of other types of rock
on the moon was only glimpsed, and
the structure and evolution of the moon
remained a mystery."

To illustrate its potential, the method is applied to a variety of oil pollution topics. Other application are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2053509145,A laboratory model of a lithospheric raft is propelled through a viscous asthenospheric layer with constant velocity of scaled magnitude appropriate to continental drift. The propulsion is due to differential heat concentration in the model oceanic and continental crusts.
https://openalex.org/W2049705106,"Thermodynamic considerations have been applied to data showing that the solubilities of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and helium in water decrease with increasing pressure and depth. When water is saturated with a given gas at 1 atmosphere absolute, the equilibrium partial pressure of the gas at any depth is equal to the partial pressure of that gas if it were contained in a gas column extending from the surface to that particular depth."
