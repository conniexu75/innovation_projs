https://openalex.org/W2052391094,"N-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W) was a slow, tight binding inhibitor of human inducible nitric- oxide synthase (iNOS). The slow onset of inhibition by 1400W showed saturation kinetics with a maximal rate constant of 0.028 s−1 and a binding constant of 2.0 μM. Inhibition was dependent on the cofactor NADPH. L-Arginine was a competitive inhibitor of 1400W binding with a Ks value of 3.0 μM. Inhibited enzyme did not recover activity after 2 h. Thus, 1400W was either an irreversible inhibitor or an extremely slowly reversible inhibitor of human iNOS with a Kd value ≤ 7 nM. In contrast, inhibition of human neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS (eNOS) was relatively weaker, rapidly reversible, and competitive with L-arginine, with Ki values of 2 μM and 50 μM, respectively. Thus, 1400W was at least 5000-fold selective for iNOS versus eNOS. This selectivity was similar to that observed in rat aortic rings, in which 1400W was greater than 1000-fold more potent against rat iNOS than eNOS. Finally, 1400W was greater than 50-fold more potent against iNOS than eNOS in a rat model of endotoxin-induced vascular injury. Thus, the potency and selectivity of 1400W inhibition of iNOS both in vitro and in vivo were far greater than of any previously described iNOS inhibitor.

The amino-terminal A/B domain of this receptor contains a consensus mitogen-activated protein kinase site in a region common to PPARγ1 and -γ2 isoforms. The A/B domain of human PPARγ1 was phosphorylated in vivo, and this was abolished either by mutation of serine 84 to alanine (S84A) or coexpression of a phosphoprotein phosphatase. In vitro, this domain was phosphorylated by ERK2 and JNK, and this was markedly reduced in the S84A mutant. A wild type Gal4-PPARγ(A/B) chimera exhibited weak constitutive transcriptional activity. Remarkably, this was significantly enhanced in the S84A mutant fusion. Ligand-dependent activation by full-length mouse PPARγ2 was also augmented by mutation of the homologous serine in the A/B domain to alanine. The nonphosphorylatable form of PPARγ was also more adipogenic. Thus, phosphorylation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase site in the A/B region of PPARγ inhibits both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transactivation functions. This observation provides a potential mechanism whereby transcriptional activation by PPARγ may be modulated by growth factor or cytokine-stimulated signal transduction pathways involved in adipogenesis.

Adipocyte differentiation is a complex process regulated by extracellular hormone and cytokine stimulation (1Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 697-710Google Scholar). Cultured preadipocyte cell lines differentiate into lipid-laden adipocytes following exposure to insulin, glucocorticoid, and inducers of intracellular cyclic AMP (2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Google Scholar). Conversely, epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorTNFαtumor necrosis factor αPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γmPPARmurine PPARhPPARhuman PPARERestrogen receptorMAPmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKJun NH2-terminal kinaseβ-galβ-galactosidaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDBDDNA binding domainERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase. and transforming growth factor α act via the EGF receptor to inhibit both primary and preadipocyte cell line differentiation (3Luetteke N.C.

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is also a potent inhibitor of differentiation. In addition, this cytokine promotes lipolysis and down-regulates adipocyte-specific gene expression in mature adipocytes (5Torti F.M. Diekmann B. Beutler B. Cerami A. Ringold G.M.

Adipocyte differentiation is driven by the coordinate expression of a range of transcription factors, including C/EBPα, -β, and -δ (7Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar) and ADD1 (8Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Google Scholar), which lead to the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. In addition, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has been shown to be selectively expressed in adipocytes (9Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Google Scholar, 10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar) and to modulate adipocyte-specific gene expression (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar). Alternative splicing generates two receptor isoforms such that mouse PPARγ2 has a 28-residue extension at its amino terminus compared with human PPARγ1. PPARγ2 mRNA is highly expressed in murine adipocyte cell lines (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar), whereas both receptor isoforms are abundant in freshly isolated mouse adipocytes (11Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Google Scholar). The early induction of PPARγ mRNA expression during adipogenesis, combined with the ability of retrovirally overexpressed PPARγ to induce lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes (12Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar), suggests that this receptor plays an important role in preadipocyte differentiation. This notion is strengthened by the observation that specific high affinity ligands for PPARγ including thiazolidinediones (which act as insulin sensitizers in vivo), as well as eicosanoids, promote the differentiation of murine preadipocyte cell lines (13Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar, 14Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

PPARγ is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family. These receptors share a conserved domain structure and modulate gene transcription through two transcription activation mechanisms: a hormone-dependent transcription activation function (AF-2) is located in the carboxyl-terminal hormone-binding domain, whereas the amino-terminal A/B domain contains a ligand-independent activation function (AF-1). Recently, the AF-1 activity of the estrogen receptor (ER), another member of this family, has been shown to be modulated following phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (16Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Google Scholar, 17Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Google Scholar). Three MAP kinase pathways have been identified in mammalian cells. Members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, are activated predominantly by growth factor stimulation via a Ras-dependent signal transduction cascade (18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). In contrast, activity of Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as SAPK) and p38 kinase is increased by exposure of cells to environmental stress or to cytokines including TNFα (19Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Google Scholar, 20Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). In turn, activated MAP kinases have been shown to regulate the activity of specific transcription factors including Elk-1, ATF-2, and c-Jun by phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues in the appropriate context (21Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 are similarly adipogenic but that a truncated receptor in which the amino-terminal domain of PPARγ2 is deleted is a more potent inducer of adipocyte differentiation (12Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar). We noted that NH2-terminal domain of PPARγ contains a consensus MAP kinase site in a region conserved between PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms. Furthermore, we and others (11Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Google Scholar, 22Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Google Scholar) have observed that PPARγ proteins migrate on immunoblots as closely spaced doublets, a pattern suggestive of phosphorylation. In this report we show that this putative MAP kinase site is phosphorylated in vivo and also in vitro by ERK2 and JNK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation significantly inhibits both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by PPARγ. Finally, we show that mutation of this MAP kinase site in PPARγ increases its adipogenic activity. These findings provide a potential pathway by which extracellular hormones and cytokines might regulate adipocyte differentiation by phosphorylation-dependent modulation of PPARγ activity. The GAL4 UAS-TKLUC luciferase reporter contains two copies of the GAL4 17-mer binding site (23Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31157-31161Google Scholar) and the BOSβ-gal and CMVβ-gal reference plasmids have been described previously (23Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31157-31161Google Scholar, 24Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Google Scholar). The GAL4-hPPARγ (A/B) wild type and S84A mutant expression vectors contain residues 1-108 of human PPARγ1 cloned into the EcoRI site of pSG424 (25Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17Google Scholar). These domains were also cloned into pGEX4T for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. pCMV-flag-p38, which contains the Flag epitope between codons 1 and 2 of p38, was obtained from J. Han (Dept. of Immunology, Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). RSV-PP1 is an expression vector encoding protein phosphatase 1α (26Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J. Deng T. Karin M. Shenolikar S. Montminy M. Cell. 1992; 70: 105-114Google Scholar). pSG-CL100 is an expression vector encoding a dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatase (27Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Google Scholar). pSPORT-mPPARγ2 encodes full-length mouse PPARγ2 (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar), and the S112A point mutation was introduced into it by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis. Both PPARγ2 and PPARγ2-SA cDNAs were then subcloned into the SalI site of pCMX. All mutations and ligation junctions were confirmed by sequencing. The acyl-CoA × 3-TK-LUC construct contains three copies of the acyl-CoA oxidase PPAR response element (5′-GATCTGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCA) in pTK-luciferase. For functional studies, JEG-3 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transferred to DMEM plus charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum immediately prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter, receptor expression vector, β-gal expression vector, and phosphatase expression vector where indicated using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 5 μM BRL49653 (in Me2SO) or vehicle control was added 16 h after transfection. Cells were lysed 24 h later, and luciferase and β-gal was measured as described (23Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31157-31161Google Scholar, 28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing-Wiley Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Luciferase values were normalized to β-gal activity and fold activation was calculated. JEG-3 cells, plated on 10-cm plates, were transfected with 30 μg of GAL4-hPPARγ plus 10 μg of PP1 expression vector as indicated. 40 h later cells were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 30 min, followed by a 4-h incubation with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (DuPont NEN). Cells were lysed by a 30-min incubation at 4°C in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaPO4, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 0.2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were cleared by centrifuging at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.Samples were precleared with 10 μl of whole rabbit serum (Cappel) in a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of GAL4 DBD rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4°C. Immune complexes were then precipitated with a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose and washed five times with RIPA buffer. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation of p38 kinase, JEG-3 cells were maintained on 10-cm plates and transfected with pCMV-flag-p38 by a 4-h exposure to calcium phosphate. After 48 h cells were UV irradiated (40 J/m2 for 30 s) and lysed by a 5-min incubation at 4°C in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, 2 mM EGTA, 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM orthovanadate, 2 μM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Flag-p38 was immunoprecipitated by a 1-h incubation of cleared cell lysates with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT) followed by a 1-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer followed by three washes in lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and a further three washes in kinase buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid). Whole cell extracts were prepared from JEG-3 cells transfected with wild type or mutant mPPARγ2 as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Corp.) with anti-PPARγ IgG at a dilution of 1:1000. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, induced with 1 mM isopropylthio-β-D-galactosidase, and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) but not removed from the matrix. Following purification, proteins were resuspended in NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0), and their concentrations were determined. Phosphorylation of 2 μg of GST fusion proteins by ERK2 (New England Biolabs, Bishop's Stortford, UK) or JNK (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Nottingham, UK) were carried out as recommended by the manufacturers. p38 kinase assays were performed with 2 μg of substrate at 30°C for 30 min in kinase buffer containing 18 mM magnesium acetate, 90 μM ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Myelin basic protein (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a control substrate for ERK2, and a GST fusion protein containing a truncated form of activating transcription factor-2 (GST-ATF2, residues 1-96, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Wembley, UK) provided positive controls for JNK and p38. 32P incorporation was determined following SDS-PAGE fractionation. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to check equal loading of GST fusion proteins and autoradiographed. 3T3-L1 cells were made to ectopically express PPARγ2 or PPARγ2-S112A using retroviral gene transduction as described previously (22Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Google Scholar). Infected 3T3-L1 cells were selected in G418 and grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% iron-enriched fetal bovine serum. 2 days after reaching confluency, cells were treated with BRL49653 dissolved in Me2SO or Me2SO alone. After 7 days, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by 10% formalin in phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed once again with phosphate-buffered saline, then stained with 60% filtered Oil Red O stock solution (0.5 g of Oil Red O (Sigma) in 100 of ml isopropanol) for 15 min, washed four times with water, and photographed. Sequence alignment of the amino-terminal A/B region that is common to PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms indicated that a consensus MAP kinase site is conserved between species (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the NH2-terminal region of PPARγ is phosphorylated in vivo, an expression vector encoding the the A/B domain of human PPARγ1 (residues 1-108) fused to the heterologous DBD of GAL4 (residues 1-147) was transfected into JEG-3 cells. Orthophosphate labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against GAL4 revealed that the GAL4 PPARγ(A/B) fusion protein was highly phosphorylated, whereas Gal4 DBD alone was not (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). In comparison, phosphorylation of transfected GAL4 PPARγ(A/B S84A), in which a putative phosphoserine at position 84 has been mutated to alanine (S84A) was markedly reduced (Fig. 1B, lane 4), although this fusion is expressed and even more transcriptionally active than wild type Gal4-PPARγ (A/B) (see below). Furthermore, cotransfection of PP1, an activated form of a serine phosphatase, led to near complete loss of phosphorylation of the wild type PPARγ construct (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 6). Several MAP kinase cascades have been defined, each with a slightly different substrate specificity and activation pathway (21Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Google Scholar). In view of this, we tested the ability of three kinases, ERK2, JNK, and p38, to phosphorylate the isolated A/B domains of wild type and mutant hPPARγ1 expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Purified recombinant ERK2 was able to phosphorylate the wild type GST-PPARγ1 fusion protein (Fig. 2A). This phosphorylation was abolished by mutation of the serine at position 84 in hPPARγ1, which corresponds to the MAP kinase site to alanine (S84A) under conditions in which myelin basic protein was a good substrate for this kinase. Similarly, purified recombinant JNK was also able to phosphorylate wild type GST-PPARγ (A/B) in addition to a control GST-ATF2 fusion protein (Fig. 2B). Mutation of serine 84 to alanine markedly reduced but did not abolish phosphorylation by JNK, suggesting weak phosphorylation of a second kinase site in vitro, which is not phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 1B). Similar experiments have been performed with p38 kinase and phosphorylation of wild type or mutant GST PPARγ was not detected under conditions in which GST-ATF2 was a good substrate for this enzyme (data not shown). These results suggested that phosphorylation of a MAP kinase site by either ERK2 or JNK might regulate the ligand-independent transcriptional activity (AF1) of hPPARγ. Transient transfection assays in JEG-3 cells showed that the A/B domain of hPPARγ acts as a weak, ligand-independent transcriptional activator when fused to the DBD of GAL4 (Fig. 3). Mutation of serine 84 to alanine, which abolished phosphorylation of the GAL4-PPARγ fusion protein (see above and Fig. 1B), markedly enhanced the AF1 transactivation function of the PPARγ A/B domain. Similar results were obtained following transfection of wild type and mutant GAL4-PPARγ fusions in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, coexpression of CL100, the human homologue of murine MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP-1), also augmented the transcriptional activity of wild type Gal4-PPARγ A/B (Fig. 3) but had no effect on the mutant GAL4-PPAR A/B S84A fusion. Thus, two independent paradigms that either prevent (S84A mutation) or reduce (CL-100 coexpression) phosphorylation of the PPARγ A/B domain markedly enhance AF1 activity. In addition to the constitutive AF1 function in the amino-terminal domain, PPARγ also contains a ligand-dependent transcription activation function (AF2). We therefore investigated whether phosphorylation of the MAP kinase site in the A/B domain could influence the ligand-dependent AF2 activity of full-length PPARγ. Because PPARγ is conserved between species and the residues encompassing the amino-terminal MAP kinase site are identical in PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms (Fig. 1A), murine PPARγ2, which is induced specifically during adipocyte differentiation, was used in these studies. Transfection of wild type mPPARγ2 expression vector together with a reporter construct containing three copies of the PPAR-response element from the acyl-CoA oxidase gene and the thiazolidenedione ligand BRL49653 was associated with significant transcriptional activation (Fig. 4). Mutation of the homologous serine within the putative MAP kinase site in mPPARγ2 to alanine (S112A) significantly increased ligand-dependent transactivation to approximately double that of the wild type receptor. These observations indicate that in addition to inhibiting the inherent AF1 activity of PPARγ, phosphorylation of the MAP kinase site within the A/B domain also attenuates ligand-induced transcription activation by this receptor. We next tested whether the enhanced transactivation by PPARγ2-S112A resulted in increased adipogenic activity. Wild type PPARγ2 or PPARγ2-S112A were ectopically expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using a retroviral expression strategy that we have previously described (22Xue J.-C. Schwarz E.J. Chawla A. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1567-1575Google Scholar). In the absence of adipogenic stimulation, confluent preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes at a very low frequency (<1%). Ectopic expression of PPARγ2 resulted in ∼10% adipose conversion, as shown by Oil Red O staining of accumulated intracellular lipid (Fig. 5). This effect is presumably mediated by low levels of an endogenous PPARγ2 ligand, although the possibility that this was a ligand-independent effect of PPARγ overexpression cannot be discounted. Remarkably, ectopic expression of PPARγ2-S112A at levels similar to those of the ectopically expressed wild type PPARγ2 (data not shown) induced adipocyte differentiation much more dramatically. In fact, Fig. 5 shows that the degree of adipocyte differentiation due to ectopic PPARγ2-S112A expression was comparable with that achieved by cells expressing wild type PPARγ and treated with the ligand BRL49653 (50 nM). At this concentration BRL49653 alone is a relatively weak adipogenic stimulus for control cells (13Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar, 15Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Google Scholar, 30Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Google Scholar), resulting in ∼10% adipose conversion. These results show clearly that mutation of the MAP kinase consensus site produces a more adipogenic form of PPARγ2, consistent with the increased transcriptional activity of this mutant receptor. Our studies indicate that a consensus MAP kinase site located within the conserved amino-terminal A/B domains of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 regulates the transcriptional activity of these adipogenic nuclear receptor isoforms. Phosphorylation of this site reduces the inherent transcriptional activity of the AF1 transactivation domain. In addition, ligand-dependent transactivation by the full-length receptor is also inhibited. This observation contrasts with previous studies of the ER showing that MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the amino-terminal A/B domain enhanced the transcriptional activity of this receptor (16Kato S.

Furthermore, the divergent transcriptional effects of phosphorylation in PPARγ versus ER suggest that the different sequences around the consensus MAP kinase site in each A/B domain may also influence the way AF1 activity is modulated. Although the A/B domain sequence motif that we have identified represents a consensus MAP kinase site, we have demonstrated that this residue is amenable to phosphorylation by both ERK2 and JNK. Interestingly, both TNFα and EGF, which are potent inhibitors of adipocyte differentiation (3Luetteke N.C. Lee D.C. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Sandgren E.P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 203-213Google Scholar, 4Serrero G. Mills D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3912-3916Google Scholar, 5Torti F.M. Diekmann B. Beutler B. Cerami A. Ringold G.M.

In addition to enhancing JNK activity, TNFα stimulation has also been reported to activate MAP kinase (31Van Lint J. Agostinis P. Vandervoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25916-25921Google Scholar, 32Vietor I. Schwenger P. Li W. Schlessinger J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18994-18999Google Scholar), and EGF stimulation enhances MAP kinase activity in a variety of cell types (18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). The present work suggests that activation of either pathway could phosphorylate and hence inhibit PPARγ activity, thus contributing to the anti-adipogenic effects of these agents. It is also possible that other signal transduction pathways may be involved. For example, it is interesting to note that adipocyte differentiation is promoted by culture in conditions that raise intracellular cAMP (33Schramm K. Neihof M. Radziwill G. Rommel C. Moelling K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 740-747Google Scholar, 34Whitehurst C.E. Owaki H. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Geppert T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5594-5599Google Scholar), and elevated cAMP levels have been reported to inhibit ERK activity in rat adipocytes (35Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 305-310Google Scholar, 36Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Google Scholar). In some cell types, cAMP-dependent stimulation of protein kinase A leads to direct inhibition of Raf-1, which in turn inhibits EGF-stimulated MAP kinase activity (37Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar). Given the convergence of these pathways, it is tempting to speculate that altered PPARγ phosphorylation might contribute to the abnormal adipogenesis seen in mice harboring a mutant protein kinase A regulatory subunit (38Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamen K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has been shown to regulate the activity of transcription factors by a number of different mechanisms (21Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Google Scholar). Because equal levels of mutant and wild type PPARγ2 were detected in transfected cells (Fig. 4), phosphorylation does not appear to alter PPARγ protein stability, as has been shown for the transcription factor Fos (39Okazaki K. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5048-5059Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the inhibitory effect of NH2-terminal PPARγ phosphorylation is transferable to the heterologous DNA binding domain of GAL4, we also consider it unlikely that phosphorylation alters the ability of PPARγ to bind to DNA. A third possibility is that phosphorylation inhibits the activity of PPARγ by altering receptor interaction with other transcription intermediary proteins. For example, an interaction between the A/B domain of thyroid hormone receptors TRβ2 and TRα1 and TFIIB, which might influence transcription by altering preinitiation complex formation or stability, has recently been described (40Tomura H. Lazar J. Phyllaier M. Nikodem V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5600-5604Google Scholar, 41Hadzic E. Desai-Yajnik V. Helmer E. Guo S. Wu S. Koudinova N. Casanova J. Raaka B. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4507-4517Google Scholar). This raises the possibility of analogous interactions between basal transcription factors and the A/B region of PPARγ that are phosphorylation-sensitive. Alternatively, phosphorylation at this site might influence PPARγ interaction with specific coactivator or corepressor proteins, in the same way that phosphorylation of c-Jun enhances recruitment of the CREB-binding coactivator protein (42Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Google Scholar). Our finding of increased adipogenicity of a PPARγ2 point mutant that is not phosphorylated by ERK and related MAP kinases in its A/B domain strongly suggests that NH2-terminal phosphorylation inhibits the adipogenic activity of the wild type receptor. This also provides a molecular basis for an earlier observation that retroviral expression of NH2-terminally truncated PPARγ2 induces murine preadipocyte differentiation more strongly than its wild type counterpart (12Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar). The precise role of PPARγ phosphorylation in regulation of adipocyte differentiation remains to be elucidated. However, the ability to modulate the activity of this adipogenic transcription factor by altering its phosphorylation state might provide a novel strategy for development of anti-adipogenic therapeutic agents to treat obesity.

To examine the phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in situ, we have generated several polyclonal antibodies that recognize the NR1 subunit only when specific serine residues are phosphorylated. Using these antibodies, we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates serine residues 890 and 896 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates serine residue 897 of the NR1 subunit. Activation of PKC and PKA together lead to the simultaneous phosphorylation of neighboring serine residues 896 and 897. Phosphorylation of serine 890 by PKC results in the dispersion of surface-associated clusters of the NR1 subunit expressed in fibroblasts, while phosphorylation of serine 896 and 897 has no effect on the subcellular distribution of NR1. The PKC-induced redistribution of the NR1 subunit in cells occurs within minutes of serine 890 phosphorylation and reverses upon dephosphorylation. These results demonstrate that PKA and PKC phosphorylate distinct residues within a small region of the NR1 subunit and differentially affect the subcellular distribution of the NR1 subunit.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most rapid excitatory transmission in the central nervous system and play important roles in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neurological disorders (1Hollmann M.

Glutamate receptors have been divided into NMDA 1The abbreviations used are: NMDAN-methyl-D-aspartatePKCprotein kinase CPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePDAphorbol 12,13-diacetateFMOCN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylPBSphosphate-buffered salinePVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMARCKSmyristoylated, alanine-rich, protein kinase C substrate.

Non-NMDA glutamate receptors activate and desensitize rapidly and mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. NMDA receptors are more slowly activated and desensitized and have a high Ca2+ permeability and a voltage-dependent Mg2+ block, two properties thought to underlie use-dependent synaptic plasticity in the brain (1Hollmann M.

Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have recently identified the genes encoding subunits for the NMDA and non-NMDA receptors (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Google Scholar, 2Seeburg P.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 297-303Google Scholar). NMDA receptors consist of two families of homologous subunits, the NR1 and NR2A-D subunits (6Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Google Scholar, 7Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

The differential expression of NR2 subunits in the various regions of the brain may account for the diversity of NMDA receptor subtypes (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Google Scholar). In addition, the NR1 subunit is highly alternatively spliced giving rise to at least seven forms of NR1 (NR1A-G) increasing the potential diversity of NMDA receptors in the brain (12Sugihara H.

Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 383-388Google Scholar). NMDA receptors appear to be regulated by a number of protein kinases and phosphatases. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters have been demonstrated to activate (16Aniksztejn L. Otani S. Ben-Ari Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 500-505Google Scholar, 17Gerber G. Kangrga I.

J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 983-992Google Scholar) neuronal NMDA receptors. In addition, intracellular perfusion of purified PKC into spinal trigeminal neurons potentiates NMDA receptors (20Chen L. Huang L.-Y.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 521-523Google Scholar), and PKC seems to mediate the modulation of NMDA receptors by μ-opioids in these cells (21Chen L. Huang L.-Y.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 319-326Google Scholar). Activation of PKC by phorbol esters can also potentiate recombinant NMDA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes including homomeric NR1 receptors (13Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.V.L.

In addition, recent studies in rat hippocampal neurons have suggested that cAMP-dependent protein kinase can also potentiate NMDA receptors (25Raman I.M. Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 415-421Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that NMDA receptors are directly phosphorylated by protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinases (26Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar, 27Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Google Scholar, 28Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Google Scholar). PKC has been shown to phosphorylate the NR1 subunit in neurons and in heterologous expression systems (26Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar). This phosphorylation occurs on the C terminus of the NR1 subunit, and mutation of four serine residues in the C terminus dramatically reduce PKC phosphorylation of NR1 (26Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar). These four serine residues are all contained within a single exon (C1) which is regulated by alternative splicing of NR1 mRNA (12Sugihara H. Moriyoshi K. Ishii T. Masu M. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 826-832Google Scholar, 13Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.V.L. Uhl G.R. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9359-9363Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of the C1 exon induces the NR1 subunit to cluster into receptor-rich domains associated with the cell surface when expressed in heterologous cells, and PKC phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit disrupts these spontaneous aggregates of the receptor (29Ehlers M.D. Tingley W.G. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 1734-1737Google Scholar). In the present study we have further characterized the phosphorylation of the NR1 protein in vitro and in situ using site-specific mutagenesis and phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. These phosphorylation site-specific antibodies recognize the NR1 protein only when specific serine residues are phosphorylated. We show that in addition to PKC, PKA also phosphorylates the C terminus of NR1. PKC specifically phosphorylates threonine 879 and serines 890 and 896, whereas PKA phosphorylates serine 897. Moreover, only phosphorylation of serine 890 by PKC induces the dispersal of the clusters of the NR1 subunit in fibroblasts, suggesting that PKC and PKA may differentially regulate NR1 subunits in the brain. NR1A cDNA was a generous gift of S. Nakanishi. PKC and the catalytic subunit of PKA were purified from rat brain and bovine heart, respectively, as described (30Woodgett J.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4836-4843Google Scholar, 31Reimann E.R. Behman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 51-55Google Scholar). Other materials were purchased from the following sources: radioisotopes, DuPont NEN; phorbol esters and forskolin, Calbiochem; cellulose TLC (thin layer chromatography) plates and XAR autoradiography film, Kodak; PVDF membrane, Millipore; nitrocellulose membrane, VWR; tissue culture media, sera, and supplies, Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized using Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer using the FastMoc procedures and reagents supplied by the Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems division. Di-tert-butyl-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite, FMOC serine (hydroxyl group not protected), and FMOC threonine (hydroxyl group not protected) were obtained from Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA. At each amino acid position where phosphorylation was desired, the FMOC serine without hydroxyl group protection was substituted using empty cartridges of the same amino acid and the same reaction vessel cycles as would have been used for the normal residue. The N-terminal residue was added as the t-butoxycarbonyl protected amino acid rather than the FMOC derivative so as to avoid the presence of a free amino group in subsequent reactions. A portion of the resin-bound unprotected pre-phosphorylated peptide may be removed at this point to produce the non-phosphorylated peptide by the normal methods of peptide cleavage and deprotection. Resin-bound peptide (330 mg) and a magnetic stir bar were placed in an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer reaction vessel which was modified so that one cap did not have the drainage hole. Into the vessel was placed 1 g of di-tert-butyl-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite and 0.6 g of 1-H-tetrazole for each unprotected serine or threonine in the peptide and 3.7 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide. A normal reaction vessel filter and normal cap were secured on the top of the reaction vessel, and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 3-5 h. When the reaction was complete, the vessel was removed from the magnetic stirrer and inverted over a filter flask. The blank end cap was removed, and the reaction mixture was drained away from the resin. The resin was washed three times with 10-ml portions of N,N-dimethylacetamide and then with three 10-ml portions of diethyl ether and dried overnight under vacuum. The resin-bound intermediate was weighed to confirm weight gain. The blank plug was replaced and the vessel was again placed on the stir plate. To the resin was added 1 ml of t-butylhydroperoxide and 3 ml of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction vessel was resealed, and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 3-5 h. At the end of this time the vessel was inverted over a filter flask, and the oxidation mixture was drained away from the resin. The resin was then washed with three 5-ml portions each of t-amyl alcohol, N,N-dimethylacetamide, once with 5 ml of acetic acid, three times with t-amyl alcohol, and methanol. Finally, the resin was washed with three 10-ml portions of diethyl ether. The rinsed resin was dried under vacuum, still in the same reaction vessel. The dried resin was weighed to confirm weight gain. To the resin-bound phosphopeptide in the reaction vessel was added 9.5 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 0.25 ml of water, 0.25 g of thiocresol, and, in the case of arginine-containing peptides, 0.1 ml of thioanisole. The reaction vessel was sealed and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. After 3 h, the reaction mixture was filtered through a filter flask containing about 100 ml of cold methyl t-butyl ether. The resulting suspension was separated in 50-ml conical tubes. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min; the supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh methyl t-butyl ether. This was repeated three more times. The precipitate was finally dissolved in 200 ml of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid in water, and the clear solution was shell-frozen and lyophilized. The peptide was subsequently purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. TOF MALDI mass spectrometry of the purified peptides were performed using a Kompact MALDI III (Manchester, United Kingdom) in the Middle Atlantic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, located at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The peptides KTSTLASSFKRRR and KFKRRRSSKDTST, corresponding to amino acids 884-895 and amino acids 891-902 of NR1A, respectively, were synthesized as described above. Lysine residues were included in the N-terminal positions of the peptides to facilitate glutaraldehyde coupling to carrier protein, thyroglobulin. During synthesis, FMOC unprotected serine residues (Nova Biochemicals) were included in positions 889, 890, 896, and/or 897. The resulting phosphopeptides were coupled to thyroglobulin and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits, and sera were obtained periodically by Hazleton Research Products. Polyclonal anti-phosphopeptide antibodies were purified from sera by sequential chromatography on Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) columns covalently linked to unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides. Antibodies were eluted from the peptide affinity columns using 100 mM glycine (pH-2.7). Anti-NR1 C-terminal antibodies were described previously (26Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar). Bacterial fusion proteins containing the C-terminal region of NR1A (amino acids 834-938) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of NR1A cDNA (primers 5′-ACCATGGATCCCGAGATCGCCTACAAGCGA-3′ and 5′-ACCATGAATTCCTCAGCTCTCCCTATGACG-3′), subcloning the polymerase chain reaction products into restriction endonuclease sites (BamHI and EcoRI) in the pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen), and transforming BL21 Escherichia coli. Transformed bacteria were grown in 400-ml cultures, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (10 mM), lysed in guanidinium (6 M), and fusion proteins purified on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) in the presence of 8 M urea, and dialyzed against Tris buffered-saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), according to Invitrogen's protocol. For phosphorylation reactions, 1 μg of purified fusion protein was incubated with 20 ng of bovine cardiac PKC and/or 100 ng of rat brain PKA (catalytic subunit), or no kinase, for 30 min at 30°C in 100 μl total volume. Phosphorylation reaction buffer contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 μM ATP, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 5 μg/ml diacylglycerol. 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was included. In most cases, fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 14% polyacrylamide gels and either excised from the gel for phosphopeptide mapping or transferred to PVDF membrane by electrophoresis at 30 V. In some cases, fusion protein was applied directly to nitrocellulose membranes (“slot blots”), using a Bio-Dot SF apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyacrylamide gel fragments containing radiolabeled, phosphorylated NR1 C-terminal fusion protein were incubated with 0.3 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) in 1 ml of 0.4% NH4HCO3 for 20 h at 37°C. After removal of NH4HCO3 by lyophilization, phosphopeptides were resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. The tryptic digests were spotted onto TLC plates (Kodak) and separated by electrophoresis (500 V, horizontal) in the presence of acetic acid/pyridine/H2O, 19:1:89 (v/v), and ascending chromatography in pyridine/butanol/acetic acid/H2O, 15:10:3:12 (32Huganir R.L. Miles K. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6968-6972Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes were fixed in acetic acid/methanol/H2O, 10:25:65 (v/v), blocked (1 h) with 0.5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated (1 h) with primary antibodies (150-500 ng/ml in blocking buffer, washed (5 × 5 min, blocking buffer), and incubated (1 h) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (1:5,000 in blocking buffer; Amersham Corp.). After final washes in Tris-buffered saline (5 × 5 min) membranes were immersed in chemiluminescence detection reagent (DuPont NEN) for 1 min and then exposed to XAR film. Exposure time ranged from 10 s to 10 min. Quail fibroblast (QT-6) cells or human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK) cells were maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2 and passaged every 4-6 days. QT-6 cell medium contained 199 Earles medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). HEK cell medium included minimal essential media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfections, the pRK5 expression vector containing NR1 cDNA was precipitated onto cultured cells by the calcium phosphate method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

After incubation for 8-12 h under 3% CO2, remaining DNA was washed away with fresh media and cells were returned to 5% CO2. For immunocytochemical experiments, cells were immediately replated onto poly-lysine coated glass coverslips. Thirty to forty-five hours after transfection, cells were treated with 100 nM PMA, 20 μM forskolin, or vehicle solution, rinsed in PBS, and either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, or solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and proteins resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels. QT-6 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 6% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS for 1 h. Primary antibody (30 ng/ml) was applied overnight at 4°C in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100, PBS and then washed away with three buffer changes over 30 min. Fluorescein (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibody was applied in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three more washes, cells were immersed in permafluor solution (Immunon) supplemented with 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane (Aldrich) and mounted on glass slides. Fluorescence was visualized and quantified using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. In some cases, 1-2-μm thick optical sections were obtained in the x-y plane by scanning laser confocal microscopy using an argon laser and the Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope system. Excitation was at 488 nm, and emissions were taken between 510-515 nm. Confocal images were retained using COMOS version 6.03 software (Bio-Rad) and processed with Adobe Photoshop and ClarisDraw software. The hippocampi of 6-8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected and chilled in ice-cold ACSF solution (126 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10 mMD-glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2). Thick slices (400 μM) were prepared using a tissue chopper and incubated in an interface chamber for 60 min at room temperature. Eight to ten slices were transferred to a 35-mm diameter dish containing 1 ml of ACSF solution in a humidified 95% O2/5% CO2 gas saturated chamber. After 20 min incubation, slices were treated with 100 nM PMA and 20 μM forskolin for 15 min and then the slices were transferred in 5 ml of ice-cold ACSF solution to wash out the drug. After ACSF solutions were discarded, the slices were sonicated on ice with 1 ml of buffer A (10 mM Na3PO4 (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 50 mM NaF, 10 units/ml trasylol) for 30 s. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. After discarding the supernatant, the membrane pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. In order to identify kinases that directly phosphorylate the NR1 subunit, bacterial fusion proteins containing the C-terminal region of NR1 protein were incubated with purified kinases in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1). Previous results indicated that PKC phosphorylates the NR1 subunit in transfected cells and that mutation of four serine residues (serines 889, 890, 896, and 897) eliminated the majority of PKC phosphorylation (26Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, PKC rapidly phosphorylated the C-terminal region of the NR1 subunit (Fig. 1C), with mutation of serine residues 889, 890, 896, and 897 to alanine dramatically reducing PKC phosphorylation (data not shown). Interestingly, based on the characterized consensus sequence of PKA substrates (34Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Google Scholar), the C-terminal region of the NR1 subunit also contains a potential site for PKA phosphorylation (serine 897). Indeed, PKA readily phosphorylated the NR1 C-terminal fusion protein (Fig. 1, C and D). Mutation of serine residues 896 and 897 to alanines (S896A, S897A) completely eliminated PKA phosphorylation of the fusion protein (Fig. 1D). In order to characterize PKA phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit, tryptic phosphopeptide map analysis was performed on C-terminal NR1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by PKA and/or PKC, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The phosphorylated NR1 fusion protein was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel, proteolyzed with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic phosphopeptides resolved by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography (see “Experimental Procedures”). PKA phosphorylation of the fusion protein produced phosphopeptides that differed markedly from those produced by PKC phosphorylation (compare Fig. 2, A and B). However, tryptic phosphopeptides generated from fusion protein that had been phosphorylated by both PKA and PKC (Fig. 2C) closely resembled tryptic phosphopeptides of the NR1 subunit isolated from neurons in culture as indicated by the numbered phosphopeptides (compare with Fig. 2 from Ref. 26Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Google Scholar). To associate the tryptic phosphopeptides with specific residues in the NR1 protein, tryptic phosphopeptide maps of mutated NR1 C-terminal fusion proteins were obtained. Conversion of serine residues 896 and 897 in the NR1 fusion protein to alanine residues resulted in tryptic phosphopeptide maps of PKC and PKA phosphorylated fusion protein that lacked phosphopeptides 1,4,4′,6 and 6′ (Fig. 2D). Similarly, phosphopeptide maps of a mutant fusion protein where serine residues 889 and 890 were mutated to an alanine residue lacked phosphopeptides 3, 5, and 8, whereas mutation of threonine 879 to alanine eliminated phosphopeptide 2 (see Table I). Analogous mutants, expressed as full-length recombinant NR1 proteins in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK) cells and phosphorylated in situ, yielded results virtually identical to those seen in vitro (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the majority of NR1 protein phosphorylation occurs on two pairs of serine residues (889-890, 896-897) in the C-terminal region of NR1 (see Fig. 1A). PKC phosphorylates both pairs of serines, whereas PKA phosphorylates only the second pair (896-897). PKC also phosphorylates threonine 879. In an attempt to determine which specific serine residues in the two pairs of serines are phosphorylated by the two kinases, we examined fusion proteins in which individual serines were converted to alanines. However, mutation of individual serines had little effect on phosphorylation of the mutant fusion proteins by PKA and PKC (data not shown) suggesting that both serines in each pair could be phosphorylated by the appropriate enzymes in these mutants. However, we were concerned that these results may not indicate which serine residues are phosphorylated by these kinases in the wild-type NR1 subunit. We therefore turned to phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to examine the physiological phosphorylation sites of NR1.Table IPhosphopeptide identificationMutationsMissing phosphopeptidesS896A, S897A1, 4, 4′, 6, 6′S889A, S890A3, 5, 8T879A2 Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation site-specific antibodies has previously been used to examine the phosphorylation of individual proteins in vivo (35Czernick A.J.

Ito M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 697-709Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to generate phosphorylation site-specific antibodies that would specifically recognize the various phosphorylated forms of the NR1 subunit. Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequence of NR1 surrounding the pairs of serines were synthesized, and the peptides were chemically phosphorylated on serine residues 889, 890, 896, or 897 (see “Experimental Procedures”). These peptides were then used to immunize rabbits, and the resulting antibodies were affinity purified on phosphopeptide affinity columns. The specificity of the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies was characterized using immunoblots of the NR1 fusion protein. Because of its bacterial origin, the fusion protein should have a minimal level of basal phosphorylation. Appropriately, the anti-phosphoserine 890, anti-phosphoserine 896, and anti-phosphoserine 897 antibodies only poorly recognized NR1 fusion protein (Fig. 3, A-C). In contrast, phosphorylation of the NR1 fusion protein with PKA markedly increased its recognition by the anti-phosphoserine 897 antibody (Fig. 3C), whereas phosphorylation of the NR1 fusion protein with PKC markedly increased its recognition by the anti-phosphoserine 890 and anti-phosphoserine 896 antibodies (Fig. 3, A and B). The anti-phosphoserine 889 antibody recognized both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated fusion protein equally well and was not investigated further (data not shown). These results in"

INTRODUCTIONThe primary mechanisms that regulate smooth muscle contraction and relaxation are, respectively, phosphorylation of the regulatory 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) 1The abbreviations used are: MLC2020-kDa myosin light chain8Br-cGMP8-bromo guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphateMLCKmyosin light chain kinaseMLCPmyosin light chain phosphataseMC-LRmicrocystin-LRML-91-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepinePKGprotein kinase G or cGMP-activated kinaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. at Ser-19 by MLC20 kinase (MLCK) and its dephosphorylation by MLC20 phosphatase (MLCP) (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Biochemistry of the Contractile Process in Smooth Muscle. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 2Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Google Scholar). Typically, intracellular Ca2+ levels modulate the MLCK to MLCP activity ratio and ultimately the degree of contractile force because MLCK activity depends on the amount of the Ca2+-calmodulin complex, which itself hinges on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. In many cases, however, the sensitivity of force to Ca2+ can be changed by physiological modulation of the Ca2+ dependence of MLC20 phosphorylation (3Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denney G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1708-1715Google Scholar, 4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Google Scholar) or by other mechanisms such as thin filament disinhibition (5Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Google Scholar, 6Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell Signalling. 1993; 5: 667-686Google Scholar).The nucleotide cyclic GMP has emerged as a potent, physiological second messenger involved in both vasodilator action and failure of vasoconstrictor activity. The neighboring endothelium, endogenous circulating hormones, as well as clinically administered nitrovasodilators all function to widen the lumen of vessels by stimulating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle to produce cGMP (7Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2007-2018Google Scholar). To date, cGMP has been implicated in lowering intracellular Ca2+ (8Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 357: 539-551Google Scholar, 9Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar) and in decreasing sensitivity of the contractile force to Ca2+ (10Pfitzer G. Merkel L. J. Rüegg J.C. Hoffman F. Pflüger. Arch. 1986; 407: 87-91Google Scholar, 11Nishimura J. van Breemen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 929-935Google Scholar). A myriad of Ca2+ lowering mechanisms have since been reportedly shown (see Ref. 9Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar for references): increased Ca2+ sequestration, increased Ca2+ efflux, decreased Ca2+ influx through decreased Ca2+ channel activity and through hyperpolarization via increased K+ channel activity, and decreased Ca2+ release through antagonism of second messenger formation and possibly through phosphorylation of its receptor. In stark contrast, there are currently no proposed mechanisms for the Ca2+ desensitization by cGMP because little research has been carried out on this effect. Still, no one has been able to belittle the significance of force desensitization in the vasodilating effect of cGMP (12Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Pfeifer A. Raeburn D. Giembycz M.A. Airways Smooth Muscle: Biochemical Control of Contraction and Relaxation. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 253-269Google Scholar). In this study, we not only demonstrate a very high affinity for the nonhydrolyzable cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP (8Br-cGMP) to bring about Ca2+ desensitization, but we also provide convincing evidence that cGMP activates MLCP. A short report of our work has appeared previously in abstract form (13Kitazawa T. Lee M. Zhang L. Masuo M. Li L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis study illustrates how nanomolar concentrations of 8Br-cGMP but not 8Br-5′GMP strongly and reversibly reduces the ability of Ca2+ to cause the vascular smooth muscle contractile machinery to generate force in situ. Moreover, it analyzes this effect of 8Br-cGMP to identify which of the contractile or regulatory apparatuses might be altered sufficiently to account for the Ca2+ desensitizing effect.The cGMP-induced desensitization of contractile force to Ca2+ must involve a Ca2+-independent reduction in the MLC20 phosphorylation by cGMP at a given Ca2+ level and/or a change to some MLC20 phosphorylation-independent regulatory mechanism(s). An example of the latter could be a cGMP-induced increase in inhibition of actomyosin ATPase by the thin filament-associated proteins caldesmon and calponin (5Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Google Scholar, 6Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell Signalling. 1993; 5: 667-686Google Scholar, 19Itoh T. Suzuki A. Watanabe Y. Mino T. Naka M. Tanaka T. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20400-20403Google Scholar). However, because 8Br-cGMP does not appear to change the steady state relationship between phosphorylation and force (Fig. 3C), it is reasonable to exclude a significant involvement of such phosphorylation-independent mechanisms. In this tissue, it appears that the Ca2+ desensitization of force by 8Br-cGMP is mainly mediated through Ca2+-independent decreases in phosphorylation at MLC20. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of more complicated mechanisms of Ca2+ desensitization of force by cGMP during the nonsteady state phases of contraction and relaxation.With that in mind, we set out to establish whether cGMP causes inactivation of MLCK, activation of MLCP, or some combination thereof. It is well known that in vitro phosphorylation of MLCK at its site A by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II inactivates MLCK by decreasing the affinity of MLCK for Ca2+-calmodulin (20Stull J.T. Hsu L.-C. Tansey M.G. Kamm K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16683-16690Google Scholar). Hence phosphorylation at site A by any of the above mentioned kinases would cause a lower than normal MLC20 phosphorylation at a given Ca2+ level. Not surprisingly, it had been proposed that the cGMP-activated kinase (PKG) phosphorylates MLCK and accounts for the Ca2+ desensitizing effect of cGMP. Direct phosphorylation of MLCK by PKG does indeed occur in vitro but not at site A; furthermore, this phosphorylation does not modify the activity of MLCK (21Nishikawa M. Shirakawa S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8978-8983Google Scholar, 22Hathaway D.R. Konicki M.V. Coolican S.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1985; 17: 841-850Google Scholar). Thus from the biochemical studies, it seems that cGMP is not capable of affecting MLCK activity through its protein kinase PKG. Still, the biochemical research on isolated MLCK could not provide any useful information to evaluate whether an indirect inhibition of MLCK by cGMP occurred. Our experiment, however, involving virtually complete elimination of MLCP activity (Fig. 4, A and B) lends physiological support to the idea that MLCK is unaffected by cGMP. 8Br-cGMP did not change the activity of MLCK, as evidenced by its ineffectiveness on the phosphorylation rate and rate of development of force. This result was confirmed in two different types of permeabilized preparations using two structurally different selective MLCP inhibitors. We realize that it is conceivable, although unlikely, that our chosen two phosphatase inhibitors MC-LR and calyculin A somehow interfere with the putative ability of PKG to inhibit MLCK, thus hiding such an effect.At this point it now seemed by default that cGMP was exerting Ca2+ desensitization through activation of MLCP. The experiment summarized in Fig. 5 indeed indicates such a mechanism; 8Br-cGMP significantly increased the rates of dephosphorylation and relaxation. The t1/2 for dephosphorylation was 1.4 times greater in the absence of 8Br-cGMP and the t1/2 for relaxation 1.3 times greater. One concern we have, however, is over the inability of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA and the MLCK inhibitor ML-9 to diffuse instantaneously into the permeabilized strips and to abolish the MLCK activity immediately, creating some curiosity as to whether the effect might be even greater under ideal, diffusion-independent conditions.An alternative approach to investigating the cGMP effect is to compare the kinetics of our experimental time courses with what can be predicted from a theoretical model (23Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9307-9310Google Scholar, 24Mitsui T. Kitazawa T. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5842-5848Google Scholar) that is based on the simple two-state phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reaction (Fig. 6; also see below). Our results mentioned above indicated that MLCP activation predominantly accounted for Ca2+ desensitization of the contractile force, but we suspected that diffusion limitations with our Fig. 5 protocol had been decreasing the visibility of such MLCP activation. Additionally, we could not rule out completely the possibility that our Fig. 4 protocol was somehow masking a putative MLCK inhibition by 8Br-cGMP. A comparison of the experimental and theoretical time course kinetics in Fig. 6 addresses those concerns in an ideological manner and suggests that cGMP elicits Ca2+ desensitization of force through a substantial activation of MLCP. A 3.8-fold increase in MLCP activity changed the kinetics of the simulated pCa 6.0-induced phosphorylation in a manner very similar and comparable to how 8Br-cGMP changed the phosphorylation kinetics of actual pCa 6.0-induced contractions. Thus we conclude from experimental results that cGMP creates marked Ca2+ desensitization of contractile force in vascular smooth muscle by activating MLCP. That finding would also imply that MLCP activity in situ under normal physiological conditions is not maximal. It has been interestingly suggested that PKG in pituitary tumor cells stimulates Ca2+- and voltage-activated potassium channels through activation of an okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase (25White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Google Scholar). We suggest that activation of protein phosphatase by cGMP may be a general function in biological systems.In our theoretical model, we made predictions regarding MLC20 phosphorylation based on a single phosphorylation site for MLCK. Although in vitro MLCK can phosphorylate 2 mol/mol of MLC20 (Ser-19 and Thr-18), the rate of phosphorylation at the latter site is much lower than at the former site and their dephosphorylations by MLCP occur at similar rate (26Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Google Scholar), suggesting that only a very small portion of MLC20 is diphosphorylated under physiological conditions. In fact, the extent of phosphorylation is 1 mol/mol or lower in intact smooth muscle (27Barany K. Barany M. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 21-35Google Scholar) and 1.1-1.2 mol/mol in the permeabilized muscle maximally stimulated by Ca2+ ions alone or with GTPγS (15Masuo M. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Kitazawa T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Google Scholar). Additional Thr-18 phosphorylation increases the actin-activated myosin ATPase (26Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Google Scholar) but does not increase the rate of movement of actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay (28Sellers J.R. Barany M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 181-190Google Scholar). Therefore, only one phosphorylation site at MLC20 is enough and appropriate to simulate the time course of MLC20 phosphorylation in our conditions (23Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9307-9310Google Scholar, 24Mitsui T. Kitazawa T. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5842-5848Google Scholar).The time course of force development was similar to that of MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 4), but the relaxation occurred much more slowly than the dephosphorylation (Fig. 5). The relaxation and dephosphorylation rates were somewhat affected by diffusion of EGTA and ML-9, but MLC phosphorylation at 1 min in the Ca2+-free (EGTA 10 mM), ML-9 solution was decreased by 60% in control and by 73% in the presence of 8Br-cGMP, even though force levels in both conditions were reduced only by 3-4% (Fig. 5). These observations are consistent with previous results (29Chatterjee M. Murphy R.A. Science. 1983; 221: 464-466Google Scholar) and can be explained by a slow onset detachment of dephosphorylated cross-bridges (30Hai C.-M. Murphy R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 285-298Google Scholar). Recently, Khromov et al. (31Khromov A. Somlyo A.V. Trentham D.R. Zimmermann B. Somlyo A.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2611-2622Google Scholar) precisely analyzed the biphasic time course of relaxation in permeabilized arterial smooth muscle by photolysis of a caged Ca2+ chelator. They suggested that the initial plateau phase of relaxation followed by an exponential decay may be due to continued cycling of remaining phosphorylated cross-bridges and cooperative cycling of dephosphorylated cross-bridges. It is therefore the length of the plateau phase of relaxation in tonic smooth muscle that may depend inversely upon the MLC dephosphorylation rate. The second exponential decay phase was suggested to be representative of the detachment rate of dephosphorylated cross-bridges, which is independent of the dephosphorylation rate. The time course of relaxation initiated by EGTA and ML-9 in this study was also biphasic (Fig. 5A). 8Br-cGMP reduced the duration of the plateau phase of relaxation but did not significantly affect the subsequent exponential decay. Using the work of Khromov et al. (31Khromov A. Somlyo A.V. Trentham D.R. Zimmermann B. Somlyo A.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2611-2622Google Scholar) to interpret our results shown in Fig. 5, one again concludes that 8Br-cGMP increases the rate of MLC dephosphorylation but does not affect detachment rate of dephosphorylated cross-bridge.The loss of 8Br-cGMP's desensitizing effect in heavily permeabilized, demembranated samples implies that some soluble cytosolic target(s), such as PKG and/or diffusible cofactor(s), mediates that effect in intact and selectively permeabilized fibers, confirming previous work of Pfitzer et al. (10Pfitzer G. Merkel L. J. Rüegg J.C. Hoffman F. Pflüger. Arch. 1986; 407: 87-91Google Scholar). This idea is in agreement with other studies involving cGMP because no known action of cGMP in smooth muscle relaxation has been shown to function independently of PKG (9Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar). One can then reasonably assume from the low nanomolar IC50 of 8Br-cGMP shown in this study that the unknown anticipatory target involved in coupling cGMP to the activation of MLCP is likely PKG. However, because cGMP has also been shown to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (32Shabb J.B. Ng L. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16031-16034Google Scholar), the possibility that high micromolar concentrations of 8Br-cGMP stimulate both PKG and protein kinase A signaling pathways cannot be excluded.The Ca2+ level in smooth muscle is the primary determinant in the phosphorylation of MLC20 and hence in the contraction. The known mechanisms in this tissue for handling cytoplasmic Ca2+ and for modulating Ca2+ sensitivity of the contraction are synergistic and cooperative pathways. Excitatory agonists produce contraction by elevating Ca2+ levels and increasing Ca2+ sensitivity (33Bradley A.B. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 385: 437-448Google Scholar, 34Rembold C.M. Murphy R.A. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 593-603Google Scholar), whereas vasodilating substances cause relaxation by reducing Ca2+ levels and decreasing Ca2+ sensitivity (35Karaki H. Sato K. Ozaki H. Murakami K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 156: 259-266Google Scholar, 36Yanagisawa T. Kawada M. Taira N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 98: 469-482Google Scholar). Furthermore, the excitatory agonists cause Ca2+ sensitization through inhibition of MLCP (23Kitazawa T. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9307-9310Google Scholar, 37Kubota Y. Nomura M. Kamm K.E. Mumby M.C. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262Google Scholar), whereas we have shown in this study that cGMP cause Ca2+ desensitization through activation of MLCP. Thus, nitrovasodilators and the endothelium via production of NO appear to antagonize excitatory agonists in almost every reported mechanism, including a now apparent activation of MLCP versus agonist-induced inhibition of MLCP. INTRODUCTIONThe primary mechanisms that regulate smooth muscle contraction and relaxation are, respectively, phosphorylation of the regulatory 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) 1The abbreviations used are: MLC2020-kDa myosin light chain8Br-cGMP8-bromo guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphateMLCKmyosin light chain kinaseMLCPmyosin light chain phosphataseMC-LRmicrocystin-LRML-91-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepinePKGprotein kinase G or cGMP-activated kinaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. at Ser-19 by MLC20 kinase (MLCK) and its dephosphorylation by MLC20 phosphatase (MLCP) (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Biochemistry of the Contractile Process in Smooth Muscle. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 2Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 299-313Google Scholar). Typically, intracellular Ca2+ levels modulate the MLCK to MLCP activity ratio and ultimately the degree of contractile force because MLCK activity depends on the amount of the Ca2+-calmodulin complex, which itself hinges on cytosolic Ca2+ levels. In many cases, however, the sensitivity of force to Ca2+ can be changed by physiological modulation of the Ca2+ dependence of MLC20 phosphorylation (3Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denney G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1708-1715Google Scholar, 4Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Google Scholar) or by other mechanisms such as thin filament disinhibition (5Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Google Scholar, 6Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. Cell Signalling. 1993; 5: 667-686Google Scholar).The nucleotide cyclic GMP has emerged as a potent, physiological second messenger involved in both vasodilator action and failure of vasoconstrictor activity. The neighboring endothelium, endogenous circulating hormones, as well as clinically administered nitrovasodilators all function to widen the lumen of vessels by stimulating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle to produce cGMP (7Furchgott R.F. Vanhoutte P.M. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2007-2018Google Scholar). To date, cGMP has been implicated in lowering intracellular Ca2+ (8Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 357: 539-551Google Scholar, 9Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar) and in decreasing sensitivity of the contractile force to Ca2+ (10Pfitzer G. Merkel L. J. Rüegg J.C. Hoffman F. Pflüger. Arch. 1986; 407: 87-91Google Scholar, 11Nishimura J. van Breemen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 929-935Google Scholar). A myriad of Ca2+ lowering mechanisms have since been reportedly shown (see Ref. 9Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Google Scholar for references): increased Ca2+ sequestration, increased Ca2+ efflux, decreased Ca2+ influx through decreased Ca2+ channel activity and through hyperpolarization via increased K+ channel activity, and decreased Ca2+ release through antagonism of second messenger formation and possibly through phosphorylation of its receptor. In stark contrast, there are currently no proposed mechanisms for the Ca2+ desensitization by cGMP because little research has been carried out on this effect. Still, no one has been able to belittle the significance of force desensitization in the vasodilating effect of cGMP (12Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Pfeifer A. Raeburn D. Giembycz M.A. Airways Smooth Muscle: Biochemical Control of Contraction and Relaxation. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1994: 253-269Google Scholar). In this study, we not only demonstrate a very high affinity for the nonhydrolyzable cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP (8Br-cGMP) to bring about Ca2+ desensitization, but we also provide convincing evidence that cGMP activates MLCP. A short report of our work has appeared previously in abstract form (13Kitazawa T. Lee M. Zhang L. Masuo M. Li L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70Google Scholar)."

Recent work has suggested that the antidiabetic agents, the thiazolidinediones (TZ), which are also high affinity ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), inhibit leptin expression in rodents. To examine the effects of this class of drug on the leptin gene in adipocytes we performed Northern analysis on primary rat adipocytes cultured in the presence or absence of TZ. TZ reduced leptin mRNA levels by 75%. To determine whether this effect was mediated at the transcriptional level, we isolated 6510 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence of the leptin promoter and studied reporter constructs in primary rat adipocytes and CV-1 cells. Sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of a consensus direct repeat with a 1-base-pair gap site between −3951 and −3939 as well as a consensus CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site between −55 and −47. Our functional analysis in transfected primary rat adipocytes demonstrates that, despite the presence of a canonical direct repeat with a 1-base-pair gap site, TZ alone decreases reporter gene expression of leptin promoter constructs ranging from −6510 to +9 to −65 to +9. In CV-1 cells, which contain endogenous PPARγ, TZ treatment alone had little effect on these constructs. However, TZ treatment did inhibit C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of the leptin promoter. This down-regulation of leptin reporter constructs mapped to a −65 to +9 promoter fragment which binds C/EBPα in gel-mobility shift assays but does not bind PPARγ2 alone or as a heterodimer with 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor. Conversely, the promoter (−5400 to +24 base pairs) of the aP2 gene, another adipocyte-specific gene, was induced 7.3-fold by TZ. Co-transfection with C/EBPα minimally stimulated the aP2 promoter from basal levels but notably blocked activation by TZ. These data indicate that PPARγ and C/EBPα can functionally antagonize each other on at least two separate promoters and that this mechanism may explain the down-regulation of leptin expression by thiazolidinediones. The ob gene product, leptin, is a major hormonal regulator of appetite and fat cell mass.

These data indicate that PPARγ and C/EBPα can functionally antagonize each other on at least two separate promoters and that this mechanism may explain the down-regulation of leptin expression by thiazolidinediones. The identification of the leptin gene product (1Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barono M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Google Scholar) as a major hormonal regulator of appetite and fat cell mass provides a novel paradigm to explore the regulation of a fat-specific gene product which may be influenced by nutritional intake as well as other metabolic mediators. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the leptin gene is down-regulated by fasting (2Frederich R.C. Lollmann B. Hamann A. Napolitano-Rosen A. Kahn B.B. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1658-1663Google Scholar) and up-regulated by obesity (3Maffei M. Fei H. Lee G.H. Dani C. Leroy P. Zhang Y. Proenca R. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6957-6960Google Scholar). Studies on fat cell gene expression have been enhanced by the identification of two specific classes of transcription factors: the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBPCCAAT/enhancer binding proteinPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorRXR9-cis-retinoic acid receptorTZthiazolidinedioneDR+1direct repeat with a 1-base-pair gapPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasekbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)GSTglutathione S-transferase.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar), members of the b-ZIP (basic DNA binding domain and a leucine zipper domain required for dimerization) family and PPARγ, a member of the peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor family of nuclear hormone receptors (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar). The C/EBP isoforms are expressed at high levels in adipocytes and are induced during adipogenesis (7Cao Z. Umek R.M. Mcknight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPα has been demonstrated to play an important role in the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes (8Samuelsson L. Stromberg K. Vikman K. Bjursell G. Enerback S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3787-3793Google Scholar, 9Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. Mcknight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Google Scholar, 10Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Google Scholar) and can convert fibroblasts into adipocytes (11Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Google Scholar). C/EBPβ can also induce adipocyte differentiation (12Yeh W.-C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Google Scholar), possibly by inducing PPARγ (13Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N. Farmer S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Google Scholar), which contains C/EBP sites in its promoter (14Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.-N. Noya D. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Google Scholar). PPARγ isoforms are also potent triggers of the adipocyte differentiation cascade (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar) and can synergize with C/EBPα to promote adipocyte differentiation (15Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar) or the differentiation of myoblasts into adipocytes (16Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPα and PPARγ can bind to the promoters and activate adipose-specific genes such as aP2 (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

From these previous observations logical candidate regulators of the leptin promoter include C/EBP isoforms and PPARγ. Recently, C/EBPα (21He Y. Chen H. Quon M.J. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28887-28891Google Scholar, 22Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S. MacDougald O. Geiman D. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Google Scholar) has been identified as a transactivator of the leptin promoter working through a consensus C/EBP binding site in the proximal leptin promoter. This site mediates activation of the leptin promoter by co-transfected C/EBPα in primary rat adipocytes (21He Y. Chen H. Quon M.J. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28887-28891Google Scholar) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (22Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S. MacDougald O. Geiman D. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Google Scholar). Also, it has been recently established that the administration of the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione, which is a high affinity ligand for the PPARγ isoforms (23Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Google Scholar), down-regulates leptin expression in rodents (24Zhang B. Graziano M.P. Doebber T.W. Leibowitz M.D. WhiteCarrington S. Szalkowski D.M. Hey P.J. Wu M. Cullinan C.A. Bailey P. Lollman B. Frederich R. Flier J.S. Strader C.D. Smith R.G. J. Biol.

These data suggest that unlike other adipose tissue-specific genes such as aP2 and PEPCK, which are up-regulated by PPARγ (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar, 20Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Google Scholar) in the presence of ligand, leptin may in fact be negatively regulated by PPARγ in the presence of its ligand. The PPAR isoforms mediate positive effects on gene expression by binding to the hexamer sequence AGGTCA in a direct repeat formation spaced by 1 nucleotide (26Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Google Scholar, 27Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16114-16121Google Scholar) with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a heterodimer. Both ligands for the PPARs and RXR can activate transcription from this complex (28Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Google Scholar). Recently, a putative ligand for the PPARγ isoform has been identified as a metabolite of prostenoid J2 (29Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Google Scholar, 30Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Google Scholar), which can activate PPARγ in transient transfection assays and as well induce adipocyte differentiation in fibroblasts. In contrast to positive regulation by PPAR isoforms, little is known about negative regulation. The PPARs can down-regulate thyroid hormone-responsive promoters by competing for available RXR (31Juge-Aubry C.E. Gorla-Bajszczak A. Pernin A. Lemberger T. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18117-18122Google Scholar, 32Chu R. Madison L.D. Kopp P. Rao M.S. Jameson J.L. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11593-11597Google Scholar); furthermore, fibrates, which can activate gene expression through PPARs, have been shown to down-regulate the human apolipoprotein A-1 promoter, but the mechanism remains unclear (33Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31012-31018Google Scholar). Whether specific negative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements or crosscompetition between PPARs with other positively acting transcription factors occurs is unknown. Other members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily mediate negative regulation by 1) binding to specific negative response elements, as is the case for the thyroid hormone receptor on a number of specific genes (34Bodenner D.L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Google Scholar); and 3) as recently reported, by competition for limiting co-factors such as CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (43Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Google Scholar). In this paper we examine the role of PPARγ in the regulation of the leptin promoter and demonstrate that, despite the presence of a consensus DR+1 binding site located between −3951 and −3939 of the mouse 5′-flanking sequence, PPARγ2 mediates down-regulation of the leptin promoter by inhibiting C/EBPα-mediated transactivation. This mechanism may explain the down-regulation of leptin expression in rodents by the thiazolidinediones. Adipocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats using the procedure previously described with modifications (44Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Google Scholar). Briefly, epididymal adipose tissue was minced and digested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME)-Ham's F-12 medium (v:v, 1:1) containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington) and 1% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 1 h. The adipocytes were strained through nylon mesh and washed three times with the DME-Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Packed adipocytes (4 ml) were added to 20 ml of DME-Ham's F-12 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the incubation was carried out at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 16 h. Insulin, AD-5075 (5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl-2-hydroxyethoxy-benzyl-2,4-thiazolidinedione) were added to the culture medium, and the incubation was continued for 24 h. Total RNA was prepared from cells using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (45Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Ann. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were quantitated by absorbance at 260 nM. For Northern analyses, 10-μg aliquots of RNA were denatured in formamide/formaldehyde and electrophoresed in formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond™-N membranes (Amersham Corp.) by capillary blotting. Prehybridization and hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA probes (for leptin or aP2) were carried out as described (24Zhang B. Graziano M.P. Doebber T.W. Leibowitz M.D. WhiteCarrington S. Szalkowski D.M. Hey P.J. Wu M. Cullinan C.A. Bailey P. Lollman B. Frederich R. Flier J.S. Strader C.D. Smith R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9455-9459Google Scholar). After washing the membranes, the hybridization signals were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Each time point was repeated at least two times in duplicate. Two overlapping P1 clones (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) representing the mouse leptin gene and 5′ and 3′ sequences were isolated. 6.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence including the transcription start site and TATAA box were identified. The transcription start site was confirmed by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends from adipose tissue. A similar transcription start site has been identified by other investigators (21He Y. Chen H. Quon M.J. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28887-28891Google Scholar, 22Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S. MacDougald O. Geiman D. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Google Scholar). The promoter region was subjected to dideoxy sequencing between −6.51 kb and +9 bp. Leptin promoter-luciferase constructs were created by initially shuttling a BamHI fragment containing 765 bp of the promoter into PGEM 3Z. Subsequently −454 to +9 and −765 to +9 fragments were introduced into the luciferase vector pA3Luc, which contains a trimerized SV40 poly(A) termination to prevent transcriptional readthrough (46Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgeway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Google Scholar, 47Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.H. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280Google Scholar) as KpnI-HindIII and SmaI-HindIII fragments, respectively. The −6510 bp construct was created by excising the region from −454 to −6510 as a KpnI fragment from a genomic subclone and introducing it into the KpnI site of the −454 to +9 construct. The −3821 bp construct was created using an internal HindIII site and a HindIII site in pA3Luc. The −159 to +9 construct was created by XhoI digestion of the −454 construct followed by blunt-ending using Klenow and ligating to the SmaI site of pA3Luc. The −65 to +9 construct was cloned using a similar strategy employing EaeI. Site-directed mutagenesis of the C/EBP site (see below for oligonucleotide sequence) between −55 and −47 was performed in context of the −454 to +9 construct using synthetic oligonucleotides and restriction enzyme selection (48Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-85Google Scholar). The aP2 promoter (−5400 bp to +24) was cloned into the SmaI site of pA3Luc using HincII and SmaI sites. To create the −249 aP2 construct, the parental aP2 plasmid was digested using Ppu101 and HindIII, and the insert was cloned into the SmaI and HindIII sites of pA3Luc. The RSV 180 construct contains 180 bp of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat in pA3Luc. The sequences encompassing the leptin DR+1 (from −3951 to −3939, see below) were inserted as a HindIII fragment either as one or two copies upstream of 109 bp of the thymidine kinase promoter (TK109) in pA3Luc. TK109 pA3Luc was constructed by inserting the TK promoter from PT109 (49Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 702-705Google Scholar) into pA3Luc (a gift of T. Nagaya). All promoter constructs were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids for transfection were prepared using column purification (Qiagen) and were generally subjected to at least two separate plasmid preparations. The MSV rat C/EBPα expression vector was a gift from Alan Friedman (4Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. Mcknight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Google Scholar). An EcoRI-BssHII fragment encompassing the complete C/EBP cDNA sequence was subsequently cloned into PGEM 3Z, pSV-SPORT (BioResearch Laboratories), and pBK-CMV (Stratagene). The mouse PPARγ2 isoform was cloned into pSV-SPORT. All expression vectors were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids for transfection were prepared using column purification (Qiagen) and were generally subjected to at least two separate plasmid preparations. CV-1 and NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin, and amphotericin. Transient transfections were performed in six-well plates with each well receiving 1.67 μg of reporter and 417 ng of expression vector using the calcium phosphate technique. Amount of expression vector DNA was kept constant within experiments using pKCR2 (similar SV40 early promoter to pSV-SPORT). Each well also received 0.4 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid to control for transfection efficiency. 15-18 h after transfection the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% steroid hormone-depleted fetal bovine serum and the indicated concentration of BRL 49653. To remove steroid and thyroid hormones, fetal bovine serum was treated for 24 h at 4°C with 50 mg/ml activated charcoal (Sigma) and 30 mg/ml anion exchange resin (type AGX-8, analytical grade, Bio-Rad). After centrifugation, anion exchange resin was added again for 5 more hours. The resulting fetal bovine serum was spun again and filtered before use. 40-44 h after transfection the cells were harvested in extraction buffer (38Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.-E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Google Scholar) and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (Tropix). Luciferase activity was corrected for β-galactosidase activity as indicated. All points were repeated in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. Primary rat adipocytes were harvested by isolating white adipose tissue cells from epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley rats. Isolated adipocytes were transfected by electroporation as described previously (50Quon M.J. Zarnowski M.J. Guerre-Millo M. de la Luz Sierra M. Taylor S.I. Cushman S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 338-346Google Scholar) with 6 μg of either RSV 180 or leptin promoter luciferase constructs. A β-galactosidase expression vector was not introduced into the primary rat adipocytes. Two hours after transfection Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3.5% bovine serum albumin (final concentration) was added, and the cells were treated with 1 μM BRL 49653 or dimethylsulfoxide carrier alone. 20 h after transfection the cells were harvested for luciferase activity. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test comparing treated groups to dimethylsulfoxide carrier alone. Wild type and mutant overlapping oligonucleotides encompassing the C/EBP site from −67 to −36 (wild type 5′-TGGCCGGACAGTTGCGCAAGTGGCACTGGGG-3′: mutant 5′-TGGCCGGACAGTTGCACGGGTGGCACTGGGG-3′) and the DR+1 site at −3951 kb (wild type 5′-ACGTAGAAGCTTGAAATGAGGTAAAAGGTCAGAGTCCAAGCTT-3′) were radiolabeled by filling in with Klenow and [32P]deoxycytodine triphosphate (3000 μCi/mmol). The −65 to +9 fragment was prepared by BamHI digestion of the pA3Luc reporter construct and was radiolabeled with Klenow. Unincorporated 32P was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and each oligonucleotide was subsequently gel-purified. In vitro-translated C/EBPα, PPARγ2, and RXRα were prepared in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and protein production was analyzed by 35S incorporation and direct visualization on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 3-5 μl of in vitro-translated protein were incubated in 10 μl of binding buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, and 50 mM KCl), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 25 min. Gel-mobility shifts were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized after autoradiography. CV-1 cells were transfected with 15 μg of different C/EBPα expression vectors as described above. Cells were treated in triplicate with either BRL 49653 or dimethylsulfoxide carrier for 18-24 h. Whole cell extracts were generated in 600 μl of RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μl/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mg/ml) and 10 μl/ml sodium orthovanadate (100 mM)). 40 μg of protein from each well was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Primary antibody (C/EBP rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) probing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the secondary antibody specificity was elicited by Amersham ECL. C/EBP-specific bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The b-ZIP region of human C/EBPα was cloned in frame with the glutathione S-transferase moiety in PGEX-2TK (a gift of D.-E. Zhang). The recombinant protein and GST itself were induced in Escherichia coli DH5α at 32°C in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The GST proteins were purified on glutathione- agarose beads (Sigma) as described elsewhere (51Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.-M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Google Scholar) and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Interaction assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST-C/EBP or GST protein alone immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads with 5 μl of 35S-labeled in vitro-translated PPARγ2 or C/EBPα for 2 h in 500 μl of interaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4°C with gentle rocking. The protein-GST beads were washed four times with the same buffer. The resulting bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. In previously reported work (24Zhang B. Graziano M.P. Doebber T.W. Leibowitz M.D. WhiteCarrington S. Szalkowski D.M. Hey P.J. Wu M. Cullinan C.A. Bailey P. Lollman B. Frederich R. Flier J.S. Strader C.D. Smith R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9455-9459Google Scholar) it was demonstrated that the chronic administration of a TZ down-regulates leptin mRNA in rodent models. To confirm that this effect was mediated by a direct effect of TZ on adipocytes, we studied the regulation of leptin gene expression using primary rat adipocytes. In the absence of added insulin, leptin mRNA levels were low and not significantly affected by the TZ agonist AD-5075. The effect of insulin to augment leptin expression (Fig. 1) was consistent with data reported by Saladin et al. (52Saladin R. De Vos P. Guerre-Millo M. Leturque A. Girard J. Staels B. Auwerx J. Nature. 1995; 377: 527-529Google Scholar). In the context of insulin incubation, AD-5075 caused a 75% decrease in leptin mRNA levels (Fig. 1). Similar data on the regulation of leptin mRNA by the thiazolidinediones were seen by Kallen and Lazar in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (25Kallen C.B. Lazar M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5793-5796Google Scholar). Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that this effect was not due to changes in mRNA stability. In contrast to the effects on leptin, TZ stimulated aP2 expression by approximately 2-fold in the absence of insulin and 6-fold in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 1, panel 2). In that TZs are high affinity ligands for PPARγ and that the aP2 promoter contains two positive peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response elements between −5.4 and −4.9 kb (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar), these data indicate that liganded PPARγ has differential effects on aP2 and leptin gene expression. To facilitate our analysis of the transcriptional regulation of leptin we isolated two overlapping P1 clones which include the entire leptin gene as well as 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. Our analysis agrees with other reports concerning the genomic structure and initiation of transcription (21He Y. Chen H. Quon M.J. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28887-28891Google Scholar, 22Hwang C.-S. Mandrup S. MacDougald O. Geiman D. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Google Scholar). We subsequently analyzed the 5′-flanking sequence of the leptin gene. As outlined in Fig. 2, a consensus C/EBP site exists between −55 and −47 and a consensus DR+1 between −3951 and −3939 bp. Other sites with partial homology to C/EBP sites were also identified. No other exact consensus sites for members of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily were found between −6510 and +9 of the leptin promoter. In that the TZ compounds down-regulate leptin mRNA levels in primary rat adipocytes, we then determined the transcriptional effects of TZ on leptin promoter-constructs transiently transfected into primary rat adipocytes. As Fig. 3A shows, leptin promoter constructs were expressed well above background in transfected rat adipocytes (background, 250-300 light units). However, their expression was markedly below the RSV control (70,508 light units). Also, another full-length fat-specific gene promoter, aP2, was expressed at levels slightly above the −454 to +9 leptin promoter construct. Mutagenesis of the proximal C/EBP binding site in context of either the −454 construct (Fig. 3A) or the −6510 bp leptin construct (data not shown) caused reporter gene activity to be dramatically reduced indicating that this C/EBP site is essential for full promoter activity in transiently transfected primary rat adipocytes. The addition of 1 μM BRL 49653, a potent and selective TZ and PPARγ ligand, caused significant negative regulation of all the"
https://openalex.org/W2033164168,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (Sph-1-P) has been implicated as an intracellular second messenger in many studies. We investigated the metabolism of Sph-1-P and the mechanism by which Sph-1-P induces activation in enucleated and highly differentiated platelets. Platelets lack Sph-1-P lyase activity, possess persistently active sphingosine (Sph) kinase, and abundantly store Sph-1-P. Although exogenous Sph-1-P activated platelets, intracellular Sph-1-P, formed from exogenously added Sph by cytosolic Sph kinase, failed to do so. To support the notion that exogenous Sph-1-P stimulates platelets from outside, contact of platelet surfaces with immobilized Sph-1-P covalently linked to glass particles resulted in platelet activation. Furthermore, we detected the specific binding sites for radiolabeled Sph-1-P on the platelet surface, suggesting extracellular effects of Sph-1-P on plasma membrane receptors. This specific Sph-1-P binding was inhibited not by other sphingolipids but by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and platelet aggregation response to LPA was specifically desensitized by prior addition of Sph-1-P. Finally, internally stored Sph-1-P is released extracellularly upon stimulation, and the release correlated well with protein kinase C activation in intact platelets. These results suggest that Sph-1-P acts not intracellularly but intercellularly, following discharge from activated platelets, and shares a platelet surface receptor with LPA."

The CFTR channel is also modulated by protein kinase C (PKC), but the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we present evidence that PKA-mediated phosphorylation alone is not a sufficient stimulus to open the CFTR chloride channel in the presence of MgATP; constitutive PKC phosphorylation is essential for acute activation of CFTR by PKA. When patches were excised from transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, CFTR responses to PKA became progressively smaller with time and eventually disappeared. This decline in PKA responsiveness did not occur in the presence of exogenous PKC and was reversed by the addition of PKC to channels that had become refractory to PKA. PKC enhanced PKA stimulation of open probability without increasing the number of functional channels. Short-term pretreatment of cells with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (1 μM) reduced the channel activity that could be elicited by forskolin in cell-attached patches. Moreover, in whole cell patches, acute stimulation of CFTR currents by chlorophenylthio-cAMP was abolished by two chemically unrelated PKC inhibitors, although an abrupt, partial activation was observed after a delay of >15 min. Modulation by PKC was most pronounced when basal PKC phosphorylation was reduced by briefly preincubating cells with chelerythrine. Constitutive PKC phosphorylation in unstimulated cells permits the maximum elevation of open probability by PKA to reach a level that is ∼60% of that attained during in vitro exposure to both kinases.

https://openalex.org/W1983628593,"While acute activation of inhibitory Gi/o-coupled receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, chronic activation of such receptors leads to an increase in cAMP accumulation. This phenomenon, observed in many cell types, has been referred to as adenylyl cyclase superactivation. At this stage, the mechanism leading to adenylyl cyclase superactivation and the nature of the isozyme(s) responsible for this phenomenon are largely unknown. Here we show that transfection of adenylyl cyclase isozymes into COS-7 cells results in an isozyme-specific increase in AC activity upon stimulation (e.g. with forskolin, ionomycin, or stimulatory receptor ligands). However, independently of the method used to activate specific adenylyl cyclase isozymes, acute activation of the μ-opioid receptor inhibited the activity of adenylyl cyclases I, V, VI, and VIII, while types II, IV, and VII were stimulated and type III was not affected. Chronic μ-opioid receptor activation followed by removal of the agonist was previously shown, in transfected COS-7 cells, to induce superactivation of adenylyl cyclase type V. Here we show that it also leads to superactivation of adenylyl cyclase types I, VI, and VIII, but not of type II, III, IV, or VII, demonstrating that the superactivation is isozyme-specific. Not only were isozymes II, IV, and VII not superactivated, but a reduction in the activities of these isozymes was actually observed upon chronic opiate exposure.

Sequence and functional similarities allow the categorization of these ACs into six classes: (a) AC type I (AC-I) is stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin, possibly independently of Gαs stimulation, and is inhibited by Gβγ subunits; (b) AC-VIII is stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin; (c) AC-V and AC-VI are inhibited by low levels of Ca2+ but are unaffected by Gβγ subunits; (d) AC-II, AC-IV, and AC-VII comprise a subfamily, where AC-II and AC-IV are highly activated by Gβγ subunits in the presence of activated Gαs, while AC-II and AC-VII are stimulated by activation of protein kinase C; (e) AC-III is stimulated by a high concentration of Ca2+/calmodulin in the presence of Gαs but is unaffected by Gβγ subunits; (f) AC-IX, which has only recently been cloned, has thus far only been found to be affected by Gαs.

Nevertheless, it appears that there are cells that, under similar conditions, do not display AC superactivation, such as rat insulinoma RINm5F cells (36McDermott A.M. Sharp G.W.G. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 277-285Google Scholar) and mouse 7315c cells (37Puttfarcken P.S. Cox B.M. Life Sci. 1989; 45: 1937-1942Google Scholar). Moreover, there are cell types where AC superactivation is revealed only when AC is stimulated in a certain way (21Ammer H. Schulz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 556-563Google Scholar, 38Sharma S.K.

As described above, several AC isozymes are known today that differ in their stimulation and inhibition characteristics, and the various cell types described above may vary in their AC isozyme populations. We have previously shown that AC-V transfected into COS-7 cells is susceptible to superactivation following chronic activation of μ- or δ-opioid or m2-muscarinic receptors (40Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21309-21315Google Scholar). Thomas and Hoffman (28Thomas J.M. Hoffman B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 907-914Google Scholar) have shown that AC-VI transfected into HEK-293 cells is susceptible to superactivation following chronic activation of m2-muscarinic or D2-dopaminergic receptors. However, it is currently unknown whether other AC types could show superactivation following chronic treatment with inhibitory agonists. Here, we report that acute opiate treatment inhibits while chronic opiate treatment leads to superactivation of AC-I, AC-V, AC-VI, and AC-VIII. On the other hand, acute opiate treatment stimulates and chronic opiate treatment decreases the activity of AC-II, AC-IV, and AC-VII. The activity of AC-III is not affected by either acute or chronic opiate treatments. [2-3H]adenine (10.3 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Rotem Industries (Be'er Sheba, Israel).

Commun. 1990; 168: 1184-1193Google Scholar). Twenty-four h before transfection, a confluent 10-cm plate of COS-7 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C, was trypsinized and split into four 10-cm plates. The cells were transfected, using the DEAE-dextran chloroquine method (48Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 527-537Google Scholar), with 1 μg/plate of rat μ-opioid receptor cDNA and 2 μg/plate of either one of the AC isozyme cDNAs or of pXMD1-gal (for mock DNA transfection) and, where indicated, with 1 μg/plate of m1-muscarinic receptor, αs-Q227L, or TSH receptor cDNA. Twenty-four h later, the cells were trypsinized and recultured in 24-well plates, and after an additional 24 h the cells were assayed for AC activity as described below. Transfection efficiencies were normally in the range of 40-80%, as determined by staining for β-galactosidase activity (49Lim K. Chae C.B. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Google Scholar). The transfection of the various AC isozymes increased the amounts of cAMP in the cells compared with control (see “Results” for details). The expression of the μ-opioid receptor and of AC types I, II, IV, V, VI, and VIII was confirmed by the Western blotting technique, using selective antibodies (data not shown) kindly provided by Dr. G. Uhl (μ-opioid receptor) and by Dr. T. Pfeuffer (AC-I, -II, -IV, -V, and -VIII) or purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (AC-VI). The expression of the μ-opioid receptor was not affected by the cotransfection with the various AC isozymes (data not shown). The assay was performed in triplicate as described previously (23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Google Scholar, 40Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21309-21315Google Scholar, 50Vogel Z. Barg J. Levy R. Saya D. Heldman E. Mechoulam R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 352-355Google Scholar). In brief, cells cultured in 24-well plates were incubated for 2 h with 0.25 ml/well of fresh growth medium containing 5 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine and then washed three times with 0.5 ml/well of DMEM containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This medium was replaced with 0.5 ml/well of DMEM containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mM) and RO-20-1724 (0.5 mM). AC activity was stimulated in the presence or absence of opiate ligands by the addition of FS, TPA, ionomycin, carbachol, TSH, or isoproterenol. After 10 min (FS, TSH, or isoproterenol) or 20 min (ionomycin, TPA, or carbachol) at room temperature, the medium was removed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of perchloric acid containing 0.1 mM unlabeled cAMP, followed by neutralization with KOH, and the amount of [3H]cAMP was determined by a two-step column separation procedure as described previously (23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Google Scholar, 51Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 22-28Google Scholar). Chronic opiate treatment was achieved by incubating the cells for 18 h with 1 μM of morphine followed by opiate withdrawal (by three rapid washes with DMEM containing 20 mM Hepes and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and the addition of stimulator (see above) to assay AC activity. We found that the uptake of [3H]adenine into the cells was not affected by the chronic opiate treatment. In COS-7 cells transfected with μ-opioid receptor cDNA, cAMP accumulation could be stimulated upon activation with 1 μM FS (2-4-fold) or 10 μM isoproterenol (10-20-fold), which activates the endogenous β2-adrenergic receptors, but not with 1 μM ionomycin or TPA (Fig. 1). Similarly, COS-7 cells transfected with the constitutively active Gαs mutant αs-Q227L, displayed an elevated level of AC activity (5-10-fold). COS-7 cells transfected with the μ-opioid receptor and either the m1-muscarinic or TSH receptor displayed an elevated level of cAMP accumulation when stimulated with 100 μM carbachol (4-6-fold) or 0.1 μM TSH (8-10-fold) with respect to unstimulated cells. In a series of experiments (Fig. 2), we have utilized COS-7 cells transfected with μ-opioid receptor and investigated the effect of acute and chronic application of the μ agonist, morphine, on the activity of AC endogenously present in these cells. We found that application of 1 μM morphine, either acutely (10 min) or chronically (18 h), did not lead to any significant change in the level of cAMP in the cells (n = 7; Fig. 2a). However, acute application of morphine to cells stimulated with 1 μM FS led to marked inhibition (23.1 ± 3.4%, n = 14; p < 0.0001; see Fig. 2b) of cAMP accumulation, while not affecting AC activity in untransfected COS-7 cells (data not shown). Withdrawal from chronic opiate treatment (1 μM morphine, 18 h, followed by three rapid washes) led to an increase in FS-stimulated (18 ± 3%, n = 13; p < 0.0001) cAMP accumulation. This increase in cAMP accumulation, defined as AC superactivation (20Sharma S.K. Klee W.A. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3092-3096Google Scholar, 22Avidor-Reiss T. Zippel R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21309-21315Google Scholar), could be inhibited (28 ± 3%, n = 13) by readdition of morphine. In cells transiently cotransfected with the μ-opioid receptor and either the constitutively active αs mutant αs-Q227L or TSH receptor, a small but significant inhibition in αs- (15.3 ± 3.32%, n = 4; p < 0.025) and TSH-stimulated (14 ± 2.3%, n = 11; p < 0.001) AC activity could be observed (Fig. 2, c and d). There was no significant decrease (n = 4; Fig. 2e) in cellular cAMP levels when morphine was added to isoproterenol-stimulated μ-opioid receptor-transfected COS-7 cells. In all three conditions (TSH, αs-Q227L, and isoproterenol), withdrawal from chronic opiate treatment did not lead to any significant increase in cAMP accumulation, and readdition of morphine following withdrawal led to inhibition of cAMP accumulation by 21 ± 2.4% (n = 6; p < 0.0005), 11.6 ± 2.5% (n = 5; p < 0.05), and 13.8 ± 3.5% (n = 4; p < 0.05), respectively. On the other hand, in cells transiently transfected with the μ-opioid receptor and the m1-muscarinic receptor cDNAs, no inhibition by morphine of the carbachol-stimulated AC activity could be observed (n = 7; see Fig. 2f). Withdrawal from chronic opiate treatment did not lead to any increase in cAMP accumulation. On the contrary, it led to a reduction of 12.6 ± 4.2% (n = 7; p < 0.05) in cAMP levels compared with control cells. Readdition of morphine under these conditions did not lead to a further inhibition of AC activity. These results indicate that in COS-7 cells, opioid receptor regulation of endogenous cAMP levels depends on the way in which AC is stimulated. In order to evaluate the possibility that this phenomenon is due to activation of a particular AC isozyme or of a combination of isozymes present in the cells, we have transfected AC types I-VIII into COS-7 cells and monitored the effect of acute and chronic morphine on AC activity. All of the exogenous ACs were found to be expressed in the cells and to be functionally active, as determined by the increase in cAMP accumulation in the cells following stimulation with the appropriate stimulant (e.g. FS, ionomycin, TPA, or TSH; see below). In cells transfected with AC-I or AC-VIII, stimulation with FS or ionomycin resulted in a large increase in cAMP accumulation (3-5- and 3-10-fold, respectively), as compared with that obtained with the endogenous AC activity present in COS-7 cells (Figs. 3, a and b, Fig. 4a). The effects of FS and ionomycin on AC-I or AC-VIII activities were synergistic, whereas no such synergism was observed for the endogenous AC activity of COS-7 cells. The finding that AC-I- and AC-VIII-transfected cells show strong activation by ionomycin is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that Ca2+/calmodulin has a stimulatory effect on these isozymes (1Krupinski J.

Data represent the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of the μ-opioid receptor by morphine during the stimulation of AC-I led to inhibition of ionomycin- or ionomycin/FS-stimulated AC-I activity (20-30%; Fig. 3, c and d). On the other hand, activation of the opioid receptor for 18 h before the AC-I stimulation led, after washing of the agonist, to an increase in AC-I activity (by 1.6-1.9-fold over nontreated cells), indicating that AC-I is superactivated during the chronic opiate exposure. Readdition of morphine after chronic treatment and withdrawal led to a 30-40% inhibition of AC-I activity, indicating that the opioid receptor and its coupling to AC were still functional. However, cAMP levels in the cells were higher (by 30-45%) under these conditions as compared with acute inhibition, as expected for inhibition of up-regulated levels of AC activity. This suggests, as shown previously with AC endogenously found in Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Google Scholar), that the apparent tolerance due to chronic morphine exposure is a result of the superactivated state of the AC following the chronic exposure. In Fig. 4b, we show that the opiate effect on AC-VIII is similar to that on AC-I. Acute activation of the opioid receptor led to inhibition of AC-VIII (by 21.3 ± 5.3%, n = 6), and chronic treatment followed by withdrawal led to superactivation (2.14 ± 0.15-fold, n = 6) of AC-VIII. Readdition of morphine after chronic treatment and withdrawal led to a 46 ± 5.4% (n = 5) inhibition of AC-VIII activity. As with AC-I, this level of cAMP is higher (49 ± 7.6%, n = 5) as compared with acute inhibition of nontreated cells. Cells transfected with AC-V cDNA express an increase in unstimulated activity (158 ± 11%, n = 10) as well as in activity stimulated by FS (485 ± 63%, n = 10), TPA (473 ± 31%, n = 4), αs-Q227L (361 ± 17%, n = 3), TSH (169 ± 11%, n = 6), and isoproterenol (162 ± 7%, n = 3), as compared with the activity endogenously present in COS-7 cells under the same conditions. We have recently shown that acute activation of the μ-opioid receptor leads to inhibition of FS- or TPA-stimulated AC-V, while chronic opiate exposure leads to its superactivation (40Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21309-21315Google Scholar). In Fig. 5, we show that inhibition and superactivation can also be obtained when AC-V is stimulated by activation of the endogenous β2-adrenergic or transfected TSH receptors as well as by the constitutively active αs-Q227L. Acute morphine inhibited by about 25% the accumulation of cAMP in unstimulated cells. Inhibition of 50-60% was observed in the level of cAMP in cells stimulated with FS, TPA, αs-Q227L, TSH, or isoproterenol. Removal of the agonist following chronic treatment led to superactivation (1.7-2.7-fold over control, nontreated cells) of AC-V activity in all of these cases. Reapplying the opiate agonist after withdrawal led to AC inhibition (40-70%). In cells transfected with AC-VI, TSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation was higher (164 ± 6%, n = 3) than the activity endogenously present in COS-7 cells. AC-VI was recently shown to undergo inhibition by acute D2- or m2-agonist exposure, and superactivation following chronic exposure to these agonists (28Thomas J.M. Hoffman B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 907-914Google Scholar). These observations are supported by results we obtained using COS-7 cells transfected with μ-opioid receptor and AC-VI. Fig. 6 shows, using TSH as a stimulant of AC, that acute μ-opioid receptor activation inhibited cAMP accumulation (by 36.3 ± 5.9%, n = 3) and that removal of the agonist following chronic treatment led to superactivation of AC-VI activity (1.44 ± 0.07-fold over control nontreated cells, n = 3). Reapplying the opiate agonist after withdrawal led to AC inhibition (54.1 ± 4.9%, n = 3). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that AC-I, AC-V, AC-VI, and AC-VIII exhibit inhibition and superactivation by acute and chronic opiate exposure, respectively, and that the two functions are not dependent on the agent used to stimulate AC activity. In AC-II-transfected cells (cotransfected with μ-opioid receptor), cAMP accumulation was higher than th"
https://openalex.org/W1983526542,"The hepatotoxic cyclic heptapeptide microcystins and cyclic pentapeptide nodularins are powerful liver tumor promoters and potent inhibitors of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase-1 and −2A (PP-1c and PP-2Ac). In marked contrast to microcystins, which interact covalently with PP-1 and PP-2A, the nodularins do not bind covalently to PP-1 and PP-2A and may additionally possess unique carcinogenic properties. The conformation of microcystin-LR has been determined in solution and bound to PP-1c. We show here that the free NMR solution structures of two distinct microcystin structural congeners (microcystin-LR and -LL) are remarkably similar to the bound crystal structure of microcystin-LR. We have exploited this finding by using Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling to dock the solution structures of microcystin-LL and the marine toxin motuporin (nodularin-V) onto the crystal structure of PP-1c. Both of these toxins occupy a position similar to that of microcystin-LR when bound to PP-1c. However, although there are relatively minor differences in the structural orientation of microcystin-LL compared with microcystin-LR, there is a striking difference in the position of the N-methyldehydrobutyrine residue in motuporin relative to the comparable N-methyldehydroalanine residue in microcystin-LR. We propose that this difference in orientation provides a molecular explanation for why nodularins are incapable of forming a covalent linkage with PP-1c. Furthermore, the predicted position of N-methyldehydrobutyrine in motuporin is at the surface of the PP-1c-toxin complex, which may thus facilitate chemical interaction with a further macromolecule(s) possibly relating to its carcinogenic properties. PP-1c and PP-2Ac are also targets for other marine toxins such as okadaic acid and calyculin A. It was therefore of interest to use Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling to dock the known free crystal structures of okadaic acid and calyculin A to the crystal structure of PP-1c. These experiments predict that both okadaic acid and calyculin A are strikingly similar to microcystins and motuporin in their tertiary structure and relative PP-1c binding position.

Inhibition of these enzymes in the liver is apparently associated with hepatocyte deformation due to reorganization of microfilaments (11Eriksson J.E. Toivola D. Meriluoto J.A.O. Codd G.A.

Liver tumor promotion may be linked to the ability of this cyclic peptide to promote hyperphosphorylation of cytokeratins associated with morphological changes in rat hepatocytes (12Ohta T.

To date more than 40 different microcystins have been characterized (13Rhinehart K.L. Harada K.I. Namikoshi M. Chen C. Harvis C.A. Munro M.H.G. Blunt J.W. Mulligan P.E. Beasley V.R. Dahlem A.M. Carmichael W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8557-8558Google Scholar, 14Craig M. McCready T.L. Luu H.A. Smillie M.A. Dubord P. Holmes C.F.B. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 1541-1549Google Scholar). Within the microcystin family, members differ from each other in the nature of two variable L-amino acids indicated by suffix letters (e.g. L = Leu, R = Arg) and in the presence or absence of methyl groups on the D-erythro-β-methylaspartic acid (Masp) and/or N-methyldehydroalanine (Mdha) residues (Fig. 1). Despite these differences no loss of PPase inhibition or tumor promotion has been observed. Nodularins are structurally related cyclic pentapeptides (Fig. 1) that inhibit PP-1c and PP-2Ac with potency similar to that of microcystins and are also powerful tumor promoters (15Ohta T. Sueoka E. Iida N. Komori A. Suganuma M. Nishiwaki R. Tatematsu M. Kim S. Carmichael W.W. Fujiki H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6402-6406Google Scholar). The relatively hydrophobic cyclic pentapeptide motuporin (also termed nodularin-V in Fig. 1), which was isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei, differs from nodularin by substitution of a valine residue for an arginine residue (16DeSilva S.D. Williams D.E. Andersen R.J. Klix H. Holmes C.F.B. Allen T.M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 1561-1564Google Scholar). Although sharing similar biological properties, important functional differences between the microcystins and nodularins have been identified. One difference is in the interaction with PP-1c and PP-2Ac. Although both toxins initially bind noncovalently and inhibit these enzymes, microcystin-LR, -LA, and -LL undergo a secondary time-dependent interaction with the phosphatase (3Mackintosh R.W. Dalby K.N. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Google Scholar, 4Runnegar M. Berndt N. Kong S.M. Lee E.Y.C. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 162-169Google Scholar, 17Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Holmes C.F.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 569-578Google Scholar). This secondary interaction results in a covalent linkage causing irreversible modification of PP-1c/PP-2Ac. In contrast, nodularin or motuporin does not bind covalently to PP-1c/PP-2Ac after inhibiting it. A second difference is that in addition to acting as a tumor promoter, nodularin may also act as a carcinogen/tumor initiator (15Ohta T. Sueoka E. Iida N. Komori A. Suganuma M. Nishiwaki R. Tatematsu M. Kim S. Carmichael W.W. Fujiki H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6402-6406Google Scholar). Okadaic acid (OA) and related congeners are polyether-like compounds (Fig. 1), potent inhibitors of PP-1c/PP-2Ac, and powerful tumor promoters (for review, see Ref. 10Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Google Scholar). OA is produced by unicellular dinoflagellates such as Dinophysis and Prorocentrum, causes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning in humans, and has also been used extensively as a research tool in studying reversible protein phosphorylation in many cellular processes (18Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar). Calyculin A (Fig. 1) and its analogs isolated from the marine sponge Discodermia calyx are also effective inhibitors of PP-1c and PP-2Ac (19Fujuki H. Suganuma M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 143-194Google Scholar). Paradoxically, although microcystin/nodularin, OA, and calyculin A possess strikingly different linear structures (Fig. 1), they are all potent PP-1c/PP-2Ac inhibitors and appear to bind to a similar region on PP-1c (discussed in Ref. 20Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Google Scholar and references therein). Previously, the solution structures of microcystin-LR and motuporin (nodularin-V) were compared with each other to give insights into how their residues and tertiary structure were important for binding to PP-1c/PP-2Ac (1Bagu J.R. Sönnichsen F.D. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Sykes B.D. Holmes C.F.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 114-116Google Scholar). Comparison of these solution structures revealed how the Mdhb residue in motuporin was relatively significantly displaced from the Mdha residue in microcystin-LR, thus providing a preliminary explanation for why microcystins are capable of binding covalently to the PPases, whereas motuporin lacks this ability. Elucidation of the crystal structure of microcystin-LR bound covalently to PP-1c (2Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Google Scholar) provided a detailed view of key interactions between microcystin-LR and PP-1c and facilitated a detailed comparison of the structures of unbound and bound toxin. Accordingly, in this paper we show that the published free solution NMR structure of microcystin-LR does not change significantly in conformation upon inhibiting and binding covalently to PP-1c. This may be a factor contributing to the high affinity of microcystin-LR for PP-1c. Given the remarkable similarity between the free solution structure and bound crystal structure of microcystin-LR, we predict that the other microcystins will have similar free and bound structures. In accordance with this hypothesis, we also determined the solution structure of the hydrophobic microcystin congener microcystin-LL and docked this structure (using Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling) onto the crystal structure of PP-1c. Furthermore, because nodularins are structurally related to microcystins, we also assume that the nodularins will largely retain their solution structure upon binding to PP-1c and have docked motuporin onto this enzyme. A comparison of the complexes of microcystin-LR, microcystin-LL, and motuporin with PP-1c sheds light upon the different molecular mechanisms underlying their interaction with the phosphatase. These comparisons strongly suggest why the microcystins react covalently, whereas the nodularins do not, and provide a preliminary hypothesis for explaining the carcinogenic properties of the nodularins. Microcystin-LL and motuporin were purified as described previously (14Craig M. McCready T.L. Luu H.A. Smillie M.A. Dubord P. Holmes C.F.B. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 1541-1549Google Scholar, 16DeSilva S.D. Williams D.E. Andersen R.J. Klix H. Holmes C.F.B. Allen T.M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 1561-1564Google Scholar). Samples used for NMR studies were reconstituted at 1 mM in potassium phosphate (10 mM), sodium chloride (50 mM) buffer with 80-90% H2O, 10-20% D2O at pH 7. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (0.1 mM) was added as a 1H NMR chemical shift standard. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz on a Varian VXR-500 NMR spectrometer. Proton NMR resonance assignments for microcystin-LL were made using standard sequential assignment methods with double quantum filtered COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra and were similar to microcystin-LR and motuporin assignments (1Bagu J.R. Sönnichsen F.D. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Sykes B.D. Holmes C.F.B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 114-116Google Scholar). 1H-1H internuclear distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional 1H NOESY taken with a mixing time of 150 ms so as to minimize spin diffusion. 3JNHαCH and 3JCH-CH coupling constants were obtained by curve fitting one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra. Assignments were made at 25 and 5°C, with structural information recorded at 5°C. Calibration of the NOEs was accomplished using the known distance of 1.8 Å between the HB protons of the sp2 carbon of the Mdha side chain to scale the experimental cross-peak intensity. Sixty structures were generated using the distance geometry program DGII in the program Insight II version 2.3 (Biosym Technologies Inc.) with 58 of the 60 structures converging into one fold and the other 2 discarded because of violations. For this cyclic peptide the vicinal angle restraints were very important in restraining the structure of the ring. Distance and angle violations were analyzed using the NMR refine module in Insight II. There were no consistently violated distance restraints over 0.1 Å, and angles fell within the defined restraint range in almost all cases for the 58 converging structures. An average structure was then generated from the 58 structures and was subjected to constrained minimization to correct bond distances that had been distorted through averaging. Metropolis Monte Carlo docking of microcystin-LL and motuporin was accomplished using the Monte Carlo macro in Insight II version 2.3. For microcystin-LL, the minimized average structure was used for docking with the PP-1c crystal structure (2Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Google Scholar). The PP-1c crystal structure was modified to facilitate docking by removing the bound microcystin-LR and adding protons. The starting position for placing microcystin-LL relative to PP-1c was obtained by superimposing microcystin-LL onto the bound x-ray crystal structure of microcystin-LR. This was accomplished by superimposing the identical backbone atoms of the docking PPase structure onto the original PPase structure that still had microcystin-LR attached, superimposing microcystin-LL onto microcystin-LR in the crystal structure, then removing original PPase + microcystin-LR, thus leaving docking PPase with microcystin-LL in its starting position. From this single starting point, the Monte Carlo macro then performed docking calculations for 2,000 trials at a temperature of 50 K. Other temperatures (1 and 100 K) were tried, but varying the temperature did not make any difference in positioning the final docked structure of microcystin-LL (provided the number of trials was equivalent). Furthermore, different numbers of trials were used (100, 1,000, and 2,000) at 50 K with all three amounts of trials resulting in a similarly docked microcystin-LL. Because 2,000 trials resulted in the lowest energy for the final structure, this was chosen as the optimum number of trials to be performed. For motuporin, the minimized average solution structure was again used for docking with PP-1c (the latter structure used exhibited protons but lacked bound microcystin-LR). Superimposition of motuporin onto bound microcystin-LR was accomplished in a manner similar to that of microcystin-LL. Docking of motuporin using the Monte Carlo macro was at 50 K with 2,000 trials. To carry out molecular modeling studies with OA (3Mackintosh R.W. Dalby K.N. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Google Scholar) and calyculin A (4Runnegar M. Berndt N. Kong S.M. Lee E.Y.C. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 162-169Google Scholar), the free crystal structures of these toxins were retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Data base (21Allen F.H. Kennard O. Taylor R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 146-153Google Scholar). In the case of OA, the bromobenzyl region of the crystal structure was removed so as to use native OA in the docking process. Both OA and calyculin A were docked in the same manner as microcystin-LL and motuporin. The starting point used for OA and calyculin A was from visual superimposition of the individual toxin onto bound microcystin-LR. As a rigorous test of our procedures, the minimized average solution structure of microcystin-LR was docked onto the crystal structure of PP-1c in the same manner and starting point as microcystin-LL and motuporin. The docked structure of microcystin-LR hardly moved from its starting position, indicating that the Metropolis Monte Carlo macro used was successful in keeping the free solution structure of microcystin-LR at the same binding position observed in the PP-1c-microcystin-LR crystal structure (data not shown). In addition, we calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) change in atomic positions from the original manually positioned toxins to the final model after docking. These data (Table I) show that the RMSD for all atoms between starting and docked structures for each toxin varied between 0.68 Å for microcystin-LR and 2.36 Å for OA.Table IRoot mean square deviation for all atoms between starting and final docked structures of each toxinToxinRMSDÅMicrocystin-LR0.68Microcystin-LL1.56Motuporin1.96Okadaic acid2.36Calyculin A1.26 Open table in a new tab As a further test of the robustness of our docking methods, we employed our Metropolis Monte Carlo procedures for the converging 58 NMR structures of microcystin-LL. Although most of these structures do indeed dock in a manner similar to that of the average structure, to be objective we focused particularly on the six most disparate microcystin-LL NMR structures. The disparate nature of these distorted structures was predicated largely by the flexibility of their Adda side chains in solution. Therefore, even though the main ring of these toxins might have to move an unrealistic amount to compensate for an unusually positioned Adda side chain, these six most distorted toxin structures still fitted well, wherein the backbone RMSD (comparing docked NMR calculated structures with the docked average solution structure for microcystin-LL) averaged 1.28 Å (± 0.54 S.D.). We compared extensively (Fig. 2) the minimized average free solution structure of microcystin-LR (determined by NMR spectroscopy) with that of microcystin-LR bound to PP-1c (determined by x-ray crystallography). The RMSD of all backbone atoms superimposed on each other was 0.65 Å. The two structures are strikingly similar, indicating that microcystin-LR retains its free conformation while inhibiting and binding covalently to PP-1c. The minor differences in orientation of Arg and Mdha side chains between the two structures may be accounted for by the flexibility of the Arg side chain in solution and the change in the position of the Mdha side chain (where it points upward from the saddle in the free solution structure and downward in the bound crystal structure; Fig. 2) following covalent bonding between this residue and Cys-273 of PP-1c. In solution the Adda side chain is flexible, with the position adopted in Fig. 2 representing that of the average structure. In the crystal structure the Adda side chain is inflexible and clearly defined. The family of solution structures of microcystin-LL determined by 1H NMR is shown in Fig. 3A. The RMSD of backbone atoms relative to the average structure is 0.57 ± 0.10 Å. The cyclic backbone of microcystin-LL forms a relatively rigid saddle, whereas the Adda side chain is highly flexible. The Glu and Masp carboxyl groups are positioned such that their negative charges are situated below the saddle. Mdha is located at the top, front part of the saddle in the perspective shown in Fig. 3A. The minimized average structure of microcystin-LL is highly comparable to the minimized average solution structure of microcystin-LR (Fig. 3B), with the RMSD of the two cyclic backbones being 0.77 Å. Clearly, substitution of positively charged Arg with hydrophobic Leu in microcystin-LL results in no overall structural change. Given that microcystin-LR retains its solution structure upon binding to PP-1c, we postulated that microcystin-LL would do likewise. The minimized average free solution structure of microcystin-LL was docked onto the crystal structure of PP-1c using Metropolis Monte Carlo procedures. These data show that microcystin-LL retains a position that is highly similar to the crystal structure of microcystin-LR bound to PP-1c. This is exemplified by the presence of virtually identical PPase residues in close proximity (within 4 Å) to microcystin-LL when compared with bound microcystin-LR (see Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Panel A, bound crystal microcystin-LR complexed with PP-1c in stereo (top). Bound microcystin-LR is in red with the PPase residues in blue (labels in white). Panel B, Metropolis Monte Carlo docking of the free average minimized structure of motuporin onto the crystal structure of PP-1c in stereo (bottom). Motuporin is in yellow with PP-1c residues in blue (labels in white). Only PPase residues that have atoms within 4 Å of either microcystin-LR or motuporin are displayed. The same orientation is shown for the PPase residues in both cases. No hydrogen atoms shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The average free minimized solution structure of motuporin was superimposed onto the bound crystal structure of microcystin-LR, and the results are depicted in Fig. 4. The backbone segment of the Masp-Val-Adda atoms of motuporin (excluding the Adda carbonyl carbon) was superimposed onto the corresponding Masp-Arg-Adda atoms of bound crystal microcystin-LR. This superimposition was chosen because this range of atoms had similar ϕ, ψ, and ω angles. The RMSD between the two structures, when superimposed via these atoms, is 0.46 Å. These data reconfirm the similarities in the backbone atoms of residues Masp, Arg/Val, and Adda; the positioning of the carboxyls (Masp and Glu); and the positioning of the Adda side chain between microcystin-LR and motuporin. Once again, the difference in the Mdha/Mdhb region of the toxins results in a major displacement (7.13 Å with respect to β carbons) of the Mdhb residue in motuporin relative to Mdha in microcystin-LR. Assuming that motuporin (like microcystin-LR) retains its free solution structure upon binding to PP-1c, we once again docked the free averaged minimized solution structure of this toxin onto the crystal structure of PP-1c using Metropolis Monte Carlo procedures (Fig. 5B). In our model the distance between the β carbon of the Mdhb residue and the sulfur atom on the Cys-273 side chain is 10 Å. Motuporin differs only slightly in position relative to PP-1c-bound microcystin-LR. This model predicts similar PPase residues to be within 4 Å of the toxin when compared with bound microcystin-LR (Fig. 5A) and docked microcystin-LL, but it lacks some proximity connections (within 4 Å) particularly with respect to PP-1c residues 274-276. The overall crystal structure of microcystin-LR bound to PP-1c (Fig. 6A) was compared with our structural model for motuporin docked onto the crystal structure of PP-1c (Fig. 6B). We identified a remarkable difference between the two PPase-toxin complexes such that whereas Mdha in microcystin-LR is bonded covalently to Cys-273 and relatively buried, the equivalent Mdhb residue in motuporin should be highly accessible and actually protrude from the molecular surface of the PP-1c-motuporin complex. Fig. 7A depicts the PP-1c-docked free crystal structure of OA (see “Experimental Procedures”) compared with the bound crystal structure of microcystin-LR. Interestingly, there are striking similarities in the three-dimensional structure and relative positioning of docked OA when compared with bound microcystin-LR. The hydrophobic end of OA overlaps with the hydrophobic Adda residue of microcystin-LR. The tertiary structure of OA continues to follow microcystin-LR up to its Arg residue but then extends over the top of the microcystin saddle to overlap once again with microcystin near the Mdha residue. Finally, the C1 carboxyl group of OA is predicted to be positioned very near the Glu residue of microcystin-LR. Thus, the hydrophobic regions and carboxyl groups of each toxin overlap. Fig. 7B depicts a view of PP-1c-docked OA showing surrounding PP-1c residues predicted to be within 4 Å of the toxin. The hydrophobic section of OA is able to fit into the hydrophobic pocket in a fashion similar to the Adda residue of microcystin and motuporin. The carboxyl group end of OA is predicted to be near Arg-96 and Tyr-272 of PP-1c, similar to the Glu and Masp carboxyl groups of microcystin and motuporin. The data in Fig. 7 underscore a predicted structural similarity among OA microcystin-LR, microcystin-LL, and motuporin such that these toxins all appear to have many PP-1c contact residues in common. Therefore, OA appears not only to bind to the same region as microcystin and motuporin, but may undergo similar interactions with PP-1c residues present in the microcystin binding pocket. The docked free crystal structure of calyculin A is shown in Fig. 8A. Like OA, calyculin A resembles bound microcystin-LR in terms of its three-dimensional structure and position in relation to PP-1c. The negatively charged phosphate group of calyculin A appears to be located somewhat above the Masp group of microcystin-LR, but they are still predicted to be fairly close to each other. Fig. 8B shows the surrounding PP-1c residues within 4 Å of calyculin A. We therefore predict that calyculin A would bind in the same pocket as the other PP-1c inhibitors and is close to many of the same contact PP-1c residues. The nature of the molecular surfaces of microcystin-LR, motuporin, OA, and calyculin A in both their unbound (Fig. 9) and PP-1c bound/docked (Fig. 10) conformations was calculated using the GRASP procedure. The surface of each toxin was examined according to its electrostatic surface potential (in the unbound form) and its distance from the surface of PP-1c (in the bound/docked form). These experiments revealed a strong similarity in the tertiary structures of the toxins and prompted a further GRASP analysis of the molecular surfaces of PP-1c involved in toxin binding (Fig. 11). Interestingly, the predicted molecular surfaces of PP-1c closely involved in binding microcystin-LR (Fig. 11A) and OA (Fig. 11C) were the most strikingly similar. These include the region on PP-1c (represented in white, 0-1.5 Å distance) comprising Tyr-272 and Cys-273. Notably, this region (represented in red in Fig. 11B) is not predicted to be close to Mdhb in motuporin and appears to be less important in interacting with this toxin. These data are again consistent with the idea that motuporin does not interact covalently with PP-1c.Fig. 10Molecular surfaces of PP-1 bound marine toxins as calculated by GRASP(37Nicholls A.

Recently, a distinct class of dual specificity phosphatase has been shown to reverse activation of MAP kinases by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine and threonine residues. By searching the expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST) for homologues of known dual specificity phosphatases, we identified a novel partial human sequence for which we isolated a full-length cDNA (termed MKP-4). The deduced amino acid sequence of MKP-4 is most similar to MKP-X/PYST2 (61% identity) and MKP-3/PYST1 (57% identity), includes two N-terminal CH2 domains homologous to the cell cycle regulator Cdc25 phosphatase, and contains the extended active site sequence motif VXVHCXAGXSRSXTX3AYLM (where X is any amino acid) conserved in dual specificity phosphatases. MKP-4 produced in Escherichia coli catalyzes vanadate-sensitive breakdown of p-nitrophenyl phosphate as well as in vitro inactivation of purified ERK2. When expressed in COS-7 cells, MKP-4 blocks activation of MAP kinases with the selectivity ERK > p38 = JNK/SAPK. This cellular specificity is similar to MKP-3/PYST1, although distinct from hVH-5/M3-6 (JNK/SAPK = p38 >>> ERK). Northern analysis reveals a highly restricted tissue distribution with a single MKP-4 mRNA species of approximately 2.5 kilobases detected only in placenta, kidney, and embryonic liver. Immunocytochemical analysis showed MKP-4 to be present within cytosol although punctate nuclear staining co-localizing with promyelocytic protein was also observed in a subpopulation (10-20%) of cells. Chromosomal localization by analysis of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and a panel of radiation hybrids assign the human gene for MKP-4 to Xq28. The identification and characterization of MKP-4 highlights the emergence of an expanding family of structurally homologous dual specificity phosphatases possessing distinct MAP kinase specificity and subcellular localization as well as diverse patterns of tissue expression.

The deduced amino acid sequence of MKP-4 is most similar to MKP-X/PYST2 (61% identity) and MKP-3/PYST1 (57% identity), includes two N-terminal CH2 domains homologous to the cell cycle regulator Cdc25 phosphatase, and contains the extended active site sequence motif VXVHCXAGXSRSXTX3AYLM (where X is any amino acid) conserved in dual specificity phosphatases. MKP-4 produced in Escherichia coli catalyzes vanadate-sensitive breakdown of p-nitrophenyl phosphate as well as in vitro inactivation of purified ERK2. When expressed in COS-7 cells, MKP-4 blocks activation of MAP kinases with the selectivity ERK > p38 = JNK/SAPK. This cellular specificity is similar to MKP-3/PYST1, although distinct from hVH-5/M3-6 (JNK/SAPK = p38 >>> ERK). Northern analysis reveals a highly restricted tissue distribution with a single MKP-4 mRNA species of approximately 2.5 kilobases detected only in placenta, kidney, and embryonic liver. Immunocytochemical analysis showed MKP-4 to be present within cytosol although punctate nuclear staining co-localizing with promyelocytic protein was also observed in a subpopulation (10-20%) of cells. Chromosomal localization by analysis of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and a panel of radiation hybrids assign the human gene for MKP-4 to Xq28. The identification and characterization of MKP-4 highlights the emergence of an expanding family of structurally homologous dual specificity phosphatases possessing distinct MAP kinase specificity and subcellular localization as well as diverse patterns of tissue expression."

We previously established a transgenic mouse model in which rat stromelysin-1 targeted to the mammary gland augmented expression of endogenous stromelysin-1, disrupted functional differentiation, and induced mammary tumors. A cell line generated from an adenocarcinoma in one of these animals and a previously described mammary tumor cell line generated in culture readily invaded both a reconstituted basement membrane and type I collagen gels, whereas a nonmalignant, functionally normal epithelial cell line did not. Invasion of Matrigel by tumor cells was largely abolished by metalloproteinase inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of other proteinase families. Inhibition experiments with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides revealed that Matrigel invasion of both cell lines was critically dependent on stromelysin-1 expression. Invasion of collagen, on the other hand, was reduced by only 40-50%. Stromelysin-1 was expressed in both malignant and nonmalignant cells grown on plastic substrata. Its expression was completely inhibited in nonmalignant cells, but up-regulated in tumor cells, in response to Matrigel. Thus misregulation of stromelysin-1 expression appears to be an important aspect of mammary tumor cell progression to an invasive phenotype.

In the present study, we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) is responsible for the phosphorylation and inhibition of AC6 during A2a desensitization. Inhibition of PKC by several independent methods markedly blocked the suppression of AC6 during A2a desensitization. Purified PKC from rat brain directly phosphorylated and inhibited recombinant AC6 expressed in Sf21 cells. Substantially lower AC6 activities were also observed in PC12 cells overexpressing PKCδ or PKCϵ. Stimulation of A2a-R in PC12 cells under the same conditions as those required for A2a desensitization resulted in an increase in Ca2+-independent PKC activity. Most importantly, exogenous PKC did not further suppress AC6 activity in A2a-desensitized membranes. In vitro PKC phosphorylation of AC6 isolated from A2a-desensitized cells was also profoundly lower than that from control cells, suggesting a specific role for PKC in regulating AC6 during A2a desensitization in PC12 cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a calcium-independent, novel PKC inhibits AC6 activity during A2a desensitization in PC12 cells.

ATP was without effect on VSV8 binding to GRP94, whether present during or subsequent to peptide binding. To evaluate the interaction of GRP94 with adenine nucleotides, the ATP binding and hydrolysis activities were directly assayed. Only negligible binding of ATP to GRP94 was observed. In addition, analysis of the GRP94 adenine nucleotide content indicated that GRP94 did not copurify with bound adenine nucleotides. GRP94 preparations exhibited low ATPase and apparent autophosphorylation activities. Further purification, combined with inhibitor studies, indicated that both activities were the result of trace contamination (<0.1%) with casein kinase II.

Transient cell transfection assays, using plasmid constructs harboring the perlecan promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, demonstrated that the largest ∼2.5-kilobase construct contained maximal promoter activity. This promoter region was functionally active in a variety of cells of diverse histogenetic origin, thus corroborating the widespread expression of this gene product. Stepwise 5′ deletion analyses demonstrated that the −461-base pair (bp) proximal promoter retained ∼90% of the total activity, and internal deletions confirmed that the most proximal sequence was essential for proper promoter activity.

https://openalex.org/W2013393210,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to function as a potent mitogen for a variety of cells, transducing its signal through the c-<i>met</i> tyrosine kinase receptor. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine that has been shown to promote survival of motor neurons. We show here that c-<i>met</i> mRNA is present in the embryonic rat spinal cord. Peak expression of c-<i>met</i> (at E14) coincides with the period of naturally occurring cell death in motor neurons, suggesting a possible role of HGF in the regulation of this process. Utilizing a neuron-enriched culture system, we established that HGF, like CNTF, stimulates choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in motor neurons. When co-administered to motor neuron cultures, saturating concentrations of HGF and CNTF produced a synergistic increase in CAT levels. We show that this synergy reflects enhanced motor neuron survival. Exposure of motor neuron cultures to the cytostatic agent vincristine markedly decreased CAT levels; co-treatment with HGF and CNTF (but not either factor alone) restored CAT activity to control levels. Our findings indicate that HGF is a survival factor for motor neurons, that it acts synergistically with CNTF, and that HGF and CNTF can together be neuroprotective in the face of vincristine toxicity."

Whereas stathmin is a soluble cytosolic protein, SCG10 is membrane-associated, indicating that the protein acts in a distinct subcellular compartment. Identifying the precise intracellular distribution of SCG10 as well as the mechanisms responsible for its specific targeting will contribute to elucidating its function. The main structural feature distinguishing the two proteins is that SCG10 contains an NH2-terminal extension of 34 amino acids.

The neuronal growth-associated protein SCG10 belongs to the same gene family as stathmin, a ubiquitous phosphoprotein. In contrast to stathmin, which is a highly soluble cytosolic protein (1Sobel A. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Chneiweiss H. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3765-3772Google Scholar), SCG10 is associated with cellular membranes (2Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Google Scholar). SCG10 was first identified as a gene expressed in sympathetic neurons but not in chromaffin cells (3Anderson D.J. Axel R.

In this study, we have defined the intracellular localization of SCG10 in PC12 cells and transfected COS-7 cells as the area of the Golgi complex. In addition, we have studied the mechanism responsible for the membrane binding and targeting of SCG10 to this area. Because the structural difference between stathmin and SCG10 lies in the NH2-terminal region of SCG10, we generated several constructs encoding truncated and chimeric proteins for the transfection of COS-7 cells. We demonstrate that the NH2-terminal region of SCG10 contains a signal required for its targeting to the area of the Golgi complex and sufficient to target stathmin as well as the unrelated protein, β-galactosidase, to this subcellular region. Furthermore, the presence of two cysteines within the NH2 terminus of SCG10, a potential locus for palmitoylation, prompted us to investigate thio-acylation as a possible lipid modification for the membrane localization of SCG10. The rabbit antiserum raised against the NH2-terminal amino acids 15-27 of stathmin has been previously described (13Koppel J. Boutterin M.C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol.

The rabbit antiserum was further purified by sequential absorption on a protein A-Sepharose column followed by affinity chromatography on a glutathione S-transferase-stathmin-Affi-Gel-10 column to eliminate antibodies cross-reacting with stathmin. The mouse mAbs were purified on a spectra/gel Fast IgG column (Spectrum) and by gel filtration on Superdex200 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).

The following reagents were obtained from commercial sources: mouse mAbs directed against β-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI), γ-adaptin, FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), and mouse mAbs against α-mannosidase II (BAbCO, Berkeley, CA). Standard DNA procedures were performed according to Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Mori (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. The coding sequences of both stathmin and SCG10 were amplified by PCR using primers containing BamHI and XbaI extensions and then subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the corresponding sites for expression in COS-7 cells. A NH2-terminal truncated SCG10 construct ΔNSCG10 was generated by PCR starting from amino acid 35. A chimeric construct SCG-GAL containing the NH2-terminal region of SCG10 (amino acid 1-34) fused to the β-galactosidase polypeptide (amino acid 8-1001) was generated by PCR and in-frame ligation. A chimeric construct SCG-STAT containing the same NH2-terminal domain of SCG10 (amino acid 1-34) fused to the stathmin polypeptide (amino acid 3-150) was generated similarly. For experiments where exogenous expression had to be distinguished from endogenous expression in COS-7 cells, stathmin and SCG-STAT were epitope-tagged at the COOH terminus with a KT3 tag (TPPPEPET; Ref. 18Martin G.A.

COS-7 cells were grown in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed with the Bio-Rad electroporation system using 260 V and 960 microfarad. 15 μg of DNA were used for each transfection in electroporation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) at a cell density of 107/ml. After electroporation, the cells were plated on glass coverslips precoated with 1 mg/ml polyethyleneimine (Sigma) in 0.03 M borate buffer, pH 8.3, for immunofluorescent studies or on 100-mm Petri dishes for biochemical procedures. In some experiments, cells were treated with 10 μM nocodazole (Sigma) for 2 h and processed for immunocytochemistry. Cultures were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in sulfate buffer (90 mM Na2SO4, 30 mM K2SO4, 5.8 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 20 min and then rinsed with MTBS (66 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in MTBS containing 10% rat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4°C. After rinsing in MTBS, cells were incubated with either fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector, Peterborough, UK) for 30 min at room temperature. Wheat germ agglutinin was used at 2.5 μg/ml concomitantly with secondary antibodies. Cultures were rinsed in MTBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with Glu-Glu-tagged wild-type and mutated SCG10 constructs where cysteines 22 and 24 were individually or concomitantly substituted with alanines. 48 h after electroporation, cells were collected from 100-mm dishes, rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and labeled for 4 h at 37°C in 2 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 800 μCi of [3H]palmitate or [3H]myristate (DuPont NEN). Cells were then pelleted, rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 400 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM NaF) supplemented with a mixture of proteases inhibitors (complete tablet, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). SCG10 was then immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4°C with constant rotation using 50 μg/ml anti-GluGlu mouse mAbs. 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose/PBS (Pharmacia) were then added to the immunoprecipitation buffer, and samples were rotated for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, and proteins were eluted for 5 min at 95°C in 50 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were then electrophoresed in duplicates on 8-16% SDS-PAGE. The gels were processed either for 3H fluorography or for anti-SCG10 immunoblotting. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were allowed to grow for 48 h after electroporation. For the continuous sucrose gradient, four 10-cm diameter Petri dishes were used. The confluent monolayers were washed twice with PBS at 4°C, scraped in 2.5 ml of PBS, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm in a Heraeus 1.0 R megafuge at 4°C. After rinsing the cells in 2.5 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4), the cell pellet was recentrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm at 4°C. The cells were then resuspended in 0.4 ml of homogenization buffer and harvested by seven passages through a 22G 1 1/4 needle fitted on a 1-ml plastic syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm at 4°C, and the post-nuclear supernatant was collected (1 mg of total protein in 0.4 ml) and layered on a 4-ml continuous sucrose gradient poured from 45% (1.58 M) and 11.5% (0.35 M) sucrose solutions containing 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. The gradient was centrifuged for 17 h at 35′000 rpm at 4°C in a Beckman L8-80 ultracentrifuge using a SW60 rotor. Eight fractions of about 0.5 ml each were collected from the bottom using a peristaltic pump at low flow, and sucrose concentration was determined by refractometry. Samples were precipitated in 15-μg aliquots according to Wessel and Flügge (22Wessel D. Flügge U.I Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Google Scholar) and resuspended in sample buffer. For the cytosol membranes preparation, transiently transfected COS-7 cells were collected 48 h after electroporation and pelleted at 2000 × g for 5 min. The cells were then harvested by sonication in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine) and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 2 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Cytosol and membranes were prepared by centrifugation of the supernatants at 58,000 rpm (150,000 × g) for 40 min at 4°C in a TL100.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The pellets were washed three times and then resuspended to the same volume of homogenization buffer as the cytosol fraction. The samples were analyzed by SDS 8-16% PAGE and immunoblotted. Following electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblots were immersed in blocking solution consisting of 5% milk powder in PBS/0.15% Tween 20. Blots were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2.5% milk powder in PBS, and the signals were detected using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK). We generated a specific antiserum and mAbs against SCG10 to compare the subcellular localization of stathmin and SCG10 in PC12 cells and in transfected COS-7 cells. For stathmin, we obtained a rabbit antiserum from A. Sobel (INSERM, Paris). The specificity of the stathmin and SCG10 antibodies was tested on immunoblots where the stathmin antiserum specifically recognized bacterially produced rat stathmin and not SCG10 and the purified SCG10 antiserum as well as the mAb labeled specifically recombinant SCG10 and not stathmin (data not shown). When COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with a construct encoding stathmin, no staining was observed with the SCG10 antiserum in cells that highly expressed stathmin (Fig. 1, A and B). Both, purified SCG10 antiserum and mAbs gave indistinguishable staining patterns in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, C and D) and in PC12 cells (Fig. 2). Double immunostaining of PC12 cells demonstrated that stathmin was homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm as expected for a soluble protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the SCG10 mAbs recognized punctate structures in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2B). To investigate the nature of the punctate structures, we performed double stainings of PC12 cells with two markers of the Golgi complex: α-mannosidase II, a glycoprotein enriched in the cis/medial Golgi region (23Burke B. Griffiths G. Reggio H. Louvard D. Warren G. EMBO Journal. 1982; 1: 1621-1628Google Scholar) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that binds to N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid residues found predominantly in the trans Golgi apparatus/network (24Tartakoff A.M. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1243-1248Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C-F). SCG10 immunoreactivity colocalized with both markers, indicating that SCG10 is localized in the area of the Golgi complex.Fig. 2Localization of stathmin and SCG10 in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were treated with NGF for 24 h and double-stained with the rabbit antiserum directed to stathmin (A) and the mAb anti-SCG10 (B). The anti-SCG10 mAb does not cross-react with stathmin. Cells were stained with the rabbit serum anti-SCG10 (C and E) and counterstained with a mAb directed to the Golgi marker α-mannosidase II (D) and with FITC-coupled WGA (F).

Scale bar, 7.5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the subcellular localization of SCG10 in the Golgi complex region is mediated by an intrinsic feature of the structure of SCG10, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with both stathmin and SCG10 expression constructs (Fig. 3). To distinguish transfected stathmin from stathmin that was endogenously expressed at low levels in COS-7 cells, at the 3′ end of the stathmin cDNA, we added a fragment encoding the 6-amino acid epitope “Glu-Glu” (EYMPME; Ref. 19Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Google Scholar) or the KT3 epitope (TPPPEPET; Ref. 18Martin G.A. Viskochil D. Bollag G.

Walter G. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 483-491Google Scholar, 16Grussenmyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Google Scholar). No SCG10 immunoreactivity was observed in wild-type COS-7 cells stained with the SCG10 antiserum (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence staining of transfected COS-7 cells revealed distinct distribution patterns of stathmin and SCG10 as observed in the PC12 cells. Unlike stathmin, which was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A), SCG10 was highly concentrated in the region of the Golgi complex as shown by its colocalization with WGA and another marker of the trans Golgi compartment, γ-adaptin (25Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). SCG10 staining remained similar to that of WGA (Fig. 5, A and B) or γ-adaptin (Fig. 5, C and D) following disruption of the Golgi organization with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole (26Rogalsky A.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1092-1100Google Scholar). Although most of the structures were labeled with both SCG10 and the Golgi markers, a significant proportion showed a staining for SCG10 but not for the Golgi markers and conversely (Fig. 5, A-D). In PC12 cells, SCG10 remained colocalized with α-mannosidase II following nocodazole treatment, whereas brefeldin A (20 μg/ml, 20 min), which induces a breakdown of the Golgi stacks and a redistribution of resident Golgi proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (27Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Google Scholar, 28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Scale bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to further characterize the association of SCG10 with the Golgi apparatus, we employed a cell fractionation procedure based on a sucrose density gradient. Post-nuclear supernatants from transfected COS-7 cells were centrifuged on a continuous sucrose gradient ranging linearly from 37 to 12% (w/w), and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. SCG10 was enriched in heavy fractions, particularly in fractions 3 and 4 (32-28%), but significant amounts of the protein were detected in the other fractions (Fig. 6). The Golgi marker γ-adaptin showed a distribution comparable with that of SCG10 and was enriched in fractions 3-5, consistent with our previous immunofluorescent studies (Fig. 6). Total cellular proteins measured in each fraction show a distinct distribution (Fig. 6). SCG10-enriched fractions were then treated with high salt, nonionic detergent, and alkali in order to determine the nature of the association with Golgi membranes. Consistent with previous results obtained with SCG10-enriched smooth microsomes (2Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Google Scholar), the protein was completely extracted with 1% Triton X-100 but only partially with carbonate pH 11.4 (40-50%). No significant extraction with high salts (1.5 M) was observed (data not shown). SCG10 has a structural feature that is not present in stathmin (amino acid 1-34, Fig. 3). This NH2-terminal domain contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, which has been proposed to be responsible for membrane attachment of SCG10 (2Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Google Scholar). In order to address the question whether the differential localization of stathmin and SCG10 is mediated by this NH2-terminal region, we generated several plasmid constructs expressing both deletion and fusion proteins (Fig. 3). These were transfected into COS-7 cells and analyzed by double immunofluorescence. When COS-7 cells were transfected with a construct in which the NH2-terminal region of rat SCG10 (amino acids 1-34) was deleted, the truncated SCG10 molecule was found in the cytoplasm. The appearance was very similar to stathmin expression (Fig. 7). Therefore, removal of this domain led to a complete solubilization of the remaining region. This indicates that the first 34 amino acids of SCG10 contain information required for association with the Golgi complex. When COS-7 cells were transfected with a construct in which the NH2-terminal domain of SCG10 was fused in frame to stathmin, the chimeric stathmin molecule, just like SCG10, was concentrated in the region of the Golgi complex as revealed by colocalization with the Golgi marker WGA (Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the NH2-terminal domain of SCG10 contains information sufficient to target the otherwise cytosolic stathmin to this intracellular compartment. To further define the mechanism responsible for intracellular targeting of SCG10, we transfected COS-7 cells with a construct in which the NH2-terminal domain of SCG10 was fused to an unrelated protein, β-galactosidase. Although β-galactosidase had a diffuse cytosolic localization, the SCG10 (1Sobel A. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Chneiweiss H. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. J. Biol.

Antisense oligonucleotides directed against the mRNAs coding for alphaq, alpha11, beta1, beta3, gamma2, and gamma3 subunits selectively inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i activated by alpha1-adrenoreceptors. A corresponding reduction of the expression of these G protein subunits was immunochemically confirmed. In experiments performed in Ca2+-free solution only cells injected with anti-alphaq antisense oligonucleotides displayed a reduction of the alpha1-adrenoreceptor-induced Ca2+ release. In contrast, in Ca2+-containing solution, injection of anti-alpha11 antisense oligonucleotides suppressed the alpha1-adrenoreceptor-induced stimulation of the store-operated Ca2+ influx. Agents that specifically bound Gbetagamma subunits (anti-betacom antibody and overexpression of a beta-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl-terminal fragment) had no effect on the alpha1-adrenoreceptor-induced signal transduction. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha1-adrenoreceptors utilize two different Galpha subunits to increase [Ca2+]i. Galphaq may activate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and induce release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Galpha11 may enhance the Ca2+-activated Ca2+ influx that replenishes intracellular Ca2+ stores."

Using the yeast two-hybrid interaction system, we now provide evidence that Tax interacts with Ets1. Moreover, a double mutation (D22A,C23S) in the Tax protein that abrogated the Tax/Ets1 interaction also inhibited the Tax/Ets1 cooperative effect, suggesting that the interaction between Tax and Ets1 is important for transactivation of the PTHrP promoter. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, we find that Tax facilitates the interaction between Ets1 and Sp1, forming a ternary complex. When the Sp1 site in the PTHrP promoter was mutated, the Tax/Ets1 cooperative effect was dramatically decreased. This suggests that Sp1 plays an important role in the Ets1-dependent Tax transactivation of the PTHrP P2 promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that Gal4-Tax is a strong activator of the Gal PTHrP promoter, implying that Tax contributes directly to the transcriptional activation of the promoter. We propose a model in which the Tax/Ets1 cooperative effect on the PTHrP P2 promoter is based on the ability of Tax, Ets1, and Sp1 to form a ternary complex on the template DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2046913625,"We have previously examined, by alanine scanning mutagenesis, amino acids 515-535 of the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain to determine which of these residues are important in estradiol binding. Mutation at four sites that potentially lie along one face of an α-helix, Gly521, His524, Leu525, and Met528, all significantly impaired estradiol binding by the ER (Ekena, K., Weis, K. E., Katzenellenbogen, J. A., and Katzenellenbogen, B. S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 20053-20059). In this report, we compare the pattern of residues that are important in the recognition of several structurally diverse estrogen agonists and antagonists (the synthetic nonsteroidal agonist hexestrol, an agonist derived from the mold metabolite zearalenone, P1496, and the partial agonist-antagonist trans-hydroxytamoxifen) with those that are predicted to contact estradiol in the receptor-ligand complex. Although there are some similarities in the pattern of residue recognition among all four ligands, each ligand showed distinct differences as well. Interestingly, alanine substitution at only one residue, the leucine at position 525, was found to inhibit binding of all the ligands tested. Another residue, His524, was found to be important in the recognition of three different agonists but not trans-hydroxytamoxifen (the only ligand lacking a second hydroxyl group). The recognition of estradiol and another agonist, P1496, was impaired by the G521A mutation, whereas ligand-induced activity by the two compounds that lack B- and C-rings, hexestrol and trans-hydroxytamoxifen, was unaffected. Our findings demonstrate that these ligands fit into the ER ligand binding pocket differently and that each contacts a distinct set of amino acids. The smaller ligands (estradiol and hexestrol) have a narrower footprint of interacting residues than the larger ligands (P1496 and trans-hydroxytamoxifen). This pattern of interaction is most consistent with the amino acids within this region being in contact with the portion of these ligands that corresponds to the D-ring end of estradiol.

INTRODUCTIONEstrogens strongly influence the growth, differentiation, and functioning of the reproductive system, including the mammary gland and the uterus (1Katzenellenbogen B.S. Biol.

The effect of estrogen on the mammary gland is of particular interest because of its link to breast cancer; the proliferation and metastatic activity of nearly 40% of breast cancers are stimulated by estrogens (3Read L.D. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Genes, Oncogenes, and Hormones: Advances in Cellular and Molecular Biology of Breast Cancer.

A member of a superfamily of nuclear receptors, the estrogen receptor contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, domain C, and a highly conserved ligand-binding domain, domain E. In addition to its ligand binding activity, the E domain also possesses dimerization activity and a hormone-dependent activation function (AF-2). A hormone-independent activation function (AF-1) is located within the receptor's A/B domain. In the presence of ligand, the ER bound to an estrogen response element (ERE) can either activate or suppress transcription of a downstream target gene in a cell- and promoter-specific manner (4Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar–11Fujimoto N. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 296-304Google Scholar).Estrogen antagonists such as tamoxifen have been successfully used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers (3Read L.D. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Genes, Oncogenes, and Hormones: Advances in Cellular and Molecular Biology of Breast Cancer. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1991: 277-299Google Scholar, 12Wakeling A.E.

These antagonists compete with estradiol for binding to the receptor but fail to elicit transcriptional activity. Unfortunately, tamoxifen treatment has several drawbacks. First, tamoxifen is not a complete antagonist and has agonistic effects in certain cell and promoter contexts. Second, breast cancer cells often become resistant to this treatment (14Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 1434-1435Google Scholar). Finally, despite the need to inhibit ER activity in breast cancer cells, the retention of some ER activity is important in a number of other biological processes, including bone maintenance, the cardiovascular system, and liver metabolism (2Sarrel P.M. Lufkin E.G. Oursler M.J. Keefe D. Sci. Amer. Sci. Med. 1994; 1: 44-53Google Scholar). Thus, it becomes important to understand how the ER recognizes and interprets ligands of different structure, that is, which amino acids are involved in their binding, and thereby how these ligands might result in different activities in various cell types. Such information could then be used to design new estrogen agonists and antagonists with target cell- and response-selective biological effects.We and others have identified regions of the ER involved in recognition of ligand (15Harlow K.W. Smith D.N. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Greene G.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17476-17485Google Scholar–18Danielian P.S. White R. Hoare S.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 232-240Google Scholar). We have found amino acids near Cys530 to be important in estradiol binding, whereas residues C-terminal to position 535 have been shown to contain AF-2 activity (19Wrenn C.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24089-24098Google Scholar–21Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Google Scholar), and residues 507-514 may contain dimerization activity (20Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Google Scholar, 22Lees J.A. Fawell S.E. White R. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5529-5531Google Scholar). Recently, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis to identify those amino acids in the 515-535 region of the ER ligand binding domain important in estradiol binding (23Ekena K. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20053-20059Google Scholar). Mutation of the amino acids Gly521, His524, Leu525, and Met528 to alanine affected the ability of the ER to bind estradiol and had a parallel effect on estrogen-dependent transcription without affecting the overall activity of the receptor. These results, taken together with structural predictions based on crystal structures of other ligand-bound nuclear receptors, indicated that these four amino acids of the ER may lie along one face of an α-helix and are presumed to be in contact with the bound estradiol.In this report, we extend those studies to include four other estrogen agonists and antagonists with varied structures: the synthetic nonsteroidal agonist meso-hexestrol; P1496, an agonist derived from the mold metabolite zearalenone; the partial agonist-antagonist trans-hydroxytamoxifen; and the pure antagonist ICI. Interestingly, we observe that different amino acids in the 515-535 region of the ER are important in the recognition of these different ligands. Only one amino acid (Leu525) was found to be important in binding all of the ligands. By comparing the amino acids important in binding each of the ligands and comparing the ER amino acid sequence with other nuclear receptors and published crystal structures, we suggest which portion of these ligands are in contact with this region of the ER ligand binding pocket.DISCUSSIONWe have probed the interaction that various ligands have with a portion of the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER) by alanine scanning mutagenesis, studying in addition to estradiol the behavior of three high affinity ligands: two nonsteroidal agonists, the simple, symmetrical synthetic ligand meso-hexestrol, and P1496, a derivative of the fungal produced estrogen zearalenone, as well as the partial antagonist, trans-hydroxytamoxifen, the potent metabolite of tamoxifen. As in our earlier study with estradiol, we found that the substitution of certain residues in this ER region to alanine caused a significant to marked reduction in the potency of these ligands in inducing transcriptional activity. In addition, the principal finding from this study is that each of the ligands displayed a distinct footprint of interacting residues in the alanine scanning mutagenesis, indicating that the structural differences in these ligands result in different patterns of interaction with amino acids of the ER (Table I).We have confirmed that the alterations in ligand-induced transcriptional activity of the mutant receptors correspond to a dose shift (i.e. change in potency) in the transactivation response. Previously, with estradiol, we established that the decrease in transcription activation potency correlated well with a decreased binding affinity of estradiol to the mutant receptors (23Ekena K. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20053-20059Google Scholar). Thus, these interacting residues are considered to be ones that are important in determining the binding affinity of these ligands.The effects of mutational change at certain sites were of particular interest. First, the L525A mutation was the only mutation that strongly affected the transcriptional potency of all four ligands (Table I). However, P1496, the bulkiest of the ligands, was least affected, possibly because it may best be able to compensate for the reduced bulk in ER that results from the Leu to Ala mutation. Second, the H524A mutation had a very strong effect on hexestrol and P1496-induced ER activity and a major effect on estradiol but no effect on TOT. It is of note that TOT is the only ligand that lacks a second hydroxyl group with which this histidine may be interacting. Third, the G521A substitution strongly affected estradiol and P1496 transactivation yet had only a modest effect on TOT and no effect on hexestrol. As discussed later, the smaller size of certain portions of the hexestrol and TOT structures, compared with estradiol and P1496, might enable them to tolerate the increased residue size resulting from the G521A substitution. Fourth, the K520A, M522A, N532A, and P535A substitutions had an effect on TOT induced transactivation but did so by reducing the maximal transcriptional activity of the mutant ER-TOT complex rather than by shifting the dose response curve. This decreased transactivation potential suggests that these residues do not involve the binding interaction between TOT and ER but rather affect the manner in which the liganded complex interacts with other components important for activating transcription. It is interesting that certain specific contacts between TOT and ER appear to affect only its balance of agonist and antagonist activity (such as residues 520, 522, and 535), whereas others affect only its binding affinity (such as residues 515, 516, and 525).From our previous study on the effect of alanine scanning mutagenesis on the binding of estradiol and ligand-induced transactivation of the ER (23Ekena K. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20053-20059Google Scholar), we showed that the residues most affected by alanine substitution, Gly521, His524, Leu525, and Met528, could be displayed on three adjacent turns on one face of an α-helix. By sequence comparison with the human retinoic acid receptor-γ (RAR) and the rat thyroid hormone receptor-α1 (TR), these sites lie on the inner face of helix-11 and correspond to residues in the RAR-retinoic acid (RA) and TR-thyroid hormone (T3) structures that are in close contact with the bound ligands (32Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Google Scholar, 33Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Google Scholar). In the case of RAR-RA, these residues are in contact with the apolar end of the ligand, the β-ionone portion, and in the case of TR-T3, these residues contact the distal phenolic ring, with His381 in TR (corresponding to Gly521 in ER), making a hydrogen bond to the distal phenolic hydroxyl group.In this study, we find that the pattern of residues in the 515-535 region of ER that affect ligand-induced transcription differs depending on the structure of the activating ligand. A comparison of the structures of these ligands (Fig. 1) together with their interacting residues (Table I) allows one to formulate a model for the basic orientation of these ligands within the binding cavity of the ER (Fig. 6). By analogy with the TR-T3 and RAR-RA structures, this model shows the 515-535 region of ER as a helical region (corresponding to a portion of helix-10 and all of helix-11) and the beginning of the loop region between helix-11 and −12. The residues that affect the transcriptional potency of each of the four ligands are indicated schematically with circles. The helix and loop of ER and the structures of the ligands are presented on the same dimensional scale to illustrate the differential interaction that these four ligands have with the ER.The four activating ligands, estradiol, hexestrol, P1496, and TOT, all have one common structural feature, a phenol, yet they show different patterns of residues whose substitution with alanine affects their transcriptional potency. These differences suggest that the ligands are not making contact with the 515-535 portion of the ER through their structurally common A-ring like feature. The rather narrow footprint of residues that affect hexestrol recognition (principally two residues, His524 and Leu525, on one turn of the helix) suggests that contact is being made with a portion of the hexestrol structure that is narrower than the corresponding region in estradiol (whose potency is affected principally by three residues, Gly521, His524, and Leu525, on two helical turns). In contrast, the much wider footprint of residues that affect P1496 binding (four or more residues on at least three turns) suggests that their interaction is with a region of the ligand that is larger than the corresponding region in estradiol. Thus, if the phenol rings of these three ligands are oriented similarly and away from the 515-535 region, then it is the D-ring end of estradiol and the corresponding narrower region of hexestrol and the wider region of P1496 that are likely to be in contact with this region of the ER.The pattern of residues that affect the transcriptional potency of TOT is rather unique. The interaction of TOT with the middle of the helical region is limited. In particular, its lack of interaction with His524 suggests that in lacking a second hydroxyl group, TOT is indifferent to the hydrogen bonding characteristics of the residue at this site. On the other hand, TOT is the only ligand whose transcriptional potency is affected by residues near the N terminus of the examined region (Arg515 and His516), suggesting that its side chain may extend to be in contact with this region of the receptor.Altogether, the comparison of ligand structure with the pattern of residues where mutation affects their transcriptional potency suggests that selected residues in the 515-535 region of the receptor are in contact with a portion of these ligands that corresponds to the D-ring end of estradiol. Thus, a rough comparison can be made between the orientation of these estrogens in ER and the RA and T3 ligands in RAR and TR, respectively. It is the D-ring end of estradiol that corresponds to the apolar end of RA and the phenol of T3 that is in contact with the helix-11 region of these nuclear receptors. The A-ring or phenolic portion of the estrogen ligands, which corresponds to the polar end of the RA and T3 ligands, is directed away from helix-11.It is well recognized now that the ER and related nuclear receptors show transcriptional activity that is modulated by the nature of the particular gene promoter and the cellular background, consistent with ligand-receptor interaction with cell- and promoter-specific factors and transcriptional coactivators (5Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Google Scholar, 34Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Google Scholar). The interplay between the shape of an ER ligand and the residues that support its binding to ER, as studied here, may potentially underlie the selective actions of different ER ligands in various target cells and promoter contexts.

https://openalex.org/W1981099194,"Plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) vary over 1000-fold between individuals and are determined by the gene for its unique apolipoprotein, apo(a), which has greater than 100 alleles. Using primary baboon hepatocyte cultures, we previously demonstrated that differences in the ability of apo(a) allelic variants to escape the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are a major determinant of Lp(a) production rate. To examine the reason for these differences, the folding of newly synthesized apo(a) was analyzed in pulse-chase experiments. Samples were harvested in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide to preserve disulfide-bonded folding intermediates, and apo(a) was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Apo(a) required a prolonged period (30-60 min) to reach its fully oxidized form. Multiple folding intermediates were resolved, including a disulfide-linked, apo(a)-containing complex. Unexpectedly, all allelic variants examined showed similar patterns and kinetics of folding. Even “null” apo(a) proteins, which are unable to exit the ER, appeared to fold normally. The ER glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, prevented apo(a) secretion, but did not inhibit folding. This suggests that an event which is dependent on trimming of N-linked glucoses, and which occurs after the folding events detectable in our assay, is required for apo(a) secretion. Differences in the ability to undergo this event may explain the variable efficiency with which apo(a) allelic variants exit the ER. Plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) vary over 1000-fold between individuals and are determined by the gene for its unique apolipoprotein, apo(a), which has greater than 100 alleles. Using primary baboon hepatocyte cultures, we previously demonstrated that differences in the ability of apo(a) allelic variants to escape the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are a major determinant of Lp(a) production rate. To examine the reason for these differences, the folding of newly synthesized apo(a) was analyzed in pulse-chase experiments. Samples were harvested in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide to preserve disulfide-bonded folding intermediates, and apo(a) was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Apo(a) required a prolonged period (30-60 min) to reach its fully oxidized form. Multiple folding intermediates were resolved, including a disulfide-linked, apo(a)-containing complex. Unexpectedly, all allelic variants examined showed similar patterns and kinetics of folding. Even “null” apo(a) proteins, which are unable to exit the ER, appeared to fold normally. The ER glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, prevented apo(a) secretion, but did not inhibit folding. This suggests that an event which is dependent on trimming of N-linked glucoses, and which occurs after the folding events detectable in our assay, is required for apo(a) secretion. Differences in the ability to undergo this event may explain the variable efficiency with which apo(a) allelic variants exit the ER.

Lp(a) is composed of low density lipoprotein in which apoB is attached to apo(a) by disulfide linkage (1Berg K. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1963; 59: 369-382Google Scholar, 2Utermann G. Science. 1989; 246: 904-910Google Scholar). As many as 34 different isoforms of apo(a) have been identified in human plasma, which vary in size from <300 to >800 kDa (3Lackner C. Cohen J.C.

Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 603-613Google Scholar). Apo(a) has a highly complex, repetitive structure and is homologous with plasminogen (7McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar). Apo(a) contains an inactive copy of the plasminogen protease domain and a single plasminogen kringle 5 (K5) domain, preceded by multiple domains with homology to plasminogen K4 (7McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar). The size variation of apo(a) is due to differences in the number of K4 domains encoded in the apo(a) gene (8Gavish D. Azrolan N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin.

Each K4 repeat contains 3 internal disulfide bonds, 1 N-linked, and 6 potential O-linked glycosylation sites (7McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M.

Lp(a) is only found in the plasma of primates (12Makino K. Scanu A.M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 679-683Google Scholar) and the hedgehog (13Laplaud P.M. Beaubatie L. Rall Jr., S.C. Luc G. Saboureau M. J.

In humans, plasma levels of Lp(a) vary from <1 to >100 mg/dl and are highly heritable (15Gaubatz J.W. Cushing G.L. Morrisett J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 167-186Google Scholar). High plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (for review, see Ref. 16Scanu A.M. Fless G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1709-1715Google Scholar). Greater than 90% of the inter-individual variation in Lp(a) concentration is attributable to the apo(a) gene locus (17Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Google Scholar). There is an inverse correlation between apo(a) size and plasma Lp(a) level (5Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C. Kemmler H.G. Seitz C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 458-465Google Scholar, 6Gaubatz J.W. Ghanem K.I. Guevara Jr., J. Nava M.L. Patsch W. Morrisett J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 603-613Google Scholar, 10Lackner C. Boerwinkle E.

Invest. 1991; 87: 2153-2161Google Scholar), and a particular isoform size may be associated with as much as a 200-fold difference in plasma Lp(a) concentrations in different individuals (19Perombelon Y.F.N. Soutar A.K. Knight B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1481-1492Google Scholar). Thus, sequence variations at the apo(a) locus independent of size also influence Lp(a) levels (20Cohen J.C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1630-1636Google Scholar). “Null” apo(a) alleles, which do not give rise to any detectable plasma protein (5Utermann G. Menzel H.J. Kraft H.G. Duba H.C.

Invest. 1993; 91: 1630-1636Google Scholar). However, as yet, no identified polymorphism other than K4 number has been demonstrated to directly influence circulating Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) is synthesized by the liver (32Tomlinson J.E. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Google Scholar, 33Kraft H.G. Menzel H.J. Hoppichler F. Vogel W. Utermann G. J. Clin.

Some of the variation in Lp(a) production rate is determined by differences in hepatic apo(a) mRNA concentration (9Hixson J.E. Britten M.L. Manis G.S. Rainwater D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6013-6016Google Scholar, 38Azrolan N. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Google Scholar). “Transcript negative null” alleles that do not produce any detectable hepatic apo(a) mRNA transcript (9Hixson J.E. Britten M.L. Manis G.S. Rainwater D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6013-6016Google Scholar, 39White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Hixson J.E. Estlack L.E. Lanford R.E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67/68: 123-133Google Scholar) represent an extreme example of this type of regulation. Post-transcriptional mechanisms are also important (38Azrolan N. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Google Scholar). A sequence polymorphism in the 5′-untranslated region of human apo(a) was recently shown to influence the translation efficiency of apo(a) mRNA in vitro (31Zysow B.R. Lindahl G.E. Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Lawn R.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 58-64Google Scholar). Baboons show very similar characteristics to humans in terms of plasma Lp(a) levels and apo(a) isoform sizes (40Rainwater D.L. Manis G.S. VandeBerg J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 549-558Google Scholar, 41Rainwater D.L. Manis G.S. Kushwaha R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 75-78Google Scholar). We have established primary cultures of baboon hepatocytes as a model system for the analysis of Lp(a) biogenesis (34Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 30-35Google Scholar). Since hepatocytes can be isolated from animals with selected Lp(a) phenotypes, this provides us with a unique opportunity to examine the influence of apo(a) allelic variation on Lp(a) production rate. Using this system, we have demonstrated that, in comparison to other secretory proteins, newly synthesized apo(a) has a prolonged residence time in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before it is processed to its mature form and transported to the cell surface (21White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Google Scholar, 39White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Hixson J.E. Estlack L.E. Lanford R.E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67/68: 123-133Google Scholar, 42White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Google Scholar, 43White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Google Scholar). Differences in the efficiency with which apo(a) allelic variants undergo post-translational processing accounts, at least partially, for the inverse correlation between apo(a) size and plasma Lp(a) level (21White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Google Scholar). In addition, “transcript positive null” apo(a) phenotypes, in which there is no detectable plasma Lp(a), but which are associated with substantial levels of apo(a) mRNA in the liver (9Hixson J.E. Britten M.L. Manis G.S. Rainwater D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6013-6016Google Scholar, 39White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Hixson J.E. Estlack L.E. Lanford R.E. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67/68: 123-133Google Scholar), are explained by the production of defective apo(a) proteins that are unable to exit the ER and are retained and degraded inside the cell (21White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Google Scholar). Thus, the efficiency with which apo(a) leaves the ER is a major determinant of plasma Lp(a) levels. The ER lumen provides a specialized environment to promote the folding and assembly of newly synthesized transmembrane and secretory proteins. Misfolded and unassembled proteins are retained and degraded in the ER (44Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar). Considering the complex structure of the apo(a) glycoprotein, we hypothesized that the long ER residence time of apo(a) may be due to the extended time required to reach its correct conformation. Differences in the proficiency with which apo(a) allelic variants fold may account for their varying abilities to escape the ER. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the folding of a number of apo(a) allelic variants in the ER. [35S]Cysteine and Expre35S35S label were from DuPont NEN. Protein A-agarose was from Repligen Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Sheep anti-human apoB was from Boehringer Mannheim, and goat anti-human Lp(a) was from Biodesign (Kennebunkport, ME). Methionine and cysteine-free Williams medium E was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Tunicamycin was from Sigma, and castanospermine and deoxymannojirimycin were from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (45Lanford R.E. Carey K.D. Estlack L.E. Smith G.C. Hay R.V. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 174-182Google Scholar). Lobectomy was performed according to institutional guidelines under general anesthesia; ketamine hydrochloride was used as an immobilizing agent, and anesthesia was maintained with sodium pentobarbital. Analgesics were provided 48 h post-operatively. Cells were cultured in a serum-free medium (SFM) formulation (formula III) as described previously (43White A.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28716-28723Google Scholar), except for the omission of thyrotropin releasing factor. All experiments were performed using confluent 60-mm dishes of cells, which had been in culture for 5-7 days. Apo(a) isoforms in the baboon are classified into 12 size groups; A, the largest, through L, the smallest (40Rainwater D.L. Manis G.S. VandeBerg J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 549-558Google Scholar). Hepatocytes from seven different animals were analyzed. Two animals expressed an I apo(a) isoform (plasma Lp(a) levels of 34 (Fig. 1) and 30 mg/dl (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7)). Three animals expressed an A isoform (19 mg/dl, Fig. 2C; 20 mg/dl, Fig. 2D; 17 mg/dl, Fig. 3), and one expressed a C isoform (34 mg/dl, Fig. 2B). Two animals (Fig. 4) had plasma Lp(a) levels <2 mg/dl and no apo(a) detectable in their plasma by immunoblotting. Northern analysis of hepatic RNA from these null phenotype animals revealed a single apo(a) mRNA species in each case, which gave rise to apo(a) proteins approximately the size of an I isoform.Fig. 2Folding of apo(a) after post-translational reduction. Hepatocytes expressing the following apo(a) isoforms were analyzed; A = I; B = C; C = A; D = A. Cells were labeled for 1 h with 125 μCi/ml each of [35S]cysteine and Expre35S35S label. During the last 5 min of incubation, 5 mM DTT was added to the culture media. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and chased for up to 60 min (A) or 120 min (B-D) before harvest in the presence of NEM. Apo(a) was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by 3-10% SDS-PAGE, with or without prior reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. For each experiment, an additional 0 time point was included, and the sample was immunoprecipitated with preimmune goat serum (NS) to control for the specificity of the apo(a) antibody.

Culture media were clarified at 2000 × g for 10 min and adjusted to 1% Nonidet P-40. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 2 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 9.0). To analyze the influence of glycosylation inhibitors on apo(a) maturation and secretion, hepatocytes were preincubated for 1 h in methionine and cysteine-free SFM in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), castanospermine, or deoxymannojirimycin (1 mM each). The cells were then labeled for 30 min in the same media containing 125 μCi/ml each of [35S]cysteine and Expre35S35S label and then chased in complete SFM plus drugs for 5 h. Culture media and cells were harvested as described above. Apo(a) folding was initially analyzed essentially as described by Braakman et al. (46Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were preincubated for 1 h in methionine and cysteine-free SFM and then labeled for 10 min in the same medium containing 125 μCi/ml each of [35S]cysteine and Expre35S35S label. The cells were then either harvested immediately or were washed once with PBS and chased for various periods in complete SFM containing 0.5 mM cycloheximide. To harvest, the cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and then lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer containing 20 mM NEM. In later experiments, this protocol was modified to optimize detection of apo(a) folding intermediates. The experiments were performed as described above, except that the cells were labeled for 1 h. Five minutes before the end of labeling, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the cultures. The hepatocytes were then washed twice with PBS, chased, and harvested, as above. Samples were immunoprecipitated exactly as described previously (42White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Google Scholar). Prior to electrophoresis, immunoprecipitates were heated to 100°C for 5 min in gel sample buffer with (reduced samples) or without (nonreduced samples) 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved by 3-10% SDS-PAGE and fluorography (42White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates were resolved by 3-10% SDS-PAGE, either with or without prior reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and immunoblotted for apo(a), exactly as described previously (42White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Google Scholar). Apo(a) folding was initially analyzed using a pulse-chase protocol, essentially as described by Braakman et al. (46Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Google Scholar). Baboon hepatocytes were labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine and cysteine and chased for 0, 10, 30, or 60 min in unlabeled medium. Cells were lysed in the presence of the alkylating agent, NEM, to preserve partially disulfide-bonded apo(a) folding intermediates, and apo(a) was immunoprecipitated and analyzed, with or without prior reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, by 3-10% SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 shows results obtained with hepatocytes expressing a low molecular weight apo(a) isoform (I isoform), the mature form of which has a molecular mass similar to that of apoB (550 kDa). When samples were analyzed after reduction, a single apo(a) protein, representing the newly synthesized apo(a) precursor, could be seen at the 0, 10, and 30 min time points. At 60 min, the fully glycosylated, mature form of apo(a) also appeared (Fig. 1). Mature apo(a) contains fully processed N-linked and O-linked glycans, and its appearance is a marker for movement of apo(a) out of the ER and through the Golgi apparatus (42White A.L. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 509-517Google Scholar). Densitometric scanning of the autoradiograph determined that 13% of apo(a) was in the mature form at 60 min, consistent with our previous studies in which we analyzed apo(a) proteins of similar size (21White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Google Scholar). An almost undetectable decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the reduced apo(a) precursor was observed with increasing chase times (Fig. 1). Control experiments established that this was due to decreased binding of NEM at later time points as a result of increased intramolecular disulfide formation. NEM presumably increases the electrophoretic mobility of apo(a) by enhancing binding of SDS through electrostatic interaction. When analyzed under nonreducing conditions, a single form of apo(a) was again seen immediately after the pulse (Fig. 1). Nonreduced apo(a) exhibited an increased mobility in comparison to the fully reduced protein, indicating some limited co-translational disulfide bond formation (46Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Google Scholar, 47Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of nonreduced apo(a) increased at later chase times, reflecting the formation of further disulfide bonds. At the 30-min time point, a form of apo(a) with a greatly decreased mobility also appeared (comp., Fig. 1). Control immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting experiments (see below) confirmed that this band contains apo(a). Since it disappears upon reduction, it most likely represents a disulfide-linked complex of apo(a) with itself or with another protein(s). While in this form, apo(a) apparently continued to fold, since the mobility of the complex also increased with time (Fig. 1, and see below). The mobility of monomeric apo(a) did not reach a maximum until 60 min of chase, concomitant with the appearance of the mature protein. Mature apo(a) had a mobility between that of the precursor's monomeric and complexed forms (Fig. 1). In comparison to other characterized secretory proteins, apo(a) has a greatly prolonged ER residence time. These data demonstrate that the long ER residence time of apo(a) coincides with a prolonged period required for apo(a) to fold. Due to the short labeling time required, the above folding assay was not sensitive enough to resolve folding intermediates of most apo(a) variants. Secretory proteins in the ER of living cells can be rapidly reduced by addition of the membrane-permeable reducing agent, DTT (48Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Google Scholar). This effect is reversible; on removal of DTT, the reduced proteins fold and are secreted normally (47Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Google Scholar, 48Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Google Scholar, 49Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol."

INTRODUCTIONThe OX40 antigen was defined in the rat as an antigen with a highly restricted distribution being present only on activated rat CD4+ T lymphocytes and absent from resting lymphocytes and other tissues (1Paterson D.J. Jefferies W.A. Green J.R. Brandon M.R. Corthesy P. Puklavec M. Williams A.F. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 1281-1290Google Scholar). In the mouse OX40 is present on both CD4+- and CD8+-activated T cells (2Calderhead D.M. Buhlmann J.E. Van den Eertwegh A. Claassen E. Noelle R.J. Fell H.P. J.

It is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose extracellular portion contains three cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids (4Mallett S. Fossum S. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1063-1068Google Scholar). Similar repeats are found in the extracellular parts of several other membrane glycoproteins, including the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor, two receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNFR) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFRtumor necrosis factor receptorTNFtumor necrosis factorOX40LOX40 ligandsOX40soluble OX40CHOChinese hamster ovarymAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRUresponse units. and the leukocyte antigens CD40, CD27, CD30, 4-1BB, and Fas (CD95) that make up the TNFR superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 5Barclay A.N.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 407-413Google Scholar). The structure of the TNFR I shows that the cysteine-rich repeats form a linear array of small domains, which comprise the binding site for TNF (7Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Google Scholar).The ligands of the TNFR superfamily members, with the exception of nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins, also share sequence similarity (∼15-36%) in what is now known as the TNF superfamily. These proteins are type II membrane proteins, and their similarity is confined to the COOH-terminal extracellular domains, which are often released as soluble proteins by proteolysis (reviewed in Refs. 6Armitage R.J.

Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Google Scholar). The OX40L is involved in T cell help for B cells in the development of IgG responses (14Stuber E. Neurath M. Calderhead D. Fell H.P. Strober W. Immunity. 1995; 2: 507-521Google Scholar, 15Stuber E. Strober W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 979-989Google Scholar). The quaternary organization of OX40L is unknown, although sequence similarity with other members of the TNF superfamily suggests that it is likely to form a homotrimer. However, another member of this superfamily, 4-1BB ligand, forms a disulfide-linked homodimer (16Goodwin R.G. Din W.S. DavisSmith T. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Brannan C.I.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 2631-2641Google Scholar), indicating that there exists heterogeneity in the quaternary structure among members of this superfamily.A recombinant soluble OX40L-Fc fusion protein binds OX40 on activated T cells (3Al-Shamkhani A.

Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Clifford K.N. Alderson M.R. Goodwin R.G. Fanslow W.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3992-4001Google Scholar), but the strength of binding could not be quantified, because the effect on the avidity brought about by the dimeric Fc portion of the OX40L-Fc construct could not be estimated. We have expressed a soluble recombinant protein containing the COOH-terminal extracellular domain of OX40L fused to domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4. The CD4 portion of the fusion protein has been used previously as a tag to generate monomeric fusion proteins, including several different domain types (17Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Google Scholar). Using the soluble CD4-OX40L (sCD4-OX40L) fusion protein, we have studied the affinity and kinetics of the OX40L binding to OX40 using (i) conventional radiolabeled ligand binding studies to activated T cells and (ii) the BIAcore™ biosensor, which detects macromolecular interactions in real time using the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (18Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar, 19Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Google Scholar, 20van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Google Scholar). We have also investigated the affinity and kinetics of sOX40 binding to immobilized OX40L, as soluble forms of several TNFR superfamily members, including both TNFR I and TNFR II (21Engelmann H. Novick D. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1531-1536Google Scholar, 22Porteu F. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 599-607Google Scholar), CD27 (23Hintzen R.Q. De Jong R. Hack C.E. Chamuleau M. De Vries E. Ten Berge I. Borst J. Van Lier R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 29-35Google Scholar), and CD30 (24Del Prete G. Maggi E. Pizzolo G. Romagnani S. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 76-80Google Scholar) are released from the cell surface by proteolysis, and any functional effects of the soluble receptors will be limited by their monomeric affinities.DISCUSSIONWe have studied the interaction between OX40 and its ligand using soluble recombinant proteins and a combination of biosensor technology and conventional radioligand binding studies. The finding that sCD4-OX40L is a trimer suggests that membrane-bound OX40L and native soluble OX40L, if it exists, will also form trimers. This is consistent with the determined stoichiometry of 3.1:1 for the interaction of sOX40 with immobilized trimeric sCD4-OX40L. The fact that sCD4-OX40L binds to immobilized sOX40 and to OX40 expressed on activated T cells with a much higher apparent affinity than when monomeric sOX40 binds immobilized sCD4-OX40L is also consistent with the existence of a trimeric form of the OX40L. The increase in the overall affinity of the trimeric sCD4-OX40L is primarily due to a decrease (∼500-fold) in the koff. The apparent affinity of the interaction between sCD4-OX40L and OX40 expressed on the surface of activated T cells (KD∼ 0.2-0.4 nM) obtained by either equilibrium binding or kinetic measurements at 4°C is very similar to that of the TNF-α interaction with TNFR I/II (34Loetscher H. Pan Y.-C.E. Lahm H.-W. Gentz R. Brockhaus M. Tabuchi H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1990; 61: 351-359Google Scholar, 35Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D. Goodwin R.G. Science. 1990; 248: 1019-1023Google Scholar), but is approximately 10-fold higher than that obtained from the BIAcore measurements. In the BIAcore experiments the direct immobilization of sOX40 on the dextran matrix may limit the possible orientations of sOX40 and hence the observed kinetics may represent a dimeric interaction. In contrast, the slower dissociation of sCD4-OX40L from cells is consistent with a trimeric interaction.The soluble monomeric form of the rat OX40 molecule, containing the cysteine-rich domains, binds to immobilized trimeric mouse OX40L (sCD4-OX40L) with low affinity (KD = 190 nM) and dissociates relatively quickly (t1/2 = 35 s). To our knowledge, direct affinity and kinetic measurements of the interaction between soluble forms of other members of the TNFR superfamily and their ligands have not been reported, and thus we do not know whether these results are representative of other members of this superfamily. A soluble form of the TNFR II was estimated to be∼ 1000-fold less effective than the dimeric TNFR II-Fc in inhibiting a functional assay for TNF (36Mohler K.M. Torrance D.S. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Stremler K.E. Fung V.P. Madani H. Widmer M.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1548-1561Google Scholar). The sTNFR was only about 50-fold less effective in an inhibition binding assay although kinetic analysis was not carried out.The low dissociation rate of the trimer from cell surfaces makes reversal of the interaction very slow and it seems likely that a general mechanism for reversal is the cleavage of the receptor, together with any bound ligand, from the cell surface as observed for several members of the TNFR superfamily (21Engelmann H. Novick D. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1531-1536Google Scholar–24Del Prete G. Maggi E. Pizzolo G. Romagnani S. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 76-80Google Scholar). If OX40 is also released from the cell surface, our results suggest that sOX40 will not act as an antagonist of OX40L because of its low affinity. It is not known whether OX40L acts as a soluble protein and/or as a cell surface protein but this shedding mechanism would also provide a mechanism of terminating the interaction between membrane-bound OX40L and OX40 on activated T cells. The role of natural soluble forms of the TNFR superfamily members in vivo remains unknown but Mohler et al. (36Mohler K.M. Torrance D.S. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Stremler K.E. Fung V.P. Madani H. Widmer M.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1548-1561Google Scholar) showed that injection of soluble TNFR II into mice did not protect them from the lethal effect of LPS, whereas a dimeric TNFR II-Fc chimeric protein gave good levels of protection. These results suggest that soluble TNFR II does not function as an antagonist in vivo.In conclusion, our results indicate that the OX40/OX40L complex will have a similar overall structure to that of TNFR I/TNF-β complex (7Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Google Scholar), namely, that three OX40 molecules interact with a single OX40L trimer. However, receptor dimerization rather than trimerization was shown to be sufficient for inducing the biological effects of TNF (37Bazzoni F. Alejos E. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5376-5380Google Scholar, 38Adam D. Keßler U. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17482-17487Google Scholar). This will probably apply also to OX40 as cross-linking with the MRC OX40 mAb is known to enhance the proliferation of activated T cells in vitro (1Paterson D.J. Jefferies W.A. Green J.R. Brandon M.R.

Furthermore, the kinetics of binding and dissociation of sCD4-OX40L are comparable with those of F(ab′)2 fragments of many known mAbs (33Mason D.W. Williams A.F. Weir D.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. 1. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1986: 38.1-38.17Google Scholar), but contrasts with the low affinity of the monomeric receptor binding to ligand. Thus the soluble receptor is unlikely to have functional effects in contrast to the high affinity ligand. INTRODUCTIONThe OX40 antigen was defined in the rat as an antigen with a highly restricted distribution being present only on activated rat CD4+ T lymphocytes and absent from resting lymphocytes and other tissues (1Paterson D.J. Jefferies W.A. Green J.R. Brandon M.R. Corthesy P. Puklavec M. Williams A.F. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 1281-1290Google Scholar). In the mouse OX40 is present on both CD4+- and CD8+-activated T cells (2Calderhead D.M. Buhlmann J.E. Van den Eertwegh A. Claassen E. Noelle R.J. Fell H.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5261-5271Google Scholar, 3Al-Shamkhani A. Birkeland M.L. Puklavec M. Brown M.H. James W. Barclay A.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1695-1699Google Scholar). It is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose extracellular portion contains three cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids (4Mallett S. Fossum S. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1063-1068Google Scholar). Similar repeats are found in the extracellular parts of several other membrane glycoproteins, including the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor, two receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNFR) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFRtumor necrosis factor receptorTNFtumor necrosis factorOX40LOX40 ligandsOX40soluble OX40CHOChinese hamster ovarymAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRUresponse units. and the leukocyte antigens CD40, CD27, CD30, 4-1BB, and Fas (CD95) that make up the TNFR superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 5Barclay A.N. Beyers A. Birkeland M.L. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Somoza C. Williams A.F. Leucocyte Antigens Factsbook. Academic Press, London1993Google Scholar and 6Armitage R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 407-413Google Scholar). The structure of the TNFR I shows that the cysteine-rich repeats form a linear array of small domains, which comprise the binding site for TNF (7Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Google Scholar).The ligands of the TNFR superfamily members, with the exception of nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins, also share sequence similarity (∼15-36%) in what is now known as the TNF superfamily. These proteins are type II membrane proteins, and their similarity is confined to the COOH-terminal extracellular domains, which are often released as soluble proteins by proteolysis (reviewed in Refs. 6Armitage R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 407-413Google Scholar and 8Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Google Scholar). Structural studies on TNF-α (9Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol.

Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Google Scholar), and CD40 ligand (11Karpusas M. Hsu Y.-M. Wang J.-H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1031-1039Google Scholar) show that they form homotrimers with a characteristic “jelly roll”β-sandwich. The stoichiometry of the interaction between TNFR I and TNF-β trimer is three to one (7Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Google Scholar).The OX40 ligand (OX40L) is expressed on the surface of activated B (2Calderhead D.M. Buhlmann J.E. Van den Eertwegh A. Claassen E. Noelle R.J. Fell H.P. J.

Maeda M. Imamura S. Uchiyama T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2185-2195Google Scholar). The OX40L is involved in T cell help for B cells in the development of IgG responses (14Stuber E. Neurath M. Calderhead D. Fell H.P. Strober W. Immunity. 1995; 2: 507-521Google Scholar, 15Stuber E. Strober W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 979-989Google Scholar). The quaternary organization of OX40L is unknown, although sequence similarity with other members of the TNF superfamily suggests that it is likely to form a homotrimer. However, another member of this superfamily, 4-1BB ligand, forms a disulfide-linked homodimer (16Goodwin R.G. Din W.S. DavisSmith T. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Farrah T. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Smith C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2631-2641Google Scholar), indicating that there exists heterogeneity in the quaternary structure among members of this superfamily.A recombinant soluble OX40L-Fc fusion protein binds OX40 on activated T cells (3Al-Shamkhani A. Birkeland M.L. Puklavec M. Brown M.H. James W. Barclay A.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1695-1699Google Scholar, 12Baum P.R. Gayle R.B. Ramsdell F. Srinivasan S. Sorensen R.A. Watson M.L. Seldin M.F. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Clifford K.N. Alderson M.R. Goodwin R.G. Fanslow W.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3992-4001Google Scholar), but the strength of binding could not be quantified, because the effect on the avidity brought about by the dimeric Fc portion of the OX40L-Fc construct could not be estimated. We have expressed a soluble recombinant protein containing the COOH-terminal extracellular domain of OX40L fused to domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4. The CD4 portion of the fusion protein has been used previously as a tag to generate monomeric fusion proteins, including several different domain types (17Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Google Scholar). Using the soluble CD4-OX40L (sCD4-OX40L) fusion protein, we have studied the affinity and kinetics of the OX40L binding to OX40 using (i) conventional radiolabeled ligand binding studies to activated T cells and (ii) the BIAcore™ biosensor, which detects macromolecular interactions in real time using the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (18Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar, 19Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Google Scholar, 20van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Google Scholar). We have also investigated the affinity and kinetics of sOX40 binding to immobilized OX40L, as soluble forms of several TNFR superfamily members, including both TNFR I and TNFR II (21Engelmann H. Novick D. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1531-1536Google Scholar, 22Porteu F. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 599-607Google Scholar), CD27 (23Hintzen R.Q. De Jong R. Hack C.E. Chamuleau M.

Today. 1995; 16: 76-80Google Scholar) are released from the cell surface by proteolysis, and any functional effects of the soluble receptors will be limited by their monomeric affinities."

The ARF-dependent nuclear PLD activity was increased in the S-phase of the regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy and also was much higher in AH 7974 cells than in the resting rat liver. In contrast, the levels of the oleate-dependent PLD activity remained constant throughout the cell cycle in liver regeneration. The intranuclear levels of the stimulating proteins of the nuclear PLD activity, e.g. ARF, RhoA, and protein kinase Cδ increased in the S-phase of the regenerating liver.

When expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, all three receptors accumulated at the basolateral cell surface showing that they carry the corresponding targeting signals.

The population of Gs proteins involved in this mechanism was different from that involved in signal transduction since neither FSH nor forskolin mimicked the effects of AlF4− and cholera toxin.

Endocrinol. 1996; 148: 435-446Google Scholar). The question was thus raised as to whether these differences in cellular distribution were due to differences in the structure of receptors or simply secondary to the fact that thyroid follicular cells and Sertoli cells are polarized, whereas the LH receptor-expressing cells are not polarized. Another question raised was whether the mechanisms of receptor basolateral delivery were cell-specific or whether the receptors contained specific signals that could direct them to this membrane compartment in any polarized cell. To answer these questions we have established MDCK cell lines that express the FSH, LH, and TSH receptors. Using these models we have analyzed the distribution of the receptors in polarized monolayers. MDCK cells (type II) were seeded and grown on coverslips (Nunc) or filters (0.4-μm polycarbonate, tissue culture-treated, Transwell costar) as described previously (24Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Google Scholar, 26Vu Hai M.T. Jolivet A. Jallal B. Salesse R. Bidard J.M. Houllier A. Guiochon-Mantel A. Garnier J. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2090-2098Google Scholar, 35Misrahi M. Loosfelt H. Atger M. Sar S. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 394-403Google Scholar). Cell stimulation was achieved with 50 nM hCG (Organon), 50 nM FSH (Serono), or 1 mUI/ml TSH (bovine TSH, UCB). Polarized monolayers of cells grown on 24-mm filters were studied after 2, 3, or 4 days of culture. The optimal receptor detection was obtained with the 2-day culture. Cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h as described (21Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Google Scholar) with 1 mCi/ml Expre35S35S (DuPont NEN) and chased for 3 h in the same medium containing unlabeled amino acids and 1% BSA. Surface immunoprecipitation was performed as described (36Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Patzak A. Patil N. Chao M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 607-618Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibodies FSHR323 or LHR38 (30 μg/ml) or polyclonal antibody TSHR 19-389 (dilution 1/300) added in the apical or in the basolateral compartment during the chase period. Extraction and purification of receptor-antibody complex were performed as described (30Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Google Scholar, 36Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Patzak A. Patil N. Chao M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 607-618Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least twice with triplicate samples. Brefeldin A (Sigma) (0-20 ng/ml) was added to the cells (37Low S.H. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 51-62Google Scholar) during the pulse and the chase periods. For pertussis toxin (Sigma) treatment, two conditions were used which yielded the same results, either 200 ng/ml before (16 h) and throughout the experiment (38Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Google Scholar) or 1 μg/ml toxin throughout the experiment (39Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Google Scholar). For cholera toxin (Sigma) treatment, two conditions were also tested which yielded the same results, 10 μg/ml toxin during the pulse (39Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Google Scholar, 40Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Google Scholar) or 2 μg/ml before (3 h) and throughout the experiment (41Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25824-25835Google Scholar). AlF4− was prepared as described (42Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Google Scholar) and added during the first hour of chase. Forskolin (Sigma) (1 μM) was used during the incubation at 37°C associated with 500 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) (40Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 677-687Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described (20Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Google Scholar, 30Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Google Scholar). The gels were fixed and processed for fluorography. Quantification was performed using densitometric scanning. Polarized monolayers of MDCK cells expressing FSHR, LHR, and TSHR were grown on filters and pulse-labeled as described above. Trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (50 μg/ml) was added to the apical or to the basolateral medium during the chase period, whereas a 6-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) was added in the opposite compartment (32Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on filters for 48 h. The filters were then placed on 30-μl drops containing radioactive ligands (125I-FSH (DuPont NEN), (130 μCi/μg, 26 μCi/ml), 125I-hCG, (DuPont NEN) (90 μCi/μg, 86 μCi/ml), or 125I-bTSH (70 μCi/μg; 3 μCi/ml) (ERIA Diagnostic Pasteur)) in the absence or in the presence of an excess of unlabeled ligand for 10 min at 37°C. After extensive washing at 4°C, the filters were then transferred to a 12-well culture plate and fresh PBS, 1% BSA (200 μl) was added to both the apical and the basolateral chambers (41Bomsel M. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25824-25835Google Scholar). The apical medium was replaced after 30, 60, and 90 min, and the radioactivity present in all fractions was counted. Saturable transfer of the hormone was determined in the presence of an excess of unlabeled hormone. The cumulative appearance of the labeled ligand in the apical medium (hormone transcytosis) was determined. In some experiments cells were incubated at 37°C with 10 μg/ml cholera toxin for 1 h before the incubation with the hormone. The total radioactivity initially bound to the basolateral cell surface was determined in parallel by acidic treatment of cells for 3 min with PBS, 50 mM glycine, pH 2, 1% BSA. The internalized fraction of the hormone corresponded to the radioactivity remaining on the filter after the acidic wash. All the fractions were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and counted in a gamma counter. MDCK cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the receptors and a gene imparting resistance to neomycin. Among neomycin-resistant clones, those giving the strongest immunocytochemical reaction with anti-TSH, anti-FSH, and anti-LH receptor monoclonal antibodies were selected. It was necessary to verify that these cells lines have conserved their ability to become polarized when grown to confluency. Three methods were used. 1) The transepithelial resistance was measured in all clones expressing TSH, FSH, and LH receptors; it was ≥300 ohms/cm2 as has previously been observed for MDCK cells (43Cereijido M. Robbins E.S. Dolan W.J. Rotunno C.A. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 853-880Google Scholar, 44Gravotta D. Milton A. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2893-2908Google Scholar). 2) The monoclonal antibody BC11 recognizes an antigen that has been shown to be restricted to the basolateral compartment of MDCK cells (a gift of A. Le Bivic). The cell lines expressing the receptors were thus incubated through their apical side with the antibody either after treatment with EGTA or in the absence of such a treatment (33Butor C. Stelzer E.H.K. Sonnenberg A. Davoust J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 269-285Google Scholar). No immunofluorescence could be observed in the latter case, whereas EGTA treatment that opens the tight junctions and thus allows antibody contact with the basolateral domain provoked a strong immunofluorescence signal with a characteristic reticular pattern (see below). Confocal microscopy confirmed that the labeling indeed corresponded to the basolateral domain of the cells (not shown). 3) Predominant apical secretion of the 80-kDa protein (gp80 marker) was observed in control and transfected MDCK cells (not shown) (25Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Kock C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 150: 2735-2743Google Scholar). It was also necessary to verify that these cell lines were expressing functionally active receptors of normal structure. In all cases, the receptors were enriched by immunopurification and then analyzed by Western blotting using specific monoclonal antibodies. In cells expressing FSH receptors two species were detected (Fig. 1) of apparent molecular mass 87 and 81 kDa. Treatment with peptide N-glycanase F (21Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Google Scholar) which removes all carbohydrate chains resolved both of them into a 75-kDa holoprotein. Incubation with endoglycosidase H (21Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Google Scholar) (which cleaves only mannose-rich precursor carbohydrates) resulted in the transformation of the 81-kDa species into the 75-kDa protein, whereas the 87-kDa receptor was unchanged. These experiments thus suggested that the 87-kDa species corresponds to the receptor with mature complex carbohydrates, whereas the 81-kDa species is the precursor glycoprotein carrying mannose-rich carbohydrate residues. To confirm this conclusion pulse-chase experiments were performed. After 1 h of labeling with radioactive amino acids followed by immunoprecipitation with antireceptor antibodies, only the 81-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 2). After 90 min of chase, the 87-kDa receptor became apparent and its concentration increased for longer chase periods, whereas the concentration of the 81-kDa protein decreased. These observations thus confirmed that the 81-kDa species was a precursor of the 87-kDa mature FSH receptor. Similar observations have been previously made in human ovaries and transfected L cells (21Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Meduri G. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1358-1366Google Scholar). Western blot experiments were also performed for LH and TSH receptors expressed in MDCK cells. In the case of the LH receptor (Fig. 1) two species were also observed at ∼89 and 68 kDa. Endoglycosidase digestions showed that the former corresponds to the mature receptor, whereas the latter corresponds to the previously described mannose-rich precursor of the LH/CG receptor (8Vu Hai M.T. Misrahi M. Houllier A. Jolivet A. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8377-8383Google Scholar) (data not shown). In the case of the TSH receptor antibodies raised against the extracellular domain detected three protein species (Fig. 1): one at ∼120, one at ∼90, and one at ∼60 kDa. Similar molecular species have been previously described for the TSH receptor expressed in L cells (30Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Google Scholar); the largest species corresponds to the mature uncleaved receptor, the 90-kDa species to the mannose-rich precursor, whereas the 60-kDa protein corresponds to the α subunit of the cleaved mature receptor. Antibodies raised against the intracellular domain of the receptor detected the two larger precursor species and also the 35-45-kDa β subunit of the cleaved mature receptor (not shown). In human thyroid cells, only cleaved mature receptor is present (traces of the mannose-rich precursor may be detected, however) (20Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Google Scholar, 30Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Google Scholar). Thus, in transfected MDCK cells, as well as in transfected L cells, the TSH receptor undergoes incomplete maturation and incomplete cleavage. Cells grown on coverslips were incubated on their apical surface with antireceptor antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, FSH, TSH, and LH receptors could not be immunostained in these conditions. However, when the cells were treated with EGTA, opening the tight junctions and thus allowing the antibodies to reach the basolateral surface, immunostaining of the three receptors in the corresponding cells could be observed. The labeling decorated the cellular contours. As stated above, correct polarization of the confluent monolayers was verified with antibody BC11 directed against a basolateral endogenous antigen (Fig. 3). Antibody BB18 recognizing an apical endogenous antigen of MDCK cells was also used as control. A strong staining was obtained with this antibody in MDCK cells in the absence of EGTA treatment (not shown). For cells transfected with each receptor, analysis of immunofluorescence by confocal microscopy in EGTA-treated cells was performed. Fig. 4 shows the LH receptor distribution. Serial XY horizontal optical sections were performed from the apical to the basal membrane of transfected MDCK cells. Antibody BB18 (Fig. 4C, a-d) strongly stained the sections corresponding to the apical surface, whereas antibody BC11 (Fig. 4A, a-d) and the monoclonal antireceptor antibody (Fig. 4B, a-d) stained sections corresponding to the basolateral surface. The same conclusions were derived from XZ vertical sections (Fig. 4, f).Fig. 4Confocal microscopic examination of the distribution of LH receptors in polarized MDCK cells. Polarized monolayers of cells grown to confluence on coverslips were treated with EGTA and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” Primary antibodies corresponded to monoclonal antibodies BC11 (A) and BB18 (C) recognizing a basolateral and an apical endogenous antigen of MDCK cells. Monoclonal antibody LHR38 (B) was also used. XY horizontal focal sections (parallel through MDCK cells) were performed from the apical (a) to the basal level (d) of the cells. The lower panel shows an XY section (e) of a selected area of cells and the corresponding XZ sections (f) taken in 0.1-μm steps through the cells at 90° to the XY sections. The apical region of the cells is oriented top-most. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunocytochemistry or immunofluorescence do not yield quantitative data. Such data can be obtained by metabolic labeling of the receptor followed by either domain-selective biotinylation of the receptor (45Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Graeve L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 277-286Google Scholar) or surface immunoprecipitation (36Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Patzak A. Patil N. Chao M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 607-618Google Scholar). Both techniques can be applied separately to the basolateral and apical compartments yielding quantitative measurements of receptors present on each surface. However, gonadotropin and TSH receptors are extremely “sticky” molecules that tend to aggregate. The biotinylation method thus led to the nonspecific precipitation of a major fraction of the intracellular mannose-rich receptor precursor (not shown). This problem still existed but was markedly reduced with the surface immunoprecipitation method. The latter was thus used for all further experiments. MCDK cells expressing FSHR, TSHR, or LHR were pulse-labeled with radioactive amino acids for 1 h (see “Materials and Methods”). Antireceptor antibodies were added either to the basal or to the apical compartments during the 3-h chase period. The receptor-antibody complexes were purified and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). For FSHR and LHR ∼85% of the receptor molecules were localized on the basolateral surface. In the case of the TSHR (which has not yet undergone cleavage after 3 h of chase (30Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Google Scholar)), the totality of the receptor molecules was found on the basolateral surface, no radioactive receptor being detected on the apical surface. It has been previously observed that the distribution of some proteins may not parallel the distribution obse"

The GM2AP precursor is synthesized as an 18-kDa peptide, which is singly glycosylated, resulting in 22-kDa high mannose and 24-27-kDa complex glycoforms. A small portion of the 22-kDa form bears phosphomannosyl residues. About 30% of the GM2AP precursor is secreted during 12 h after synthesis, consisting almost exclusively of complex glycoforms. In a post-Golgi compartment, the intracellular remainder is converted to a 20-kDa mature form within 24 h, bearing a heavily trimmed N-glycan on a 17-kDa backbone. Interestingly, even nonglycosylated GM2AP is delivered to the lysosome, as shown by tunicamycin treatment and subcellular fractionation. Also, its endocytosis is independent of carbohydrate-linked signals and is even more effective for nonglycosylated GM2AP. We conclude that a mannose-6-phosphate-independent pathway for the lysosomal delivery of GM2AP exists in cultured human keratinocytes.

INTRODUCTIONThe precise and complicated structure of the central nervous system 1The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemPCRpolymerase chain reactionAPCadenomatous polyposis colikbkilobases. is intimately associated with its functions in vivo and requires multiple cell-cell interactions. Many cell recognition molecules that mediate neuronal cell-cell interactions are implicated in neural development (1Whitesides J.G. LaMantia A.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 229-241Google Scholar, 2Muller U. Kypta R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 36-41Google Scholar). Therefore, isolating and understanding these molecules will give us a key to the mechanisms of this process.Cadherins are a family of Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules (3Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar, 4Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Google Scholar, 5Kemler R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 149-155Google Scholar). Many members of the cadherin family are expressed in the CNS and may play pivotal roles in neuronal morphogenic events such as the elongation and targeting of axons and the segregation of neuronal precursor cells (6Matsunaga M. Hatta K. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Nature. 1988; 334: 62-64Google Scholar, 7Fredette B.J. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7331-7346Google Scholar, 8Barami K. Kirschenbaum B. Lemmon V. Goldman S.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 567-582Google Scholar, 9Redies C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 243-256Google Scholar).The classical cadherins are divided into two subgroups, called type I and type II cadherins, based on their amino acid alignments (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar). Type I cadherins include E (epithelial), N (neural), P (placental), and R (retinal) cadherin, which share the basic structure of the cadherin family. PCR cloning has isolated another subgroup of the cadherin family, type II cadherins, which differ from type I cadherins in their specific amino acid sequences (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar–12Tanihara H. Kido M. Obata S. Heimark R.L. Davidson M. St. John T. Suzuki S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Google Scholar). Type II cadherins include human cadherin-5, −6, −8, −11, and −12 as well as other type II cadherins found in mouse, rat, chicken, and Xenopus (13Kimura Y. Matsunami H. Inoue T. Shimamura K. Uchida N. Ueno T. Miyazaki T. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 347-358Google Scholar, 14Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar, 15Espeseth A. Johnson E. Kintner C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 199-211Google Scholar). Thus this group is conserved in other species and may have important functional roles.Cadherins are transmembrane proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic proteins, α- and β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120, which regulate the functions of cadherins (16Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Google Scholar, 17Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Matsuyoshi N. Takeichi M. Ito F. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Google Scholar). β-Catenin also associates with APC, a colonic tumor suppressor protein, and mediates cell adhesion and a growth signaling pathway (19Su L.K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Google Scholar, 20Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Google Scholar). We isolated β-catenin-associating molecules and found a new member of the cadherin family, human cadherin-14, which is a type II cadherin. Northern blot analysis revealed that cadherin-14 was broadly expressed in the CNS.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described the isolation of a novel type II human cadherin molecule. Although many cadherins and cadherin-related molecules have been isolated by PCR (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar, 25Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St. John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Google Scholar), this is the first report of a cadherin molecule being isolated by virtue of its association with β-catenin. Cadherin-14 has several cytoplasmic amino acid sequences that differ from those used for PCR cloning. Therefore, our method can be used for isolating additional cadherin molecules that may be undetectable by PCR.Recent studies have shown that there is a direct association between E-cadherin and β-catenin (26Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Google Scholar), and β-catenin also directly associates with APC, a tumor suppressor protein of human colonic cancer (19Su L.K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Google Scholar, 20Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Google Scholar). Our in vitro protein interaction cloning also identified a direct association between β-catenin, cadherins, and APC.Type I cadherin (N-cadherin) and type II cadherins (cadherin-11 and −14) bind to β-catenin with equal strength in vitro. 3T. Shibata, Y. Shimoyama, M. Gotoh, and S. Hirohashi, unpublished observation. Post-translational modifications may regulate this association (27Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Google Scholar), but these cadherins share well conserved amino acids in the cytoplasmic β-catenin binding domain (11Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Google Scholar) so both cadherin types probably associate with catenins and function as adhesion molecules in vivo.Suzuki et al. (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar) reports the isolation of novel cadherin molecules from the human brain. They named these cadherins numerically from cadherin-4 to cadherin-13, and so far seven of them have been completely sequenced (11Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Google Scholar–13Kimura Y. Matsunami H. Inoue T. Shimamura K. Uchida N. Ueno T. Miyazaki T. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 347-358Google Scholar, 28Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Terasaki T. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2206-2211Google Scholar); cadherin-4 is the human homologue of R-cadherin (29Inuzuka H. Miyatani S. Takeichi M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 69-79Google Scholar), and cadherin-13, which lacks a cytoplasmic domain, seems to be the human homologue of T-cadherin (30Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Google Scholar). Cadherin-5, −6, −8, −11, and −12 have similar structures and high amino acid homology with each other, suggesting that they form a subgroup of cadherins called type II cadherins. They share the same aromatic amino acids in their extracellular domains and have highly conserved cytoplasmic domains (11Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L. St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Google Scholar). Amino acid alignment of cadherin-14 revealed that it also shares these aromatic amino acids (Fig. 2) and that it has high protein sequence identity with the type II cadherins (Table I), suggesting that this molecule is a type II cadherin. Previously, cadherin-5 was reported to be a type II cadherin (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar), but Shimoyama et al. (28Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Terasaki T. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2206-2211Google Scholar) reports that cadherin-5 has low similarity with other type II cadherins. Our amino acid alignment also shows that cadherin-5 has low homology with cadherin-14 and that it might be a distinct member of the cadherin family (Table I).Three amino-terminal amino acids of the extracellular domain, called the HAV domain, are conserved among N-, E-, P-, and R-cadherins and are thought to be essential to their specific molecular recognition (31Blaschuk O.W. Pouliot Y. Holland P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 679-682Google Scholar). These amino acids are not conserved in type II cadherins and are replaced by VIV in human cadherin-5, QAI in human cadherin-6 and −14, and QAD in human cadherin-8, −11, and −12. The functional meaning of this divergence is unclear. In L-cell transfection assays, type I cadherins show homophilic adhesion properties (3Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar). In an aggregation assay, mouse cadherin-11 has a similar homophilic adhesion activity (13Kimura Y. Matsunami H. Inoue T. Shimamura K. Uchida N. Ueno T. Miyazaki T. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 347-358Google Scholar). Cadherin-5 shows weaker homophilic adhesion activity than cadherin-4 (12Tanihara H. Kido M. Obata S. Heimark R.L. Davidson M. St. John T. Suzuki S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Google Scholar). Chick cadherin-6B and cadherin-7 show both homophilic and weak heterophilic interactions with each other (17Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Matsuyoshi N. Takeichi M. Ito F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 949-957Google Scholar). Therefore, whether type II cadherins have similar molecular functions to type I cadherins in vivo remains open to question. Moreover, heterophilic interactions of type I cadherins have been reported (E-cadherin and integrin αEβ7/αM290β7, E-cadherin and bacterial protein, N-cadherin and fibroblast growth factor receptor) (32Cepek K.L. Shaw S.K. Parker C.M. Russel G.J. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Brenner M.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 190-193Google Scholar, 33Karecla P.I. Bowden S.J. Green S.J. Kilshaw P.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 852-856Google Scholar, 34Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Google Scholar, 35Mengaud J. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Mege R.-M. Cossart P. Cell. 1996; 84: 923-932Google Scholar). Thus type II cadherins might be involved in a more complicated adhesion system. We are now examining whether cadherin-14 has homophilic or heterophilic cell adhesion activity.The expression of many cadherins in the CNS and their functions in neurogenesis have been extensively studied. For example, N-cadherin, which is almost ubiquitously expressed in neural tissues, may regulate axonal growth or targeting (6Matsunaga M. Hatta K. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Nature. 1988; 334: 62-64Google Scholar, 36Bixby J.L. Zhang R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1253-1260Google Scholar). R-cadherin has an expression pattern distinct from that of N-cadherin in the neural tube and may play a role in nucleus formation in the chick forebrain (37Ganzler S.I. Redies C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4157-4172Google Scholar, 38Redies C. Inuzuka H. Takeichi M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3525-3534Google Scholar). E-cadherin has various expression patterns in the brain during neuronal development. Treatment with anti-E-cadherin antibodies affects the growth pattern of the embryonic brain (39Shimamura K. Takeichi M. Development. 1992; 116: 1011-1019Google Scholar). Therefore, type I cadherins play crucial roles in neural development.Type II cadherins were first isolated from the human brain and may have varied expression patterns in neural tissues. In Xenopus, F-cadherin, a type II cadherin, is expressed at the boundaries of the neural tube, suggesting that F-cadherin may regulate the regionalization of the neural tube in early development (15Espeseth A. Johnson E. Kintner C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 199-211Google Scholar). In chick, cadherin-6B and cadherin-7 are expressed in the neural crest cells of the embryo. Chick cadherin-6B is first expressed in the presumptive neural crest cells and disappears after cell migration. Chick cadherin-7 first appears in the subpopulation of migrating neural crest cells that gives rise to dorsal and ventral root ganglia, suggesting that chick cadherin-7 may segregate migrating neural crest cells (14Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar). The results of these studies indicate that type II cadherins play important roles in neurogenic morphogenesis, as do type I cadherins.We detected cadherin-14 expression in cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We analyzed various parts of the CNS to examine the specific expression of cadherin-14 and found that it was expressed in all CNS regions. Weak expression of cadherin-14 was detected in spinal cord and corpus callosum, suggesting that cadherin-14 may not be expressed at the same level throughout the CNS. It is unclear whether cadherin-14 is expressed in a distinct subgroup of neuronal cells or not. On the other hand, the expression of cadherin-14 was not detected in placenta, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Other type II cadherins, human cadherin-6 and −11, are expressed not only in the brain but in many other organs (28Shimoyama Y. Gotoh M. Terasaki T. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2206-2211Google Scholar, 40Shibata T. Ochiai A. Gotoh M. Machinami R. Hirohashi S. Cancer Lett. 1996; 99: 147-153Google Scholar). Our results indicate that cadherin-14 has a specific and fundamental role in the CNS because it is expressed throughout the CNS.Further study of the precise expression and functions of type II cadherins, including cadherin-14, will improve our understanding of the mechanisms of neural morphogenesis. INTRODUCTIONThe precise and complicated structure of the central nervous system 1The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemPCRpolymerase chain reactionAPCadenomatous polyposis colikbkilobases. is intimately associated with its functions in vivo and requires multiple cell-cell interactions. Many cell recognition molecules that mediate neuronal cell-cell interactions are implicated in neural development (1Whitesides J.G. LaMantia A.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 229-241Google Scholar, 2Muller U. Kypta R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 36-41Google Scholar). Therefore, isolating and understanding these molecules will give us a key to the mechanisms of this process.Cadherins are a family of Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules (3Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Google Scholar, 4Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Google Scholar, 5Kemler R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 149-155Google Scholar). Many members of the cadherin family are expressed in the CNS and may play pivotal roles in neuronal morphogenic events such as the elongation and targeting of axons and the segregation of neuronal precursor cells (6Matsunaga M. Hatta K. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Nature. 1988; 334: 62-64Google Scholar, 7Fredette B.J. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7331-7346Google Scholar, 8Barami K. Kirschenbaum B. Lemmon V. Goldman S.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 567-582Google Scholar, 9Redies C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 243-256Google Scholar).The classical cadherins are divided into two subgroups, called type I and type II cadherins, based on their amino acid alignments (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar). Type I cadherins include E (epithelial), N (neural), P (placental), and R (retinal) cadherin, which share the basic structure of the cadherin family. PCR cloning has isolated another subgroup of the cadherin family, type II cadherins, which differ from type I cadherins in their specific amino acid sequences (10Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Google Scholar–12Tanihara H. Kido M. Obata S. Heimark R.L. Davidson M. St. John T. Suzuki S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1697-1704Google Scholar). Type II cadherins include human cadherin-5, −6, −8, −11, and −12 as well as other type II cadherins found in mouse, rat, chicken, and Xenopus (13Kimura Y. Matsunami H. Inoue T. Shimamura K. Uchida N. Ueno T. Miyazaki T. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 347-358Google Scholar, 14Nakagawa S. Takeichi M. Development. 1995; 121: 1321-1332Google Scholar, 15Espeseth A. Johnson E. Kintner C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 199-211Google Scholar). Thus this group is conserved in other species and may have important functional roles.Cadherins are transmembrane proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic proteins, α- and β-catenin, plakoglobin, and p120, which regulate the functions of cadherins (16Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Google Scholar, 17Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Matsuyoshi N. Takeichi M. Ito F. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Google Scholar). β-Catenin also associates with APC, a colonic tumor suppressor protein, and mediates cell adhesion and a growth signaling pathway (19Su L.K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Google Scholar, 20Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Google Scholar). We isolated β-catenin-associating molecules and found a new member of the cadherin family, human cadherin-14, which is a type II cadherin. Northern blot analysis revealed that cadherin-14 was broadly expressed in the CNS."

Interaction with vitronectin stabilizes PAI-1 and decreases the rate of conversion to the latent form, but conformational effects of vitronectin on the reactive center loop of PAI-1 have not been documented. Mutant forms of PAI-1 were designed with a cysteine substitution at either position P1′ or P9 of the reactive center loop. Labeling of the unique cysteine with a sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophore provides a probe that is sensitive to vitronectin binding. Results indicate that the scissile P1-P1′ bond of PAI-1 is more solvent exposed upon interaction with vitronectin, whereas the N-terminal portion of the reactive loop does not experience a significant change in its environment. These results were complemented by labeling vitronectin with an arginine-specific coumarin probe which compromises heparin binding but does not interfere with PAI-1 binding to the protein. Dissociation constants of approximately 100 nM are calculated for the vitronectin/PAI-1 interaction from titrations using both fluorescent probes. Furthermore, experiments in which PAI-1 failed to compete with heparin for binding to vitronectin argue for separate binding sites for the two ligands on vitronectin.

INTRODUCTIONThe adhesive glycoprotein, vitronectin, circulates in human plasma at concentrations of 200-400 μg·;ml−1 and serves as a regulatory protein in humoral defense mechanisms by interacting with macromolecules in the reaction cascades of coagulation and fibrinolysis (reviewed in Refs. 1Preissner K.T.

W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1991: 269-305Google Scholar). The circulating form of vitronectin is a monomer of 72 kDa, and vitronectin is also found in a multimeric form in platelet releasates and in the extracellular matrix (4Holmes R. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 297-308Google Scholar, 5Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ohgren Y. Rouslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4003-4007Google Scholar, 6Stockman A. Hess S. Declerck P.

Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Google Scholar, 13Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. High K.A. Roberts H. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 517-543Google Scholar). Like other serpins, PAI-1 has a reactive center loop that mimics the substrate of its target proteases (14Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Google Scholar, 15Carrell R.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Google Scholar). The active conformation of PAI-1 is relatively unstable, so that the protein undergoes rapid conversion to a latent conformation which is characterized by the insertion of the reactive center loop into a central β-sheet within the molecule (16Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Gehoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar). Interactions between strands of the β-sheet and the reactive loop stabilize this conformation relative to the active conformation, in which the loop is thought to protrude from the surface of the molecule (7Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar, 16Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Gehoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar).Binding to vitronectin results in a 2-3-fold increase in the half-life of active PAI-1 (17Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Google Scholar, 18Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 23-30Google Scholar, 19Wun T.-C. Palmier M.O. Siegel N.R. Smith C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7862-7868Google Scholar). In addition to stabilizing the active conformation of PAI-1, vitronectin also alters the protease specificity of the serpin so that the vitronectin·;PAI-1 complex is endowed with the additional ability to inhibit thrombin (20Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar, 21Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar). A vitronectin-binding site has been localized on the surface of PAI-1 using site-directed mutagenesis (22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (23van Mijer M. Gibbink R.K. Preissner K.R. Pannekoek J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Google Scholar). Binding of vitronectin is thought to restrict the movement of the central β-sheet in PAI-1 by interactions that bridge the β-sheet and adjacent secondary structural elements and thus prevent insertion of the reactive center loop (22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar). Based on the observation that vitronectin alters PAI-1 protease specificity, it can be hypothesized that vitronectin binding causes conformation changes in the reactive center loop as well. Fa et al. (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) have demonstrated that vitronectin binding causes a decrease in the anisotropy and increased rotational freedom of fluorescent reporters incorporated into the reactive center loop of PAI-1. Other details of the vitronectin-induced conformational changes in PAI-1 are uncharacterized.Very little is known about concomitant changes that occur in vitronectin when it interacts with the serpin. Moreover, there is considerable debate in the literature regarding the PAI-1-binding site(s) in vitronectin (reviewed in Ref. 25Deng G. Royle G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 66-70Google Scholar). Reports utilizing synthetic peptides or proteolytic fragments do not agree, with some results localizing the PAI-1-binding site to the heparin-binding sequence located near the C terminus of vitronectin (26Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Google Scholar, 27Gechtman Z. Sharma R. Dreizman T. Fidkin M. Shaltiel S.

Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Google Scholar), and yet another to a polypeptide consisting of residues 115-121 from vitronectin (35Mimuro J. Muanatsu S. Kurano Y. Uchida Y. Ikadi H. Watanabe S. Sakata Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 2315-2320Google Scholar). More recent work utilizing heterologous expression systems has focused on the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin, which contains eight cysteines thought to form a “disulfide knot” at the N terminus of vitronectin. Segments of the N-terminal somatomedin B domain expressed as fusion proteins with the maltose-binding protein in Escherichia coli were shown to bind and stabilize the active conformation of PAI-1 (33Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). In order to localize sequences critical for PAI-1 binding, Deng et al. (34Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Google Scholar) generated chimeras between segments of the vitronectin somatomedin B domain and complementary sequences in other inactive somatomedin B homology domains. These studies indicated that the essential PAI-1 binding determinant was located between residues 12 and 30 of vitronectin, and alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that all 8 cysteines and Gly-12, Asp-22, Leu-24, Tyr-27, Tyr-28, and Asp-34 are essential to maintain PAI-1-binding activity (34Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Google Scholar).To gain further insight into the structural changes that occur in both vitronectin and PAI-1 as they interact, and to understand more thoroughly the structural requirements for the interaction, a strategy has been employed for following the conformational changes in the molecules using fluorescent reporter groups. With site-directed mutagenesis, cysteines have been engineered into positions P1′ and P9 of the reactive center loop in PAI-1, and the mutant proteins have been labeled with the sulfhydryl-reactive probe, IANBD (36Shore J.D. Vandenberg E. Day D. Solso S.T. Sherman R. Ginsburg D. Kvassman J. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6Google Scholar, 37Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). Since wild type PAI-1 contains no cysteines, these fluorescent probes can be exploited to obtain information about the local environment of the reactive center loop at these positions. This work extends the studies of Fa et al. (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) by evaluating probes at different sites within the reactive center loop and evaluating whether conformational changes are associated with increased or decreased solvent exposure of the probe. Also, a parallel experimental approach was taken in which an arginine-reactive coumarin derivative (38Baburaj K. Azam N. Udgaonkar D. Duani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 253-265Google Scholar) was used for site-specific labeling of the arginine-rich heparin-binding region of vitronectin.Fluorescence spectroscopy of the labeled protein derivatives has been used to gain insight into the interaction of intact vitronectin and PAI-1 in solution. The following questions were of interest and guided these studies. Is the conformation of the reactive center loop of PAI-1 altered upon interaction with vitronectin? Does binding of monomeric and multimeric forms of vitronectin result in similar changes in the reactive center loop of PAI-1? Can the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin be preferentially labeled with an arginine-specific coumarin derivative? Are there conformational changes in vitronectin that are induced by interaction with PAI-1? Do PAI-1 and heparin share a common binding determinant in vitronectin?DISCUSSIONVitronectin has been found to associate with PAI-1 in vivo and has been shown to stabilize its active conformation (17Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Google Scholar, 18Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The stabilization of PAI-1 that occurs as a result of binding to vitronectin represents a regulatory factor in the cascade of reactions that control fibrinolysis. In fact, vitronectin directs PAI-1 activity through three separate mechanisms as follows: 1) vitronectin stabilizes the active conformation of PAI-1 (17Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7862-7868Google Scholar); 2) it alters the protease specificity of the serpin (20Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar, 21Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar); and 3) it may help maintain a distribution between PAI-1 in plasma and the extracellular matrix, where vitronectin is found in native and multimeric forms, respectively (53Seiffert D. Wagner N.V. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1283-1291Google Scholar).Elucidation of the conformational changes and requirements associated with the interaction of PAI-1 and vitronectin has been complicated by the propensity of both molecules to exist in alternative conformations. Moreover, the methods traditionally used to study this interaction have involved harsh treatments of the proteins, which are likely to have altered their conformations, or proteolytic fragments, which have different binding characteristics compared with the native molecules. The objective of this study was to develop a method for analyzing structural aspects of the PAI-1·;vitronectin interaction under conditions that maintain the proteins in their native conformation. Fluorescent probes targeted to specific regions of the proteins were exploited to monitor conformational changes that occur as PAI-1 and vitronectin interact. These results are discussed in response to the questions posed in the introduction.Conformational Changes in the Reactive Center Loop of PAI-1 Are Associated with Vitronectin BindingTo determine the effects of vitronectin binding on the reactive center loop, the fluorescent probe, NBD, was reacted with the unique sulfhydryl group in each of two mutant forms of PAI-1, M347C and S338C. The two sites of labeling provide environmentally sensitive probes at the P1′ and P9 positions of the reactive center loop, respectively. The usefulness of these probes to detect conformational changes in the reactive center loop of PAI-1 was demonstrated previously by Shore et al. (37Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). In those studies, the fluorescence of NBDP9PAI-1 was found to be enhanced upon conversion to latency or upon complex formation with tPA, consistent with burial of the probe within the hydrophobic core of the protein. In the present studies, vitronectin binding induced a 10% decrease in probe fluorescence at the P1′ position, but a corresponding fluorescence change at the P9 position was not observed. The fluorescence change at the P1′ site is as expected for movement of the probe at the scissile bond to a slightly more hydrophilic milieu.The results demonstrate that a conformational change at the scissile bond in the reactive center loop is associated with vitronectin binding. In serpins, protease specificity is determined by the primary sequence and conformation of the reactive center loop. Lawrence et al. (54Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Google Scholar) have shown that the substrate specificity of PAI-1 can be altered by substitutions in the reactive center loop based on the sequences of other serpins (20Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar, 54Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated that the P1 residue of the scissile bond in PAI-1 is critical for both substrate specificity and activity against tPA (55Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Verhamme I.M. Paielli D. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9301-9306Google Scholar, 56Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Google Scholar, 57Keijer J. Ehrlich H. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10700-10707Google Scholar). A methionine to arginine substitution at this position renders PAI-1 inactive against tPA but active against thrombin (57Keijer J. Ehrlich H. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10700-10707Google Scholar). It has also been reported that vitronectin restores the tPA inhibitory activity of this mutant form of PAI-1 (57Keijer J. Ehrlich H. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10700-10707Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with the observation in this work that vitronectin induces changes in the conformation of PAI-1 within the reactive center loop. The data from the present studies are the first to indicate that vitronectin induces local changes in the vicinity of the scissile bond, rather than changes that affect the entire reactive center loop. This study and that of Fa et al. (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) are significant in demonstrating that subtle changes in the conformation of the loop affect the specificity toward target proteinases.The affinity of the interaction between vitronectin and PAI-1 is high. Reports of the Kd vary from 0.1 to 190 nM (18Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 23-30Google Scholar, 21Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar, 22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar, 58Salonen E.-M. Vaheri A. Pollanen J. Stephens R. Andreasen P. Mayer M. Dano K. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6339-6343Google Scholar). Furthermore, some differences in the binding affinity between native and multimeric vitronectin have been suggested (21Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar, 30Preissner K.R. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Müller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Google Scholar). The wide range in estimates of affinity of vitronectin for PAI-1 is surprising and may be attributed in part to the conformational lability of both proteins. The result is that different forms of both proteins, including active and latent forms of PAI-1, as well as monomeric and multimeric forms of vitronectin, have not always been distinguished in binding assays. Furthermore, previous estimates of the Kd have relied on kinetic and Scatchard analyses of PAI-1 binding to immobilized vitronectin or vitronectin binding to immobilized PAI-1 (18Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 23-30Google Scholar, 22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar, 58Salonen E.-M. Vaheri A. Pollanen J. Stephens R. Andreasen P. Mayer M. Dano K. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6339-6343Google Scholar). It is difficult to accurately determine Kd values with these solid phase methods, because one must assume a concentration for the immobilized protein and one must also assume that binding sites are accessible. In fact, vitronectin has been shown to lose β-sheet structure upon adsorption to plastic (59Pitt W.G. Homan-Fabrizius D.J. Mosher D.F. Cooper S.L. J. Colloid. Interface Sci. 1989; 129: 231-238Google Scholar). Moreover, Deng et al. (25Deng G. Royle G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 66-70Google Scholar) have observed that the vitronectin-binding site in PAI-1 is disrupted when the serpin is immobilized. Estimates of the Kd for the interaction based on ligand binding directly to immobilized proteins, therefore, may not accurately reflect the Kd of the interaction in solution.The Kd values determined for the interaction of native vitronectin and PAI-1 in this study, using fluorescently labeled forms of either protein, were estimated to be equal to or lower than 100 nM. These represent the first determinations of the affinity of the interaction between the two proteins in solution. This approach obviates difficulties with the solid phase methods, providing a more reliable estimate of the energetics of interaction between vitronectin and PAI-1. It should be noted that these experiments were performed at protein concentrations (200-400 nM) that exceed the estimates for the Kd. Attempts were made to reduce the concentration of receptor protein; however, the low fluorescent yield from the labels and loss of protein due to adsorption precluded further analyses. Other methods that are more sensitive to binding interactions in the required concentration range (1-50 nM) are being pursued in this laboratory.Binding of Native or Multimeric Vitronectin to PAI-1 Does Not Lead to Identical Changes in the Conformation of the Reactive Center LoopPAI-1 originally purified from denatured plasma was found to co-purify with vitronectin in a complex of 450 kDa (17Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Google Scholar). That both multimeric and native vitronectin bind PAI-1 is clearly established (17Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Google Scholar, 30Preissner K.R. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Müller-Berghaus G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 2315-2320Google Scholar); however, it is unclear whether both forms of vitronectin have the same effect on PAI-1 conformation. Indeed, the different forms of vitronectin have diverse effects on PAI-1 activity. Stabilization of PAI-1 by the extracellular matrix, where vitronectin is found in its multimeric conformation, is significantly higher than the stabilization of PAI-1 by purified plasma vitronectin. Unlike native vitronectin, multimeric vitronectin does not alter PAI-1 substrate specificity (21Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that native, but not multimeric, vitronectin can enhance the PAI-1-induced cellular clearance of thrombin by low density lipoprotein receptors (60Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Google Scholar).To assess whether multimeric PAI-1 causes conformational changes in the reactive center loop of PAI-1, the fluorescence of NBDP1′PAI-1 was measured upon addition of multimeric vitronectin. This form of vitronectin did not alter the fluorescence of the probe, suggesting that the conformation at the scissile bond is not affected by PAI-1 binding to multimeric vitronectin. These data imply that the contrasting effects of native and multimeric vitronectin on the substrate specificity of PAI-1 result, at least in part, from differential effects of the two molecules on the conformation at the scissile bond.An Arginine-specific Probe, Hydroxycoumarin Glyoxal, Is Targeted to the Heparin-binding Region of VitronectinThe conformation of the heparin-binding sequence in vitronectin has been the subject of a great deal of discussion in the literature. Observations that vitronectin in denatured plasma binds heparin more efficiently than native vitronectin (61Barnes D.W. Silnutzer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12548-12552Google Scholar, 62Hayashi M. Akama T. Kono I. Kashiwagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1135-1138Google Scholar) resulted in the hypothesis that the heparin-binding domain is buried in the native molecule (62Hayashi M. Akama T. Kono I. Kashiwagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1135-1138Google Scholar, 63Preissner K.T. Müller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Google Scholar, 64Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 27617-27623Google Scholar). Conformational changes induced by treatments with chaotropic agents, ligands, heat, or acid were thought to expose the heparin-binding domain (6Stockman A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Google Scholar, 40Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Google Scholar, 42Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Google Scholar, 43Zhuang P. Li H. Williams J.G. Wagner N.V. Seiffert D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14333-14343Google Scholar, 64Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 27617-27623Google Scholar, 65Hildebrand A. Preissner K.T. Müller-Berghaus G. Teschemacher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15429-15434Google Scholar). A recent study by Zhuang et al. 3P. Zhuang, T. Chen, and C. B. Peterson, submitted for publication. provided evidence that the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin is not buried in the native state of the molecule and that apparent differences in affinity between native and multimeric vitronectin are due to differences in binding valency and are not the result of increased exposure of the heparin-binding domain.Based on this observation, it was hypothesized that an arginine-selective fluorescent probe might be preferentially targeted to the arginine-rich heparin-binding domain of vitronectin. The product could then serve as an agent for monitoring PAI-1-induced changes in the heparin-binding region of vitronectin. When treated with hydroxycoumarin glyoxal, vitronectin was labeled at a stoichiometry of approximately 2 mol of probe per mol of protein. Further analysis revealed that HOCGO-VN bound heparin more weakly than unlabeled vitronectin. Including heparin during the labeling reaction resulted in protection of a set of arginines from labeling. Together, these data provide evidence that the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin serves as a target for the arginine-reactive probe. Peptide mapping of the labeled protein will be required to identify the exact location of the probe(s) among the seven arginine residues within the heparin-binding domain.PAI-1-induced Conformational Changes in Vitronectin Can Be Detected Using the HOCGO-labeled ProteinCoumarin-modified vitronectin provided a tool for analyzing conformational changes in vitronectin associated with PAI-1 binding. HOCGO-VN competed effectively with immobilized vitronectin for PAI-1 binding. The HOCGO-VN behaved similarly to unlabeled native protein with respect to PAI-1 binding and stabilization, indicating that the probes did not disrupt elements essential for either activity. Fluorescence studies showed that PAI-1 binding was associated with a 15% quench in HOCGO-VN fluorescence. When PAI-1 was bound to vitronectin, the Stern-Volmer plots for iodide quenching were identical to those of HOCGO-VN in the absence of PAI-1. The evidence that PAI-1 does not affect the susceptibility of the probe to iodide quenching indicates that alterations in coumarin fluorescence upon PAI-1 binding are not the result of direct PAI-1 interactions with the probe. Rather, the binding of PAI-1 results in an altered conformation at the heparin-binding site on vitronectin. The PAI-1-induced conformational change within the heparin-binding region of vitronectin is also detected by enhanced binding of PAI-1·;vitronectin complexes over vitronectin alone to surface-immobilized heparin.Heparin and PAI-1 Do Not Share a Binding Determinant in VitronectinThree lines of evidence from this work dispute the concept that PAI-1 and heparin share a binding determinant in vitronectin. Modification of arginines in vitronectin with hydroxycoumarin glyoxal weakens heparin binding but does not affect PAI-1 binding or stabilization. Fluorescent probes, thought to be incorporated into the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin, are not protected from iodide quenching when HOCGO-VN is bound to PAI-1. Heparin and PAI-1 do not compete for binding to vitronectin. If heparin and PAI-1 did share a binding determinant in vitronectin, modifications of residues in the sequence would be expected to weaken vitronectin binding to both macromolecules. HOCGO-VN would then be expected to have a weakened affinity for PAI-1. Only affinity for heparin is affected by the modification, while interactions with PAI-1 are unperturbed.Second, it could be argued that PAI-1 and heparin share a binding determinant but that specific residues critical for interaction within that determinant are different for the serpin and the glycosaminoglycan. The iodide quenching data indicate that the heparin-binding residues that undergo modification are not located near the PAI-1-binding sites. Otherwise, the modified residues would be expected to have decreased solvent exposure in the presence of PAI-1.Finally, data from several competition experiments further dispute the possibility that heparin and PAI-1 share a binding determinant. PAI-1 bound to vitronectin-coated microtiter plates somewhat more effectively in the presence of heparin. Likewise, vitronectin complexed with PAI-1 bound heparin-coated plates somewhat more effectively than vitronectin alone. These observations contradict a previous report by Kost et al. (26Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Google Scholar) in which high concentrations of heparin prevented PAI-1 binding to immobilized vitronectin. However, a different report by the same group failed to demonstrate competition between heparin and PAI-1 for binding a CNBr fragment of vitronectin (30Preissner K.R. Grulich-Henn J. Ehrlich H.J. Declerck P. Justus C. Collen D. Pannekoek H. Müller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18490-18498Google Scholar).The results from competition experiments described in this document provide evidence that PAI-1 and heparin do not share a common binding site on vitronectin. Otherwise, at the saturating concentrations used, heparin and PAI-1 would be expected to compete for vitronectin binding. The observation that each of the two molecules increases the binding affinity of vitronectin for the other could have several interpretations. 1) Because both vitronectin and PAI-1 bind heparin, the glycosaminoglycan could serve as a template for their interaction, providing a common surface on which they both interact. This function has been attributed to heparin in the interaction between thrombin and antithrombin (67Griffith M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13899-13902Google Scholar, 68Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14708-14717Google Scholar, 69Peterson C.B. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7559-7566Google Scholar, 70Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1698-1708Google Scholar). 2) Since heparin bound to immobilized vitronectin could provide additional binding sites for PAI-1, more PAI-1 may bind in the well. 3) As both heparin and PAI-1 have been demonstrated to alter the conformation of vitronectin, the phenomenon could be an example of allostery, where binding of one of the macromolecules results in conformational changes that increase the affinity of vitronectin for the other.Concluding RemarksThe goal of these studies was to investigate conformational changes in vitronectin and PAI-1 using fluorescently labeled proteins. The probes incorporated into the proteins have provided useful information about the conformational changes that occur in the molecules as a result of their interaction. The data obtained with NBD PAI-1 demonstrate that binding native but not multimeric vitronectin alters the conformation of the reactive center loop of PAI-1. Changes in the fluorescence of probes incorporated into the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin indicate that the heparin-binding region is not an important binding determinant for PAI-1. Rather, this region experiences a conformational change when vitronectin and PAI-1 interact. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled proteins serve as valuable tools for continued investigation of mechanistic aspects of the PAI-1·;vitronectin interaction. INTRODUCTIONThe adhesive glycoprotein, vitronectin, circulates in human plasma at concentrations of 200-400 μg·;ml−1 and serves as a regulatory protein in humoral defense mechanisms by interacting with macromolecules in the reaction cascades of coagulation and fibrinolysis (reviewed in Refs. 1Preissner K.T.

W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1991: 269-305Google Scholar). The circulating form of vitronectin is a monomer of 72 kDa, and vitronectin is also found in a multimeric form in platelet releasates and in the extracellular matrix (4Holmes R. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 297-308Google Scholar, 5Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ohgren Y. Rouslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4003-4007Google Scholar, 6Stockman A. Hess S. Declerck P.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 517-543Google Scholar). Like other serpins, PAI-1 has a reactive center loop that mimics the substrate of its target proteases (14Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Google Scholar, 15Carrell R.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Google Scholar). The active conformation of PAI-1 is relatively unstable, so that the protein undergoes rapid conversion to a latent conformation which is characterized by the insertion of the reactive center loop into a central β-sheet within the molecule (16Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Gehoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar). Interactions between strands of the β-sheet and the reactive loop stabilize this conformation relative to the active conformation, in which the loop is thought to protrude from the surface of the molecule (7Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar, 16Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Gehoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar).Binding to vitronectin results in a 2-3-fold increase in the half-life of active PAI-1 (17Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.-C. Baudner S. Paques E.-P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Google Scholar, 18Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 23-30Google Scholar, 19Wun T.-C. Palmier M.O. Siegel N.R. Smith C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7862-7868Google Scholar). In addition to stabilizing the active conformation of PAI-1, vitronectin also alters the protease specificity of the serpin so that the vitronectin·;PAI-1 complex is endowed with the additional ability to inhibit thrombin (20Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar, 21Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar). A vitronectin-binding site has been localized on the surface of PAI-1 using site-directed mutagenesis (22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies (23van Mijer M. Gibbink R.K. Preissner K.R. Pannekoek J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 342-346Google Scholar). Binding of vitronectin is thought to restrict the movement of the central β-sheet in PAI-1 by interactions that bridge the β-sheet and adjacent secondary structural elements and thus prevent insertion of the reactive center loop (22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar). Based on the observation that vitronectin alters PAI-1 protease specificity, it can be hypothesized that vitronectin binding causes conformation changes in the reactive center loop as well. Fa et al. (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) have demonstrated that vitronectin binding causes a decrease in the anisotropy and increased rotational freedom of fluorescent reporters incorporated into the reactive center loop of PAI-1. Other details of the vitronectin-induced conformational changes in PAI-1 are uncharacterized.Very little is known about concomitant changes that occur in vitronectin when it interacts with the serpin. Moreover, there is considerable debate in the literature regarding the PAI-1-binding site(s) in vitronectin (reviewed in Ref. 25Deng G. Royle G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 66-70Google Scholar). Reports utilizing synthetic peptides or proteolytic fragments do not agree, with some results localizing the PAI-1-binding site to the heparin-binding sequence located near the C terminus of vitronectin (26Kost C.

Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Google Scholar), and yet another to a polypeptide consisting of residues 115-121 from vitronectin (35Mimuro J. Muanatsu S. Kurano Y. Uchida Y. Ikadi H. Watanabe S. Sakata Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 33: 2315-2320Google Scholar). More recent work utilizing heterologous expression systems has focused on the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin, which contains eight cysteines thought to form a “disulfide knot” at the N terminus of vitronectin. Segments of the N-terminal somatomedin B domain expressed as fusion proteins with the maltose-binding protein in Escherichia coli were shown to bind and stabilize the active conformation of PAI-1 (33Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.R. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Google Scholar). In order to localize sequences critical for PAI-1 binding, Deng et al. (34Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Google Scholar) generated chimeras between segments of the vitronectin somatomedin B domain and complementary sequences in other inactive somatomedin B homology domains. These studies indicated that the essential PAI-1 binding determinant was located between residues 12 and 30 of vitronectin, and alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that all 8 cysteines and Gly-12, Asp-22, Leu-24, Tyr-27, Tyr-28, and Asp-34 are essential to maintain PAI-1-binding activity (34Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Google Scholar).To gain further insight into the structural changes that occur in both vitronectin and PAI-1 as they interact, and to understand more thoroughly the structural requirements for the interaction, a strategy has been employed for following the conformational changes in the molecules using fluorescent reporter groups. With site-directed mutagenesis, cysteines have been engineered into positions P1′ and P9 of the reactive center loop in PAI-1, and the mutant proteins have been labeled with the sulfhydryl-reactive probe, IANBD (36Shore J.D. Vandenberg E. Day D. Solso S.T. Sherman R. Ginsburg D. Kvassman J. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6Google Scholar, 37Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). Since wild type PAI-1 contains no cysteines, these fluorescent probes can be exploited to obtain information about the local environment of the reactive center loop at these positions. This work extends the studies of Fa et al. (24Fa M. Karolin J. Aleshkov S. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13833-13840Google Scholar) by evaluating probes at different sites within the reactive center loop and evaluating whether conformational changes are associated with increased or decreased solvent exposure of the probe. Also, a parallel experimental approach was taken in which an arginine-reactive coumarin derivative (38Baburaj K. Azam N. Udgaonkar D. Duani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 253-265Google Scholar) was used for site-specific labeling of the arginine-rich heparin-binding region of vitronectin.Fluorescence spectroscopy of the labeled protein derivatives has been used to gain insight into the interaction of intact vitronectin and PAI-1 in solution. The following questions were of interest and guided these studies. Is the conformation of the reactive center loop of PAI-1 altered upon interaction with vitronectin? Does binding of monomeric and multimeric forms of vitronectin result in similar changes in the reactive center loop of PAI-1? Can the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin be preferentially labeled with an arginine-specific coumarin derivative? Are there conformational changes in vitronectin that are induced by interaction with PAI-1? Do PAI-1 and heparin share a common binding determinant in vitronectin?"

Fusion constructs were created that are composed of the extracellular parts of the interleukin-5 receptor α and β chains, respectively, and the transmembrane and intracellular parts of gp130, the signal transducing chain of the interleukin-6 receptor complex. In COS-7 transfectants we observed a dose-dependent interleukin-5-inducible STAT1 activation for which the presence of both the α and the β chain chimera was needed. No STAT activity was detected if one of the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor complex was deleted, indicating that STAT activity resulted from a receptor dimer rather than from higher receptor aggregates.We further investigated whether dimerization of STAT1 depends on the juxtaposition of two STAT recruitment modules in a receptor complex. We show that a receptor dimer with only a single STAT1 docking site was still able to lead to STAT1 activation. This indicates that the formation of a paired set of STAT binding sites in a receptor complex is not the prerequisite for STAT factor dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2003927480,"CD20 functions as a calcium-permeable cation channel. When expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells, CD20 accelerates the G1 progression induced by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). To further characterize how CD20 modulates the action of IGF-I, we investigated whether the activity of CD20 channel was affected by IGF-I. In quiescent cells expressing CD20, IGF-I increased cytoplasmic free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]c, which was reversed by the removal of extracellular calcium. In contrast, IGF-I did not increase [Ca2+]c in cells that did not express CD20. In perforated patch clamp recordings, addition of IGF-I to the bath solution augmented the Ca2+ permeability, which was reversed by anti-CD20 antibody. In cell-attached patch, calcium-permeable channel activity with unitary conductance of 7 picosiemens was detected, which was abolished by anti-CD20 antibody. The single channel activities were markedly enhanced when IGF-I was included in the pipette solution, whereas IGF-I added to the bath solution was ineffective. When cells were first exposed to pertussis toxin, activation of the channel by IGF-I was blocked. Transfection of cDNA for Gip2, a constitutive active form of αi2, activated the CD20 channel. These results indicate that the CD20 channel is regulated by the IGF-I receptor by a mechanism involving pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. CD20 functions as a calcium-permeable cation channel.

These results indicate that the CD20 channel is regulated by the IGF-I receptor by a mechanism involving pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. CD20 is a cell surface protein with a molecular mass of 35 kDa expressed in mature B lymphocytes (1Rosenthal P. Rimm I.J. Uniel T. Graffin J.D. Osathanondh R. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 232-237Google Scholar, 2Stashenko P. Nadler L.M. Hardy R. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1678-1685Google Scholar, 3Nadler L.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Anderson K.C. Boyd A.W.

J. Immunol. 1986; 8: 881-887Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies raised against CD20 affect the growth of B lymphocytes. Thus, most of the antibodies inhibit cell proliferation, whereas some are stimulatory. These observations led to the consideration that CD20 is involved in the regulation of cell growth in lymphocytes. The primary structure of CD20 has been determined by molecular cloning (5Einfeld D.A. Brown J.P. Valentine M.A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. EMBO J. 1986; 7: 711-717Google Scholar, 6Tedder T.F. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 208-212Google Scholar, 7Stamenkovic I. Seed B. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1975-1980Google Scholar), and the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that CD20 is a transmembrane protein with four transmembrane domains with both C- and N-terminals located in the cytoplasm. Hence, the structure of CD20 resembles those of ion channels and ion transporters. Indeed, when expressed in fibroblasts, CD20 functions as a calcium-permeable cation channel (8Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, CD20 is phosphorylated by protein kinases including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Furthermore, CD20 associates with src family tyrosine kinases including p53/56lyn, p56lck, and p59fyn (9Deans J.P. Kalt L. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Bolen J.B. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22632-22638Google Scholar). Since an addition of monoclonal antibody against CD20 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (10Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L. Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clerk E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504Google Scholar), CD20 may also participate in the protein tyrosine kinase cascade. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism modulating the activity of CD20 is largely unknown and the ligand that activates CD20 has not been identified. To investigate the function of CD20 as a calcium-permeable channel, we stably expressed CD20 in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). CD20 expressed in these cells functioned as a calcium-permeable channel and modulated the growth characteristics of these cells. Thus, CD20 expression accelerated cell cycle progression through the G1 phase and enabled the cells to progress to the S phase in medium containing low extracellular calcium (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor-I[Ca2+]ccytoplasmic free calcium concentrationI-Vcurrent-voltagePTXpertussis toxinmAbmonoclonal antibodyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-O-2-(thio) diphosphate). is a progression factor that induces G1 progression (12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar). As described by Stiles et al. (12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar), IGF-I exerts its action in a cell cycle-dependent manner. When IGF-I is added to quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells, it cannot induce cell cycle progression (12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar, 13Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2839-2843Google Scholar). In contrast, cells progress toward the S phase in response to IGF-I when they are first exposed to platelet-derived growth factor followed by epidermal growth factor (14Nishimoto I. Hata Y. Ogata E. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12120-12126Google Scholar). These are referred to as primed competent cells (14Nishimoto I. Hata Y. Ogata E. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12120-12126Google Scholar, 15Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Google Scholar). Therefore, IGF-I exerts its progression activity specifically in primed competent, but not quiescent, cells. However, when CD20 is expressed in quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells expressing CD20, at least some of the cells progress toward S phase in response to IGF-I (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). This result suggests that IGF-I can elicit progression, even in quiescent cells with the aid of CD20, and implies that a CD20-like protein is critical for the progression activity of IGF-I. If so, it is possible that the function of CD20 expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells is modulated by IGF-I. In the present study, we investigated this notion. The results indicate that IGF-I, by acting on the IGF-I receptor, activates the channel activity of CD20. insulin-like growth factor-I cytoplasmic free calcium concentration current-voltage pertussis toxin monoclonal antibody 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphate guanosine 5′-O-2-(thio) diphosphate). Recombinant human IGF-I was supplied by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Na[125I] was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). [3H]Thymidine and [32P]dCTP were obtained from Dupont NEN. mAb against CD20 (CBL456) was purchased from Cymbus Bioscience Ltd. (Southampton, UK). Balb/c 3T3 cells (clone A31) and Raji cells (B lymphoblastoid cell line) were provided by the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Balb/c 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Raji cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were cultured under humidified conditions of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. The inducible CD20 expression vector (CD20-pMEP4) was stably transfected into Balb/c 3T3 cells by electroporation as described previously (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). CD20 expressing quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells were obtained by incubating confluent cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% platelet-poor plasma and 80 μM ZnCl2 for 24 h. After the treatment with ZnCl2, all of the cells expressed CD20 (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable materials. Cells were cultured in 24-well plate (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ). Queiscent cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 24 h in the presence of 1 nM IGF-I. The level of [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as described by McNiel et al. (16McNiel P.L. Mckenna M.P. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 372-379Google Scholar). Constitutively active Gi2 mutant (Gip2) expression vector, Gip2-pcDNA I was generously provided by Dr. H. Bourne of the University of California, San Francisco. Balb/c 3T3 cells were co-transfected with CD20-pMEP4 and Gip2-pcDNA I using a transfection reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Manhein, GmbH, Germany). Twenty-four hours after exposure to DNA, cells were selected for 3 weeks of culture in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were independently picked up and screened by Northern blotting for high expression of Gip2 and CD20. The cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) was monitored using fura-2, as described previously (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with 2 μM fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) for 20 min at room temperature (20-26°C), then placed on a flow-through chamber mounted on the stage of TMD microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The perifusion medium comprised 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4). Dual wavelength microfluorometry of the fura-2 fluorescence was performed using CAM-230 (Nihon Bunko, Tokyo, Japan). The emission signals excited at both 340 and 380 nm and the ratio of these signals (340/380 ratio) was recorded. In some experiments, the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration was calibrated as described elsewhere (17Kojima I. Mogami H. Ogata E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E307-E311Google Scholar). Statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of variance. The perforated-patch (18Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Google Scholar) and the cell-attached patch clamp techniques were applied for the voltage-clamp studies. Micropipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and heat-polished at the tip. They had resistance values between 4 and 8 megohms after filling with a pipette solution. High resolution membrane currents were recorded using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifer (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by “E9SCREEN” software on an Atari computer. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential between the bath and pipette solutions. Voltage ramps were of 300-ms duration, covering a range of −100 to +100 mV. Capacitance and series resistance were canceled before each voltage ramp using the automatic neutralization routine of the EPC-9. For studies using the perforated whole-cell configuration, the micropipettes for electrical recording were filled with a solution containing 143 mM cesium-aspartate, 4 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EGTA, 200 μg/ml nystatin (Sigma; 200 mg/ml; dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2, adjusted by adding CsOH). The bath contained 140 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine-methanesulfonic acid, 10 mM Ca(OH)2, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test. Single-channel currents were recorded as described by Hamill et al. (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sackman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). The signal was stored on video tape after analogue/digital conversion (Sony PCM 501 ES, modified by Shoshin EM Corp., Okazaki, Japan). For studies using the cell-attached configuration, the micropipettes were filled with a solution containing 110 mM BaCl2 or CaCl2, 200 nM tetrodotoxin, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted by adding Ba(OH)2 or Ca(OH)2). In some experiments, Cl− was replaced with aspartate. The bath solution contained 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). Single channel recordings were analyzes by using the TAC program (HEKA). The total number of functional channels (N) in the patch were estimated by observing the number of peaks detected on the amplitude histogram. As an index of channel activity, NPo (number of channels multiplied by the open probability) was calculated as NPo=∑n=0Nn⋅tnT(Eq. 1) where T is the total record time, n is the number of channels open, and tn is the recording time during which n channels are open. Therefore, NPo can be calculated without making assumptions about the total number of channels in a patch or the open probability of a single channel. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at 20-26°C. Cells were harvested, and the total RNA was isolated using Isogene and quantified spectrophotometrically. Total RNA (20 μg) was resolved by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 8 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N++, Amersham Corp.). by means of capillary blotting in 10 × sodium citrate buffer. Hybridization was performed with a probe labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming according to the manufacture's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The hybridized membrane was exposed to Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). We showed that IGF-I stimulates DNA synthesis when added to quiescent cells expressing CD20, whereas it has no stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis in untransfected quiescent cells (12Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, IGF-I stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in CD20-expressing quiescent cells and the effect of IGF-I was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD20 in a dose-dependent manner. This monoclonal antibody also inhibited serum-induced DNA synthesis in Raji cells that express native CD20 (data not shown). It should be noted that mAb against CD20 did not affect DNA synthesis induced by IGF-I (Table I). Furthermore, mAb against CD20 did not cross-react with IGF-I assessed by Western blotting (data not shown).Table IEffect of mAb against CD20 on IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis in parental Balb/c 3T3 cellsAddition[3H]Thymidine incorporationcpmIGF-I36,107 ± 2,162IGF-I + mAb35,128 ± 2,632 Open table in a new tab IGF-I induces oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]c in primed competent cells (17Kojima I. Mogami H. Ogata E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E307-E311Google Scholar) by activating IGF-operated calcium-permeable channels (15Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Google Scholar, 20Matsunaga H. Nishimoto I. Yamashita N. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Kojima I. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C442-C446Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, however, IGF-I does not affect [Ca2+]c (16McNiel P.L. Mckenna M.P. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 372-379Google Scholar). To test whether or not CD20 is modulated by IGF-I, we first monitored the changes in [Ca2+]c in response to IGF-I using quiescent cells expressing CD20. Fig. 2A shows the typical changes in [Ca2+]c in CD20-expressing cells monitored by measuring the fluorescence of a Ca2+ indicator, fura-2. As we reported (11Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar), increasing the extracellular calcium concentration from 10 μM to 2 mM slightly increased [Ca2+]c. When 1 nM IGF-I was added to the cells, [Ca2+]c further increased (43 out of 43 cells). The increase in [Ca2+]c induced by IGF-I was monophasic in 39 out of 43 cells and the net increase in [Ca2+]c was 168 ± 46 nM (means ± S.E., n = 39), which was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The [Ca2+]c of mock-transfected control and untransfected cells did not change significantly under these conditions. In some cells (4 out of 43 cells), IGF-I induced oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]c (Fig. 2B). The effect of IGF-I was reproduced by 100 nM insulin (30 of 30 cells) (Fig. 2C). The IGF-I-induced elevation of [Ca2+]c was dependent on extracellular calcium and its removal (Fig. 2A) or the addition of lanthanum (data not shown) abolished the elevated [Ca2+]c. Elevation of [Ca2+]c induced by IGF-I were completely abolished by the mAb against CD20 and [Ca2+]c returned to the level of that in cells incubated low-calcium containing medium (6 out of 6 cells) (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that IGF-I stimulated Ca2+ influx through the CD20 channel in CD20-expressing cells. Patch-clamp experiments were performed to record the changes in calcium permeability of the membrane induced by IGF-I. We previously reported that IGF-I increases the open probability of a calcium permeable cation channel in primed competent, but not quiescent cells (15Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Google Scholar, 20Matsunaga H. Nishimoto I. Yamashita N. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Kojima I. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C442-C446Google Scholar). To distinguish CD20 from the native IGF-operated Ca2+-permeable cation channel, we used quiescent cells. First, we examined changes in Ca2+ conductance induced by IGF-I using a nystatin-perforated whole-cell patch clamp. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship was obtained by applying voltage ramps from −100 to 100 mV. Fig. 3A shows a comparison of the I-V curves obtained before and 3 min after the addition of IGF-I. These inward currents were generated by Ca2+, since Ca2+ is the only cation permeant in this condition. At a holding potential of −100 mV, inward current in cells treated with IGF-I was 446 ± 51% (means ± S.E., n = 42) of that in control cells, which was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The I-V curve was not changed as a function of time in the absence of IGF-I (Fig. 3B). The Ca2+ current was completely abolished by the mAb against CD20 (Fig. 3B) and, in addition, both La3+ and Co2+ inhibited the Ca2+ currents (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when Ca2+ was replaced with Ba2+ as a charge carrier. When 100 nM insulin was added, the calcium current was similarly enhanced (Fig. 3C). It is notable that we could not identify IGF-I-stimulated Ca2+ permeability using the conventional whole-cell patch clamp procedure. This may be due to the fact that, in whole cell configuration, soluble components of the cytosol are quickly dialyzed by the solution filling the pipettes. Next, we recorded inward currents in cell-attached patches to further characterize the action of IGF-I on Ca2+ influx in cells expressing CD20. Fig. 4 shows a typical record obtained from a cell-attached patch on a CD20-expressing cell with a high concentration of barium (110 mM) in the pipette and a holding potential of −40 mV. An inward current was observed when IGF-I was present in the pipette solution (200 out of 218 patches) (Fig. 4B), whereas little channel activity was evident in a patch without IGF-I (Fig. 4A). The IGF-I-activated inward current was not detected when mAb against CD20 (2 μg/ml) was present in the pipette solution (none of 32 patches) (Fig. 4C). IGF-I may activate CD20 channels either directly or indirectly via a soluble second messenger in the cytoplasm. To elucidate whether the CD20 channel is regulated by a diffusible second messenger, IGF-I was added to the bath solution while recording from cell-attached patches with 110 mM Ba2+ in the pipette. IGF-I therefore had access to its receptors located only outside the patch. In this condition, CD20 channels were not activated (none of 28 patches) (Fig. 4D). This finding suggested that IGF-I augments channel activity by a direct mechanism that does not involve a diffusible second messenger. The I-V curve displayed a slope conductance of 7.0 ± 0.6 pS (means ± S.E., n = 8) and extraporation of the data indicates a reversal potential of +20 mV (Fig. 5). Again, a high concentration of insulin (100 nM) reproduced the effect of IGF-I (data not shown). Barium was used as a charge carrier since calcium channels are generally more permeable to this ion, which often permits a better resolution of differences in single-channel amplitudes. However, when barium was substituted for calcium ions, there was no significant difference in the IGF-I-induced current. Moreover, current amplitudes were the same whether chloride or aspartate was the anion in the pipette solution, which confirmed that the currents were carried by an influx of cations (Ca2+ or Ba2+), rather than by an outward anion flux, which would display negative reversal potentials. Potassium cannot be taken into account since this ion was not in the pipette solution and a high concentration of barium inhibits K+ permeability. No voltage dependence was detected and inhibitors of voltage-dependent calcium channel such as nifedipine and verapamil had no effect on the IGF-I-activated currents.Fig. 5I-V relationship for single CD20 current. Single channel Ba2+ current was measured in cell-attached patch with 1 nM IGF-I in the pipette and the membrane potential was changed from −80 to 0 mV. Values are the mean ± S.E. for eight experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the involvement of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein in IGF-I-induced activation, we studied the effect of IGF-I in PTX-treated cells. When cells were pretreated with PTX (21Ui M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1984; 5: 277-279Google Scholar), the addition of IGF-I in the pipette did not affect the activity of CD20 channel (none of 30 patches) (Fig. 6A). Likewise, IGF-I did not increase calcium current in PTX-treated cells (none of 18 cells) (Fig. 6B). Additionally, IGF-I did not elevate [Ca2+]c in PTX-treated cells (none of 40 cells) (Fig. 6C). Conversely, 50 pM mastoparan, an activator of Gi/Go class of G proteins (22Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Google Scholar), markedly stimulated the activity of the CD20 channels (43 out of 43 patches) (Fig. 7A) whereas Mas 17, an analogue which does not activate the G proteins, was ineffective (none of 14 patches) (Fig. 7B).Fig. 7Effect of mastoparan on single channel CD20 current single channel current was measured in cell-attached patch with 50 pM mastoparan (A) or Mas 17 (B), an inactive analogue, in the pipette.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further assess the role of a G protein in the regulation of CD20 channel, we transfected Balb/c 3T3 cells expressing CD20 with the cDNA for Gip2, a constitutive active form of Gi2 protein (23Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vollar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.r. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H. McCormick F. Science. 1990; 249: 655-659Google Scholar). When Gip2 cDNA was expressed, the activity of CD20 channel measured in the cell-attached patch was markedly augmented without the addition of any ligand (32 of 32 patches) (Fig. 8A). When transmembrane calcium current was measured in the whole-cell-perforated patch, calcium permeability was greatly elevated (20 out of 20 cells) (Fig. 8B). In the present study, we examined whether the calcium-permeable cation channel activity of CD20 is affected by IGF-I in CD20-expressing Balb/c 3T3 cells. The notion that CD20 channel is activated by IGF-I in Balb/c 3T3 cells was supported by results obtained by three independent methods: monitoring changes in [Ca2+]c, measurement of whole-cell calcium current and the single channel analysis. It was most explicitly demonstrated by using the perforated patch clamp. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of IGF-I to the bath solution increased the inward calcium current, which was reversed by an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Therefore, it is clear that IGF-I activates the channel activity of CD20 expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells. The following observations supported the notion that IGF-I exerts its effect via the IGF-I receptor. First, we showed previously that, at a concentration of 10−9M, IGF-I predominantly acts on the IGF-I receptor but not on either the IGF-II receptor or the insulin receptor (15Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Google Scholar). In CD20-expressing cells, 1 nM IGF-I activated the channel activity of CD20. Second, a high concentration of insulin, which does not bind to the IGF-II receptor (24Nissley P. Haskell J. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1985; 3: 39-51Google Scholar), activated the CD20 channel. Given that Balb/c 3T3 cells do not express significant number of the insulin receptor, a high concentration of insulin bound to the IGF-I receptor and modulated the activity of CD20. At present, the precise mechanism by which the IGF-I receptor activates calcium-permeable CD20 channels is not certain. The IGF-I receptor structurally resembles the insulin receptor (24Nissley P. Haskell J. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1985; 3: 39-51Google Scholar, 25Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U.

Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Google Scholar), and it consists of α- and β-subunits. Ligand binding to the α-subunit results in the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase located in the β-subunit. It is generally accepted that receptor-associated tyrosine kinase is needed for the signal transduction. Yet, the downstream signal leading to the channel activation is not clear at present. Since a single channel current of CD20 was not activated by IGF-I added outside the patch, the regulatory mechanism by which IGF-I receptor activated the channel may be direct, not involving a soluble second messenger. In this regard, previous studies done in our laboratory showed that IGF-I-mediated calcium influx via the calcium-permeable cation channel is blocked by pertussis toxin (27Nishimoto I. Ogata E. Kojima I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 403-412Google Scholar). In addition, IGF-I-mediated calcium entry is blocked by GDPβS and conversely, augmented by GTPγS (28Kojima I. Kitaoka M. Ogata E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 150-152Google Scholar). These results indicated that IGF-I, by acting on the IGF-I receptor, modulates the calcium-permeable channel by a mechanism involving pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Similarly, IGF-I stimulates calcium influx in Chinese hamster ovary cells by Gi-dependent mechanism (29Pfeifer A. Nurnberg B. Kamm S. Uhde M. Schultz G. Ruth P. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 9052-9059Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism by which IGF-I activates the channel via G protein is not yet identified. As shown in Fig. 6A, pertussis toxin also abolished the activation of CD20 by IGF-I. Mastoparan, which directly activates pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (22Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Google Scholar), stimulated the CD20 channels. Additionally, the CD20 channel was markedly activated by the co-expression of cDNA for Gip2, a constitutive active form of Gi2. Hence, CD20 can be directly activated by αi2 subunit. Taken together, the mechanisms by which IGF-I activates CD20 and the IGF-operated channel may be similar. Recently, Luttrell et al. (30Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Google Scholar) demonstrated that activation of MAP kinase by IGF-I is attenuated by pertussis toxin. Their results support the notion that a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in the signaling system activated by IGF-I. Despite the fact that CD20 is not a natural effector molecule of the IGF-I signaling system, it may provide a good model system with which to study the regulation of the calcium-permeable channel by the IGF-I receptor. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which CD20 is regulated by the IGF-I receptor. The present results also provide some insight into the nature of the IGF-operated calcium-permeable channel. Despite of the fact that CD20 channel is ectopically expressed in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, the channel is activated by the IGF-I receptor. This raises an interesting possibility that the putative IGF-operated channel and CD20 may share some structural homology. CD20 is a cell-surface protein expressed in B lymphocytes. Although it has several functions in the signal transduction system in B cells (8Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Google Scholar, 9Deans J.P. Kalt L. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Bolen J.B. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22632-22638Google Scholar, 10Deans J.P. Schieven G.L. Shu G.L. Valentine M.A. Gilliland L.A. Aruffo A. Clerk E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4494-4504Google Scholar), information regarding the ligand that activates CD20 is not available. The present results may provide some insight into the regulation of CD20 functions. An obvious candidate ligand that may activate CD20 is interleukin 4, since this cytokine and insulin share the signaling molecules, insulin receptor substrate-1 and −2 (31Wang L.M. Keegan A. Frankel M. Paul W.E. Pierce J.H. Stem Cells. 1995; 13: 360-368Google Scholar, 32Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yeush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Google Scholar). However, interleukin 4 does not activate CD20 channels in Raji cells. 2M. Kanzaki and I. Kojima, unpublished observations. It is possible that a ligand that acts on a receptor system functionally resembling the IGF-I receptor activates the channel activity of CD20. Alternately, the ligand activating PTX-sensitive G proteins may activate the CD20 channel. We thank Dr. M.

https://openalex.org/W2053324846,"Permeabilized Hep G2 cells have been used to investigate the turnover of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). When such cells were chased in the presence of buffer, there was no biosynthesis of apoB-100, nor was the protein secreted from the cells. Thus the turnover of apoB-100 in these cells reflected the posttranslational degradation of the protein. Pulse-chase studies indicated that apoB-100 was degraded both when associated with the membrane and when present as lipoproteins in the secretory pathway. Neither albumin nor α1-antitrypsin showed any significant posttranslational intracellular degradation under the same condition. The kinetics for the turnover of apoB-100 in the luminal content differed from that of apoB-100 that was associated with the microsomal membrane. Moreover, while the degradation of the luminal apoB-100 was inhibited by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), this was not the case for the membrane-associated protein. Together these results suggest the existence of different pathways for the degradation of luminal apoB-100 and membrane-associated apoB-100. This was further supported by results from pulse-chase studies in intact cells, showing that ALLN increased the amount of radioactive apoB-100 that associated with the microsomal membrane during the pulse-labeling of the cells. However, ALLN did not influence the rate of turnover of the membrane-associated apoB-100.The presence of an ATP-generating system during the chase of the permeabilized cells prevented the disappearance of pulse-labeled apoB-100 from the luminal lipoprotein-associated pool. The ATP-generating system combined with cytosol protected the total apoB-100 in the system from being degraded. The cells cultured in the presence of oleic acid and chased after permeabilization in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system showed an increase in the amount of apoB-100 present on dense (“high density lipoprotein-like”) particles. This increase was linear during the time investigated (i.e. from 0 to 2 h chase) and independent of protein biosynthesis. Our results indicate that the dense particle was generated by a redistribution of apoB-100 within the secretory pathway and that it most likely was assembled from the membrane- associated form of apoB-100. These results indicate that the release of apoB-100 from this membrane-associated form to the microsomal lumen is dependent on cytosolic factors and a source of metabolic energy.

During the first step apoB is translocated to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which appears to be coupled with a partial lipidation of the protein (1Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar). In the second step the majority of lipids is added to this partially lipidated form of apoB, to form a full-size VLDL particle (2Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar) (for review with references, see Innerarity et al. (3Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Yamanaka S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2353-2356Google Scholar)). Both steps occur in primary hepatocytes (4Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Google Scholar) and in certain cell lines (such as McA-RH7777 cells) (2Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar). However, Hep G2 cells are unable to make any significant amount of VLDL; instead these cells assemble a triacylglycerol-rich particle with the size and density of a low density lipoprotein (LDL) (5Spring D.J. Chen-Liu L.W. Chatterton J.E. Elovson J. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14839-14845Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that these cells lack the second step.

Evidence to date suggests that modulation of the secretion of apoB-100 is posttranscriptionally regulated (see, for example, Refs. 6Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O.

Acta. 1990; 1042: 70-80Google Scholar). One of the control points in this regulation appears to be the translocation of apoB-100 into the ER lumen (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Google Scholar, 11Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Google Scholar, 12Rusinol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J.

Thus at least a portion of apoB-100 that is associated with the ER membrane appears to be sorted to degradation (1Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar, 14Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Google Scholar, 15Borén J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar). Moreover, apoB-100 that has been translocated into the ER lumen has been suggested to be the target for posttranslational degradation (15Borén J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar, 16Cartwright I.J. Hebbachi A.-M. Higgins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20937-20952Google Scholar). The process involved in sorting lipoproteins in the lumen to degradation appears to recognize the degree of lipidation of the particles (1Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar, 17Borén J. Wettesten M. Rustaeus S. Andersson M. Olofsson S.-O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 487-493Google Scholar, 18Rustaeus S. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Andersson M. Lidén H. Olofsson S.-O. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 10: 958-965Google Scholar). Thus, while the 200-300-Å LDL-VLDL particle that is assembled in the Hep G2 cells is secreted, the more dense apoB-100 lipoproteins present in the lumen of the secretory pathway appear to be retained and degraded in the cell (1Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar, 6Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P.

The subcellular site where the posttranslational degradation of apoB occurs has thus far not been unequivocally identified, but is generally thought to be the ER or a closely associated compartment (10Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Google Scholar, 19Davis R.A. Prewett A.B. Chan D.C.F. Thompson J.J. Borchardt R.A. Gallaher W.R. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Google Scholar), although studies in rat hepatocytes have suggested post-ER degradation of apoB (22Wang C.-N. Hobman T.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24924-24931Google Scholar, 23Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 177-186Google Scholar, 24Verkade H.J. Fast D.G. Rusinol A.E. Scraba D.G. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Google Scholar). A compartment that is closely associated with ER would fit with recent data showing that other proteins (25Roposo G. van Santen H.M. Leigendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Google Scholar) are sorted to degradation in a pre-Golgi, intermediate tubular compartment. Permeabilized cells provide a good model for studies of apoB degradation and have provided important insights into the degradative mechanisms. An important advantage with permeabilized cells is that they allow for an easier identification of degradation intermediates including an abundant N-terminal 70-kDa degradation fragment (11Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Google Scholar, 21Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Google Scholar). Using permeabilized Hep G2 cells we have obtained results (21Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Google Scholar, 26Sallach S.M. Adeli K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 29-32Google Scholar) indicating that apoB degradation occurs in the ER, is temperature- and pH-dependent, and is stimulated by ATP, and that an ALLN-sensitive cysteine protease may be involved. Moreover, we showed that the 70-kDa fragment is present in the lumen of the secretory pathway and that the generation of this fragment is ALLN-sensitive (21Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Google Scholar). The first step in the assembly of lipoproteins, i.e. the translocation of apoB into the ER lumen, appears to be of importance for the regulation of the secretion of apoB, and the amount of particles secreted depends on assembly and degradation. We have studied these processes in permeabilized Hep G2 cells, i.e. in cells that carry out only the first step in VLDL assembly. The data suggest that both the membrane-bound and lipoprotein-associated apoB-100 pools are targets for intracellular degradation. The apoB on luminal lipoproteins appears to be degraded by an ALLN-sensitive degradative mechanism and can be rescued from degradation by an ATP-generating system. To rescue the entire pool of apoB-100 in the cell, the ATP-generating system had to be combined with cytosol. Hep G2 cells (ATCC HB 8065) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Fetal bovine serum (certified grade) and cell culture media were from Life Technologies Inc. (Paisley, UK). Culture dishes and flasks were obtained from Corning or Falcon. Digitonin (50% purity), oleic acid, leupeptin, pepstatin, ALLN, and other common laboratory reagents were from Sigma. Digitonin of a higher purity (100%) was obtained from Calbiochem. Ready Safe was from Beckman. Trasylol (aprotinin) was from Bayer Leverkusen, FRG. Ultrapure electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. L-[35S]methionine (specific activity of >1000 Ci/mmol), 35S-protein labeling mixture (Pro-mix™; specific activity of >1000 Ci/mmol), 14C-methylated protein standards (rainbow markers), and Amplify were purchased from Amersham International. Monospecific apoB antibodies were in most cases prepared in the laboratory; however, such antibodies were also to a limited extent obtained from Medix-Biotech (Foster City, CA) and purified in the laboratory. Rabbit anti-goat IgG, α1-antitrypsin antiserum, and albumin antiserum were from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark) or from Sigma. Immunoprecipitin was obtained from Life Technologies Inc. (Paisley, UK). ENHANCE was from DuPont Canada (Toronto, ONT). Hep G2 cells were grown in 85- or 100-mm dishes at 37°C, 5% CO2 in complete medium (α modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum). In the cases when the cells were cultured in the presence of oleic acid, the culture medium was supplemented with 360 μM oleic acid 48 h prior to the start of the experiment. Confluent Hep G2 cultures were incubated with methionine-free modified Eagle's medium for 120 min, pulse-labeled (15-20 min) with 75-150 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine + cysteine (Pro-Mix™) or [35S]methionine, washed three times, and chased for 10-30 min in culture medium supplemented with 10 mM methionine in order to fully elongate labeled nascent polypeptides to obtain full-length apoB-100. The cells were then washed and incubated in 0.3 M sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium-free EDTA, 10 mM PIPES, pH 6.8 (CSK buffer) containing 50 μg/ml of digitonin for 10 min at room temperature. Digitonized cells were washed three times in CSK buffer and were then used for the studies. To supplement one 85- or 100-mm dish of permeabilized cells with cytosol the following protocol was used. Cytosol from one 85- or 100-mm dish of confluent Hep G2 cells was prepared as described in Pind et al. (27Pind S. Davidson H. Schwaninger R. Beckers C.J. Plutner H. Schmid S.L. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 222-234Google Scholar) with the exception that the cytosol was not desalted. The ATP-generating system described in Pind et al. (27Pind S. Davidson H. Schwaninger R. Beckers C.J. Plutner H. Schmid S.L. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 222-234Google Scholar) was used, i.e. 5 parts of 40 mM ATP was mixed with 5 parts of 200 mM creatine phosphate and 1 part of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase (100 units/ml). The cytosol was mixed with 110 μl of the ATP-generating system, and the mixture was diluted to a final volume of 2 ml with CSK buffer and added to the permeabilized cells after three washes with CSK buffer (see above). The luminal content of the total microsomal fraction was isolated as described previously (1Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar, 6Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol.

Sjöberg A. Thorlin T. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10556-10564Google Scholar). Briefly, permeabilized cells incubated for 0-2 h were washed twice with 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, and once with 50 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4. The cells were then scraped in 0.5 ml of 50 mM sucrose solution supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inhibitory units/ml Trasylol, 1 μM pepstatin A, and 5 μM ALLN), and the total microsomal fraction was recovered as described previously (6Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Google Scholar, 28Boström K. Wettesten M. Borén J. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13800-13806Google Scholar). The microsomes were subjected to carbonate extraction (30Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Google Scholar) with the modification described in Boström et al. (28Boström K. Wettesten M. Borén J. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13800-13806Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the recovery of proteins weakly associated to the membrane could be increased by carrying out the sodium carbonate extraction in the presence of a high concentration of salt. During the establishment of this method (28Boström K. Wettesten M. Borén J. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13800-13806Google Scholar) we investigated the effect of high concentration of salt for the recovery of apoB-100 with the membrane. The results indicated that there were no substantial effects of high concentration of salt on the recovery of apoB-100 from the membrane. The luminal contents were fractionated by ultracentrifugation as described elsewhere (1Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar). In short, the luminal contents were supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inhibitory units/ml Trasylol, 1 μM pepstatin A, and 5 μM ALLN) and then subjected to ultracentrifugation on a discontinous sucrose gradient (1.5 ml 49%/3.0 ml 25%/2.0 ml 20%/3.2 ml sample/1.9 ml 5%/0.9 ml of 0% sucrose) at 35,000 rpm in a SW40 rotor for 65 h, at 12°C. All solutions contained the protease inhibitor mixture as above. Gradients were fractionated into 1-ml fractions. Cell lysates or fractions collected from sucrose gradients were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to apoB-100, albumin, or α1-antitrypsin, as described earlier (31Wettesten M. Boström K. Bondjers G. Jarfeldt M. Norfeldt P.-I. Carella M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-466Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed in 3-15% polyacrylamide gradient gels containing SDS, and the bands were visualized by fluorography, cut out of the gel, and digested, and radioactivity was counted (31Wettesten M. Boström K. Bondjers G. Jarfeldt M. Norfeldt P.-I. Carella M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-466Google Scholar). The cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min and chased for 30 min, in order to obtain full-length apoB-100. The cells were then permeabilized and chased for 0 or 120 min in the presence of CSK buffer (0.3 M sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium-free EDTA, 10 mM PIPES, pH 6.8) alone or cytosol and an ATP-generating system. The 2-h chase in buffer alone resulted in a decrease in the amount of apoB-100 radioactivity in the cell, thus the recovery (given as percent of the apoB 100 radioactivity that was present before the chase) was 57 ± 11% (mean ± S.D., n = 5). There was also a substantial decrease in the apoB-100 radioactivity present on lipoproteins in the microsomal lumen. Thus only half (recovery 48 ± 19%, mean ± S.D., n = 5) of the total apoB present in the lumen before the chase was recovered after the 2-h chase. Since no significant amount of apoB appeared in the medium under these conditions, it appears that total apoB-100, including apoB-100 present on lipoproteins in the secretory pathway, was degraded. This degradation was unique for apoB-100 since we did not detect any loss of pulse-labeled albumin (Fig. 1A) or α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 1B). Gradient ultracentrifugation revealed that there was a loss of pulse-labeled apoB-100 both from the LDL-VLDL fraction and from the more dense (“HDL-like”) fraction (Fig. 2, −OA). There was an almost complete recovery (94 ± 36%; mean ± S.D., n = 4) of the apoB-100 radioactivity in the system (i.e. cells + medium) when the 2-h chase was carried out in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system. Moreover, under these conditions there was a complete recovery of the apoB-100 radioactivity present in the secretory pathway (recovery 103 ± 40%; mean ± S.D., n = 5). Gradient ultracentrifugation revealed a significant loss of apoB-100 from LDL-VLDL, while the apoB-100 radioactivity in the HDL density range tended to increase. The cytosol and the ATP-generating system induced a significant release of apoB-100 to the medium, and when the apoB-100 radioactivity of the LDL-VLDL fraction of the medium was included in the calculations, we observed a complete recovery of the apoB-100 radioactivity present in the LDL-VLDL fraction in the system (i.e. cell and medium). Culturing the cells in the presence of oleic acid before permeabilization did not influence the recovery of the total apoB-100 in the system (i.e. cell + medium) if the 2-h chase was carried out in the presence of CSK buffer alone (recovery 55 ± 17; mean ± S.D., n = 4). There was also a loss of apoB-100 radioactivity from the microsomal lumen (recovery 68 ± 6%; mean ± S.D., n = 3). Gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2, +OA) showed that this decrease was mainly confined to the LDL-VLDL fraction, where the recovery was less than 50%. Even if the apoB-100 radioactivity that was recovered from the LDL-VLDL fraction of the medium was included in the recovery calculation, we did not observe a complete recovery of the apoB-100 radioactivity present in the LDL-VLDL fraction. The apoB-100 radioactivity present in the more dense fraction (the HDL-like fraction) did not, however, decrease during the 2-h chase. Including cytosol (from cells cultured in the presence of oleic acid) and the ATP-generating system during the 2-h chase resulted in a complete recovery (121 ± 31%; mean ± S.D., n = 4) of the total apoB-100 radioactivity in the system (i.e. cells + medium). There was an increase in the total apoB-100 radioactivity present on lipoproteins in the luminal content. Thus the amount of apoB 100 radioactivity observed in the lumen after the chase corresponded to 175 ± 47% of the pre-chase value (mean ± S.D., n = 4). This was due to an increase in the apoB-100 radioactivity present in the HDL-like fraction (Fig. 2, +OA), indicating that more such particles appeared in the secretory pathway during the chase. We also observed an almost complete recovery of the apoB-100 radioactivity present in the LDL-VLDL fraction provided that the radioactivity in the LDL-VLDL fraction of the medium was included in the calculation (Fig. 2, +OA). The above results indicated that there was a generation of apoB-100 lipoproteins, in particular dense particles, in cells that had been chased in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system. Although we regard it as less likely, it is possible that the addition of cytosol and ATP starts an incorporation of the remaining radioactive amino acids (or radioactive amino acids released during protein breakdown) into apoB and that reinitiation of apoB-100 synthesis may explain the increase in the apoB-100 lipoproteins in the luminal content. To address this possibility we carried out a control experiment in which the chase was carried out in the presence of cycloheximide and a surplus of cold methionine (in addition to cytosol and the ATP-generating system). The results indicated that approximately the same amount of apoB-100 radioactivity was recovered in the dense luminal fraction (particles banding in the density range of HDL) under the two conditions. Thus the ratio between apoB-100 HDL from cells chased in the absence or presence of cycloheximide was 0.9 (mean of two experiments). Also the recovery of the apoB-100 radioactivity from LDL-VLDL was the same under the two conditions (the ratio between LDL-VLDL radioactivity recovered in the absence or presence of cycloheximide was 1.0; mean of two experiments). In these experiments we investigated the effect of buffer and the ATP-generating system during the 2-h chase after permeabilization. We used cells that had been cultured in the absence of oleic acid. To exclude the possibility that the ATP-generating system restarted the biosynthesis of radioactive apoB-100, we carried out the 2-h chase after permeabilization in the presence of cycloheximide and a surplus of unlabeled methionine. The results indicated that the ATP-generating system was not sufficient to protect the recovery of total apoB-100 in the system (recovery 60 ± 19; mean ± S.D., n = 4), and there was a difference in the recovery of total apoB-100 between permeabilized cells that were chased in the presence of the ATP-generating system and CSK buffer and those chased in the presence of the ATP-generating system and cytosol (see above; p < 0.05; two-tailed paired t test). There was, however, a complete recovery of apoB-100 from the different lipoprotein fractions present in the secretory pathway (Fig. 3), provided that the LDL-VLDL fraction recovered from the medium was taken into account. The decline in total apoB-100 radioactivity in the system (i.e. cells + medium) when chased in the presence of the ATP-generating system could be explained by a loss of the membrane-associated apoB-100 radioactivity (recovery 54%; mean of two experiments). The results presented above indicate that supplementation of permeabilized cell with cytosol and the ATP-generating system induced the formation of the dense (HDL-like) apoB-100-containing fraction. The formation of this fraction occurred without any change in the total amount of apoB-100 in the system and was not influenced by cycloheximide. It is therefore likely that it is formed by a redistribution of apoB-100 within the microsome. In agreement with such a redistribution we found a loss of pulse-labeled membrane-associated apoB-100 during the 2-h chase in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system. This loss was large enough to explain the accumulation of radioactive apoB-100 in the dense (HDL-like) fraction. This was shown by calculating the decrease in the membrane-associated apoB-100 radioactivity during the 2-h chase and relating that to the increase in apoB-100 radioactivity in the dense fraction during the same time period. The ratio (i.e. Δ apoB-100 radioactivity associated with the membrane/Δ apoB-100 radioactivity in the dense fraction) was 2.3 ± 1.7 (mean ± S.D., n = 5). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the accumulation of apoB-100 radioactivity in apoB-100 HDL was almost linear with time during the 2-h chase (data not shown). ApoB-100 radioactivity accumulated in the medium during the 2-h chase of cells that had been cultured in the absence of oleic acid, but permeabilized and chased in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system. When the cells were cultured in the presence of oleic acid, we detected a significant accumulation of apoB-100 both in the presence or absence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system. However, this accumulation increased severalfold in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system (Fig. 4). After correcting for leakage from the cells (see below) we estimated that the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system gave rise to a more than 3-fold increase in apoB secretion into the medium. It should, however, be noted that the rate of lipoprotein secretion from the cells was low compared to that of intact cells. Thus the percent of apoB-100 secreted (as the percentage of the total apoB-100 radioactivity present in the cell before the chase; mean ± S.D., n = 4) from cells cultured in the presence of oleic acid and chased in the presence or absence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system was 3 ± 0.9% and 0.9 ± 0.1%, respectively. The cells cultured in the absence of oleic acid and chased in the presence of cytosol and the ATP-generating system secreted 1.0 ± 0.6% of the total intracellular pool of radioactive apoB-100. There was no detectable accumulation of apoB-100 in the medium of cells that were cultured in the absence of oleic acid and chased in the presence of buffer alone. To correct for leakage we estimated the amount of apoB-100 HDL"
https://openalex.org/W2005777593,"We observed previously that glia maturation factor (GMF), a 17-kDa brain protein, is rapidly phosphorylated in astrocytes following stimulation by phorbol ester, and that protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated GMF is a potent inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and enhancer of p38; both are subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, suggesting GMF as a bifunctional regulator of the MAP kinase cascades. In the current report, we present evidence that PKA-phosphorylated GMF also promotes (11-fold) the catalytic activity of PKA itself, resulting in a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, GMF phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), but not by casein kinase II or p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, also activates PKA (7-fold). It appears that the mutual augmentation of GMF and PKA, and the stimulating effect of PKC, both serve to maximize the influence of PKA on the regulation of MAP kinase cascades by GMF. Using synthetic peptide fragments containing putative phosphorylation sites of GMF, we demonstrate that PKA is capable of phosphorylating threonine 26 and serine 82, whereas PKC, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, and casein kinase II, can phosphorylate serine 71, threonine 26, and serine 52, respectively. The generation of various phospho-isoforms of GMF may explain its modulation of signal transduction at multiple locations."
https://openalex.org/W2089626468,"Three distinct transmembrane glycoproteins bind fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family members. These include heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the tyrosine kinase-containing FGF receptors (FGFRs), and a cysteine-rich FGF receptor (CFR). The four FGFRs are thought to mediate FGF-signaling events but require the participation of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans to bind FGFs and transduce intracellular signals. However, a number of groups have proposed that FGF action requires events independent of FGFR activation. CFR, a high affinity FGF-binding protein, was first isolated from chicken embryos. To better understand the interactions between CFR and FGFs, we have constructed a series of CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments. Analysis of these has identified a ∼200-amino acid domain that constitutes a CFR FGF binding site. A CFR fragment of 450 residues, CFR290-740, binds FGF-2 with an affinity indistinguishable from the full-length molecule, whereas smaller fragments display greatly reduced FGF binding. Although CFR binds heparin with high affinity, an analysis of the heparin-CFR interaction failed to identify a linear sequence containing a heparin binding site. Two types of FGF binding sites were identified: an ionic strength and heparin-independent site that represents FGF binding to CFR290-740 and an additional FGF binding site that is heparan sulfate-dependent and sensitive to high ionic strength. This latter site is likely to bind FGF indirectly via heparan sulfate binding to CFR. FGF-2 peptides that encompass a sequence implicated in FGF-2 binding to FGFRs also block FGF-2 binding to CFR. Our data suggest that binding of FGFs to CFR and FGFRs is mutually exclusive, since the CFR FGF binding site does not require heparan sulfate, and similar regions on FGF-2 interact with both FGFRs and CFR.

D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Google Scholar). Three types of membrane anchored FGF-binding proteins have been identified that are likely to be involved in mediating the diverse functions of the FGF family. These include four tyrosine kinase-containing membrane glycoproteins (FGFRs) (15Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Google Scholar, 16Mason I.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Google Scholar), a large family of diverse heparan sulfate proteoglycans (17Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

An additional secreted FGF-binding protein has also been characterized (19Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Google Scholar). Among these, the FGFRs are proposed to mediate the biological functions of the FGFs. However, these receptors require heparan sulfate proteoglycans to bind FGFs with high affinity and to transduce FGF signals (20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar). Both binding sites for heparan sulfate present on the FGF and the FGFRs are likely to be required for FGF binding and signaling (22Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Google Scholar, 23Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Google Scholar, 24Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C.

The majority of FGF-mediated signaling events appear to require FGFRs, but additional requirements involving internalization and intracellular transport of the FGF ligand have been proposed (28Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H. Baldin V. Tauber J.P. Teissie J. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6770-6774Google Scholar, 29Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D.

Nagamine Y. Monti E. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 369-381Google Scholar). In addition, mutants of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 have revealed that the biological activities of these factors do not entirely correlate with their ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the FGFRs (34Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that additional FGF-binding proteins or receptors are involved in mediating some of the biological activities of the FGF family. A number of functions can be envisioned for these additional FGF-binding proteins. If transport of FGF into the cytoplasm is necessary for FGF function, then there are likely to be proteins involved in FGF transport and perhaps in regulation of intracellular FGF levels.CFR was first isolated as a high affinity FGF-binding protein from chicken embryos (35Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18647-18653Google Scholar). Isolation, sequencing, and characterization of the CFR cDNA revealed a protein sequence with no known homologs (18Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Google Scholar). CFR was found to bind a number of FGFs and to possess an amino-terminal signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, and a basic cytoplasmic region comprising 13 amino acids. Three other groups have since independently isolated CFR based on its identification as an FGF-binding protein (36Soulet L. Chevet E. Lemaitre G. Blanquaert F. Meddahi A. Barritault D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 49-55Google Scholar), a medial Golgi protein (37Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Google Scholar), and a ligand for the E-selectin receptor (38Steegmaler M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M. Kocher H.P. Kleuser B. Vestweber D. Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Google Scholar). Although the function of CFR is not known, we have recently reported a role for CFR in regulation of intracellular FGF trafficking (39Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Dodge N. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; Google Scholar).To better delineate the roles of CFR in FGF action, we have constructed a series of CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments, expressed the recombinant proteins in COS cells, and determined their FGF binding properties. In this article, we report that the binding of FGFs to CFR occurs within a 450-amino acid stretch of CFR sequence and that this binding does not require the presence of heparan sulfate. FGF-2 peptides that encompass a sequence implicated in FGF-2 binding to FGFRs also block FGF-2 binding to CFR. This result suggests that a similar region on FGF-2 may interact with both FGFRs and CFR. These data thus define an FGF binding site on CFR that is unlike the heparan sulfate-dependent FGF binding sites on the FGFRs (20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar) and may be involved in mediating distinct CFR-dependent FGF actions (39Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Dodge N. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; Google Scholar).RESULTSThe CFR protein binds affinity matrices containing covalently attached FGF-1, FGF-2, or heparin, suggesting that CFR binds not only to FGFs but also to heparin (Fig. 1). Although the CFR-associated proteins of 70 and 45 kDa are adsorbed to the affinity matrices, we have previously demonstrated that CFR binds FGFs directly (35Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18647-18653Google Scholar). However, these data do not determine whether FGF binding to CFR requires the presence of heparin or heparan sulfate, as is observed for the FGFRs. Therefore, we performed a detailed analysis of the CFR interactions with FGFs and heparin to further characterize the binding sites for the individual ligands.Five deletion mutants were constructed that maintained the open reading frame of CFR and an intact signal peptide sequence (Fig. 2A). Detection of the deletion mutants was initially accomplished using the anti-LA monoclonal antibody. However, deletion of carboxyl-terminal regions including amino acids 740-1138 or 219-1138 removed the anti-LA antibody epitope. Therefore, an HA1-tag was inserted into the mutants following the signal peptide sequence. Although the HA1 tag was satisfactory for Western analysis, it was unsuitable for analysis of 125I-FGF binding to CFR by RISA. Since the anti-LA antibody was originally used for RISA analysis for wild type CFR (47Deleted in proofDeleted in proofGoogle Scholar), we identified the 17-amino acid epitope and inserted the LA tag immediately preceding the coding sequence of the HA tag (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Analysis of 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR and its deletion mutants in COS cells. A, schematic diagrams of CFR deletion mutants. The CFR cDNA encodes a signal peptide (▨), a transmembrane domain (⍟), and a short 13-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The HA1 sequence (▧) was inserted following the signal peptide sequence (▨). The LA sequence (▪) was inserted between the signal peptide and the HA1 sequence. B, mutants were expressed in COS cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the anti-LA antibody. The relative level of mutant proteins was quantitated by phosphorimage analysis. C, binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CFR and its deletion mutants from COS cell extracts was performed by RISA. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of 125I-FGF-2 bound to the mock-transfected COS cell extract. The values shown were derived by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. Bars, S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Each deletion mutant was inserted in to a COS cell expression vector and transiently transfected in to COS cells. The expression levels were determined by Western blot analysis of COS cell extracts using the anti-LA antibody (Fig. 2B). The Western blot analysis of CFR deletion mutants demonstrated that similar levels of protein were present, with no apparent differences in degradation of any individual mutant compared with wild type CFR (CFRwt). To normalize the levels of CFR protein present for determination of 125I-FGF binding, extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with both the anti-LA and anti-HA epitope tag monoclonal antibodies. The relative levels of CFR protein were determined by chemiluminescence quantitation of phosphorimages. The relative levels of protein detected by both antibodies were used to normalize the expression of CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments to the level of wild type CFR expression. This procedure eliminated any potential artifacts due to differences in the expressed proteins or differences in the recognition of individual antibody epitopes.Equivalent amounts of wild type CFR and CFR deletion mutants were analyzed for 125I-FGF-2 binding by RISA. Three of the deletion mutants bound 125I-FGF-2 similarly to wild type CFR, whereas two mutants exhibited low levels of 125I-FGF-2 binding (Fig. 2C). Typically, bound counts averaged 4000 cpm, whereas the nonspecific binding averaged 500 cpm. These data suggest that the FGF binding site on CFR lies within residues 219-496 or 624-740.To further delineate the FGF binding domain, a number of CFR fragments were constructed (Fig. 3A). CFR fragments were expressed in COS cells, and extracts were isolated and quantitated for CFR protein content as described for the CFR deletion mutants. Western analysis of all four CFR fragments demonstrated that the proteins were stably expressed in COS cells (Fig. 3B). Binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CFRwt and to the CFR fragments identified only one fragment (CFR290-740) that was capable of binding significant levels of 125I-FGF-2 (Fig. 3C). Although the fragments appeared stable when analyzed in COS cell extracts, more than one freeze-thaw cycle abolished 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR290-740. Similar treatments did not affect binding to CFRwt. The four CFR fragments constructed were expected to narrow an FGF binding domain on CFR to approximately 200 residues. Data from the deletion analyses (see Fig. 2) suggested that the FGF binding domain was localized to a region encompassing either residues 219-496 or 624-740. However, only the CFR290-740 fragment bound 125I-FGF-2 (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Analysis of 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR and CFR fragments. A, schematic diagrams of CFR fragments. The legend is identical to that of Fig. 2A. B, fragments were expressed in COS cells and analyzed as described for Fig. 2. C, binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CFRwt and CFR fragments expressed in COS cells was determined by RISA. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of 125I-FGF-2 bound to the mock-transfected COS cell extract. The values shown were derived by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. D, CFR fragments expressed in COS cells were incubated with FGF-agarose. The extracts adsorbed to FGF-agarose were washed and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-LA monoclonal antibody. The amount of CFR present was quantified by phosphorimage analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Several possible hypotheses could explain the lack of 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR fragments smaller than CFR290-740. First, the RISA requires that a monoclonal antibody interacts with and retains the CFR fragment. It is possible that smaller CFR fragments exhibit reduced FGF binding due to steric hindrance following antibody binding. Alternatively, the fragments may not possess sufficient structural stability to maintain an FGF binding site or may not be folded properly, or the binding site for FGFs may comprise non-linear amino acid sequences contained in residues 219-496 and 624-740. To distinguish between the first two possibilities, an FGF binding assay independent of the RISA was developed. COS cell extracts containing equal amounts of CFR fragments or wild type CFR were adsorbed to FGF-agarose. The amount of CFR or CFR fragment adsorbed to the affinity matrix was determined by boiling the washed beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separating the fragments by SDS-PAGE, and visualizing by immunoblot analysis. The amount of CFR present was quantified as described previously for the CFR deletion mutants. These data were consistent with the RISA data in that CFRwt and the CFR290-740 fragment were retained on FGF-agarose, whereas other CFR fragments were not retained (Fig. 3D). Thus, the inability of the smaller CFR fragments to bind to the affinity matrix is likely to arise from improper folding or instability of CFR fragments, resulting in proteins incapable of FGF binding.Scatchard analysis of 125I-FGF-2 equilibrium binding to CFRwt and CFR290-740 revealed KD values that were virtually identical and comparable with those previously determined by our group (35Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18647-18653Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding data from three independent experiments yielded KD values of 1.4 ± 0.8 and 1.8 ± 0.9 nM for CFR290-740 and CFRwt, respectively. Curve fitting identified only a single class of sites when plotted according to Scatchard. 2Z. Zhou and B. B. Olwin, unpublished data. Thus, the CFR domain encompassing residues 290-740 contains a complete and intact FGF binding site. We hypothesize that CFR higher order structure is necessary for the formation of an FGF binding site, as: 1) bacterially produced CFR lacking a signal peptide and transmembrane domain does not bind FGFs; 2) denaturation of CFR by boiling abolishes FGF binding; and 3) CFR290-740 possesses intact disulfide bonds, a characteristic of the wild type protein.2Next, we examined the heparin binding to CFR to determine whether CFR bound heparin directly and to identify putative heparin binding domains. The specificity of heparin binding to the CFR complex was determined by RISA, examining 125I-heparin binding and competition with heparin or chondroitin sulfate. CFR expressed in COS cells and partially purified CFR specifically bound heparin, since unlabeled heparin but not chondroitin sulfate competed for 125I-heparin binding (Fig. 4). CFR expressed in COS cells does not contain bound CFR-associated proteins (47Deleted in proofDeleted in proofGoogle Scholar), suggesting a direct interaction of CFR with heparin.Fig. 4Heparin binding to CFR in CHO Cells. A modified RISA was used to asses the ability of CFR to specifically bind heparin. Relative heparin binding (□) was determined for partially purified chicken CFR and extracts prepared from CHO-K1 cells expressing CFRwt (CHO.CFRwt) and CHO-K1 cells transfected with an empty expression vector (CHO.vec). Controls include the addition of a 1000-fold excess of chondroitin sulfate (□) or heparin (▥), no α-CFR monoclonal antibody (▪), and 2 M NaCl wash ().View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Heparin binding to CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments was performed analogously to the previously described FGF binding experiments. CFR deletion mutants and fragments bind heparin but exhibit a complex pattern (Fig. 5A). At least one heparan sulfate binding site appears to be present. Binding of CFR deletion mutants and fragments to heparin-agarose also presents a complex pattern (Fig. 5B). Both assays demonstrate that alterations of CFR structure and primary sequence affect heparin binding. These data do not allow unambiguous identification of a heparin binding domain within the CFR primary amino acid sequence.Fig. 5Heparin binding to CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments. A, CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments from COS cell extracts were used for heparin binding by RISA. Equal amounts of CFR mutants and fragments were used for each assay. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of [3H]heparin bound to the mock-transfected COS cell extract. The values shown were derived by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. B, CFR fragments expressed in COS cells were incubated with heparin-agarose. The extracts adsorbed to heparin-agarose were washed and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-LA monoclonal antibody. The amount of CFR present was quantified by phosphorimage analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We then performed a series of experiments to determine whether the binding of CFR to FGF was dependent on heparan sulfate. CHO-K1 cells (wild type) and CHO cell mutants that do not synthesize heparan sulfate and display low levels of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (CHO677) (48Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Google Scholar) were stably transfected with CFRwt expression vectors. A CHO-K1 clone and a CHO677 clone were selected for similar levels of CFR protein expression (Fig. 6A) and subjected to 125I-FGF-2 binding by RISA (Fig. 6B). The CHO677 cells exhibited 50% less 125I-FGF-2 binding than the CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6B). To confirm that the assay conditions did not alter the levels of CFR present, the cells were solubilized in SDS-PAGE buffer following the assay, and the products were analyzed by Western blotting (not shown). This confirmed that equivalent levels of CFR were present in all wells.Fig. 6FGF binding to CFR expressed in CHO-K1 and CHO.677 cells. A, Western analysis of CFR in CHO cell extracts. Shown here are representative clones isolated following transfection with the parent vector (lane 1), CHO-K1 cells transfected with the CFRwt expression vector (lane 2), and CHO677 cells transfected with the CFRwt expression vector (lane 3). Equal amounts of extract protein were loaded in each lane. B, extracts from the indicated cell types were used to determine their relative ability to bind 125I-FGF-2 in a RISA. Equivalent amounts of CFR were added from CHO-K1 and CHO677 extracts. An immunoblot analysis of the proteins remaining in the wells following the RISA confirmed that equivalent amounts of CFR were immunoadsorbed (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Heparin appears to augment FGF binding to CFR. Since a high ionic strength wash disrupts the interaction of CFR with heparin (Fig. 1), it should also abrogate heparin-dependent increases in FGF binding. Analysis of 125I-FGF-2 binding by RISA in the presence or absence of heparin revealed that heparin-dependent increases in FGF binding occur (Fig. 7). Addition of heparin to extracts from CHO-K1 and CHO677 cells expressing CFR increased 125I-FGF-2 binding to equivalent levels (Fig. 7). A 2 M NaCl wash following incubation with heparin and ligand reduced 125I-FGF-2 binding 2-3-fold, resulting in equivalent binding to CHO-K1 and CHO677 extracts. In the absence of heparin or heparan sulfate, we observed a single class of FGF binding sites on CFR that were not affected by high ionic strength and displayed a KD near 1 nM. In the presence of heparin, additional FGF binding was observed that is ionic strength dependent (Fig. 7). Scatchard analysis of CFR and CFR treated with heparin followed by a high ionic strength wash revealed an increase in the number of FGF binding sites but no detectable change in affinity. Thus, it is likely that heparin binding to CFR stabilizes higher order CFR structure.Fig. 7Effects of heparin and a 2 M NaCl wash on FGF-2 binding to CFR expressed in CHO-K1 and CHO677 cells. Binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CFR expressed in CHO-K1 (▧, wild type) and CHO-677 (□, heparan sulfate-deficient) CHO cells was performed in the absence or presence of heparin. Where noted, the binding of 125I-FGF-2 was followed by two 2 M NaCl washes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The interactions of CFR with FGFs appear to differ from those observed for the FGFR tyrosine kinases. FGF-2 peptides have been used previously to identify a critical region of FGF-2 that has been proposed to interact with the FGF receptor tyrosine kinases (49Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Google Scholar). FGF-2 peptides containing a loop sequence (residues 106-115) bind to an FGFR site that is proposed to be involved in promoting dimer formation and signaling. The peptides containing this loop sequence block FGF-2 binding to FGF tyrosine kinase receptors, whereas peptides lacking the sequence do not (49Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Google Scholar). A similar analysis was performed for 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR. Peptides containing the loop sequences that inhibit FGF binding to FGFRs also inhibited binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CFR, whereas a FGF-2 peptide that did not contain the loop sequence did not block 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR (Fig. 8). Although our data suggest that the interactions of CFR with FGFs are different than the interactions of FGFRs with FGFs, a similar binding site on FGF-2 may interact with both CFR and FGFRs.Fig. 8Inhibition of FGF binding to CFR by FGF-2 peptide. Binding of 125I-FGF-2 to CFRwt in the presence of FGF-2 and FGF-2 peptides were performed by RISA. Purified CFR from chicken embryos was used for this assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe FGF family is known to bind to two distinct transmembrane glycoprotein complexes that include a complex of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the tyrosine kinase-containing FGF receptors, and the CFR complex. To better understand the role(s) that CFR may play in FGF action, we constructed a series of CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments to determine the nature of the interactions of FGFs and heparin with CFR. Analysis of deletion mutants suggested that the FGF binding domain comprises a region of ∼200 amino acids from residue 290 to residue 496 and/or ∼150 amino acids from residue 625 to residue 740.CFR possesses basic stretches of amino acids that correspond well to heparin binding “consensus” sites. Consistent with this observation, we have shown that CFR is a heparin-binding protein. An analysis of heparin binding to deletion mutants and CFR fragments failed to identify a region of sequence that comprises a single binding site. However, it is clear that CFR binds heparin at physiological ionic strength, suggesting that CFR is a heparin-binding protein in vivo.To better define the nature of the interactions of FGF and heparan sulfate with CFR, a series of experiments was performed to analyze the interdependence of FGF and heparin binding. Expression of CFR in a mutant CHO cell line that does not synthesize heparan sulfate provides conclusive evidence that FGF-2 does not require the carbohydrate to bind to CFR. However, addition of heparin to CFR expressed in CHO677 cells prior to incubation with FGF-2 increased FGF-2 binding by 2-3-fold. The heparin-dependent increase in FGF-2 binding is sensitive to 2 M NaCl, whereas the heparin-independent FGF binding is not sensitive to high ionic strength. Moreover, the level of FGF-2 binding in the presence of heparin can be reduced to the level of FGF binding in CHO677 cell extracts by treatment with high ionic strength. The salt treatment releases bound heparin from CFR, suggesting the presence of two types of FGF binding sites on CFR (Fig. 9). One site, identified by mutational analysis, is ionic strength-independent and resides between residues 290-740, whereas an additional site is sensitive to high ionic strength and is proposed to be bound indirectly via heparan sulfate interaction with CFR (Fig. 9). We therefore propose that these two types of FGF binding sites are distinct as presented in our model (Fig. 9). In contrast to CFR, FGFRs are incapable of binding FGFs in the absence of heparan sulfate (20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar, 26Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Google Scholar, 27Patstone G. Maher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3343-3346Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate binding to both FGF and the FGFR appear necessary to form a functional complex (50Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D.R. Lear J.D. Nahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Google Scholar, 51Rapraeger A.C. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 645-649Google Scholar). FGFRs contain a heparan sulfate binding site that is dependent on divalent cations (27Patstone G. Maher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3343-3346Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the FGF “binding site” on FGFRs is likely to recognize a complex of FGF and heparan sulfate, whereas CFR binds FGFs independently of heparan sulfate.Fig. 9A model for FGF binding to CFR. A model for the FGF-2 binding to CFR is presented in which two FGF binding sites are present under normal physiological conditions in the presence of heparan sulfate (a repeating carbohydrate dimer). A, at physiological ionic strength FGF-2 is bound directly to CFR and indirectly via heparan sulfate. B, at high ionic strength or in the absence of heparan sulfate, FGF-2 is bound only to the direct site on CFR. This site binds several FGF family members and is located between residues 290 and 740.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further delineate the characteristics of the FGF binding site on CFR, we examined the ability of FGF-2 peptides to block 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR. A similar study analyzing FGF-2 binding to intact cells revealed that a peptide corresponding to residues 106-115 of FGF-2 efficiently blocked FGF-2 activity, FGF-2 cross-linking, and FGF-2 binding (49Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Google Scholar). The efficacy of inhibition by the peptides on FGF-2 activity and FGF-2 cross-linking was indistinguishable from that observed for 125I-FGF-2 binding to CFR. Thus, the site on FGF-2 that interacts with CFR is likely to include the site that binds to FGFRs. Thus, the FGF binding site on CFR represents the only known FGF binding site that is independent of heparan sulfate. We predict that FGF binding to CFR and to FGFRs would likely be mutually exclusive. These data are consistent with an activity of CFR we have observed in CHO cells. CFR reduces the levels of intracellular FGF-2 and FGF-1 that have been internalized from the extracellular environment (39Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Dodge N. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; Google Scholar). Import of these FGFs into the cytoplasm has been observed independently by three laboratories (28Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H. Baldin V. Tauber J.P. Teissie J. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6770-6774Google Scholar, 52Baldin V. Roman A.M. Bosc B.I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Google Scholar, 53Cao Y. Pettersson R.F.

Two of these groups have demonstrated that import into the cytoplasm and nuclear localization of FGFs is critical for cell growth. If CFR acts to reduce the levels of intracellular FGFs, and the binding of FGFs to CFR and FGFRs is mutually exclusive as our data indicate, then CFR may modulate FGF functions that require internalized FGFs.Analysis of CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments for FGF binding has identified a new type of FGF binding domain that is distinct from the heparan sulfate-dependent binding site present on FGFRs. Further examination of this FGF binding site should reveal additional details of the CFR and FGF interactions. A comparison of the crystal structures for FGFR and CFR bound to FGFs will aid in the elucidation of the role(s) of CFR in FGF action.

D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Google Scholar). Three types of membrane anchored FGF-binding proteins have been identified that are likely to be involved in mediating the diverse functions of the FGF family. These include four tyrosine kinase-containing membrane glycoproteins (FGFRs) (15Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Google Scholar, 16Mason I.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 547-552Google Scholar), a large family of diverse heparan sulfate proteoglycans (17Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar), and a cysteine-rich FGF receptor (CFR) (18Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Google Scholar). An additional secreted FGF-binding protein has also been characterized (19Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Google Scholar). Among these, the FGFRs are proposed to mediate the biological functions of the FGFs. However, these receptors require heparan sulfate proteoglycans to bind FGFs with high affinity and to transduce FGF signals (20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar). Both binding sites for heparan sulfate present on the FGF and the FGFRs are likely to be required for FGF binding and signaling (22Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Google Scholar, 23Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Google Scholar, 24Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C.

The majority of FGF-mediated signaling events appear to require FGFRs, but additional requirements involving internalization and intracellular transport of the FGF ligand have been proposed (28Bouche G. Gas N. Prats H. Baldin V. Tauber J.P. Teissie J. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6770-6774Google Scholar, 29Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D.

A role for other FGF-binding proteins in mediating FGF signaling is thus expected, since these recent reports have identified FGF receptor tyrosine kinase-independent activities of FGFs that include the stimulation of DNA synthesis (29Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Google Scholar) (29Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D.

Nagamine Y. Monti E. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 369-381Google Scholar). In addition, mutants of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 have revealed that the biological activities of these factors do not entirely correlate with their ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the FGFRs (34Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that additional FGF-binding proteins or receptors are involved in mediating some of the biological activities of the FGF family. A number of functions can be envisioned for these additional FGF-binding proteins. If transport of FGF into the cytoplasm is necessary for FGF function, then there are likely to be proteins involved in FGF transport and perhaps in regulation of intracellular FGF levels.CFR was first isolated as a high affinity FGF-binding protein from chicken embryos (35Burrus L.W. Olwin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18647-18653Google Scholar). Isolation, sequencing, and characterization of the CFR cDNA revealed a protein sequence with no known homologs (18Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Google Scholar). CFR was found to bind a number of FGFs and to possess an amino-terminal signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, and a basic cytoplasmic region comprising 13 amino acids. Three other groups have since independently isolated CFR based on its identification as an FGF-binding protein (36Soulet L. Chevet E. Lemaitre G. Blanquaert F. Meddahi A. Barritault D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 49-55Google Scholar), a medial Golgi protein (37Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Google Scholar), and a ligand for the E-selectin receptor (38Steegmaler M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M. Kocher H.P. Kleuser B. Vestweber D. Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Google Scholar). Although the function of CFR is not known, we have recently reported a role for CFR in regulation of intracellular FGF trafficking (39Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Dodge N. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; Google Scholar).To better delineate the roles of CFR in FGF action, we have constructed a series of CFR deletion mutants and CFR fragments, expressed the recombinant proteins in COS cells, and determined their FGF binding properties. In this article, we report that the binding of FGFs to CFR occurs within a 450-amino acid stretch of CFR sequence and that this binding does not require the presence of heparan sulfate. FGF-2 peptides that encompass a sequence implicated in FGF-2 binding to FGFRs also block FGF-2 binding to CFR. This result suggests that a similar region on FGF-2 may interact with both FGFRs and CFR. These data thus define an FGF binding site on CFR that is unlike the heparan sulfate-dependent FGF binding sites on the FGFRs (20Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 21Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar) and may be involved in mediating distinct CFR-dependent FGF actions (39Zuber M.E. Zhou Z. Dodge N. Olwin B.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; Google Scholar)."

https://openalex.org/W2142024681,"The molecular chaperone cpn60 binds many unfolded proteins and facilitates their proper folding. Synthetic peptides have been used to probe the question of how cpn60 might recognize such a diverse set of unfolded proteins. Three hybrid peptides were synthesized encompassing portions of the bee venom peptide, apamin, and the sequence KWLAESVRAGK from an amphipathic helix in the NH2-terminal region of bovine rhodanese. Two disulfides connecting cysteine residues hold the peptides in stable helical conformations with unobstructed faces oriented away from the disulfides. Peptides were designed to present either a hydrophobic or hydrophilic face of the amphipathic helix that is similar to the one near the amino terminus of rhodanese. Aggregation of these peptides was detected by measuring 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)napthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bisANS) fluorescence at increasing peptide concentrations, and aggregation was not apparent below 2 μM. Thus, all experiments with the peptides were performed at a concentration of 1 μM. Reducing agents cause these helical peptides to form random coils. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of fluorescein-labeled peptide with the exposed hydrophobic face yielded a Kd = ∼106 μM for binding to cpn60, whereas there was no detectable binding of the reduced form. The peptide with the exposed hydrophilic face did not bind to cpn60 in either the oxidized or reduced states. Fluorescence experiments utilizing bisANS as a probe showed that binding of the helical hydrophobic peptide could induce the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on cpn60, whereas the same peptide in its random coil form had no effect. Thus, binding to cpn60 is favored by a secondary structure that organizes and exposes a hydrophobic surface, a feature found in amphipathic helices. Further, the binding of a hydrophobic surface to cpn60 can induce further exposure of complementary surfaces on cpn60 complexes, thus amplifying interactions available for target proteins.

Further, the binding of a hydrophobic surface to cpn60 can induce further exposure of complementary surfaces on cpn60 complexes, thus amplifying interactions available for target proteins. It has been accepted for some time that the amino acid sequence of a protein contains all the information to specify its tertiary conformation (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Scopus (5107) Google Scholar). However, in vitro refolding is often inefficient due to competing kinetic pathways that lead to aggregation or the formation of non-native conformations (2Fisher G. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2205-2212Google Scholar). It is believed that aggregation is a result of the association of hydrophobic surfaces that are normally hidden in the core of a folded protein but are exposed in partially folded states. The yields of properly folded protein in these in vitro experiments can be improved by carefully selecting conditions such as lower temperature (3Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Google Scholar), lower protein concentration (4Horowitz P. Criscimagna N.L J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15652-15658Google Scholar), or the addition of “nondenaturing” detergents (5Tandon S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15615-15618Google Scholar), all of which favor folding. It is of interest to consider how aggregation can be avoided in vivo, where temperatures remain relatively constant and high local concentrations of interactive nascent polypeptides are often present. Molecular chaperones are a group of cellular proteins known to be mediators of in vivo folding. Molecular chaperone proteins are mainly found in one of three highly conserved groups, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90, ranging from prokaryotes to mammals. Some molecular chaperones are expressed during heat shock, whereas others are expressed constitutively and are necessary for cell survival at nonstressed physiological conditions (6Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar). A characteristic property of molecular chaperones is that they can bind non-native forms of proteins and release them in a controlled manner. Escherichia coli Cpn60 (GroEL) is homologous to the eukaryotic mitochondrial protein Hsp60, and it is one of the best studied molecular chaperones. Cpn60 is composed of fourteen 57-kDa monomers assembled into two stacked seven-subunit rings (7Hendrix R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Google Scholar). Cpn60 assists in vitro refolding of a number of proteins, e.g. rhodanese (8Mendoza J.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24648-24654Google Scholar), citrate synthase (9Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Google Scholar), and lactate dehydrogenase (10Badcoe I.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lund P. Clark A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9195-9200Google Scholar). Unfolded rhodanese forms a binary complex with Cpn60 (8Mendoza J.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24648-24654Google Scholar) that requires the addition of the co-chaperonin cpn10 (groES), MgATP, and K+ for the most efficient release of folded, active rhodanese (11Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism for the binding and release of target proteins by cpn60 is incompletely understood. The fact that cpn60 can bind a wide variety of non-native polypeptides suggests that the molecular recognition is not specific for the sequence of the target. The 2.8 Å crystal structure and mutational analysis of cpn60 suggest that the polypeptide binding sites contain essential hydrophobic residues located in the apical domains of each cpn60 monomer (12Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Google Scholar, 13Fenton W.A. Yechezkel K. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Google Scholar). The common feature shared by the proteins that bind cpn60 has been suggested to be the presence of hydrophobic surfaces on folding intermediates. It was proposed by Martin et al., for example, that dihydrofolate reductase and rhodanese are bound to cpn60 as “molten globule” intermediates (14Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the secondary structure of regions of target proteins may be important for binding to cpn60 (15Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7359-7362Google Scholar). For example, transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement NMR experiments were used to study the binding of a peptide based on the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese. The binding was extremely weak (Kd = ∼1000 μM), but the peptide, which was a random coil in solution, appeared when bound to adopt a helical conformation. It was conjectured that the sequence that could form an amphipathic helix might bind along the hydrophobic face. A second example, the capture of an all β-sheet Fab fragment by cpn60 (16Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16829-16833Google Scholar), indicates that the specific secondary structure is not the determinant for the recognition by cpn60. To investigate the structural and chemical nature of cpn60-substrate interactions, we chose to study constrained peptides. Apamin is a peptide component of bee venom that contains 18 residues with two disulfide bonds bridging Cys1 to Cys11 and Cys3 to Cys15. These disulfides lock the COOH-terminal half of apamin (residues 9-16) into a helical conformation (18Callewaert G.L. Shipolini R. FEBS Lett. 1968; 1: 111-113Google Scholar, 35Pease J.H.B. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8491-8498Google Scholar). Various sequences can be substituted into the COOH terminus of apamin and forced into a helical conformation by the presence of these disulfide bridges (19Pease J.H.B. Storrs R.W. Wemmer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5643-5647Google Scholar). 1N. J. Skelton, unpublished data. The apamin framework can be used to present either the hydrophobic or hydrophilic face of an amphipathic helix (17Wemmer D. Kallenbach N.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1901-1906Google Scholar), and thus it serves as a useful tool for examining the structural requirements for binding to cpn60. Hybrid apamin peptides were constructed containing the NH2-terminal sequence of rhodanese (KWLAESVRAGK), which has been shown to bind in a helical conformation to cpn60. These peptides were then tested for their ability to bind cpn60. The peptides have the following sequences: C1NC3K(FITC)APETALC11WLAC15SVRAGK-NH2 (APA09), C1NC3KAPETALC11WLAC15SVRAGK-NH2 (APA14), and C1NC3K(FITC)APETKWC11AESC15RAGK-NH2 (APA08), with bold letters representing the rhodanese amino acids. 2The cyclized (helical) apamin-rhodanese hybrid peptides are designated as APA08c, APA09c, and APA14c, with the lower case c denoting the cyclized peptide form. The linear (reduced) apamin-rhodanese hybrid peptides are designated as APA08r, APA09r, and APA14r, with the lower case r denoting the linear form. The acronyms APA09 and APA14 are used in describing the hydrophobic peptides, and APA08 is used in describing the hydrophilic peptide. APA09 and APA08 were both synthesized with a FITC-labeled 3The abbreviations used are: FITCfluorescein isothiocyanateDTTDithiothreitolbisANS1,1′-bis(4-anilino)napthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acidNOEnuclear Overhauser effectHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. lysine at residue 4.

Following purification, cpn60 was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM DTT. Then glycerol was added to 10% (v/v), and aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The monomer concentration of cpn60 was measured at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1.22 × 107M−1 cm−1 as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis, assuming a molar mass of 60 kDa (21Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized on para-methyl benzhydrylamine resin utilizing t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry with rapid manual cycles as described previously (22Scholzer M. Alenwood P. Jones A. Alenwood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Google Scholar). The peptides were prepared with t-butoxycarbonyl-Lys (ϵ Fmoc) in the lysine 4 position. The Fmoc was removed with 20% piperidine in DMA after stepwise synthesis and prior to hydrogen fluoride cleavage. Fluorescein was incorporated into APA08 and APA09 by the addition of 4-fold excess FITC and diisopropylethylamine in DMA. The final t-butoxycarbonyl group was removed, the peptides were cleaved from the resin, and the side chain protecting groups were removed by treatment with anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride at 0°C for 1 h (10 ml of hydrogen fluoride, 1.0 ml of anisole, 0.2 ml of ethyl methylsulfide, 0.1 ml of thioanisole, 0.1 g of para-thiocresol/g of resin). The resultant peptide/resin mixture was washed with diethyl ether and extracted with 20% acetic acid. The crude linear peptide was lyophilized and purified by C18 reverse phase HPLC, eluting with a 23-38% acetonitrile gradient. The purified linear peptide was cyclized by dissolving it in water at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, adjusting the pH to 8.0-8.5 with ammonium hydroxide and stirring at 20°C for 3 days. The pH was then adjusted to 3.0 with acetic acid, and the solution was either lyophilized or maintained as the 0.1 mg/ml acidified solution and submitted for HPLC purification. The identity of each peptide was characterized by amino acid sequencing and mass spectroscopy. The hydrophilic peptide APA08 has the sequence CNCK(FITC)APETKWCAESCRAGK-NH2. The hydrophobic peptides APA09 and APA14 have the sequences CNCK(FITC)APETALCWLACSVRAGK-NH2 and CNCKAPETALCWLACSVRAGK-NH2, respectively. The bold characters in the above sequences represent the NH2-terminal portions of bovine rhodanese inserted into the apamin peptide. Disulfide bonds form between cysteine residues 1 and 11 and between cysteine residues 3 and 15 in the oxidized form of each peptide. The cyclized (oxidized) peptides are designated as APA08c, APA09c, and APA14c, with the lowercase c denoting the peptides in the cyclized form. The linear (reduced) peptides are designated as APA08r, APA09r and APA14r, with the lowercase r denoting the peptides in the reduced form. Each peptide was reconstituted in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and placed in a 0.05-cm pathlength quartz cell. All samples were filtered. The final concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements. The concentrations of each peptide were as follows: 0.165 mg/ml for APA08 cyclized, 0.020 and 0.031 mg/ml for APA09 linear and cyclized, respectively, and 0.30 mg/ml for APA14 linear and cyclized. The samples were analyzed with an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (model DS/60, Aviv Associates, New York, NY) using a constant bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Spectra were taken from 190 to 250 nm at 0.2-nm intervals with an averaging time of 3.0 s/data point. All spectra were acquired in triplicate and averaged. The spectrum of an appropriate buffer control sample was then subtracted from each of the sample spectra. The final spectral data were converted to mean residue weight ellipticities for determination of secondary structure content (mean residue weight factors: APA08, 129.9; APA09, 124.1; and APA14, 105.6). The mean residue weight ellipticities were used to calculate the relative contribution of secondary structural components (α-helix and β-sheet) to the overall spectra. The spectral deconvolution method utilized for these calculations has been described previously (23Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar). The peptide APA14 (2.0 mg) was dissolved in 440 μl of 95% H2O/5% D2O, and the pH was adjusted to 4.6 by microliter additions of 1 M NaOH; 50 μl of CD3CN (final concentration, 1.9 M) was added to improve solubility. All spectra were acquired at 25°C on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer. Two-dimensional phase sensitive correlation spectroscopy (24Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1975; 64: 2229-2246Google Scholar), NOE spectroscopy (25Bodenhausen G. Kogler H. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 370-388Google Scholar, 26Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys.

Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) spectra were acquired with low power coherent irradiation of the water resonance for 1.5 s prior to the pulse sequence and during the NOE spectroscopy mixing time. Total correlation spectroscopy mixing was achieved with a clean DIPSI-2rc sequence applied for 90 ms (31Cavanagh J. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 670-678Google Scholar), and mixing times of 300 ms were used in both NOE spectroscopy experiments. The spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA), and assigned using established techniques (32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). 3JHN-Hα were obtained by line fitting ω2 slices from the correlation spectroscopy spectrum processed with very high digital resolution. A second set of NMR spectra were acquired after the addition of 10 μl of 2 M DTT to allow the uncyclized (reduced) peptide to be studied. A rotating frame Overhauser spectroscopy spectrum (33Bothner-By A.A. Stephens R.L. Lee J.-M. Warren C.D. Jeanloz R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 811-813Google Scholar) of the uncyclized peptide failed to identify any additional dipolar coupling interaction. Fluorescence of bisANS was measured using an excitation wavelength of 397 nm and an emission wavelength of 500 nm. Anisotropy measurements on APA08 and APA09 peptides, each of which had Lys4 labeled with fluorescein, were performed with an excitation wavelength of 492 nm and emission wavelength at 519 nm. Fluorescence studies were carried out on a SLM model 500C fluorometer with an excitation slit width of 2.5 nm and emission slit width of 10 nm. Binding experiments were carried out on both APA08 and APA09 peptides in the oxidized and reduced states as follows. To a cuvette containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, a given peptide was added to a concentration of 1 μM, and the anisotropy values were recorded at 20°C. To this solution, cpn60 that had been dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, was added to the cuvette to a final concentration of 10 μM, and the anisotropy value was measured. A dissociation constant was estimated for oxidized APA09, which was the only fluorescently labeled peptide that displayed detectable binding to cpn60. The approach used was to titrate a 1 μM solution of the oxidized APA09 peptide with increasing amounts of cpn60. Titrations using increasing peptide concentrations were not possible because of strong self-association, as expected with amphipathic structures and demonstrated with these peptides (see “Results”). The dissociation constant was estimated as follows: Cpn60−APA09↔Cpn60+APA09; Kd=[C][F]CF(Eq. 1) where [CF], [C], and [F] are the concentrations of binary complexes cpn60-APA09, cpn60, and APA09, respectively. If only the fluorophore-protein complexes ([CF]) result in significant anisotropy (r), then at a fixed total concentration of fluorophore ([FT]) and increasing concentrations of protein ([CT]), the anisotropy of bound (rbound) can be determined from a plot of [1/r] versus [1/[CT]], in which the y intercept is [1/rbound]. robs=fBrB+fFrF(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, robs is the measured anisotropy at a given protein concentration, fB and fF are the fractions of fluorophore bound and free, respectively, and rB and rF are the anisotropy values when the fluorophore is all bound or all free, respectively. Because rfree is small, Equation 2 can be simplified to: robs =fBrB(Eq. 3) fB=robsrmax(Eq. 4) Thus, at any given protein concentration, assuming one binding site per monomer, the fraction of fluorophore bound can be determined using Equation 4. CF=fBFT(Eq. 5) [F]=FT−CF(Eq. 6) [C]=CT−CF(Eq. 7) CF=[C][F]1Kd(Eq. 8) Plotting Equation 8 as [CF] versus [C][F], the slope of the fitted line is [1/Kd]. To follow hydrophobic exposure on cpn60, 10 μM bisANS was added to a cuvette containing 1 μM cpn60, and the emission spectrum was recorded. Subsequently, 1 μM oxidized APA14 was added to the cuvette, and the bisANS emission was recorded. BisANS fluorescence was insignificant in the presence of 1 μM oxidized APA14 alone (data not shown). The increase in bisANS fluorescence in the presence of cpn60 was attributed to hydrophobic exposure induced on the chaperonin by the oxidized APA14 peptide. To follow loss of hydrophobic sites following reduction of the peptide, 2 mM DTT was added to the samples above. Emission spectra were collected from 0 to 40 min. The CD spectra of the oxidized peptides, APA09c (Figs. 1A), APA14c (Fig. 1B), and APA08c (Fig. 1C), indicate a high degree of helical secondary structure, whereas the spectra of reduced peptides, APA09r (Fig. 1A) and APA14r (Fig. 1B), indicate there is little or no regular helical structure. The secondary structure calculated for each peptide in either the oxidized or reduced form is shown in Table I. The fluorescein-labeled peptides APA08 and APA09 were not soluble at concentrations required for NMR. However, analysis of oxidized APA14c by 1H NMR spectroscopy identified intense HN-HN sequential NOEs and medium range NOEs characteristic of a helix between residues 9 and 16 (Fig. 2); the presence of a helical conformation is confirmed by the small values of 3JHN-Hα for these residues. The data for residues 17-19 are not indicative of a well formed helix, suggesting that they form a frayed terminus to the helix or adopt a turn conformation. These findings are in line with the structure modeled for APA14 and are consistent with the three-dimensional structures determined for other apamin peptides (35Pease J.H.B. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8491-8498Google Scholar).1 Many of the chemical shifts of oxidized APA14c are found to be very different from random coil values, suggesting that the peptide does adopt a well defined structure. The addition of dithiothreitol to the peptide resulted in a loss of the characteristic helical NOEs, an increase in the 3JHN-Hα scalar coupling constants (Fig. 2, lower panel), and movement of the resonances to approximately random coil positions. Helical interactions were also absent from rotating frame Overhauser spectroscopy spectra, indicating that the loss of NOE intensity was not the result of a change in rotational correlation time. Thus, the disulfide bonds are required to maintain APA14 in a helical conformation. The predicted structure of these peptides is shown in Fig. 3, and the surface hydrophobicity of each peptide is also presented.Table I.Secondary structure of apamin peptidesPeptideFractionsaFar ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra from Fig. 1 were deconvoluted as previously described (23).α-Helixβ-SheetRemainderAPA08c0.55 ± 0.0120.45 ± 0.0120.0 ± 0.0APA09r0.19 ± 0.0190.81 ± 0.0190.0 ± 0.0APA09c0.71 ± 0.0130.29 ± 0.0130.0 ± 0.0APA14r0.0 ± 0.00.46 ± 0.0080.54 ± 0.008APA14c0.57 ± 0.0140.27 ± 0.0270.16 ± 0.039a Far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra from Fig. 1 were deconvoluted as previously described (23Provencher S.W.

Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25963-25965Google Scholar). The backbone of the peptide is shown in gray, with the side chains substituted from rhodanese in cyan. Cysteines are indicated in orange. Side chain conformations are taken from the crystal structure of rhodanese (39Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol.

These surfaces are colored according to an effective “hydrophobic potential” derived from the desolvation parameters of Eisenberg et al. (34Eisenberg D. Wesson M. Yamashita M. Chem. Scr. 1989; 29A: 217-221Google Scholar), in which exposed hydrophilic regions are indicated in red, and exposed hydrophobic regions are indicated in blue.4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Oxidized APA09c and APA14c are amphipathic helical peptides with exposed hydrophobic faces. Thus, the question of solubility and formation of aggregates was addressed. BisANS fluorescence was used to detect aggregation of oxidized APA14c (Fig. 4) and reduced APA14r (data not shown). A cuvette containing 10 μM bisANS was titrated with increasing amounts of either oxidized APA14c or reduced APA14r. There was relatively little increase in bisANS fluorescence in the range of peptide concentrations from 0 to 2.0 μM, but there was a substantial increase that occurred above 2 μM APA14. As shown in Fig. 4B, the fluorescence response is reminiscent of similar titrations that are used to define the critical micelle concentrations of amphiphilic detergents (36Horowitz P.M. J. Colloid and Interface Sci. 1977; 61: 197-198Google Scholar). Thus, significant self-association of the peptide occurs when its concentration is higher than 2-3 μM. To avoid artifacts and interpretive complications from aggregation, all experiments with APA08, APA09 (the fluorescein-labeled form of APA14), and APA14 were done at a concentration of 1 μM. Fluorescence anisotropy binding studies were done using the fluorescein-labeled APA09 peptides (same sequence as APA14). Initial experiments were done to determine any differences in the binding affinity of oxidized APA09c and reduced APA09r. The anisotropy of 1 μM APA09c free in solution had a value of 0.061 ± 0.004. The anisotropy of 1 μM APA09c in the presence of 10 μM cpn60 was 0.084 ± 0.003. On the other hand, there was virtually no change in the anisotropy of free APA09r (0.055 ± 0.008) as compared with APA09r in the presence of cpn60 (0.050 ± 0.006). The dissociation constant for oxidized APA09c was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cpn60 was titrated into a solution of 1 μM oxidized APA09c over a concentration range of 1-65 μM cpn60. The inverse of the change in anisotropy was plotted as a function of the inverse of the cpn60 monomer concentration, and the data were fit with a straight line (Fig. 5B). The anisotropy of bound peptide was determined from the y-intercept of the straight line as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of cpn60/APA09c complex formed was then plotted against the concentration of free cpn60 multiplied by the concentration of free APA09c (Fig. 5). The data were fit to a straight line, and by taking the inverse of the slope, a Kd was estimated to be approximately 106 (± 6) μM. Independent of the assumptions used for the analysis of these data, it is clear that the oxidized peptide shows considerable binding, whereas the reduced version of the same peptide shows no detectable interaction. The oxidized APA08c peptide was subjected to the same fluorescence anisotropy experimental conditions, and no change in anisotropy was detected. Thus, the oxidized APA08c hydrophilic peptide did not bind to cpn60 as observed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Changes in bisANS fluorescence were used to assess changes in hydrophobic exposure in solutions containing cpn60 together with APA14c. When 10 μM bisANS was mixed with 1 μM cpn60, the maximum fluorescence intensity was observed at 502 nm. When 1 μM oxidized APA14c was added, the maximum fluorescence intensity increased by a factor of 1.7 with no change in the wavelength maximum. Fig. 6 shows the time course of the bisANS fluorescence intensity after the addition of 2 mM DTT to the APA14c-cpn60 mixture. The decrease in bisANS fluorescence that followed the reduction of the peptide could be modeled by a single exponential with a decay rate constant = 0.065/min (Fig. 6). A control sample showed that the fluorescence intensity of 10 μM bisANS did not change upon the addition of 2 mM DTT. These results indicate that the complex of cpn60 with APA14c displays considerably more hydrophobic exposure than the sum of the individual components, and the result requires the presence of the oxidized and not the reduced peptide. Cpn60 can bind a wide variety of proteins in non-native states, implying that the specific primary sequence does not supply the information required for recognition (9Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F.X. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Google Scholar, 11Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Google Scholar, 14Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Google Scholar, 37Liminet A.A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopopoulos C. Pluckthun A. EMBO J. 1990; 99: 2315-2319Google Scholar). Because cpn60 does not bind proteins in their native folded state, the recognition does not require formation of native tertiary structure (14Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Google Scholar). The binding of various proteins must occur by a more general mechanism of molecular recognition. One common feature of partially folded proteins is the solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues that would be buried in the native state. As proteins fold, local regions can form secondary structures such as α helices that can align residues to produce hydrophobic surfaces. These surfaces could provide the necessary binding motif for recognition by the cpn60 hydrophobic binding sites. The oxidized peptides APA09c, APA14c, and APA08c used in this study address the issue of secondary structural requirements for binding to cpn60 and suggest a possible mechanism of cpn60 binding to unfolded proteins via induced hydrophobic exposure on cpn60 as a result of an initial amphipathic peptide binding. The small size of APA09 compared with that of the cpn60 tetradecamer (798 kDa) allowed the binding of the peptide to cpn60 to be followed by fluorescence anisotropy. Oxidized APA09c was determined to bind weakly to cpn60 with a Kd = ∼106 μM, assuming one binding site on cpn60. No binding of reduced APA09r was detected under the same experimental conditions. This result shows the effect of organizing the hydrophobic surface onto a helical motif. Although the binding interactions of these small peptides are weak, they should be viewed as a part of the many weak interactions that would occur with a partially folded protein containing numerous elements of local secondary structure. This implied multiple binding of a protein to the oligomeric cpn60 is supported by the previous observation that cpn60 quaternary structure is stabilized by interactions with partially folded proteins (38Mendoza J.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25963-25965Google Scholar). That the hydrophilic peptide, APA08, shows no binding to cpn60 supports the suggestion that hydrophobic interactions are important in forming the cpn60-protein complex. These results are complementary to the data from Fenton et al. (13Fenton W.A. Yechezkel K. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Google Scholar), where polypeptide binding studies were performed on various mutants of cpn60 to demonstrate the requirement for hydrophobic residues on cpn60 to bind partially folded proteins. The present studies suggest that initial binding of amphipathic elements to cpn60 can induce the formation of increased hydrophobic exposure. When the interactions with the peptides are eliminated by reduction, the induced hydrophobic surfaces are lost. This may be related to the effects seen with proteins whose exposed, interactive surfaces are buried as they fold with two consequences: (a) they are bound less tightly to cpn60, and (b) the interactive surfaces on cpn60 are hidden and protected against nonproductive interactions. The 2.8 Å crystal structure of cpn60 (12Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Google Scholar) as well as mutational analysis (13Fenton W.A. Yechezkel K. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Google Scholar) have suggested that the polypeptide binding site on cpn60 resides in hydrophobic sequence within the apical domain of each monomer. The crystal structure in this region has poor resolution, presumably due to flexibility or malleability in this area of the apical domain (12Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that interactions with amphipathic structural elements could modify the exposure in this part of the structure and interactions with nucleotides or the co-chaperonins could modulate the interactions. Thus, organized amphipathic structures on unfolded proteins may not only be a part of the general recognition motif for cpn60 binding, but they may also serve as a means of amplifying the hydrophobic surface exposed by cpn60. Finally, the observed strong net binding to cpn60 of partially folded proteins may result from multiple weak interactions stemming from the symmetrical association of many subunits. This would allow some flexibility of the bound protein by dissociation at some of the sites without permitting its release from the complex."

In E. coli, formylation provides a positive determinant for allowing the initiation factor IF2 to select the initiator tRNA from other tRNAs (10Majumdar A. Bose K.K. Gupta N.K. Wahba A.J. J. Biol.

Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4507-4514Google Scholar). The formylation reaction is highly specific; the enzyme formylates the initiator Met-tRNA but not the elongator Met-tRNA or any other aminoacyl-tRNA (15Dickerman H.W. Steers Jr., E. Redfield B.G. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1522-1525Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that most of the determinants on the initiator tRNA important for its formylation by MTF are clustered in the acceptor stem (16Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18012-18017Google Scholar, 17Guillon J.-M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Google Scholar, 18Lee C.-P. Dyson M.R.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Google Scholar), little is known about the amino acid residues in MTF that are important for this recognition and the molecular basis of the specificity in recognition. methionyl-tRNA methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase formylmethionine tRNA methionine tRNA phenylalanine tRNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy. As a first step in identifying regions of MTF that come close to the acceptor stem of the tRNA, we have cross-linked periodate-oxidized tRNA to MTF and have analyzed the site(s) of cross-linking. We show that Lys207 in the sequence KLSKE (207-211) of MTF is the site of cross-link to the 3′ terminus of the tRNA. 3D. Mangroo and U. L. RajBhandary, unpublished observations. The cross-linking of periodate-oxidized E. coli tRNAfMet to MTF has been studied before by Blanquet and co-workers (21Hountondji C. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 403-407Google Scholar). However, the sites of cross-linking were not analyzed in the previous work. Sodium metaperiodate, folinic acid, carboxypeptidase Y (sequencing grade), and methionine were obtained from Sigma. Sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were purchased from Aldrich. E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase were purified in our laboratory by Mike Dyson. Nuclease P1, modified trypsin (sequencing grade), and chymotrypsin (sequencing grade) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. RNase T1 was from Sankyo Chemical Company Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). [35S]Methionine (specific activity = 1175 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]ATP (specific activity = 3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. All of the solvents used for HPLC were HPLC grade and procured from EM Science. All other routinely used chemicals were of the highest purity grade available. The reaction was carried out at 37°C. The incubation mixture (20 μl) contained 20 mM imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM ATP, 150 mM NH4Cl, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mM MgCl2, 25 μM [35S]methionine (specific activity = 5,000-10,000 cpm/pmol), tRNA (approximately 0.1 A260 of total tRNA or 0.01 A260 of pure tRNAfMet) and saturating amounts of purified methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Aliquots (5 μl) were withdrawn at 5-min intervals and spotted onto 3 MM Whatman paper discs (presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid and dried), and the discs were washed for 20 min at 0°C, followed by a wash with 5% trichloroacetic acid (10 min) and finally one wash with ethanol for 10 min (22RajBhandary U.L. Ghosh H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1104-1113Google Scholar). Discs were dried in a ventilation oven, and the radioactivity on each filter was determined by scintillation counting. The incubation (20 μl), carried out at 37°C, contained 10 μl of the above aminoacylation reaction mixture (which had been preincubated for 30 min), 0.3 mM N10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and appropriate amounts of MTF (depending on the purity and specific activity of preparation). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min and was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 0.36 M CuSO4 in 1.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and incubated further for 3 min at room temperature (20Guillon J.M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Google Scholar). Acid-precipitable radioactivity was measured as described for the aminoacylation assay. Purification of MTF was carried out using a procedure developed by Dr. D. Mangroo. 2The amino acid numbering is based on the gene sequence, the initiating methionine being the first amino acid. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 2.69 × 105 pmol of formyl group incorporated into Met-tRNAfMet/min/μg of protein. The purified enzyme migrated as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were estimated by the modified Lowry DC method as described by the supplier (Bio-Rad) using IgG as a standard. The concentration of purified MTF was also determined using an absorbance of 1.39 at 280 nm for a solution containing 1 mg/ml of MTF and with a light path of 1 cm (23Blanquet S. Dessen P. Kahn D. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 106: 141-152Google Scholar). This value agreed well with the value obtained from the Bio-Rad protein assay. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) after boiling the protein samples for 5 min in 62.5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, containing 4% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 10%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. Total tRNA was isolated by phenol extraction from E. coli cells (17 g, wet weight) overproducing tRNA2fMet from the plasmid pUC13 trnfM (which carries the tRNA2fMet gene). The crude tRNA (100 A260 units) was fractionated on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel, and tRNAs were visualized by UV shadowing (25Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-338Google Scholar). The gel slice containing tRNAfMet was cut, and tRNAfMet was eluted from the gel in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA (TE buffer). The purity of gel-eluted tRNAfMet, estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by aminoacylation assay, was >95% (22RajBhandary U.L. Ghosh H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1104-1113Google Scholar). 32P-3′-End labeling of tRNAfMet was carried out using tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. First, the 3′-terminal A76 was removed by Whitfeld degradation by treatment of the tRNA with sodium periodate and subsequently with aniline (26Whitfeld P.R. Biochem. J. 1954; 58: 390-396Google Scholar). The 3′-terminal phosphate thus generated was removed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. The reaction mixture for 3′ labeling contained 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.2), 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 mM glutathione-SH, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μM [α-32P]ATP, 6 μM tRNAfMet (−A76) and 2 units of E. coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. Incubation was at 37°C for 20 min. One unit of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 μmol of AMP/h (27Cudny H. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6450-6453Google Scholar). Unreacted ATP was removed by spin column chromatography through a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 column. The 32P-3′-end-labeled tRNAfMet was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer (pH 8.0). The labeled tRNAfMet was subsequently purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8 M urea-PAGE), eluted from gel, and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dried and dissolved in distilled water and stored at −20°C. The reaction mixture (40 μl) contained 1.0 A260 unit of 3′-end labeled [32P]tRNAfMet (30,000 cpm), 2.5 mM sodium periodate, and 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 0°C in the dark. Excess periodate was destroyed by the addition of ethylene glycol to 5 mM (final concentration). The oxidized tRNAfMet was ethanol-precipitated, the pellet was dissolved in water, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was added to it, and the oxidized tRNAfMet was reprecipitated with ethanol. The pellet was collected by centrifugation, excess ethanol was removed, and the pellet was dried and dissolved in 50 μl of distilled water and used immediately for the cross-linking reaction. The extent of oxidation of tRNAfMet was checked by determining the residual methionine acceptance activity (22RajBhandary U.L. Ghosh H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1104-1113Google Scholar) of oxidized tRNA and was found to be essentially complete (>96%). For most experiments, the periodate-oxidized tRNAfMet (10 pmol) was incubated in a total volume of 10 μl with MTF (0.066 μg, 2 pmol) in 20 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA at 37°C for 1 h in the presence of 1 mM sodium cyanoborohydride (21Hountondji C. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 403-407Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by the addition of sodium borohydride (1 mM final concentration), and the extent of cross-linking was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis. The effect of the addition of either excess substrate (tRNAfMet) or cofactor (N10-formyltetrahydrofolate) to the reaction mixture on the cross-linking efficiency was determined by adding appropriate amounts of these ligands to the reaction mixture followed by incubation for 10 min at 37°C prior to the addition of periodate-oxidized tRNAfMet. The effect of cross-linking of periodate-oxidized tRNAfMet to MTF on the enzymatic activity of MTF was evaluated by withdrawing (5 μl) aliquots of a large scale reaction mixture (60 pmol of MTF and 300 pmol of either 32P-labeled unoxidized initiator tRNA or oxidized initiator tRNA) at various times (every 5 min for 30 min) and estimating the residual enzyme activity after diluting the reaction mixture 500-fold with 20 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For isolation and analysis of cross-linked MTF, a large scale reaction was carried out using 20 μg of MTF (600 pmol) and 1800 pmol of periodate-oxidized tRNAfMet (3-fold molar excess), and the reaction time was increased to 2 h. MTF (90 pmol) in 40 μl of 20 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA was incubated with 450 pmol of oxidized tRNAs in the presence of 1 mM sodium cyanoborohydride at 37°C. Aliquots (4 μl) were removed at the indicated time intervals, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 μl of sodium borohydride (final concentration of 1 mM). The extent of cross-linking in each case was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and by PhosphorImager analysis. MTF cross-linked to tRNA was separated from uncross-linked MTF by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Following the cross-linking reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 M LiCl and loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (1 ml) preequilibrated with the same buffer. After extensive washing of the column to remove MTF, the cross-linked MTF was eluted with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 M LiCl. Fractions (0.3 ml) were collected. The fractions showing high radioactivity were pooled and subjected to Centricon-10 ultrafiltration for desalting. After centrifugation, excess tRNA and tRNA cross-linked to MTF was hydrolyzed to nucleotides (28RajBhandary U.L. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 2815-2821Google Scholar) by incubating the cross-linked MTF with 0.3 unit of P1 nuclease and 5 units of RNase T1 at 45°C for 4 h. The extent of hydrolysis of tRNA from cross-linked MTF was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To remove free nucleotides from cross-linked MTF, the reaction mixture with nuclease P1 and RNase T1 was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (0.8 × 14 cm). Fractions containing MTF (void volume) were concentrated and used for proteolytic digestion. Alternatively, centrifugation through the Centricon-10 membrane was used to remove the released nucleotides from cross-linked MTF. The cross-linked MTF (20 μg and ∼10,000 cpm of Cerenkov radiation) in 100 μl of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was treated with 2 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (10%, w/w) at 37°C for 12 h. The tryptic peptides were separated by HPLC on a Hewlett-Packard HP-1090 HPLC system equipped with a reverse phase Vydac C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm). The trypsin digest was diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 250 μl, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and injected into the column preequilibrated with 90% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 10% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% acetonitrile). The elution rate was 0.5 ml/min in 90% solvent A and 10% solvent B from 0 to 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 10% solvent B to 20% solvent B between 10 and 60 min (0.2% per min) and then 20-27% B between 60 and 160 min (0.07% per min) and then 27-100% solvent B in an additional 40 min (1.82% per min). The effluent was continuously monitored at 210 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. The radioactivity in each fraction was determined by Cerenkov counting for 32P in an LKB-1217 RACKBETA liquid scintillation counter. Fractions containing peak II* (obtained from the HPLC of trypsin digestion of cross-linked MTF above) were lyophilized and dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. This mixture was then treated with 2 μg of chymotrypsin for 5 h at 37°C and subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column. The column was preequilibrated with 100% solvent A. The elution rate was 0.5 ml/min in 100% solvent A from 0 to 10 min followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 25% Solvent B between 10 and 135 min (0.2% per min) and then 25-100% Solvent B for an additional 35 min. The effluent was continuously monitored at 210 nm, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. The radioactivity in each fraction was determined by Cerenkov counting for 32P as above. The mass of the cross-linked peptides was determined on a MALDI mass spectrophotometer (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager mass spectrophotometer) using delayed extraction technology. For the mass analysis of the peptides, approximately 1 pmol of peptide (based on radioactivity) was mixed with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (matrix). For calibration of the mass spectrophotometer, oxidized insulin chain B (Sigma) was used as a standard. C-terminal amino acid sequencing was also carried out using limited digestion of peptide with carboxypeptidase Y followed by mass spectroscopic analysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of isolated peptides was determined using an automated gas phase protein/peptide sequence analyzer from Applied Biosystems (model 470A) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (model 120) and computer (model 900A). Periodate-oxidized nucleotides and tRNAs have often been used as affinity reagents for cross-linking to proteins (29Bazaes S. Eyzaguire J. Chemical Modification of Enzymes: Active Site Studies. Ellis Horwood Ltd. Publishers, Chichester, United Kingdom1987: 35-44Google Scholar). Oxidation of tRNA with sodium periodate converts the terminal ribose moiety in the A76 of the tRNA to a 2′,3′-dialdehyde. The dialdehyde then reacts primarily with the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues in a protein that comes close to the 3′-end of tRNA. For following the cross-linking of MTF to the tRNA, 32P-3′-end-labeled tRNA2fMet was incubated with MTF in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride, which reduces the intermediate Schiff's base and prevents reversal of the reaction (21Hountondji C. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 403-407Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched after 1 h by the addition of sodium borohydride, and the products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography of the gel. Fig. 2, lane 2, shows that in an incubation mixture containing periodate-oxidized tRNA, most of the 32P radioactivity migrated more slowly than tRNA at a position expected for that of a tRNA cross-linked to a protein. Formation of the tRNA-protein cross-link requires oxidation of the tRNA with periodate. When 32P-3′-end-labeled tRNA2fMet without periodate oxidation was incubated with MTF under identical conditions, there was no cross-link between the tRNA and the protein (Fig. 2, lane 1). The presence of sodium cyanoborohydride during the incubation was found to be important for maximal cross-linking (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows the effect of increasing the concentration of the oxidized tRNA on the extent of cross-linking. It can be seen that with 2 pmol of MTF (0.2 μM), the extent of cross-linking is dependent on the concentration of the tRNA and reaches a plateau at approximately 10-20 pmol of the tRNA (1-2 μM). This result indicates that the cross-linking of periodate-oxidized tRNA2fMet to MTF is saturable and that it is quite specific. Further evidence for the specificity of cross-linking was derived from an experiment in which increasing amounts of unoxidized tRNA2fMet was added to the cross-linking reaction containing a fixed amount of periodate-oxidized tRNA. It was found that there was a gradual decrease in the extent of cross-linking dependent upon the concentration of unoxidized tRNA2fMet in the reaction (data not shown). This result suggests that unoxidized tRNA and oxidized tRNA are competing for the same site in MTF. In contrast, the addition of N10-formyltetrahydrofolate, another substrate of MTF, had no significant effect on the extent of cross-linking (data not shown). The cross-linking of MTF to periodate-oxidized tRNA2fMet leads to loss of enzymatic activity of MTF. Incubation of MTF with periodate-oxidized tRNA2fMet leads to a time-dependent inactivation of MTF (data not shown). This inactivation requires the presence of periodate-oxidized tRNA2fMet. The presence of a 10-fold excess of unoxidized tRNA2fMet over the oxidized tRNA, which competes against cross-linking of MTF to the oxidized tRNA, also protects MTF from inactivation (data not shown). A similar effect of cross-linking of oxidized tRNAfMet on enzymatic activity of MTF was described before by Hountondji et al. (21Hountondji C. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 403-407Google Scholar). The following strategy was used to isolate and analyze the peptide(s) attached to the tRNA. Following the cross-linking reaction, cross-linked MTF was separated from uncross-linked MTF by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (see “Materials and Methods”). The excess of 32P-3′-end-labeled tRNA2fMet and most of the tRNA moiety in the cross-linked MTF were hydrolyzed to nucleotides using a mixture of nuclease P1 and RNase T1. A mixture of the two nucleases was used to ensure complete hydrolysis of the tRNA (28RajBhandary U.L. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 2815-2821Google Scholar). This treatment should yield MTF carrying only a 32P-labeled fragment of AMP attached to it. The cross-linked MTF carrying the 32P label was separated from the mononucleotides and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A similar tryptic digest of MTF that had not been cross-linked to tRNA was also subjected to HPLC. Fig. 4 shows the tryptic peptide and 32P radioactivity profiles of MTF and MTF cross-linked to [32P]AMP moiety of the tRNA. A peptide peak (designated peptide I) eluting at 66 min in digests of MTF (Fig. 4A), is absent in digests of cross-linked MTF (Fig. 4B) and is replaced in the latter by a peak (designated peptide I*) eluting at 104 min. This peptide I*, which is absent in digests of uncross-linked MTF, also contains 32P radioactivity (Fig. 4C), suggesting that it is derived from the peptide eluting at 66 min in digests of uncross-linked MTF. Another peak designated peptide II* also contains 32P radioactivity. This peak contains a mixture of two peptides, one of which is radioactive. We show below that the radioactive peptide II* is a partial digestion product and is the same as peptide I* but with an extension of four amino acids at the C terminus. A combination of MALDI mass spectroscopy (30Burlingame A.L. Boyd R.K. Gaskell S.J. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 634R-683Google Scholar), N-terminal sequencing using Edman degradation (31Matsudaira P. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 1-30Google Scholar), and C-terminal sequencing using partial digestion with carboxypeptidase Y (32Jones B.N. Shively J.E. Methods of Protein Microcharacterization. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1986: 337-361Google Scholar) followed by MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis was used to establish the sequence of these peptides. The following lines of evidence summarized in Table I show that peptide I* has the sequence 186QLADGTAKPEVQDETLVTYAEKLSK210, in which Lys207 is linked to the [32P]AMP moiety of the tRNA.Table I.Mass spectroscopic and amino acid sequence analysis of peptide I*PeptideMass calculated (M + 1)Mass obtainedAmino acid sequence determinedPeptide sequence deducedC-terminalN-terminalDaDaMissing peak I2406.212406.95NDaND, not determined.ND186QLADGTAKPEVQDETLVTYAEK207Peak I*3066.43bMolecular mass based on Schiff's base (Fig. 6, structure I).3052.23-LSKQLADGTAKPE186QLADGTAKPEVQDETLVTYAEKcLysine linked to AMP moiety.LSK2103064.43dMolecular mass based on hydroxymorpholine derivative (Fig. 6, structure II).3050.663048.43eMolecular mass based on morpholine derivative (Fig. 6, structure III).3049.19a ND, not determined.b Molecular mass based on Schiff's base (Fig. 6, structure I).c Lysine linked to AMP moiety.d Molecular mass based on hydroxymorpholine derivative (Fig. 6, structure II).e Molecular mass based on morpholine derivative (Fig. 6, structure III). Open table in a new tab (i)MALDI mass spectroscopy of peptide I yielded two peaks with molecular masses of 2406.95 and 2390.59 Da. The only tryptic peptide of MTF that fits this is Gln186-Lys207. The difference of 16.36 Da in the two molecular masses is most probably due to the well known conversion of glutamine at the N terminus of peptides or proteins to pyroglutamic acid (33Blomback B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 398-411Google Scholar). The complete absence of a peak corresponding to peptide I in digests of cross-linked MTF (Fig. 4B) suggests that one of the two lysine residues in the peptide is linked to the AMP moiety of the tRNA. The most likely possibility is that Lys207 is cross-linked to the AMP moiety, thereby making the peptide bond involving this lysine residue resistant to cleavage by trypsin in the cross-linked MTF.(ii)N-terminal sequencing of peptide I* yielded the sequence QLADGTAKPE, which is the same as that of peptide I. This result confirms the suggestion above that peptide I* is derived from peptide I. Furthermore, the clear identification of lysine as amino acid number 8 of peptide I* shows that lysine 193 is not cross-linked in MTF and supports the conclusion above that Lys207 is the one most probably cross-linked. While the N-terminal sequence data were unambiguous, the yields of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives in the first and successive cycles were much lower than expected (∼35%), based on the 32P radioactivity present in peptide I*. This is due to the fact that most of the glutamine at the N terminus is converted to pyroglutamic acid, which is inert to the reagents used for N-terminal sequencing.(iii)Partial digestion with carboxypeptidase Y of peptide I* in situ on the sample plate used for MALDI mass spectroscopy, followed by mass spectroscopic analysis of the partial digestion products, indicated the loss successively of the amino acids lysine, serine, and leucine from the C terminus. Thus, the sequence at the C terminus of peptide I* is -LSK. These are the amino acids that immediately follow Lys207 in the sequence of MTF. This result supports the conclusion above that peptide I* is derived from peptide I and shows that it has an extension of LSK at the C terminus beyond Lys207.(iv)Final evidence for the sequence of peptide I* was d"

Isolation of the two chains of the interferon γ receptor (IFN-γR) has permitted an analysis of the contributions of each to the signal transduction mechanism.

The Janus kinases (or Jaks) are a family of receptor-associated soluble tyrosine kinases with four known members, Tyk2, Jak1, Jak2 and Jak3.

The erythropoietin (Epo) receptor, EpoR, is a member of the class I cytokine receptor subfamily. A single chain encodes both ligand-binding and signal-transducing functions. Epo induces homodimerization of the receptor to initiate signal transduction (for reviews, see Refs. 18Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O.

Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 163-173Google Scholar). Jak2 is associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR and is activated upon ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor (36Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Google Scholar). Strikingly an Arg → Cys mutation in the extracellular domain of EpoR results in ligand independent dimerization/oligomerization and constitutive, ligand-independent activation of Jak2 and mitogenesis (37Watowich S.S.

In this study we used chimeric EpoR, IFN-γR1, and IFN-γR2 constructs to investigate the differences between the architecture of Epo and IFN-γ receptor complexes and shed light on the requirement for one or two receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and the necessity for one or two distinct transmembrane chains for effective signal transduction. Recombinant human erythropoietin was a gift from Dr. Lawrence Blatt of Amgen. Restriction endonucleases were from Boehringer Mannheim and New England Biolabs; T4 DNA ligase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; [α-32P]dCTP was from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. CHO-B7 cells represent the Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) containing a transfected human HLA-B7 gene (12Jung V. Jones C. Kumar C.S. Stefanos S. O'Connell S. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1827-1830Google Scholar). The 16-9 hamster × human somatic hybrid cell line is a CHO-K1 derivative containing a translocation of the long arm of human chromosome 6 and the human HLA-B7 gene (13Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8737-8741Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Transfections were carried out with the DOTAP transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol and the transfected cells were maintained in F-12 medium containing 450 μg/ml Geneticin (antibiotic G418). Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed with cloned cells expressing the various receptor subunits. The EpoR expression plasmid was made by cloning the EcoRI-AflIII fragment of the human EpoR cDNA p18R (39Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Google Scholar) into the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The construction of plasmids expressing Hu-IFN-γR1 and Hu-IFN-γR2 chains from cDNA under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter has been previously described (5Kumar C.S. Muthukumaran G. Frost L.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17174-17182Google Scholar). For ease of construction of the various chimeric receptors, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to incorporate a unique NheI site at the 3′ end of the extracellular domain (EC) and at the 5′ end of the transmembrane-intracellular domains (IC) of the receptors. The primers were designed to code for the three amino acids Trp, Leu, and Ala, which are commonly found in the transmembrane domain of several proteins, encompassing the NheI site. The extracellular portions of EpoR, Hu-IFN-γR1, and Hu-IFN-γR2, containing an NheI site (designated EpoREC/NheI, γR1EC/NheI, and γR2EC/NheI) were generated by PCR from the respective cDNAs as templates with the use of the T7 primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′) and the internal primers 5′-GCCGCTAGCCAGGGGTCCAGGTCGCTAGGCG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 1874-1893 of p18R EpoR cDNA; Ref. 39Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Google Scholar), 5′-GTGGCTAGCCAAGAACCTTTTATACTGCT-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 779-785 of the Hu-IFN-γR1 cDNA; Ref. 4Aguet M. Dembic Z.

Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S. Schwartz B. Miki T. Pestka S. Cell. 1994; 76: 793-802Google Scholar). The intracellular portions of the various receptors with the unique NheI site at the 5′ end of the transmembrane domain (designated EpoRIC/NheI, γR1IC/NheI, and γR2IC/NheI were generated by PCR on corresponding cDNA templates with the use of the SP6 primer (5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATA-3′) and the internal primers 5′-GTGGCTAGCGACGCTCTCCCTCATCCTCG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 1902-1921 of plasmid p18R), 5′-GTGGCTAGCGATTCCAGTTGTTGCTGCTTTAC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 792-814 of the Hu-IFN-γR1 cDNA), and 5′-GTGGCTAGCGATCTCCGTGGGAACATTT-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 1398-1416 of the Hu-IFN-γR2 cDNA). The NheI site in each primer is underlined. The PCR products encoding the extracellular domains were incubated with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs to generate blunt ends; then the PCR fragments, which contained the vector multiple cloning sites, were subsequently digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI (EpoREC/NheI and γR2EC/NheI) or BamHI (γR1EC/NheI), and cloned into the EcoRV and EcoRI/BamHI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to yield the plasmids pEpoREC, pγR1EC and pγR2EC. Analogously, the PCR products encoding the intracellular domains of the various receptors were treated with T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends, digested with XbaI restriction endonuclease, and cloned into the EcoRV and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 to yield the plasmids pEpoRIC, pγR1IC, and pγR2IC. To introduce the Stat1α binding site of Hu-IFN-γR1 into the cytoplasmic domain of EpoR, two-step asymmetric PCR (detailed in Ref. 41Muthukumaran G. Donnelly R.J. Ebensperger C. Mariano T.M. Poast J. Baron S. Dembic Z. Pestka S. J. Interferon and Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 1039-1045Google Scholar) was carried out sequentially on Hu-IFN-γR1 cDNA and pEpoRIC cDNA templates with vector primers and the internal primer CTTGTCCTTCTGTTTTTATTTCagagcaagccacatagetggg. The uppercase letters denote sequences corresponding to the Hu-IFN-γR1 cDNA, and the lowercase letters represent sequences corresponding to the EpoR cDNA. The Hu-IFN-γR2 chain with the Stat1α binding site of Hu-IFN-γR1 was constructed by restriction enzyme digestion of pγR2IC and IFN-γR1 cDNA with BspEI and AvaI, respectively, followed by ligation. For construction of the chimeric receptors, plasmids encoding the suitable extracellular or intracellular domains were digested with NheI and XbaI restriction endonucleases and ligated together. All constructs were sequenced for verification of the entire nucleotide sequence of the receptor. Sequencing was done in an Applied Biosystems model 373 automated DNA sequencer with dideoxy dye-terminator chemistry. EMSAs were performed with the 22-base pair sequence containing a Stat1α binding site (5′-GATCGATTTCCCCGAAATCATG-3′) corresponding to the GAS element in the promoter region of the human IRF-1 gene (42Yuan J. Wegenka U.A. Lütticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T. Schindler C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1657-1668Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides, 5′-GATCGATTTCCCCGAAAT-3′ and 5′-CATGATTTCGGGGAAATC-3′, were annealed by incubation for 10 min at 65°C, 10 min at 37°C, and 10 min at 22°C, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I by the filling-in reaction (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared as follows (44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in six-well plates, and harvested by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells from each well were washed with 1.0 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris·;HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min on ice, the extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant was recovered for use in the assay and stored at −80°C. EMSA reactions contained 2.5 μl of the whole cell extracts, 1 ng 32P-labeled probe (specific activity approximately 109 cpm/μg), 24 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 160 μg/ml poly(dI·;dC), 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 4.0% Ficoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 40 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol in a total volume of 12.5 μl. For the supershift assay, 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution of anti-Stat1α antibody was included in the reaction. Competition experiments contained a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide. Reactions were incubated at 24°C for 20 min. Then 8 μl of the reaction mixture was electrophoresed at 400 V for 3-4 h at 4°C on a 5% polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen for 12 h at −80°C. Rabbit anti-Jak1 antibody was developed against a synthetic peptide (KTLIEKERFYESRCRPVTPSC) corresponding to the end of the second kinase-like domain of murine Jak1. Rabbit anti-Stat1α antibody, raised against the carboxyl-terminal region of Stat1α, was a gift from James Darnell. Rabbit anti-Jak2 antibody (catalogue no. SC-294) and rabbit anti-Stat5 antibody (catalogue no. SC-835) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Sigma (catalogue no. P3300). Cells were stimulated with Hu-IFN-γ (1,000 units/ml) or Epo (100 units/ml) for 10 min at 37°C. Immunoprecipitations and blottings were performed as described (16Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Google Scholar, 40Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P.

Cytofluorographic analysis of cells for surface expression of class I MHC antigens was performed as described previously (13Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8737-8741Google Scholar, 41Muthukumaran G. Donnelly R.J. Ebensperger C. Mariano T.M. Poast J. Baron S. Dembic Z. Pestka S. J.

A. 1992; 89: 11317-11321Google Scholar) with mouse anti-human-HLA B-7 monoclonal antibody (W6/32) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The schematic illustration of the various chimeric receptor molecules that were produced is shown in Fig. 1. In one set of chimeric constructs, the extracellular domain of the EpoR was spliced to the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain of each of the two IFN-γR subunits. In the other set of chimeras, the transmembrane and intracellular domain of EpoR was fused to the extracellular domain of IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2. To investigate the role of the intracellular domain of IFN-γR2 in the signal transduction complex of IFN-γ, we constructed a chimeric receptor chain consisting of the extracellular domain of IFN-γR2 and the intracellular domain of EpoR. This chimeric construct, γR2/EpoR, and the native IFN-γR2 subunit were separately transfected into CHO-B7 as well as CHO-16-9 cells. The ability of the transfected chimeric cDNA to transduce a signal upon induction with Hu-IFN-γ was assayed by measurement of enhanced MHC class I antigen expression in the transfected cells and by activation of Stat1α. CHO-B7 cells transfected with IFN-γR2 or γR2/EpoR cDNA showed no response to Hu-IFN-γ as they lack the ligand-binding receptor subunit, Hu-IFN-γR1 (data not shown). Parental CHO-16-9 cells, which contain human chromosome 6q and express the Hu-IFN-γR1 subunit, showed no induction of MHC class I antigens in response to Hu-IFN-γ (Fig. 2, panel A) but when stably transfected with expression vectors encoding Hu-IFN-γR2 cDNA or γR2/EpoR chimera, exhibited enhanced cell surface expression of class I MHC antigens in response to Hu-IFN-γ (Fig. 2, panels B and C). To assess how effectively the intracellular domain of EpoR could substitute for the intracellular domain of the IFN-γR2 subunit, we measured the induction of MHC class I antigens as a function of IFN-γ concentration. As depicted in Fig. 3, there was a slightly lower induction of MHC class I antigens in the cells containing the chimeric γR2/EpoR than in the cells containing the native Hu-IFN-γR2 chain at each concentration of Hu-IFN-γ used. Nevertheless, the fact that the EpoR intracellular domain can be substituted for the Hu-IFN-γR2 intracellular domain shows that another sequence that can recruit Jak2 into the signal transduction complex can substitute for the intracellular domain of Hu-IFN-γR2.Fig. 3Induction of expression of class I MHC surface antigens as a function of interferon concentration. Cells were treated with Hu-IFN-γ at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 units/ml for 72 h. Class I MHC antigens were detected as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Relative fluorescence values are based on the mean fluorescence of cell populations (n = 10,000). The data were normalized so that the mean fluorescence intensity was adjusted to 1.0 for cells in the absence of Hu-IFN-γ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Various chimeric receptors between the EpoR and Hu-IFN-γR1 and Hu-IFN-γR2 subunits were constructed in order to gain an understanding of the events leading to signal transduction. CHO-16-9 cells were stably transfected with expression vectors coding for EpoR, EpoR/γR1, EpoR/γR2, the combination of EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2, and γR1/EpoR(p91). In response to Epo, the EpoR transfectants showed no response (Fig. 2, panel D). The EpoR/γR1 transfectants showed a slight enhancement of expression of MHC class I antigens (Fig. 2, panel E), which shows that the intracellular domain of the Hu-IFN-γR1 chain, by itself, can recruit all the requisite components for signal transduction. At lower concentrations of Epo (less than 100 units/ml), there was little or no increased MHC class I antigen expression in these cells (Fig. 4). The transfectants containing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 chains exhibited substantial expression of MHC class I antigens (Fig. 2, panel F; Fig. 4). Cells transfected with the expression vector coding for EpoR(p91) chimeric cDNA (EpoR with the p91 recruitment site from IFN-γR1) respond to Epo with enhanced expression of class I MHC antigens, while the γR1/EpoR(p91) transfectants were unresponsive (Fig. 2, panels H and G, respectively). Furthermore, the γR1/γR2(p91) receptor chain is unable to transduce a signal upon binding ligand, 2S. Kotenko, unpublished observation. whereas the cells expressing the EpoR/γR2(p91) chimeric receptor exhibited enhanced class I MHC antigen expression in response to activation by Epo (Fig. 2, panel I). We analyzed Stat activation in cells expressing wild-type and chimeric receptors in response to IFN-γ and Epo. As shown in Fig. 5, IFN-γ stimulation resulted in Stat1α activation in transfected 16-9 cells expressing native IFN-γR2 or γR2/EpoR chains. Similarly, Epo caused activation of Stat1α in transfected cell lines expressing EpoR/γR1 and both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 receptor chains (Fig. 6). Consistent with the small enhancement in surface expression of class I MHC antigens in cells expressing EpoR/γR1 in response to Epo, Stat1α activation was also lower in these cells compared to cells expressing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 chains. Activation of p91 was also observed in cells expressing the EpoR(p91) and EpoR/γR2(p91) chains (Fig. 6). Furthermore, cells expressing those chimeric receptors containing the EpoR intracellular domain, except γR1/EpoR(p91) and γR1/EpoR, exhibited activation of Stat5 in addition to Stat1α (Fig. 5; data with γR1/EpoR were negative similar to results with γR1/EpoR(p91)). 3G.

Both Stat1α and Stat5 are supershifted by the addition of anti-Stat1α and anti-Stat5 antibodies, respectively. Addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled GAS oligonucleotide eliminates both Stat1α and Stat5 activated complexes.Fig. 6Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of cells expressing chimeric receptors. Clones of transfected 16-9 cells stably expressing EpoR/γR1, EpoR(p91), or EpoR/γR2(p91) chimeric receptor subunits, or both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 chimeric receptors were treated with erythropoietin at 100 units/ml for 15 min at 37°C. Whole cell extracts were made and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay performed. As shown in the figure, induction with Epo causes activation of Stat1α in cells expressing EpoR/γR1, EpoR(p91), and EpoR/γR2(p91), as well as in those cells expressing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2. Addition of anti-Stat1α antibody to the reaction mixture caused the Stat1α complex to be shifted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) IFN-γ activates Jak1 and Jak2 kinases (46Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Google Scholar), whereas Epo activates Jak2 (36Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Yi T. Tang B. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Google Scholar) during signal transduction. Thus, we tested the ability of the various chimeric receptors to activate Jak1 and Jak2 kinases in response to binding of ligand. Phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 (Fig. 7) was examined by immunoprecipitation of cellular lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, followed by a Western blot visualized with specific anti-Jak1 and anti-Jak2 antibodies. Both Jak1 and Jak2 were phosphorylated in response to Hu-IFN-γ treatment in 16-9 cells expressing parental IFN-γR2 or chimeric γR2/EpoR receptors. Induction with Epo phosphorylated both Jak1 and Jak2 kinase in the cell line expressing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 chains. In the cell line expressing only the chimeric EpoR/γR1 receptor, only Jak1 kinase was phosphorylated in response to Epo. The cell line transfected with the γR1/EpoR chimeric receptor did not exhibit phosphorylation of either Jak1 or Jak2 kinase upon IFN-γ treatment. For hormones, growth factors and cytokines, the conversion of the extracellular ligand-binding event to the intracellular signal involves a change in the oligomeric structure of the receptor. Depending on the ligand, this can take the form of receptor homodimers (Epo, growth hormone), heterodimers (ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor), homotrimers (tumor necrosis factor), and more complex assemblies (reviewed in Ref. 47Stahl N. Yancopoulous G.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 587-590Google Scholar). In the case of IFN-γ, the oligomerization involving IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 initiates the signal transduction events: activation of Jak1 and Jak2, phosphorylation of IFN-γR1 on Tyr-457 (16Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Google Scholar, 25Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viriano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Google Scholar), followed by phosphorylation and activation of Stat1α (27Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Google Scholar). A major function of receptor dimerization is to bring two receptor-associated kinases together for transactivation and phosphorylation of the receptor chains. The cytoplasmic domain of the IFN-γR2 subunit serves to bring Jak2 kinase into the signal transduction complex (16Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Google Scholar). This is a crucial event since deletion of the membrane-proximal region of the intracellular domain of the IFN-γR2 chain, which encompasses the Jak2 association site, completely abrogates its ability to transduce signals in response to IFN-γ (16Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Google Scholar), and cells lacking Jak2 do not respond to IFN-γ (46Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Google Scholar). This is further supported by the observation that the IFN-γR2/EpoR chimeric receptor, which recruits Jak2, is almost as effective as the native IFN-γR2 chain in supporting signal transduction in response to IFN-γ (Figs. 2, 5, and 7). The IFN-γR2 subunit is a helper receptor subunit with a Jak2 association site, but no Stat recruitment site; its intracellular domain can be substituted with the cytoplasmic domain of any receptor subunit that can bring a Jak kinase to the IFN-γ receptor complex to support signal transduction (40Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17174-17182Google Scholar). The requirement for two distinct Jak kinases in the IFN-γ signaling pathway was demonstrated with the use of kinase-deficient cell lines (46Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Google Scholar, 48Watling D. Guschin D. Müller M. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Rogers N.C. Schindler C. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 166-170Google Scholar). Based on our results with the chimeric erythropoietin-interferon γ receptors, we propose that this reflects two features characteristic of the IFN-γ receptor complex: the unique properties of the receptor relative to the positioning of the Jaks, and the idea that Jak1 is relatively ineffective in one or more of the following phosphorylation steps (trans-phosphorylation of itself, phosphorylation of IFN-γR1, and activation of Stat1α). The presence of Jak2 facilitates effective phosphorylation of the above steps. In contrast to the growth hormone receptor (49De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar) and the EpoR (37Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Google Scholar) complexes, when one IFN-γ homodimer binds two IFN-γR1 molecules, the two receptor subunits do not interact with one another and are separated by 27 Å (50Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zanodry P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Google Scholar) at their closest point. Therefore, although the IFN-γR1 chain possesses both a Jak1 association site and a Stat1α recruitment site, alone it is unable to transduce a signal on homodimerization as the two Jak1 kinases are not in physical proximity to permit transphosphorylation (Fig. 8A). Crystallographic analysis of the IFN-γ·;IFN-γR1 complex suggests that each monomer of the IFN-γ homodimer binds one IFN-γR1 and one IFN-γR2 subunit (50Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L. Lundell D.J. Lunn C.A. Zanodry P.J. Narula S.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 230-235Google Scholar). Thus the signal-transducing complex of IFN-γ consists of the IFN-γ homodimer bound to two IFN-γR1 and two IFN-γR2 chains, which recruit Jak1 and Jak2, respectively (16Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Google Scholar, 40Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17174-17182Google Scholar); and Jak2 phosphorylates Jak1, following which either kinase phosphorylates Tyr-457 of the IFN-γR1 chain (Fig. 8B; see also Refs. 25Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viriano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Google Scholar, 45Cook J.R. Jung V. Schwartz B. Wang P. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The phosphorylated segment of each IFN-γR1 chain recruits Stat1α, which is then phosphorylated by Jak1 or Jak2, then released to dimerize and form the active Stat1α. In contrast, with the EpoR/γR1 dimer, two Jak1 kinases are brought sufficiently close together to activate one another (Fig. 8C), albeit inefficiently. In the case of the EpoR/γR1·;EpoR/γR2 dimer, one Jak1 and one Jak2 are in close apposition for Jak2 to phosphorylate Jak1 and initiate efficient downstream signaling events (Fig. 8D). Cells expressing the EpoR/γR2(p91) chimeric receptor (Fig. 2I) exhibit a stronger biological response than cells expressing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 (Fig. 2F) or even the native IFN-γ receptor (γR2, Fig. 2B), which supports a modulating role for Jak1 in the IFN-γR complex. In cells expressing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 chains, binding of Epo can induce the formation of three types of receptor dimers: EpoR/γR1 homodimers, EpoR/γR2 homodimers, and EpoR/γR1·;EpoR/γR2 heterodimers. The EpoR/γR1 homodimer is barely active (Figs. 2E and 4), and the EpoR/γR2 homodimer is inactive. The major functional receptor complex therefore must be the EpoR/γR1·;EpoR/γR2 heterodimer (Fig. 8D). That Jak1 is relatively ineffective in transphosphorylation is supported by the observation that cells expressing the EpoR/γR1 chimera show a smaller response than the cells expressing both EpoR/γR1 and EpoR/γR2 or the EpoR/γR2(p91) chimeric receptor chains. Thus, even though homodimerization of the EpoR/γR1 receptor by Epo brings the cytoplasmic domains of the two γR1 subunits into close proximity (Fig. 8C), the data of Figs. 2, 4, and 7 indicate that Jak2 is more effective at phosphorylating Jak1 than the latter is at cross-phosphorylating itself. This is consistent with the results of Briscoe et al. (52Briscoe J. Rogers N. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Harpur A. Wilks A. Horn F. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J. Kerr I.M. J. Interferon and Cytokine Res. 1995; 15,: S56Google Scholar), who reported that a Jak1 molecule with an inactive kinase domain can replace the normal Jak1 in signal transduction by IFN-γ and suggested a structural role for Jak1 in the receptor complex. As noted above, the Jak kinases do not mediate Stat selectivity and are promiscuous in their activity; each of the Jak kinases can substitute for Jak2 in signal transduction by IFN-γ (40Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17174-17182Google Scholar). Selectivity is likely maintained from the extracellular receptor-ligand interaction to the final signal transduction mechanism by other regions of the intracellular domains. For example, Heim et al. (53Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Google Scholar) suggested that the SH2 recognition domain of Stat1α maintains some of the specificity. It remains to be established, however, how Stat1α can be activated by many different cytokines and maintain specificity through transcription. Other molecules that interact with Jaks and Stats may contribute to the specificity of the interaction (54Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. Izotova L. Krause C.D. Mehnert J.M. Pestka S. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1996; 7: 478Google Scholar). 4C. Schindler, personal communication. We propose that the multichain cytokine class II receptors have two major chains exemplified by the IFN-γ receptor complex (Fig. 8B). The ligand binding chain (IFN-γR1) and the accessory chain (IFN-γR2; helper receptor) serve as a foundation for the functional IFN-γR complex (16Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Mariano T.M. Donnelly R.J. Muthukumaran G. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20915-20921Google Scholar, 40Kotenko S.V. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17174-17182Google Scholar). The geometry of the IFN-γR1 chain is such that its homodimerization yields a non-functional intracellular receptor complex. The accessory chain completes this function (Fig. 8A). The question arises: why should two separate chains have evolved when one in the correct configuration would suffice? We postulate that the presence of two distinct chains provides for more effective control and fine tuning of responses to ligand. For example, the differences in response of TH1 and TH2 cells to IFN-γ result from the lack of expression of the IFN-γR2 chain in the TH1 subset (55Bach E.A. Szabo S.J. Dighe A.S. Ashkenazi A. Aguet M. Murphy K.M. Schreiber R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1215-1217Google Scholar–57Skrenta H. Peritt D. Cook J.R. Garotta G. Trinchieri G. Pestka S. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1996; 7: 622Google Scholar) and allows exquisite fine tuning of sensitivity to IFN-γ. It is also possible that receptors with multiple chains could recruit additional factors into the complex to generate a wider variety of intracellular signals. This could explain how receptors with multiple subunits could activate a greater number of specific pathways and signals than those with fewer elements in the receptor complex. Our experiments begin to provide an insight into these possibilities.

The transcriptional mechanisms regulating these distinct phases are poorly understood. In particular, while a required role for the germ cell transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator-τ during spermiogenesis has recently been demonstrated, the transcriptional mechanisms leading to early haploid cell formation are unknown. The rat and mouse proenkephalin genes are selectively expressed from an alternate, germ cell-specific promoter in meiotic and early haploid cells. In this study, the minimal rat proenkephalin germ line promoter was localized to a 116-bp region encompassing the transcriptional start site region. Further, a proximal 51-bp sequence located in the 5′-flanking region is absolutely required for germ line promoter activity. This 51 bp sequence corresponds to a previously characterized binding element (GCP1) that forms cell-specific complexes with rat spermatogenic cell nuclear factors distinct from cyclic AMP response element binding proteins. Further, GCP1 contains novel direct repeat sequences required for factor binding and transgene expression in spermatogenic cells. These repeat elements are highly similar to sequences within the active regions of other male germ line promoters expressed during meiosis. GCP1 may therefore contain transcriptional elements that participate more generally during meiosis in the differentiation of spermatocytes and early haploid spermatids.

GCP1 may therefore contain transcriptional elements that participate more generally during meiosis in the differentiation of spermatocytes and early haploid spermatids. Spermatogenesis consists of a well defined developmental program involving a series of proliferative and differentiative stages. These events can be divided into three phases: 1) mitosis involving spermatogonial cell types, 2) meiotic division and differentiation of spermatocytes into haploid spermatids, and 3) spermiogenesis in which spermatids morphologically differentiate into spermatozoa. Successful integration of these phases requires the sequential expression of different subsets of genes and involves, in part, stage-dependent transcription from spermatogenic cell-specific promoters. Developmental regulation of distinct and sometimes cell-specific transcription factors appears to be a critical mechanism controlling this spermatogenic program. For example, a number of proliferation-associated transcriptional regulators, including c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, are expressed exclusively in spermatogonial cell types (1Propst F. Rosenberg M.P. Vande Woude G.F. Trends Genet... 1988; 4: 183-187Google Scholar, 2Torry D.S. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 27: 167-170Google Scholar).

Recent studies have begun to shed light on the role of transcriptional regulators during specific phases of sperm development. CREMτ, a spermatogenic cell-specific CREM isoform, functions as a transcriptional activator of promoters containing cAMP response elements (CREs) (6Delmas V. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 121-124Google Scholar). Expression of CREMτ protein is reportedly restricted to postmeiotic (spermatid) stages, suggesting a specific role during spermiogenesis (4Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has been shown to activate transcription from a number of haploid-specific promoters that contain CREs, including those for RT7, protamine-1, and transition protein-1 (6Delmas V.

In addition, CREM-deficient mice are infertile due to the failure to complete spermiogenesis beyond the round spermatid stage, and they lack testicular expression of several haploid-specific, CRE-dependent genes (9Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquiller D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sasson-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Google Scholar, 10Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Google Scholar). Clearly, while CREMτ has a critical role in regulating spermiogenesis via CRE-containing promoters, additional transcription pathways are required for appropriate sperm maturation. For example, several germ cell promoters are active during meiosis alone or in both late meiotic and early postmeiotic germ cells, including those for histones H1 and H2B, lactate dehydrogenase c, Pdha-2, proacrosin, and pgk-2 (11van Wert J.M. Wolfe S.A. Grimes S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8733-8743Google Scholar, 12Lim K. Chae C.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15271-15273Google Scholar, 13Thomas K. Del Mazo J. Eversole P. Bellve A.

Further, formation of pachytene spermatocytes and early (round) spermatids is not interrupted in CREM-deficient mice, and proacrosin expression persists in these mutants (9Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquiller D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sasson-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Google Scholar, 10Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Google Scholar). Thus, CREM-independent transcriptional mechanisms clearly are important for meiosis and haploid cell formation. The proenkephalin gene, which codes for enkephalin-containing opioid peptides, is expressed in a stage-dependent manner during rat and mouse spermatogenesis (17Kilpatrick D.L. Millette C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5015-5081Google Scholar, 18Kilpatrick D.L. Borland K. Jin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5695-5699Google Scholar). Opioid peptides have been implicated in paracrine interactions between germ cells and Sertoli cells that may be important for maintenance of spermatogenesis (19Fabbri A. Tsai-Morris C.H. Luna S. Fraioli F. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2544-2546Google Scholar, 20Morris P.L. Vale W.W. Bardin C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1513-1519Google Scholar). Proenkephalin expression occurs initially at low levels in early meiotic stages and then increases markedly in late pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids and declines thereafter. These cells use an independent, alternate promoter within the single copy proenkephalin gene to synthesize a novel 1700-nt germ cell-specific mRNA (21Kilpatrick D.L. Zinn S.A. Fitzgerald M. Higuchi H. Sabol S.L. Meyerhardt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3717-3726Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the rat proenkephalin germ line promoter is contained within a 500-bp TATA-less sequence located within the first somatic intron (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar). While the upstream somatic promoter contains functional CRE elements (23Hyman S.E. Comb M. Lin Y.-S. Pearlberg J. Green M.R. Goodman H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4225-4233Google Scholar), the germ line proenkephalin promoter lacks such consensus sequences. Since this promoter is highly active in both pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, its characterization should provide valuable insight into CRE-independent transcriptional mechanisms governing formation of late meiotic and early haploid cells. Here we report the identification of novel cis-acting repeat elements required for expression of the rat germ line proenkephalin promoter using a transgenic mouse model. The existence of germ cell-specific nuclear factors interacting with these elements is also demonstrated. Previous transgenic studies (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar) used a rat proenkephalin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion construct encompassing the germ cell proenkephalin start site region as well as adjacent 3′- and 5′-sequences (RPKCAT0.5). Derivatives of this transgene were generated as follows (see Fig. 1). RPKCAT0.5ΔMSP and RPKCAT0.5ΔBSM were prepared by isolation of HindIII-MspI and HindIII-BsmI fragments, respectively, from RPKCAT0.5 and subcloning into the promoterless RPKCAT vector using HindIII and SmaI sites. RPKCAT0.4 was made by deletion of the first 100 bp from RPKCAT0.5 using TfiI and XhoI and re-ligation of blunt ends. Constructs RPKCAT0.5-3′Del, RPKCAT0.4-3′Del, RPKCAT5′Del, RPKCAT0.45, and RPKCAT0.45-3′Del were all generated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) was used in 20 cycle reactions. The DNA sequences of 5′-primers were as follows: 0.5-3′Del, GTACTACCATCGATGCATGCGATCGTCCAACTTTCT; 0.4-3′Del, CAGTACCGCTCGAGAATCTTGCCCTAAGCAACCGAC; 0.45 and 0.45-3′Del, ACTACCATCGATGCGCCTGCTCCCGAGCCG; and 0.5-5′Del, GTACTACCATCGATCAGGAAGACAGGATGCCCCA. The 3′-primer used for each RPKCAT-3′Del construct was TCCTGTCCTTCCGAGGGCGC, while that used for constructs 0.5-5′ Del and 0.45 was GCTGGTACCAGATCTGAGCTC. Restriction sites within the RPKCAT vector used for subcloning of PCR products were as follows: 0.5-3′Del, 0.5-5′ Del, 0.45 and 0.45-3′ Del for ClaI/SmaI; and 0.4-3′ Del for XhoI/SmaI. The transgene GCP1mut was prepared by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing GCP1 sequences that extended to the third repeat element at its 3′-end where a TfiI site is located and that contained mutations in the second and third repeats (shown in lower case): CGATGCGCCTGCTCCCGAGCCGCGAAtaCagtTGTTCGtaCagt (sense) and actGtaCGAACAactGtaTTCGCGGCTGGGAGCAGGGCGCAT (antisense). This annealed fragment contained a cohesive PstI overhang at its 5′-end and a blunt 3′-end. A DNA fragment containing the remaining 3′-sequences for RPKCATO.45 was isolated as a TfiI-XmaI fragment, with the TfiI site blunt-ended using Klenow. These two DNA fragments were then ligated to a PstI/XmaI fragment prepared from pRPKCAT0.5 containing CAT, SV40, and vector sequences. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing before use in transgenic experiments. Transgenes containing promoter, CAT, and SV40 3′ sequences were released by restriction digestion of plasmid DNAs and gel purified prior to injection. Numbering of sequences within the germ line promoter are based on assignment of the most upstream initiation site as +1. Transgenic mice were made by microinjection of the purified transgenes into the male pronucleus of fertilized mouse eggs. To determine transgene integration, tail DNA from founder mice was analyzed by PCR using primers to CAT sequences (ACGTTTCAGTTTGCTCATGG and AGCTAAGGAAGCTAAAATGG) (24Walter C.A. Nasr-Schirf D. Luna V.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1065-1070Google Scholar). TSHβ primers (TCCTCAAAGATGCTCATTAG and GTAACTCACTCATGCAAAGT) were used as a positive internal control. Positive founders were bred to obtain male transgenic offspring prior to analysis. Tissues were removed from males for each positive line following sexual maturation. A sufficient number of independent transgenic lines (typically 4-8) were generated for each construct to ensure clear interpretation of results. In particular, all non-functional constructs in this study yielded no positive lines, while expressing transgenes had an expression rate of typically 67% or greater. This success rate for functionally active transgenes is consistent with previous transgenic studies (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar, 25Zinn S.A. Ebert K.M. Mehta N.D. Joshi J. Kilpatrick D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23850-23855Google Scholar). Total RNA from tissues or isolated cells was prepared by the method of Chirgwin et al. (26Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). RNase protection was performed as described previously (25Zinn S.A. Ebert K.M. Mehta N.D. Joshi J. Kilpatrick D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23850-23855Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled antisense RNA probes were generated from linearized plasmids using [α-32P]UTP and either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase. The RNA probes were annealed to total RNA in a final volume of 30 μl of hybridization buffer and then digested with 40 μg/ml RNase A and 2 μg/ml RNase T1. Samples were treated with proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and then extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Riboprobes vectors for CAT (pCAT) sequences and the rat proenkephalin germ line start site region (pAva) have been previously described (25Zinn S.A. Ebert K.M. Mehta N.D. Joshi J. Kilpatrick D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23850-23855Google Scholar). The vector p0.45-3′DelCAT was used for start site analysis of the RPKCAT-3′Del constructs. It was prepared by subcloning a XhoI/EcoRI fragment from RPKCAT0.45-3′Del into the same sites within pBS-SK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Spermatogenic cells enriched in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids were prepared by enzymatic digestion of adult transgenic mouse testes essentially as described by Bellve et al. (27Bellve A.R. Millette C.F. Bhatnagar Y.M. O'Brien D.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; Google Scholar). For nuclear extracts, enriched spermatogenic cells were isolated from adult rat testes and homogenized in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml each aprotonin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin, 2 mM benzamidine, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated on sucrose gradients, and nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar, 28Cereghini S. Raymondjean M. Carranca A.G. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Cell. 1987; 50: 627-638Google Scholar) and stored at −70 C. Gel-shift assays were performed according to previous protocols (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 0.25-1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA (oligonucleotide or genomic) was incubated on ice for 20 min with 2 μg of nuclear extract in a total reaction buffer volume of 14 μl. The reaction buffer contained 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 30 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM spermidine, 0.5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5 μg of poly(dA-dT). DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels using low ionic strength buffer containing 12.5 mM Tris borate (pH 8.0) and 0.25 mM EDTA. Competition assays were performed by addition of excess amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide into the reaction mixture. Double-stranded oligonucleotides and genomic restriction fragments containing 5′ overhangs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by fill-in reactions with Klenow. Genomic fragments were prepared by restriction digestion of pRPKCAT0.5 (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar). DNA sequences of oligonucleotide probes were as follows: GCP1, GCGCCTGCTCCCGAGCCGCGAACTCCAGTGTTCGCTCCAGAATCTTGCCCT; and GCP1-mut123, GCGCCTGtaCagtAGCCGCGAAtaCagtTGTTCGtacagtAATCTTGCCCT. GCP1mut1, GCP1mut2, GCP1mut3, and GCP1mut23 oligonucleotides contained the same mutated bases of the indicated repeat elements as in GCP1mut123. TATA-mut sequences were used as nonspecific competitor DNA: GGGGGGGGAGAAAAGGGGT. Additional competitor DNAs used were: CRE, AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG; CREmut, AGAGATTGCCTGTGGTCAGAGAGCTAG; and Gli, GAA AGATTGTCCCTGCTGGTCCTGCTCCACGACCCACCCGGCAAGGTT. Autoradiographs of competition experiments using wild-type and mutated GCP1 sequences were quantified using densitometric scanning (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). A search for transcription factor binding elements within rat proenkephalin promoter sequences was performed using the Tfsites program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Previous work demonstrated that a fusion gene construct (RPKCAT0.5) containing 500 bp of the rat proenkephalin gene linked to the reporter gene CAT was sufficient for cell- and stage-specific expression of the germ line proenkephalin promoter (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar). RPKCAT0.5 contains the transcriptional start site region for the rat promoter as well as neighboring 5′- and 3′-sequences (Fig. 1). To further map cis-elements that specify spermatogenic cell transcription, a series of proenkephalin-CAT constructs containing different portions of this 500 bp promoter sequence were generated and tested in transgenic mice. Fig. 1 summarizes the results for a series of nine different constructs in comparison with RPKCAT0.5. Constructs RPKCAT0.5ΔMSP (−118 to +312), RPKCAT0.5ΔBsm (−118 to +168), RPKCATO.8 (which also contains the upstream somatic promoter), and RPKCAT0.5-3′Del (−118 to +62) comprise sequential deletions of the 3′ promoter region. All four constructs actively expressed CAT transcripts in testes of transgenic mice but not in somatic tissues (kidney, liver, heart, or cerebellum) as determined by RNase protection analysis of total RNA using an antisense riboprobe to CAT sequences. In each case, a 250-nt CAT protection fragment was selectively detected in testis RNA (Fig. 2; data not shown). To confirm that the transgenes were expressed in the male germ line, RNase protection was performed using RNA from enriched preparations of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, stages that express rat proenkephalin in high amounts. CAT transcripts were abundantly detected in these germ cells for all four transgenes (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The level of transgene expression in germ cells was equivalent to that for the original RPKCAT0.5 construct, as shown for RPKCAT0.5-3′Del (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Expression of the RPKCAT0.5-3′Del transgene in spermatogenic cells. A, protection analysis of CAT transcripts in total RNA from spermatogenic cells. Fifty μg of total RNA was used except for the first lane of line 1 for the 0.5-3′Del transgene (0.5-3′Del-1) (100 μg). RNA from purified germ cells of RPKCAT0.5 transgenic mice (0.5(+)) was used as a positive control while kidney RNA (0.5-3′Del-1K(−)) served as a negative control. Probe, pCAT riboprobe digested alone; M, size markers. B, analysis of transcription start sites for the RPKCAT0.5-3′Del construct. RNase protection was performed with the p0.45-3′DELCAT riboprobe using total RNA from transgenic mouse testes and kidney (50 μg of each). Total RNA from non-transgenic mouse testis (MT) was used as a negative control. Numbers above lanes refer to specific transgenic lines. K, kidney; T, testis. The major protected bands have lengths of approximately 300, 309, 320, and 334 nt and are shown by arrows. This result agrees well with the sizes predicted for transcripts initiated from the 3′-Del transgenes, as shown in the schematic in panel C. C, the region encompassed by the p0.45-3′DELCAT riboprobe is shown together with the four observed protection fragments generated from the initiation region (In) below it.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transcriptional initiation of the 1.7-kilobase proenkephalin mRNAs in rat and mouse testis occurs at multiple sites spanning a 35-bp region within the germ line promoter. RNase protection using probes encompassing this region was performed to determine whether transcription of the four transgenes initiated from these same sites. Analysis of testicular RNA from RPKCAT0.5-3′Del mice using the p0.45-3′DELCAT riboprobe generated multiple protection fragments of approximately 300, 309, 320, and 334 nt that agree well with the predicted sizes for products initiated from the germ line start sites (Fig. 3, B and C). Appropriate initiation from the other 3′ deleted transgenes (RPKCAT0.5ΔMSP, ΔBSM, and RPKCAT0.8) was also confirmed by RNase protection (data not shown). Based on these results, sequences downstream of position +62 are dispensable for appropriate stage- and cell-specific initiation from the rat proenkephalin promoter in male germ cells. In contrast to the above findings, deletion of either 128 (−118 to +10) (RPKCAT5′-Del) or 105 bp (−118 to −14) (RPKCAT0.4) of the 5′-flanking region resulted in complete loss of detectable CAT transcripts in testes of transgenic mice (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). For all but one transgenic line, CAT expression was also absent in somatic tissues of mice harboring these transgenes. One RPKCAT0.4 line exhibited expression in multiple somatic tissues as well as testis (data not shown). This appears to reflect the fortuitous insertion of the transgene adjacent to or within a ubiquitously active transcription unit. These results demonstrated the existence of one or more functional cis-elements within the 5′-flanking sequence extending from −118 to −14. Previous experiments detected multiple sites within the 500 bp proenkephalin germ line promoter that were bound by nuclear proteins from spermatogenic cells (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar). One of these sites, termed GCP1 (−54 to −4), was contained within the functional 105 bp 5′-flanking sequence, immediately upstream of the initiation region (Fig. 1). To determine whether binding within this region was functionally important, another transgene (RPKCAT0.45) was tested in which the 51-bp GCP1 sequence was selectively added back to the RPKCAT0.4 transgene. Readdition of these sequences restored testis- specific transgene expression (Fig. 5A). The level of RPKCAT0.45 expression was also comparable with that found for the other functional transgenes (Fig. 5A). Further analysis also confirmed that the transgene was expressed in spermatogenic cells (Fig. 5B). To determine whether transcription initiated from the appropriate start sites, RNase protection was performed on transgenic testis RNA using the pAva riboprobe (Fig. 5C). Multiple protection fragments identical in size to those generated from rat testis RNA were observed. Thus, sequences from −54 to −4 contain regulatory elements that are critical for stage-dependent, spermatogenic cell-specific expression of the rat proenkephalin gene. To define more accurately the minimal promoter sequences required for the proenkephalin germ line promoter, the construct RPKCAT0.45-3′Del was studied (Fig. 1). This transgene was equally active in directing testis-specific expression (Fig. 6A) that also localized to germ cells and initiated from the appropriate sites (data not shown), thus further defining the minimal promoter region to a 116-bp sequence (−54 to +62). In addition to GCP1, this minimal promoter encompasses the initiation region and a previously defined (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar) downstream protein interaction site (GCP2) (Fig. 6B). The preceding findings indicated that nuclear protein interactions with GCP1 sequences are critical for activity of the proenkephalin germ line promoter during spermatogenesis. Sequence analysis did not reveal any consensus binding sites for known transcription factors within this region. However, the GCP1 sequence does contain three direct repeats (CTCCA/CG) (Fig. 7A) that could function to regulate transcription. The possible involvement of these repeated sequences in factor binding was, therefore, examined using gel-shift analysis. GCP1 sequences form a major and additional minor complexes of higher mobility with rat testis and germ cell nuclear extracts that are distinct from those formed with liver nuclear proteins (Fig. 7B). The relative abundance of the higher mobility complexes varied in different experiments (Fig. 7, C and D), and they may reflect probe heterogeneity and/or partial proteolysis in some experiments. Competition experiments demonstrated that binding of germ cell factors to GCP1 was DNA sequence-specific (Fig. 7C). This analysis also revealed that GCP1 sequences were not recognized by CRE-binding proteins present in spermatogenic cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 7C). Further, mutation of the three direct repeats abolished the binding of germ cell factors (Fig. 7D), suggesting the direct involvement of these elements in GCP1/protein interactions. Additional studies of the repeat sequences were performed to determine their relative contributions to factor binding by GCP1. Mutation of the first repeat alone had a negligible effect on this interaction (Fig. 8). However, mutation of either the second or third repeat resulted in partial loss of binding activity (50-65% decrease) and mutation of both resulted in essentially complete disruption of the GCP1/protein complex (Fig. 8; see also Fig. 7D). Mutation of repeat 1 together with either the second or third repeat did not further reduce GCP1 binding activity, nor did deletion of the 5′-end of GCP1 including the first repeat (Fig. 8). Thus, the second and third repeats, which are identical in sequence and differ from the first repeat in the fifth position (A instead of C), are required for maximal binding of GCP1 to germ cell nuclear factors. It is possible that the first repeat is inactive because of this single base difference in the fifth position or because of its positioning within GCP1, or both. To examine the functional significance of these in vitro protein interactions with GCP1 sequences, an additional transgene, containing mutations of the second and third repeats identical to those used in gel-shift analysis, was constructed and tested (GCP1mut; Fig. 1). Mutation of these two sites resulted in complete loss of transgene expression in mouse testis and did not produce abberant expression in somatic tissues (Fig. 9). These findings indicate that the interactions between spermatogenic cell nuclear proteins and the second and third repeat elements within GCP1 are critical for proenkephalin germ line promoter activity. Spermatogenic cells are characterized by the production of a large number of unique transcript forms often encoding ubiquitously expressed proteins (30Wolgemuth D. Watrin F. Mamm. Genome. 1991; 1: 283-288Google Scholar). Some of these mRNAs encode germ cell-specific isoforms that may perform specialized functions during spermatogenesis (30Wolgemuth D. Watrin F. Mamm. Genome. 1991; 1: 283-288Google Scholar). In other cases, novel untranslated sequences are present that may have specific regulatory roles, as in the translational control of testis-specific superoxide dismutase-1 mRNA involving its 5′-untranslated region (31Gu W. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4535-4543Google Scholar). Transcription from an alternate spermatogenic cell-specific promoter is often involved in generation of these unique transcripts (32Sun Z. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20962-20967Google Scholar, 33Teruya J.H. Kutsunai S.Y. Spear D.H. Edwards P. Clarke C.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2315-2326Google Scholar, 34Howard T.E. Shai S.-Y. Langford K.G. Martin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4294-4302Google Scholar), as for rat and mouse proenkephalin. Alternate promoters expressed in somatic cells frequently function selectively during cell development and differentiation (35Schibler U. Sierra F. Trends Genet. 1987; 21: 237-257Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that some germ cell-specific transcripts reflect the necessity for an alternate promoter that provides appropriate cell-specific and developmentally regulated expression in the male germ line. Previous work showed that the rat proenkephalin germ line promoter functions independently of the upstream somatic promoter and that a 500-bp region could mediate cell- and stage-specific expression (22Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that a 116-bp region encompassing the start site region is sufficient for appropriate transcription of the proenkephalin promoter in spermatocytes and spermatids and that a 51-bp 5′-flanking sequence (GCP1) is absolutely required for its activity. These data are consistent with the presence of one or more cell-specific transactivators in these spermatogenic stages that interact with specific elements in GCP1. At present, there is no evidence for the involvement of transcriptional repression in somatic cells since deletion analyses did not result in ectopic transgene expression in somatic tissues. However, a role for silencer elements located elsewhere within the minimal promoter region cannot be ruled out. This is relevant since repression has been implicated in spermatogenic cell transcription of the c-mos, lactate dehydrogenase c, Tctex-1, and histone H2b promoters (12Lim K. Chae C.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15271-15273Google Scholar, 36Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Google Scholar, 37Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 5071-5075Google Scholar). While numerous germ cell-specific promoters have been analyzed, much remains to be learned regarding the specific transcriptional mechanisms mediating stage-dependent gene expression in the male germ line. A critical role for CREM proteins and CRE-dependent promoter regulation in mediating spermiogenesis has been established (9Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquiller D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sasson-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Google Scholar, 10Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Google Scholar). However, additional mechanisms appear necessary for formation of meiotic and early postmeiotic germ cells. In fact, several testis-specific DNA binding proteins apparently unrelated to CREMs have been implicated in promoter regulation in these spermatogenic stages. For example, novel ets-domain-like proteins appear to regulate the pgk-2 promoter in mouse germ cells (39Goto M. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 209-214Google Scholar), and a testis-specific protein recognizes a novel palindromic regulatory element involved in testis-specific transcription of the mouse lactate dehydrogenase c gene (37Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Google Scholar). Both of these promoters function during spermatocyte and spermatid stages. In addition, testis-specific factors bind to regulatory elements (TE1 and TE2) unrelated to CREs within the spermatocyte-specific histone H1t promoter (45Wolfe S.A. van Wert J.M. Grimes S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12461-12469Google Scholar). However, the identities and functional roles for these and other putative germ cell-specific trans-factors, such as Tet-1 (46Tamura T. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4327-4332Google Scholar), are generally unknown. The proenkephalin germ line promoter also becomes highly active in pachytene spermatocytes, and the 51-bp GCP1 regulatory region does not contain CRE-like sequences and is not responsive to CREMτ or CREB in transient co-transfection assays (data not shown). In addition, proenkephalin expression is not reduced in testes of CREM-deficient mice. 2J. Blendy and G. Shütz, unpublished observations. Therefore, the proenkephalin gene is also regulated by CREM-independent mechanisms during spermatogenesis. Consistent with this, germ cell-specific nuclear proteins distinct from CREMτ and other CRE-binding proteins specifically bind to this region. Factor binding involves a novel sequence (CTCCAG) repeated twice within GCP1, and more importantly, mutation of these two elements abolishes proenkephalin germ line promoter activity. Interestingly, this repeat resembles sequences within the lactate dehydrogenase c palindromic element that are required for germ cell-specific transcription (CTCCTG) (37Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Google Scholar). In both promoters, these sequences are located just upstream of the start sites, and in both cases, germ cell proteins bind to DNA segments containing these elements. Similarly, the testis-specific element TE2 found within the rat histone H1t promoter also contains sequences resembling the GCP1 repeats (CCCCAG) (45Wolfe S.A. van Wert J.M. Grimes S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12461-12469Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that sequences related to the repeat elements within GCP1 may regulate multiple germ cell-specific promoters expressed during late meiosis. Repeated elements are often required for proper DNA binding or enhanced activation by trans-acting factors. For example, DNA binding by thyroid hormone requires appropriately spaced direct repeats (47Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407Google Scholar), and Sp1 exhibits synergistic promoter activation when multiple binding sites are present (48Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Google Scholar). Functional analysis of other sequences within the 116-bp promoter region is an important goal of future analyses. For example, initiation regions are often critical for activation of TATA-less promoters (49Smale S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Google Scholar) although sequences resembling typical initiator (Inr) elements are not found within the start site region of the proenkephalin germ line promoter. In addition, another region is present within the defined minimal promoter (GCP2) that binds germ cell-specific nuclear factors and contains a palindromic GC-box (see Fig. 6B). Finally, characterization of the GCP1 binding proteins, their developmental expression, and potential interactions with other promoters active during late meiosis are clearly important to pursue.

Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Google Scholar). The human EPOR is a 484-amino acid glycoprotein comprised of extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of nearly equal size and a single transmembrane domain (2Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the EPOR contains a 225-amino acid region referred to as the cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domain that shares conserved features with an expanding family of cytokine and growth factor receptors (3Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar, 4Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Google Scholar) including the receptors for many interleukins (IL), colony stimulating factors, growth hormone (GH), thrombopoietin, leptin, interferons (IFN), and tissue factor among others. The CRH domains consist of two motifs of approximately 100 amino acids each that are structurally related to fibronectin type III domains. Based on this homology, Bazan (3Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar, 4Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Google Scholar) proposed that the CRH domains consist of two motifs of seven β-strands each which adopt β-sheet structures with fibronectin type III-like or immunoglobulin (Ig)-like folds. These structural predictions have been confirmed by the solution of the crystal structures of the ligand-bound extracellular domains of the GH receptor and IFN-γ receptor α (IFN-γRα), the GH bound extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor, the extracellular domain of tissue factor, and most recently, the extracellular domain of the EPOR with a peptide ligand (5de Vos A.M.

Alignment of the CRH domains of this family of receptors based on their predicted β-strand secondary structural elements reveals several conserved characteristics (3Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar, 4Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Google Scholar, 11Patthy L. Cell. 1990; 61: 13-14Google Scholar). Of these, the most highly conserved are four spatially conserved cysteine residues that form two cysteine bridges in the amino-terminal domain and a WSXWS sequence at the membrane proximal end of the carboxyl-terminal domain. The overall amino acid identity between CRH domains in receptors of this family is generally less than 25% (11Patthy L. Cell. 1990; 61: 13-14Google Scholar). Thus, the general structural topography of these domains is more highly conserved than the primary amino acid sequences. erythropoietin erythropoietin receptor EPO binding protein cytokine receptor homology wild-type interleukin growth hormone interferon granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor high performance-size exclusion liquid chromatography bovine serum albumin polymerase chain reaction Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum Tris-buffered saline growth hormone binding protein the concentration at which inhibition is 50% of control; specific amino acids are designated by the three-letter code of the amino acid followed by a superscript number identifying the position of the amino acid in the protein (e.g. Trp40); specific mutations are designated by the single-letter code for the original amino acid in the primary sequence of the protein followed by the single-letter code for the new amino acid (e.g. W40A). Amino acid residues involved in ligand binding have been identified in several receptors of the cytokine receptor family using alanine substitution site-specific mutagenesis. The importance of many of these ligand binding determinants was subsequently confirmed in structural studies. For example, Woodcock et al. (12Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Google Scholar) used alanine substitution mutagenesis on the common β-chain (βc) of the human GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors to identify amino acid residues critical for the formation of the high affinity receptors for GM-CSF and IL-5. Using mutation complementation, they also identified a residue in GM-CSF that is likely to interact with the critical residues on the βc. Support for these results was provided by a molecular model of the GM-CSF receptor complex (ligand, α-chain, and βc) in which the binding determinants identified by mutagenesis were predicted to be within bonding distance of each other (13Lyne P.D. Bamborough P. Duncan D. Richards W.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2223-2233Google Scholar). Alanine substitution mutagenesis has also been used to identify important ligand binding determinants in the extracellular domain of the growth hormone receptor (14Bass S.H. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4498-4502Google Scholar), and many of these residues were subsequently shown to interact with residues on GH in the crystal structure of the GH-growth hormone receptor complex (5de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). Although the structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand has recently been determined (10Livnah O. Stura E. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Google Scholar), the precise nature of the EPO-EBP interaction remains to be determined. Site-specific mutagenesis provides a sensitive method for investigating which residues of the extracellular domain of the EPOR are involved in EPO binding. In retrospect, we are able to compare the EBP mutagenesis data to the EBP-peptide structure which may help identify amino acid residues that are involved in EPO binding. Previously, we reported that a single residue, Phe93, is a critical ligand binding determinant of the EPOR (15Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Google Scholar). Here, in a more extensive mutagenesis analysis of the 225-amino acid extracellular domain of the EPOR, we report the effect on EPO binding of single amino acid substitutions created by site-specific mutagenesis. In some cases, residues were selected for site-specific mutagenesis based on random mutagenesis results. The functions of other amino acid residues were investigated based on their conservation among receptors of the cytokine receptor family or their homology to ligand binding determinants reported for other receptors of this family. Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP), consisting of amino acids 1-225 of the extracellular domain of the mature EPOR (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar), and analyzed for EPO binding in several different assay formats. Some mutant proteins were expressed as full-length receptor on the surface of COS cells and analyzed in receptor binding assays with 125I-EPO. We have identified residues that appear to be involved in EPO binding as well as other residues, most of which are conserved in receptors of the cytokine receptor family, that appear to be necessary for the proper folding and/or stability of the EPOR. From these results, we can begin to build the structure-activity relationships that will help to delineate the EPO binding face of the EPOR. The cloning, expression, protein recovery, and refolding of the EBP has been described in detail elsewhere (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Briefly, the nucleotide sequence of the first 225 amino acids of the extracellular domain of the human EPOR (EBP) was cloned into plasmid pSAM3 that contains a synthetic pelB signal sequence. Expression of the EBP was under the control of the T7 promoter in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3-5 h at 37°C. The EBP protein was produced as insoluble protein localized to inclusion bodies. The EBP was recovered, solubilized, and refolded as described (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). The protein refolding process was monitored by high performance-size exclusion liquid chromatography (HP-SEC), and the active protein was detected by peak shift analysis through the addition of purified recombinant EPO. Mutant EBPs created by site-specific mutagenesis were expressed in E. coli and purified as described for the wild-type EBP (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Some mutant EBPs were purified by a modification of these methods in which the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step was replaced by a preparative high performance-size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) step. The purity of mutant and wild-type EBP was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical HP-SEC as described (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified mutant and wild-type EBP were estimated using the experimentally determined extinction coefficient for the wild-type EBP of 2.3 absorbance units per mg/ml at 280 nm (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). EBP mutants were assayed in the EBP-bead binding assay as described previously (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of EBP beads (wild-type EBP covalently attached to agarose beads) were added to tubes containing varying amounts of mutant EBP protein and 0.5 nM125I-EPO (DuPont NEN, approximately 100 μCi/μg). The reaction volume was increased to 0.5 ml with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% BSA, and the tubes were rocked gently at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 1.0-ml micro column (Isolab), and the trapped beads were washed 3 × with 1-ml washes of phosphate-buffered saline, 5.0% BSA. The columns, containing the EBP-bound 125I-EPO, were counted in a gamma counter (ICN Micromedic, Huntsville, AL). Random mutations were introduced into the EBP using the method of Cadwell and Joyce (17Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Google Scholar). The EBP DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under conditions that would increase incorrect base incorporation by Taq polymerase. EBP-specific PCR primers contained a SalI restriction site on the 5′ primer and a SpeI restriction site engineered within the 3′ primer. Plasmid pCOMB3 DNA (gift of C. Barbas, Scripps Research Institute) was cut with XhoI and SpeI. Due to an internal XhoI site in the EBP, the EBP-specific PCR primers contained a SalI restriction site which is compatible with XhoI. The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM dGTP, 0.2 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, 1 mM dTTP, plus 5 units of Taq polymerase per 100-μl reaction. Reaction cycle conditions were 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, for 25 cycles on a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer 9600). The resulting amplification product was cut with restriction enzymes and ligated into the vector pCOMB3 generating a fusion with the carboxyl-terminal half of the M13 geneIII protein (18Barbas III, CF. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Google Scholar). The DNA was then transformed into E. coli strain XL-1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In most cases site-specific mutants were generated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in which single primers adjacent to convenient restriction endonuclease sites were designed to include the specific desired mutation. Other mutants required the use of overlap PCR (19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar) to facilitate site-specific mutagenesis. All mutants were verified by DNA sequence analysis to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any unintentional mutations. Bacterial colonies containing the random EBP library were tested for 125I-EPO binding using a colony ligand blot assay. Transformed bacterial colonies were picked and grown on LB-amp plates at 37°C for 4 h. The plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters soaked in 5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and placed at 30°C overnight. The filters were removed from the plates and placed in a chloroform chamber for 15 min and subsequently incubated in lysozyme buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3% BSA, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 unit/ml DNase) for 1 h with shaking. The filters were incubated in 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 M urea for 45 min, followed by 45 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M urea. The filters were blocked for 1 h in 5% non-fat milk, 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Fresh, milk/BSA/TBS containing 125I-EPO (200-300 pM) was added, and the filters were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. The filters were washed 2 × for 5 min with milk/BSA/TBS, 2 × for 5 min with TBS, and then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Selected non-binding colonies were analyzed by PCR to verify the presence of the EBP insert. Clones carrying the insert were grown in liquid culture, induced for 3 h with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and analyzed by Western blot using anti-EBP antiserum. Selected non-binding clones confirmed to contain the EBP insert and produce a fusion protein of the expected size were grown for DNA purification and sequence analysis. COS cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1%L-glutamine, 1% penicillin, 0.1% streptomycin. Cells were seeded into 100-mm tissue culture dishes at approximately 1.0 × 106 cells per plate. The cells were transfected with the EPOR-containing plasmid (wt or mutant) using 10 μg of DNA/plate and DEAE-dextran (0.14 mg/ml) in DMEM minus fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated overnight at 37°C with the DNA mixture. Cells were then washed with DMEM-FCS and incubated in DMEM-FCS containing 100 μM chloroquine for 2.5 h at 37°C. The cells were washed with DMEM-FCS; fresh media were added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h prior to use in the EPO binding assay. Transfected COS cells were removed from the plates with dissociation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mM EDTA). Cells from duplicate plates were pooled, centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in binding buffer (RPMI 1640, 5% BSA, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.02% sodium azide) and counted. Binding assays were essentially as described (20Eder M. Griffin J.D. Ernst T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1647-1656Google Scholar). Briefly, tubes containing cells and varying concentrations of 125I-labeled EPO were incubated overnight at 4°C. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of at least 100-fold excess of unlabeled EPO. Following binding, the tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed; the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer, and the cell suspension was layered onto 0.7 ml of bovine calf serum. The tubes were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the bottom of the tubes were snipped off and counted in a gamma counter. The binding data were transformed using the method of Scatchard (21Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar) in order to determine binding affinities. Detection of EPOR on the surface of COS cells was performed using an anti-EBP monoclonal antibody in a modification of the receptor binding assay described above. This procedure for cell surface detection has been described previously (15Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Google Scholar). FDC-P1 cells, stably transfected with the human EPO receptor lacking the terminal 40 amino acids (FDC-P1tHER) and demonstrating EPO responsiveness, were used for inhibition of proliferation assays. Briefly, cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1.0 unit/ml recombinant human EPO. Cells were deprived of factor for 18 h and subsequently added to 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. Each well contained cells, 0.3 units/ml EPO, and the wt EBP or EBP mutants at various concentrations. Plates were incubated at 37°C for approximately 42 h, after which the cells were pulsed with 1.0 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) for 6 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters (GF/A) using a cell harvester (Tomtec), and the filters were counted in a scintillation counter (LKB Betaplate 1205). Previously, the EBP was expressed in E. coli, purified, and extensively characterized (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). The EBP is capable of binding EPO with low nM affinity and can be purified in mg quantities from laboratory scale fermentations, making it suitable for mutagenesis studies directed toward the elucidation of the EPO binding face of the EPOR. EBP residues were chosen for site-specific mutagenesis based on results of a random mutagenesis study or on their homologous locations to conserved and non-conserved residues reported to be involved in ligand binding in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family. Generally, our approach was to screen for mutations resulting in decreased EPO binding activity by testing crude preparations of the mutant EBPs in a high performance-size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) assay (16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Although not quantitative, the HP-SEC assay does not require purification of the mutant proteins, is quick and easy to perform, and is capable of identifying mutations resulting in large reductions in EPO binding (15Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Google Scholar, 16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). This assay was successful in identifying an EBP mutant with a 1,000-fold increased IC50 for EPO (15Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Google Scholar); however, it may not be sensitive enough to detect less dramatic effects on EPO binding, since an EBP mutant (L96A-EBP) with a 200-fold increased IC50 for EPO still showed EPO binding. Following HP-SEC analysis, selected mutant proteins were purified and analyzed in competition binding assays or expressed and characterized as full-length receptor on the surface of COS cells. Using this strategy, we have created over 40 single alanine substitution mutants in the extracellular domain of the EPOR. Most of these mutants were initially analyzed for EPO binding activity in the HP-SEC assay, and approximately half were purified and further characterized in the EBP-bead and/or inhibition of proliferation assays. To identify amino acid residues of the EBP involved in EPO binding, random mutagenesis was performed using a PCR mutagenesis method (17Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Google Scholar). Random mutants were evaluated for the ability to bind 125I-EPO in a colony ligand blot assay, and the expression of mutants that did not bind EPO was confirmed by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using anti-EBP antiserum. For random mutants exhibiting EBP expression but no EPO binding, DNA encoding the EBP was sequenced to determine the location(s) of the mutation(s). Two mutations (V196D and A198V), resulting in the loss of EPO binding as evaluated by colony ligand blot analysis, involved residues located in the F′β-strand of the EPOR (data not shown). The F′β-strand is a highly conserved region in receptors of the cytokine receptor family (Fig. 1, Ref. 3Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar). This amino acid conservation, along with the random mutagenesis results, led to the selection of this region for site-specific mutagenesis. Single alanine substitution mutants were made for all of the residues from Leu186 through Met200, located in the F′β-strand and in the loop between the E′ and F′β-strands (see Fig. 2). The mutant EBPs were expressed in E. coli, and crude preparations were tested for EPO binding in the HP-SEC assay. In this assay, EBP bound to EPO is detected as a peak with a shorter retention time than that of EBP alone (Fig. 3; Ref. 16Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee H.W. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). All of the mutants spanning Leu186 through Met200 exhibited a specific EPO-EBP-bound peak in this assay, indicating that they were all capable of binding EPO (data not shown) and suggesting that none of the single alanine substitution mutants results in a 1,000-fold or greater reduction in EPO binding.Fig. 2Amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of the human EPO receptor (EBP). The primary amino acid sequence of the EBP is shown with the boxed portions indicating the β-strands of the extracellular domain as determined by the crystal structure of the EBP with a peptide ligand (10Livnah O. Stura E. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Google Scholar). The β-strands are designated by the italicized letter above the box. Amino acid positions in bold indicate sites of alanine substitutions, with the exception of Trp209 and Trp212 which were mutated to Tyr and Phe, respectively. Residues that are underlined represent EBP mutants that we have reported previously (15Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S.

Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). The crude refold preparations were analyzed in the HP-SEC assay in the absence (solid tracing) and presence (dashed tracing) of EPO on day 1 and day 6 of the refold process. The active form of the protein is indicated (peak 2) in the wild-type day 1 panel. The relative elution times are indicated for active EBP, EPO, and the EBP-EPO complex in the wild-type EBP day 6 panel. The relative amount of wild-type EBP in the active peak (peak 2) increases over the 6-day refold period. The F55A- and Y57A-EBP exhibit very little protein in peak 2 at day 1 after refold. Following 6 days of refolding, the amount of protein in peak 2 is not significantly increased for these two mutants, suggesting that the F55A- and Y57A-EBP do not refold well.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess the effects of mutations in this region, the EPO binding activity of selected mutants at both conserved and non-conserved residues of the F′β-strand was further characterized. The R189A-, R197A-, and M200A-EBP mutants were purified and assayed for EPO binding in the EBP-bead assay. The R189A and R197A mutations resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in the IC50 value, whereas the M200A mutation had a greater effect on EPO binding, resulting in a 16-fold increase in the IC50 (Fig. 4A, Table I). Full-length EPORs containing the R189A, R197A F194A, V196A, or R199A mutations were expressed in COS cells and tested for the ability to bind 125I-EPO. These mutant receptors bound EPO with affinity values comparable to wild type (Table I). Cell surface expression levels of the R197A-EPOR and R199A-EPOR in COS cells were low (≈6,300 and 9,800 receptors per cell, respectively) compared with the wild-type EPOR (consistently ≈65,000 receptors per cell) or the R189A-, F194A-, and V196A-EPOR (65,250, 43,150, and 77,500 receptors per cell, respectively, data not shown).

AMP is an allosteric inhibitor, which binds to the regulatory sites and induces the R- to T-state transition; for wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase AMP inhibition is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 2.0. The replacement of Asp-187, which forms an interaction across the C1:C2 monomer-monomer interface, with alanine did not change the catalytic efficiency, and it had no effect on the cooperativity of AMP inhibition; however, the apparent dissociation constant for AMP increased more than 4-fold as compared to the value for the wild-type enzyme. The replacement of Glu-192, which forms interactions across the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface, with Ala and Gln lowered kcat from 21 s−1 for wild-type enzyme to 15 s−1 and 13 s−1, respectively, for the mutant enzymes, while their respective Km values were not changed. However, these replacements did have dramatic effects on AMP inhibition; first, cooperative AMP inhibition was lost; second, the AMP inhibition was biphasic, which can be interpreted as due to AMP binding to two classes of binding sites. The high affinity class of sites corresponds to the regulatory sites, while the low affinity class of sites may be the active sites. The results reported here, combined with the structural and kinetic results from the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme, strongly suggest that the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface, rather than the C1:C2 monomer-monomer interface, is critical for the propagation of the allosteric signal between the AMP sites on different subunits; in addition, cooperative AMP inhibition is essential for the enzyme to be fully inhibited by the binding of AMP to the allosteric site.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase, EC 3.1.3.11), 1The abbreviations used are: Fru-1,6-P2asefructose-1,6-bisphosphataseFru-1,6-P2fructose 1,6-bisphosphateFru-2,6-P2fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis (1Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1991; 11: 465-515Google Scholar), catalyzes the hydrolysis of the α anomer of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to α-D-fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate in the presence of divalent metal ions. Pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ase is an allosteric enzyme composed of four identical subunits, each with a molecular weight of 34,000 (2Williams M.K. Kantrowitz E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3080-3082Google Scholar). Although the enzyme is normally in the active R state, upon the binding of AMP it is transformed into the completely inactive T state. X-ray structural data for both the R- and T-states are available for pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ase. The AMP complexes (3Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Google Scholar) both in the absence and the presence of fructose 6-phosphate are identified as T-state structures, while those complexes with bound fructose 6-phosphate (4Ke H. Zhang Y.P. Liang J. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2989-2993Google Scholar) or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) (5Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Zhang Y.H.K. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2404-2408Google Scholar) are identified as R-state structures. The tertiary structure of each monomer is composed of two folding domains (Fig. 1), the AMP domain with the AMP binding site and the FBP domain containing the active site. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The activity of pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ase is negatively modulated by the allosteric inhibitor AMP and also by Fru-2,6-P2, which is a competitive inhibitor (6Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 45-82Google Scholar, 7Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. 1983; 54: 121-194Google Scholar). AMP binds to the allosteric site which is about 28 Å (3Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Google Scholar) from the active site and its inhibition is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2.0. The enzyme requires divalent metal ions, such as Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ to achieve catalytic activity (6Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 45-82Google Scholar). Magnesium activation is also cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 2.0. There are two metal binding sites on each monomer. One metal binding site is defined as a structural site which is thought to be essential for subsequent substrate binding, and the other is defined as a catalytic site, thought to be essential for catalysis. The metal binding sites are located at the interface between the two domains of the enzyme (8Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). During the transition from the R- to the T-state, the C1:C2 2The four subunits of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase are designated C1, C2, C3, and C4 and are labeled counter clockwise (see Fig. 1). The C1 and C2 subunits correspond to the upper dimer, and the C3 and C4 subunits correspond to the lower dimer. dimer rotates about 15° relative to the C3:C4 dimer, and within each monomer the AMP domain rotates about 1.9° and translates about 1.6 Å relative to the FBP domain. By comparing the T- and R-state structures, Lipscomb and co-workers (9Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Google Scholar) have proposed that, after the binding of AMP, the secondary structure of the AMP domain undergoes a series of rearrangements leading to a movement involving a relative rotation and translation of the AMP domain relative to the FBP domains. This movement disturbs the active site, which consists of a substrate binding region from the FBP domain and a metal binding region at the domain interface, in such a way that enzyme activity is inhibited. Inhibition is achieved by preventing coordinated binding of substrate and of one essential metal ion in the proper arrangement necessary for substrate hydrolysis. Despite progress made in explaining the allosteric mechanism, the mechanism of signal propagation between subunits during the allosteric transition remains unclear. Structural data for the wild-type enzyme have suggested that the 190's loop 3The 190's loop corresponds to residues 187-192 in the AMP domain. (Fig. 1) may play a crucial role for allosteric regulation between subunits during the R- to T-state transition. Previously, Lys-42, which interacts at the dimer-dimer interface with several residues on the 190's loop, such as Ile-190, Gly-191, and Glu-192 (9Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Google Scholar), was mutated to alanine (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). For the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme, AMP inhibition was no longer cooperative, even though the x-ray structure of this mutant enzyme showed no alterations at the AMP binding site; this result has demonstrated that the dimer-dimer interface is important for propagation of the AMP inhibition signal (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). In order to obtain more detailed information concerning the role of the 190's loop in the regulation of the allosteric transition within each subunit and also between subunits, site-specific mutagenesis has been performed on residue Glu-192, which forms hydrogen bonds at the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface, and on the residue Asp-187, which forms hydrogen bonds at the C1:C2 monomer-monomer interface. The mutant enzymes Glu-192 → Gln, Glu-192 → Ala, and Asp-187 → Ala were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the consequences of these mutations on the kinetic properties of the enzyme were investigated. Agar, agarose, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and magnesium chloride were purchased from Sigma. Tris and enzyme-grade ammonium sulfate were supplied by ICN Biomedicals. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco. The oligomers used to construct the Glu-192 → Ala and Glu-192 → Gln mutations and some of the DNA oligomers used as primers for DNA sequencing were synthesized by Operon Technologies. All the reagents needed for DNA sequencing were obtained from Amersham Corp. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T7 DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were either from Amersham or New England Biolabs, and used according to the supplier's recommendations. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels with the Geneclean II kit from Bio 101, Inc. The E. coli K12 strain MV1190 (Δ(lac-proAB), supE, thi, Δ(sri-recA) 306::Tn10(tetr)/F′ traD36, proAB, lacIq, lacZΔM15) and the M13 phage M13K07 were obtained from J. Messing. The strain CJ236 (dut-1, ung-1, thi-1, relA-1/pCJ105(Cmr)) was a gift of T. Kunkel, while EK1601 (tonA22, ompF627(T2R), relA1, pit-10, spoT1, Δ(fbp)287, λDE3) a derivative of DF657 (11Sedivy J.M. Daldal F. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 1048-1053Google Scholar) was constructed in this laboratory (12Giroux E. Williams M.K. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31404-31409Google Scholar). E. coli strain XL1-Blue MRF− (Δ(mcrA)183, Δ(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)172, endA1, supE44, thi-1, recA, gyrA96, relA1, lac, λ−/F′ proAB, lacIq, lacZΔM15, Tn10(tetr)] was from Stragene (La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotide used to construct the Asp-187 → Ala mutation and some of the primers required for DNA sequencing were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography employing a DuPont Zorbax Oligo ion-exchange column. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed on the Fru-1,6-P2ase cDNA harbored on plasmid pEK284, employing the method of Kunkel (13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar, 14Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). Uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was obtained by infection of E. coli strain CJ236 containing pEK284 with the helper phage M13KO7 (15Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Google Scholar). Potential mutant candidates were initially identified by DNA sequence analysis (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The entire cDNA of Fru-1,6-P2ase of one candidate was sequenced to ensure that the site-specific mutagenesis had not introduced additional mutations other than the desired changes. The resultant plasmids, pEK295, pEK372, and pEK373 contained only the mutation at the codons corresponding to the Asp-187 → Ala, the Glu-192 → Ala, and the Glu-192 → Gln mutations, respectively. In order to express the wild-type and mutant pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ases, the corresponding phagemids were transformed into E. coli strain EK1601. E. coli strain EK1601 has a deletion in the chromosomal fbp gene and can be induced to produce T7 RNA polymerase (12Giroux E. Williams M.K. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31404-31409Google Scholar). In this manner the pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ase expressed from the plasmid could not be contaminated with the E. coli Fru-1,6-P2ase expressed from the chromosome. Bacteria were cultured with vigorous agitation at 37°C in M9 medium supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids and ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. Induction of T7 RNA polymerase was initiated by addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). After further cultivation for 16-22 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and broken open by a freeze-thaw procedure (17El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 137-144Google Scholar). Purification of mutant enzyme was accomplished by the method previously described (12Giroux E. Williams M.K. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31404-31409Google Scholar). A spectrophotometric, coupled-enzyme assay was employed to measure Fru-1,6-P2ase activity (18Riou J.-P. Claus T.H. Flockhart D.A. Corbin J.D. Pilkis S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4615-4619Google Scholar). Standard conditions (2 mM magnesium chloride) were used to determine specific activity. Digital absorbance values were collected and fit to a straight line by computer, using data beyond the coupling lag period. In all assays, the enzyme was added last, after incubation and thermal equilibration of the coupling enzymes, magnesium (and inhibitor) components. One unit of enzyme activity causes the reduction of 1 μmol of NADP/min at 30°C. Methods used to determine the kinetic model parameters were described previously (19Lu G. Williams M.K. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13272-13277Google Scholar). The AMP inhibition curves of the Glu-192 → Ala and Glu-192 → Gln Fru-1,6-P2ase were biphasic and therefore had to be analyzed differently from the data for the wild-type enzyme. The data for both phases of the curve did not exhibit cooperativity and therefore could be fit by the sum of two hyperbolic functions (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). Multiple determinations of initial rates of catalysis at a specific set of component concentrations provided measures of assay precision. Weighted mean data were used. Concentrations of the wild-type and all the mutant enzymes were determined using the Lowry-Peterson method (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.J. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar, 21Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to judge enzyme homogeneity (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 and NADP were checked by performance in the coupled assay, of AMP using 15.4 as the millimolar extinction coefficient at pH 7.0 and 259 nm, and of Fru-2,6-P2 by partial acid hydrolysis and analysis of fructose 6-phosphate (23Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis J. Claus T. Cumming D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3171-3174Google Scholar). The kinetic data for wild-type and the three mutant enzymes are summarized in Table TI. For each enzyme, the substrate saturation curve is hyperbolic with inhibition exhibited at high substrate concentrations. Analysis of the kinetic data was performed by using a nonlinear least squares method incorporating a term for substrate inhibition. The Asp-187 → Ala enzyme (Fig. 2) had the same kcat as the wild-type enzyme; however, the Km for this enzyme (0.7 μM) was slightly lower than the corresponding value for the wild-type enzyme (1.4 μM). Both the Glu-192 → Ala and the Glu-192 → Gln enzymes (Fig. 2) have lower kcat values, 15 s−1 and 13 s−1, respectively, compared to 21 s−1 for the wild-type enzyme. However, the Km values of the mutant enzymes were close to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table TI).Table I.Kinetic parameters for the wild-type and the mutant enzymesEnzymekcatKm, Fru-1,6-P2[Mg2+]0.5aThe concentration of Mg2+ required to activate the enzyme half of the maximal extent.Hill coefficient (Mg2+)KappbThe apparent dissociation constant of AMP for the single class of sites on the wild-type and the Asp-187 → Ala Fru-1,6-P2ase, or to the high and low affinity binding sites on the mutant enzymes.

Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 45-82Google Scholar). For wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase, the concentration of Mg2+ needed to activate the enzyme to half its maximum activity is 0.34 mM; however, the corresponding values for mutant enzymes were 0.95 mM, 1.16 mM and 0.49 mM for the Glu-192 → Ala, Glu-192 → Gln, and Asp-187 → Ala enzymes, respectively. There were also slight differences in the values of the Hill coefficients between the wild-type and the mutant enzymes. The Hill coefficient of wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase was 1.8 ± 0.5; however, the corresponding values for the mutant enzymes were 1.4 ± 0.1, 1.4 ± 0.1, and 1.7 ± 0.1 for the Asp-187 → Ala, Glu-192 → Ala, and Glu-192 → Gln enzymes, respectively (Table TI). The lower Hill coefficients indicate that the magnesium activation for the mutant enzymes were not as cooperative as it was for the wild-type enzyme. For the wild-type enzyme, Fru-2,6-P2 is a competitive inhibitor of the substrate (24Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis J. Claus T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Google Scholar), and all the mutant enzymes investigated here showed the same characteristic. The Ki value for wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase was 0.065 μM, which is very close to the value determined for the Glu-192 → Ala enzyme (Ki = 0.064 μM) and the Glu-192 → Gln enzyme (Ki = 0.059 μM). However, the Ki for the Asp-187 → Ala enzyme (0.11 μM), was slightly higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. AMP is an allosteric inhibitor for pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ase, and it binds to an allosteric site, about 28 Å distant from the substrate binding site (3Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Google Scholar). For wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase, AMP inhibition is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of approximately 2 and a dissociation constant of 2.8 μM. For the Asp 187 → Ala enzyme (see Fig. 4), AMP inhibition was still cooperative with the same Hill coefficient as that of the wild-type enzyme. However, the dissociation constant was 13.4 μM, which is about 4-fold higher than the corresponding value for the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the Asp-187 → Ala enzyme, AMP inhibition was altered drastically for the Glu 192 → Gln and the Glu-192 → Ala enzymes (see Fig. 4). First, AMP inhibition was not cooperative for either of these mutant enzymes. Second, the inhibition was biphasic and the enzymes could only be fully inhibited at high concentrations of AMP. Thus, both the high and low affinity sites must be saturated in order for complete inhibition to be obtained. The high affinity binding sites could be saturated at approximately 200 μM of AMP, resulting in 90% inhibition of the Glu-192 → Ala enzyme. The AMP dissociation constant for the high affinity sites was 1.6 μM; however, the corresponding value for the low affinity sites could not be determined accurately due partially to the fact that the remaining activity of this phase was very low. The Glu-192 → Gln enzyme also exhibited biphasic AMP inhibition; however, saturation of the high affinity binding sites resulted only in 40% inhibition, as compared with 90% for the Glu-192 → Ala enzyme. Moreover, the dissociation constant of the high affinity sites was 19 μM, which was about 10-fold higher than the corresponding value for the Glu-192 → Ala enzyme, while the dissociation constant for the low affinity binding sites was 14 mM. Based on the x-ray structures of wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase (3Ke H. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5243-5247Google Scholar, 4Ke H. Zhang Y.P. Liang J. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2989-2993Google Scholar) and previous kinetic and x-ray crystal structure studies of the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar), we speculated that the 190's loop (C1), which is located at the central part of the tetramer and forms multiple interactions with Lys-42 (C4), may be important for signal transduction across the interfaces during the R- to T-state transition (9Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Google Scholar). Both residues 187 and 192 from the 190's loop form interface interactions with residues from the neighboring subunits (Fig. 3). Therefore, in order to elucidate the role of the 190's loop in allosteric regulation, three mutant enzymes, the Glu-192 → Ala, the Glu-192 → Gln and the Asp-187 → Ala enzymes were generated and their kinetic characteristics were determined. In the structure of the wild-type enzyme, the side chain carboxyl group of Asp-187 (C1) forms hydrogen bonds across the C1:C2 monomer-monomer interface (9Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Google Scholar); the side chain of Glu-192 (C1) forms hydrogen bonds with Thr-39 (C4) and Lys-42 (C4) across the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface in both the R- and T-states (see Fig. 3). Since the 190's loop is about 30 Å distant from the substrate binding site, only minor effects on the activity were anticipated by these amino acid substitutions. For all three mutant enzymes presented here, kcat and Km values were close to the corresponding values for the wild-type enzyme. In addition, none of the mutations significantly altered the Ki value for the competitive inhibitor Fru-2,6-P2. In fact, the Ki values for the Glu-192 → Ala and Glu-192 → Gln enzymes are almost identical to those of the wild-type enzyme. These results are consistent with the proposal that the active site is not altered by mutations at the 190's loop. Based on a comparison of the wild-type R- and T-state structural data, Zhang et al. (9Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Google Scholar) found that AMP domains have extensive interactions with each other across the interfaces. They also found that during the R- to T-state transition almost all the secondary structural changes occur within the AMP domain. These authors proposed that small initial changes at any one of the AMP domains could be quickly and efficiently transmitted to neighboring AMP domains (9Zhang Y. Liang J. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Google Scholar). However, the pathway for intersubunit signal transduction, whether it be through the C1:C2 monomer-monomer interface and or the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface cannot be determined by merely evaluating the structural data for the wild-type enzyme. By combining the structural data from the wild-type enzyme with functional data obtained from mutant enzymes, it is possible to shed light on the mechanism of signal transduction in pig kidney Fru-1,6-P2ase. For the Asp-187 → Ala enzyme, AMP inhibition is cooperative (Fig. 4), although the enzyme is about 4-fold less sensitive to AMP than the wild-type enzyme. For the Glu-192 → Ala and the Glu-192 → Gln enzymes (Fig. 4), AMP inhibition was altered more significantly. First, for these two enzymes AMP inhibition was no longer cooperative, and second, AMP inhibition was biphasic as has been seen previously for the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). The two residues mutated in this work participate in different intersubunit interactions. Asp-187 forms interface interactions exclusively at the C1:C2 monomer-monomer interface, whereas Glu-192 forms interactions only across the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface. The Asp-187 → Ala mutation had no effect on the cooperativity associated with AMP inhibition, while the two mutations at Glu-192 abolished the cooperativity associated with AMP inhibition. Previously, Lys-42 (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar), which forms hydrogen bonds across the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface with residues on the 190's loop including 192, was mutated to Ala, and the resulting mutant enzyme also lost cooperativity associated with AMP inhibition. Grazi et al. (25Grazi E. Magri E. Traniello S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1321-1325Google Scholar) studied the kinetic properties of matrix-bound Fru-1,6-P2ases. They found that the matrix-bound tetramer retained most of the catalytic activity but became half-desensitized to AMP. The matrix-bound dimer possessed half the specific activity of the tetramer; however, it was almost completely desensitized to AMP. All these results strongly suggest that signal transduction between the AMP binding sites of Fru-1,6-P2ase occurs mostly via a pathway involving Glu-192 and Lys-42 across the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface, rather than a pathway across the C1:C2 interface. For the Glu-192 → Ala and Glu-192 → Gln enzymes, in addition to the loss of cooperativity associated with AMP inhibition, the AMP inhibition was found to be biphasic, as was previously observed for the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the high affinity binding sites of the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme was 18 μM, and the corresponding value for the low affinity binding sites was 11 mM. At a concentration of less than 100 μM AMP, which would be adequate to saturate only the high affinity sites, a T-state crystal of the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme was obtained and its structure determined (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). Analysis of the x-ray structural data indicated that all the AMP sites were fully occupied. Furthermore, the structure of the Lys-42 → Ala enzyme showed clearly that the allosteric site was not altered by the mutation (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar). Additionally, Lipscomb and co-workers (5Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Zhang Y.H.K. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2404-2408Google Scholar) were able to crystallize the wild-type enzyme in the R state, with the competitive inhibitor Fru-2,6-P2 and one of the products fructose 6-phosphate (4Ke H. Zhang Y.P. Liang J. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2989-2993Google Scholar) bound to the allosteric site, which suggests that comparable binding of AMP to the active site at high concentrations might be possible. Lu et al. (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar) concluded that the high affinity binding sites were associated with the binding of AMP to the regulatory sites, while the low affinity sites were associated with the binding of AMP to the active sites. However, for wild-type enzyme the binding of AMP at the active site cannot be detected by standard activity measurements because the enzyme is completely inactivated at concentrations of AMP that would not be sufficient to bind significantly to the active sites. For the Glu-192 → Ala and Glu-192 → Gln enzymes, AMP binding at the allosteric sites cannot completely inactivate the enzyme. Only by binding of AMP at both the high and low affinity sites can these mutant enzymes be completely inhibited. As shown in Fig. 4, even though the apparent AMP dissociation constant of the Glu-192 → Ala enzyme for the allosteric sites is about half the value for the wild-type enzyme, activity could not be fully inhibited by saturating the high affinity allosteric sites. The corresponding value for the Asp-187 → Ala enzyme is more than four-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme; however, it could be fully inhibited by binding of AMP to the allosteric site and it retained the cooperativity associated with AMP inhibition. Previously, kinetic studies on the Arg-22 → Ala enzyme (19Lu G. Williams M.K. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13272-13277Google Scholar) have shown that although this mutant enzyme's apparent dissociation constant is about 10-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme, AMP inhibition is still cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 2. Furthermore, the mutant enzyme could be completely inhibited by saturating the allosteric sites with AMP. All these results strongly support the notion that cooperativity is required for complete inactivation of Fru-1,6-P2ase by the binding of AMP to the allosteric sites. AMP inhibition of the Glu-192 → Gln and the Lys 42 → Ala enzymes is so similar that their inhibition curves are almost superimposable (Fig. 5), which suggests that these two mutations had almost the same effects on the allosteric regulation between the allosteric and the metal binding sites. However, the replacement of Glu-192 by Ala or Gln results in two mutant enzymes that are almost identical kinetically, except for their inhibition by AMP. Besides the approximate 10-fold difference between their apparent AMP dissociation constants for the allosteric site, the extend of inhibition is about 90% for Glu-192 → Ala enzyme whereas it is about 40% for the Glu-192 → Gln enzyme. These mutations would alter the hydrogen bond interaction between Glu-192 (C1) and Lys-42 (C4), which is important not only for allosteric regulation between the AMP binding sites across the dimer-dimer interface, but also for signal transduction between the AMP binding site and the metal binding sites within each subunit. In addition, because of the differences in their side chains, these mutations would have different affects on the charge neutralization of the two closely spaced Lys-42 residues. In this manner, the signal transduction pathway connecting the AMP binding site and the metal binding sites is interrupted differently in the Glu-192 → Ala and Glu-192 → Gln enzymes. It is important to maintain the distinction between cooperative and allosteric phenomena, while recognizing that they are often found together (26Ricard J. Cornish-Bowden A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 255-272Google Scholar). By definition, allostery allows one kind of small molecule to regulate the action of a protein on another kind of molecule. For the Glu-192 → Ala and the Glu-192 → Gln enzymes, even though AMP no longer inhibits cooperatively, within each subunit the AMP binding site can still communicate with the metal binding sites, and for this reason AMP can still inhibit the enzyme. However, the mutations at Glu-192 do affect the communication pathways in such a way that the binding of AMP at the allosteric site cannot completely inhibit these mutant enzymes. Thus, the enzyme requires cooperative AMP inhibition in order to achieve the full regulation effect between the allosteric site and the metal cation binding sites. x-ray crystallographic structural data for wild-type Fru-1,6-P2ase showed that there are two metal binding sites in each monomer (8Villeret V. Huang S. Zhang Y. Lipscomb W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4307-4315Google Scholar), which are located between the FBP and the AMP domains (Fig. 1). Direct binding (27Pontremoli S. Sparatore B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 481-485Google Scholar, 28Benkovic P.A. Frey W.A. Benkovic S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 719-726Google Scholar) and steady-state kinetic studies (6Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 45-82Google Scholar) have established the sequence of binding of metal cations and the substrate in the order: structural metal cation, substrate, then catalytic metal cation. All three mutant enzymes presented here exhibit dramatic altered AMP inhibition, but are also less sensitive to magnesium activation, for which their Hill coefficients are decreased from 2 for wild-type enzyme to around 1.5 for these mutant enzymes. The alteration of residue 187 and 192 might cause a small local structural reorientation of the 190's loop, which would result in the observed changes in the magnesium activation of the mutant enzymes. The mechanism of allosteric regulation between the magnesium sites has been studied before. Direct binding studies (28Benkovic P.A. Frey W.A. Benkovic S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 719-726Google Scholar) showed that after the binding of four structural metal ions per tetramer, 2 moles of ligand result in the binding of 4 catalytic metal ions, suggesting a positive cooperative interaction between sites on different subunits. Nevertheless, since within each subunit the structural metal binding site must be occupied before the second metal cation can bind to the catalytic site (6Benkovic S.J. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1982; 53: 45-82Google Scholar), intrasubunit cooperativity cannot be ruled out. The results presented here, combined with the previous kinetic and structural results from Lys-42 → Ala enzyme (10Lu G. Stec B. Giroux E.L. Kantrowitz E.R. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Google Scholar), strongly suggest that the signal transduction pathway between the AMP binding sites takes place across the C1:C4 dimer-dimer interface, mediated by residues of the 190's loop. Furthermore, cooperative AMP inhibition is required in order to achieve full communication between the allosteric and the metal binding sites in fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase."
