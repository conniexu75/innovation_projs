https://openalex.org/W3006831735,"Ultrafast vortex microlasers For applications in ultrafast communication, all-optical switches will require low energy consumption, high speed, a strong modulation ratio, a small footprint, and on-chip integration. Although the small footprint and on-chip integration are accessible, the trade-off between low energy consumption and high speed has been challenging. Huang et al. exploited the idea of bound states in the continuum, effectively a high–quality ( Q ) cavity without the physical cavity, to design vortex lasers with highly directional output and single-mode operation. With the trade-off between low energy consumption and high speed now broken, it should be possible to realize ultrafast optical switching that meets all the requirements of modern classic and quantum information.

Constantin et al. now show that these aminoalkyl radicals can, in turn, conveniently strip iodine atoms from a variety of alkyl carbons. The new alkyl radicals that result readily undergo deuteration and couplings such as alkylation, allylation, and olefination. The upshot is that simple amines can replace more hazardous conventional reagents such as trialkyltin compounds in the homolytic activation and functionalization of halocarbons.

Starting with the observation that offspring of germ-free mice tended to become obese on high-fat diets, Kimura et al. investigated how the presence of the microbiota might be protective in mice (see the Perspective by Ferguson). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from the microbiota are known to suppress insulin signaling and reduce fat deposition in adipocytes. Further experiments showed that SCFAs in the bloodstream were able to pass from a non–germ-free mother's gut microbiota across the placenta and into the developing embryos. The authors found that in the embryos, the SCFA propionate mediates not only insulin levels through GPR43 signaling but also sympathetic nervous system development through GPR41 signaling. A high-fiber diet promoted propionate production from the maternal microbiota, and maternal antibiotic treatment resulted in obese-prone offspring. Science , this issue p. eaaw8429 ; see also p. 978"

Such complex cell shapes, in plants, were generally thought to be driven by turgor pressure. Haas et al. now show that the extracellular cell wall can actively shape the cell it contains without relying on turgor pressure. Nanofilaments of pectin homogalacturonan in the cell wall shift between crystalline and anisotropic phases according to whether they are methylated. The shift in form drives changes in cell wall shape that stand independent of turgor pressure. Science , this issue p. 1003"

However, for a lithium titanate (Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ) anode, the lithium ions interact with two phases and the diffusion is slow in both, but it still shows high-rate capabilities. Zhang et al. used electron energy-loss spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations to probe the anomalous behavior. They found that a diffuse interface forms between the starting and ending compositions, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 and Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 , and this is what allows the lithium ions to travel quickly.

https://openalex.org/W3008163265,"Background Switzerland, like other high-income countries, is facing a major public health challenge with the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Discussions are currently on-going in Switzerland regarding the implementation of a Front-of-Pack nutrition label (FoPL) as a public health measure to guide consumers towards healthier food choices, and the Nutri-Score represents an alternative supported by multiple actors. To date, no studies have investigated the performance of the Nutri-Score among Swiss consumers. This study aimed to compare the response of Swiss consumers to five FoPLs (Health Star Rating system, Multiple Traffic Lights, Nutri-Score, Reference Intakes and Warning symbol) in terms of perception and understanding of these labels and effects on food choices. Methods In 2019, 1,088 Swiss consumers were recruited and asked to select one product from among a set of three foods with different nutritional profiles and then classify the products within the sets according to their nutritional quality. Tasks were performed in situations without a label and then with one of the five FoPLs–depending on the group in which they were randomized–on the pack. Finally, participants were questioned on their perceptions regarding the label to which they were exposed. Results All FoPLs were favorably perceived, with marginal differences between FoPLs. The Nutri-Score demonstrated the highest percentage of improvement in food choices and the highest overall performance in helping consumers rank the products according to their nutritional quality. Conclusion Overall, the Nutri-Score was the most efficient FoPL in informing Swiss consumers of the nutritional quality of food products, and as such could be a useful tool to improve food choices and reduce the burden of chronic diseases in Switzerland."

Comprehensive assessments of their cellular interactions with bioactive compounds, particularly in a kinetic format, are imperative to the development of drugs with improved efficacy. Hence, we developed complementary cellular assays that enable equilibrium and real-time analyses of GPCR ligand engagement and consequent activation, measured as receptor internalization. These assays utilize GPCRs genetically fused to an N-terminal HiBiT peptide (1.3 kDa), which produces bright luminescence upon high-affinity complementation with LgBiT, an 18-kDa subunit derived from NanoLuc. The cell impermeability of LgBiT limits signal detection to the cell surface and enables measurements of ligand-induced internalization through changes in cell-surface receptor density. In addition, bioluminescent resonance energy transfer is used to quantify dynamic interactions between ligands and their cognate HiBiT-tagged GPCRs through competitive binding with fluorescent tracers. The sensitivity and dynamic range of these assays benefit from the specificity of bioluminescent resonance energy transfer and the high signal intensity of HiBiT/LgBiT without background luminescence from receptors present in intracellular compartments. These features allow analyses of challenging interactions having low selectivity or affinity and enable studies using endogenously tagged receptors. Using the β-adrenergic receptor family as a model, we demonstrate the versatility of these assays by utilizing the same HiBiT construct in analyses of multiple aspects of GPCR pharmacology. We anticipate that this combination of target engagement and proximal functional readout will prove useful to the study of other GPCR families and the development of new therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W3007715244,"Profiling skin microbiome and metabolome has been utilised to gain further insight into wound healing processes. The aims of this multi-part temporal study in 11 volunteers were to analytically profile the dynamic wound tissue and headspace metabolome and sequence microbial communities in acute wound healing at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28, and to investigate their relationship to wound healing, using non-invasive quantitative devices. Metabolites were obtained using tissue extraction, sorbent and polydimethylsiloxane patches and analysed using GCMS. PCA of wound tissue metabolome clearly separated time points with 10 metabolites of 346 being involved in separation. Analysis of variance-simultaneous component analysis identified a statistical difference between the wound headspace metabolome, sites (P = 0.0024) and time points (P<0.0001), with 10 out of the 129 metabolites measured involved with this separation between sites and time points. A reciprocal relationship between Staphylococcus spp. and Propionibacterium spp. was observed at day 21 (P<0.05) with a statistical correlation between collagen and Propionibacterium (r = 0.417; P = 0.038) and Staphylococcus (r = -0.434; P = 0.03). Procrustes analysis showed a statistically significant similarity between wound headspace and tissue metabolome with non-invasive wound devices. This exploratory study demonstrates the temporal and dynamic nature of acute wound metabolome and microbiome presenting a novel class of biomarkers that correspond to wound healing, with further confirmatory studies now necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3008090583,"Resisting extinction Prevailing evolutionary wisdom tells us that ecological differentiation leads to speciation. Whether this pattern can be seen over paleontological time, however, has been difficult to test. Knope et al. looked at a dataset of thousands of modern and extinct marine groups and found the relationship to be more complex than expected. Ecological diversification is associated with lower rates of origination, and the taxonomical richness seemingly associated with these groups is due to resistance to extinction. Furthermore, the researchers found that the strong association between ecological differentiation and taxonomic diversity is a recent development shaped by extinction events over time.

https://openalex.org/W3007003209,"Background Schistosomiasis is one of the most neglected tropical parasitic disease which is common in Ethiopia. It is disease of rural areas for decades but now days there are reports of schistosomiasis from urban settings. Therefore, this study aimed to determine epidemiology of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection and associated determinant factors among school children attending primary schools nearby rivers in Jimma town, an urban setting, southwest Ethiopia. Methodology A cross sectional study was conducted among 328 school children aged between 7–17 years in selected primary schools nearby rivers in Jimma town from March to April 2017. For the diagnosis of S. mansoni, a single stool sample was obtained from each child and processed using double Kato Katz thick smear for quantification of S. mansoni ova examined using light microscope. A questionnaire was used to collect socio demographic data and associated determinant factors for S. mansoni infection. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Variables with P-value < 0.05 were significantly associated with S. mansoni infection. Results The overall prevalence of S. mansoni infection was found to be 28.7%. Majority of infection intensities were categorized as light with maximum egg per gram of stool (epg) was 1728. The geometric mean of infection intensity was 102.3epg. Schools distance from river (p = 0.001), swimming habit in rivers (p = 0.001) and crossing river on bare foot (p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for S. mansoni infection. Conclusions The study revealed S. mansoni infection is prevalent in Jimma town. The school children were at moderate risk of morbidity caused by S. mansoni (prevalence ≥ 10% and < 50% according to WHO threshold), hence a biannual mass drug administration with praziquantel is required once every two years in the study area and promote health information on prevention, control, transmission and risk factors for S. mansoni infection."

Despite its biomedical significance, studies on AspH have long been limited by a lack of assays for its isolated form. Recent structural work has revealed that AspH accepts substrates with a noncanonical EGFD disulfide connectivity (i.e. the Cys 1–2, 3–4, 5–6 disulfide pattern). We developed stable cyclic thioether analogues of the noncanonical EGFD AspH substrates to avoid disulfide shuffling. We monitored their hydroxylation by solid-phase extraction coupled to MS. The extent of recombinant AspH-catalyzed cyclic peptide hydroxylation appears to reflect levels of EGFD hydroxylation observed in vivo, which vary considerably. We applied the assay to determine the kinetic parameters of human AspH with respect to 2OG, Fe(II), l-ascorbic acid, and substrate and found that these parameters are in the typical ranges for 2OG oxygenases. Of note, a relatively high Km for O2 suggested that O2 availability may regulate AspH activity in a biologically relevant manner. We anticipate that the assay will enable the development of selective small-molecule inhibitors for AspH and other human 2OG oxygenases.

https://openalex.org/W3007191415,"Monocytes are rapidly recruited to sites of diabetic complications and differentiate into macrophages. Previously, we showed that rat kidney mesangial cells dividing during hyperglycemic stress abnormally synthesize hyaluronan (HA) in intracellular compartments. This initiates a stress response, resulting in an extracellular HA matrix after division that recruits inflammatory cells. Cell–cell communication among macrophages that are recruited into the glomeruli and the damaged rat mesangial cells leads to diabetic nephropathy, fibrosis, and proteinurea, which are inhibited in heparin-treated diabetic rats. In this study, we found that murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) and a human leukemic cell line, U937 cells, dividing in hyperglycemia also accumulate intracellular HA and that heparin inhibits the HA accumulation. Both cell types expressed increased levels of proinflammatory markers: inducible nitric-oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-α, when cultured under hyperglycemic stress, which was inhibited by heparin. Furthermore, the abnormal intracellular HA was also observed in peripheral blood monocytes derived from three different hyperglycemic diabetic mouse models: streptozotocin-treated, high-fat fed, and Ins2Akita. Moreover, peripheral blood monocytes in humans with type 2 diabetes and poorly controlled blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of >7) also had intracellular HA, whereas those with HbA1c of <7, did not. Of note, heparin increased the anti-inflammatory markers arginase 1 and interleukin-10 in murine BMDMs. We conclude that heparin treatment of high glucose–exposed dividing BMDMs promotes an anti-inflammatory tissue-repair phenotype in these cells.

By week 6, kidney glomeruli have an extensive HA matrix around the RMCs with embedded recruited macrophages that are unable to remove the HA matrix effectively. The dialogue between the macrophages and the damaged RMCs initiates inflammatory and fibrotic responses that lead to diabetic nephropathy and proteinurea caused by tissue damage and loss of function. In contrast, RMCs in diabetic rats, injected intraperitoneally daily with a very low dose of heparin, do not synthesize HA in intracellular compartments nor undergo autophagy. Instead they synthesize an extensive monocyte-adhesive extracellular HA matrix after completing division that is present within 1 week. By week 6, kidney glomeruli in the uncontrolled diabetic rats treated with heparin have much less HA because of the influx of macrophages that effectively remove the HA matrix without initiating inflammatory and fibrotic responses. This allows the RMCs to maintain glomerular function while still synthesizing an extracellular monocyte-adhesive HA matrix in response to hyperglycemia (1Wang A. Ren J. Wang C.P. Hascall V.C.

Mtr macrophages, on the other hand, have a high phagocytic capacity, can mitigate inflammatory responses, and can promote wound healing and tissue remodeling (7Mills C.D. M1 and M2 Macrophages: oracles of health and disease.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 32 (23428224): 463-48810.1615/CritRevImmunol.v32.i6.10Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 8Italiani P.

Based on that and our previous findings, we propose that monocytes and bone marrow–derived macrophages during uncontrolled high levels of glucose accumulate intracellular HA and are of a proinflammatory phenotype, whereas those treated with heparin are of a tissue repair phenotype, are anti-inflammatory, and do not accumulate intracellular HA. This provides a likely mechanism for the inability of macrophages to effectively remove the deposited HA matrix in kidneys from uncontrolled STZ diabetic rats compared with those treated with heparin. Mpi/Mtr macrophages are most commonly distinguished based on their catabolism of l-arginine and Th1/Th2 cytokine production (9Mills C.D. Kincaid K. Alt J.M. Heilman M.J. Hill A.M.

Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that hyperglycemia (5× normal glucose) induced the relative gene expression of proinflammatory markers iNOS and TNFα in dividing U937 cells, whereas a low concentration (2 μg/ml) of heparin inhibited the expression of those markers. No significant difference was observed for the relative gene expression of anti-inflammatory ARG1 and IL-10 in any of the treatments.

However, the presence of heparin in the medium maintained a uniform distribution of CD44 on the cell surface of hyperglycemic stressed U937 cells (Fig. 2H) that is comparable with those cultured in normoglycemia with or without heparin (Fig. 2, E and F). We have previously shown that heparin prevents the synthesis of intracellular HA in dividing mesangial cells under hyperglycemic stress in vivo as well as in vitro. Instead a more extensive HA is extruded outside the cells as part of their extracellular matrix (1Wang A. Ren J. Wang C.P. Hascall V.C.

Heparin has a similar effect on dividing U937 cells as shown in Fig. 3 (A–D). Cell surface–associated HA is increased under hyperglycemic stress (Fig. 3C, green), and a more extensive HA matrix is formed on those cells treated with heparin under hyperglycemic stress (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, U937 cells have small amounts of HA on their cell surface in normoglycemia (Fig. 3A). This HA is likely being synthesized by the HA synthases in the plasma membrane, which release the completed HA into the medium. This is supported by the results in Fig. 4. Heparin had no apparent increase in the amounts of HA on the U937 cell surface in normoglycemia (Fig. 3B).Figure 4U937 cells synthesize HA that is mostly released into the culture media. The bar graphs show the amounts of HA determined by FACE in the cellular and medium compartments of U937 cells after 48 h of treatment under normoglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions with or without heparin. In all culture conditions, U937 cells synthesize equivalent amounts of HA that are released into the culture media (Media). The values of HA associated with U937 cells (Cells) cultured during hyperglycemia with and without heparin are statistically greater (p < 0.01) than those cultured during normoglycemia with or without heparin (n = 6). The amounts in the media are much more than the amounts associated with the cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Measurements of HA in the media show that U937 cells in all four conditions secrete most of their synthesized HA into the medium, showing that HA synthesis continues during division in normal glucose with or without heparin (Fig. 4, Media), unlike mesangial cells (1Wang A.

Further, the amounts of HA in the media were equivalent independent of glucose content and the presence of heparin (Fig. 4). As supported by Fig. 3, the cell matrix HA in the hyperglycemic cultures with or without heparin were significantly increased relative to the results in normoglycemia (Fig. 4, Cells). To investigate the effect of heparin on murine macrophages, BMDMs derived from their femur and tibia bones were cultured in high-glucose medium with or without heparin to compare with those cultured in normal glucose medium. Dividing hyperglycemic monocyte progenitor cells differentiated into macrophages that expressed higher levels of proinflammatory markers including iNOS (Fig. 5A) and TNFα (Fig. 5B) than in normoglycemia with or without heparin. Heparin inhibited the relative expression of these proinflammatory markers and instead promoted the relative gene expression of anti-inflammatory markers including ARG1 (Fig. 5A) and IL-10 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, heparin decreased the protein levels of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8), a proinflammatory transcription factor (18Bhattacharjee A. Shukla M. Yakubenko V.P. Mulya A. Kundu S. Cathcart M.K. IL-4 and IL-13 employ discrete signaling pathways for target gene expression in alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages.Free Radic. Biol.

Heparin had no significant effects on macrophage polarization in normoglycemia (Fig. 5). Similar to U937 cells, there is intracellular HA in dividing BMDMs when cultured under hyperglycemic stress (Fig. 6C, green) compared with those cultured in normoglycemia (Fig. 6A). The addition of heparin prevented the intracellular HA in BMDMs cultured under hyperglycemic stress (Fig. 6D). Heparin had no significant effect on BMDMs cultured in normal glucose levels (Fig. 6B). F4/80, a murine macrophage marker, was stained in red (Fig. 6, E–H). Similar to U937 cells, BMDMs synthesize HA on their cell surface in normoglycemia (Fig. 7A, green). There is an increased synthesis of HA on BMDM cell surfaces when cultured under hyperglycemic stress (Fig. 7C) that is more extensive when treated with heparin (Fig. 7D). Heparin treatment did not significantly increase HA synthesis on BMDMs that were cultured in normoglycemia (Fig. 7B). F4/80, a murine macrophage marker, stained in red, showed the predominance of macrophages in the cultures (Fig. 7, E–H). Similar to U937 cells, BMDMs synthesize and secrete most of their HA in all conditions (Fig. 8, Media), and they have cell surface HA when cultured in normal glucose levels that is significantly increased in the hyperglycemic cultures with or without heparin (Fig. 8, Cells).

Circulating monocytes from high-fat diet–fed mice only stained for intracellular HA when blood glucose levels were high (Fig. 9K compared with Fig. 9I). Human circulating monocytes in blood smears from deidentified type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c greater than 7, an indicator of uncontrolled high glucose levels in the blood, stained for HA in intracellular compartments in contrast with monocytes from deidentified type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c lower than 7 (Fig. 9O compared with 9M, representative of four patients each). In summary, no intracellular HA was observed in any of the monocytes in the normoglycemic blood smears, whereas in the hyperglycemic ones, the vast majority did. Monocytes are rapidly recruited to the site of injury or inflammation where they are differentiated into macrophages. Classically activated proinflammatory (Mpi) macrophages are characterized by the increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Th1) and NO production required for an effective pathogen killing (5Murray P.J.

Our results show that hyperglycemic stressed monocytes such as leukemic U937 cells (Fig. 1) and BMDMs express higher levels of proinflammatory markers (Fig. 5). In contrast, heparin inhibits proinflammatory markers (iNOS and TNFα) and promotes anti-inflammatory markers (ARG1 and IL-10) in BMDMs, but not in U937 cells, dividing under hyperglycemic stress (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). U937 cells are a leukemic monocytic cell line that is reprogrammed to sustain cell division and may no longer have the ability to promote an anti-inflammatory repair phenotype through the heparin-induced mechanism.

Feed additives, including bioactive compounds, could be a promising alternative. This study aimed to test two bioactive compounds, sodium salicylate (SA) and a chestnut extract (CE) containing hydrolysable tannins, on the occurrence of PWD. At weaning, 72 piglets were assigned to four treatments that combined two factors: CE supplementation (with 2% of CE (CE+) or without (CE-)) and SA supplementation (with 35 mg/kg BW of SA (SA+) or without (SA-)). Then, 4 days after weaning, all piglets were infected with a suspension at 108 CFU/ml of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC F4ac). Each piglet had free access to an electrolyte solution containing, or not, SA. This SA supplementation was administered for 5 days (i.e., from the day of infection (day 0) to 4 days post-infection (day 4). During the 2 weeks post-infection, supplementation with SA had no effect (P > 0.05) on growth performances nor on fecal scores. A significant SA × time interaction (P < 0.01) for fecal scores and the percentage of diarrhea indicated that piglets with SA did not recover faster and did have a second episode of diarrhea. In contrast to SA treatment, inclusion of CE increased (P < 0.05) growth performances and feed intake. In the first week post-infection, CE decreased (P < 0.001) the overall fecal scores, the percentage of piglets with diarrhea, the days in diarrhea, and ETEC shedding in the feces. There was a SA×CE interaction (P < 0.05) for ETEC shedding, suggesting a negative effect of combining SA with CE. This study highlighted that, in contrast to SA, CE could represent a promising alternative to antibiotics immediately after weaning for improving growth performance and reducing PWD."

Materials and Methods Impressions of a resin reference model with two almost parallel implants were taken using three elastomeric impressions (closed tray technique, open tray nonsplinted technique and open tray splinted technique) and scanned with four optical scanners (CEREC Omnicam, 3M True Definition Scanner, 3Shape TRIOS3 and Carestream CS 3600). STL files of the different methods were superimposed and analyzed with control software (Geomagic Control X, 3D systems) to determine the mean deviation between scans. Results Compared to elastomeric impressions, optical impressions showed a significantly improved mean precision. TRIOS3 and CS3600 showed a significantly improved mean trueness compared to that of closed tray, CEREC Omnicam and TrueDefinition. All methods showed a certain degree of implant rotation over their axes, which was significantly higher in the closed tray and the open tray nonsplinted techniques.

https://openalex.org/W3007570380,"Background The two most common general anesthesia techniques are total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and venous/inhalation balanced general anesthesia (BGA). It is unclear whether any of these two techniques affect patient perception of the quality of recovery. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was to assess the quality of postoperative recovery of women undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. We compared patients who received TIVA with those who received BGA. We also evaluated the factors that may decrease patient-perceived quality of postoperative recovery. Methods We prospectively recruited 121 women aged 18–65 years who were scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. These patients were randomized to receive TIVA (target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil) or BGA (continuous remifentanil infusion and sevoflurane inhalation). To measure the quality of postanesthetic and postoperative recovery, we administered the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire 24 hours after the patient awoke from anesthesia. Results All 60 patients in the TIVA group responded to QoR-40 (median, 188 points; minimum 128; maximum 200). Sixty-one patients in the BGA group had a mean QoR-40 score of 186 points (median, 188 points; minimum 146; maximum 200). There was no significant difference in the QoR-40 score between the two groups (p = 0.577). The patients who presented postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain had worse perception of the quality of postoperative recovery. Conclusions Both TIVA and BGA had a similar effect on the perception of the quality of postoperative recovery in women undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PONV and pain may negatively affect patient perception of the quality of postoperative recovery."

We previously reported that a series of microRNAs (miRNAs) mapped in the 14q32.2 maternally imprinted gene region (Dlk1-Dio3 mat) are related to NAFLD development and progression in a mouse model. We examined the suitability of miR-379, a circulating Dlk1-Dio3 mat miRNA, as a human NAFLD biomarker.Eighty NAFLD patients were recruited for this study. miR-379 was selected from the putative Dlk1-Dio3 mat miRNA cluster because it exhibited the greatest expression difference between NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in our preliminary study. Real-time PCR was used to examine the expression levels of miR-379 and miR-16 as an internal control. One patient was excluded due to low RT-PCR signal.Compared to normal controls, serum miR-379 expression was significantly up-regulated in NAFLD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that miR-379 is a suitable marker for discriminating NAFLD patients from controls, with an area under the curve value of 0.72. Serum miR-379 exhibited positive correlations with alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with early stage NAFLD (Brunt fibrosis stage 0 to 1). The correlation between serum miR-379 and cholesterol levels was lost in early stage NAFLD patients treated with statins. Software-based predictions indicated that various energy metabolism-related genes, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 receptor, are potential targets of miR-379.Serum miR-379 exhibits high potential as a biomarker for NAFLD. miR-379 appears to increase cholesterol lipotoxicity, leading to the development and progression of NAFLD, via interference with the expression of target genes, including those related to the IGF-1 signaling pathway. Our results could facilitate future research into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD."

However, little is known about juvenile stingray movement patterns and habitat use in coral reefs. This study used active acoustic telemetry to determine fine-scale diel movement patterns and habitat use of juvenile cowtail stingrays (Pastinachus ater) in a coral reef flat environment. Seven cowtail stingrays (4 males and 3 females) were manually tracked between April and December 2016. Each individual was tracked over 2 days, generating a total of 14 active tracks ranging from 4.91 to 9 h. Specimens moved at an average speed of 2.44 m min-1 ± 0.87 SE, with minimum distances travelled ranging from 546 to 1446 m. Tracking data showed that juvenile cowtail stingrays move in response to tidal cycles, moving faster and in straighter pathways during incoming and outgoing tides. Juvenile cowtail stingrays also showed a strong affinity to sand flat areas and mangrove edge areas. These areas provide food resources and potential refuges for juvenile rays to avoid predators. Coral reef flats were identified as secondary refuge for juveniles during the lowest tides. Future research is necessary to fully unveil the major drivers of juvenile cowtail stingray seasonal and ontogenetic movement patterns and habitat use within coral reef flat environments. This information is important to establish a full understanding of juvenile cowtail stingray ecology, but could also improve management and conservation policies."

For this purpose, nine formulations were developed in accordance with 32 factorial design using Design Expert® 11. The concentration of propylene glycol (X1) and oleic acid (X2) were selected as independent variable whereas Q10 (Y1), flux (Y2) and lag time (Y3) were considered as the response variables. The impact of drug loading, surface area, gel concentration, membrane variation and agitation speed on drug release and permeation was also studied. The skin sensitivity reaction, analgesic activity and anti-inflammatory action of the optimized patch were also determined in Albino Wistar rats. Stability studies were performed for three months at three different temperature conditions. The result suggests that a membrane-based system with controlled zero-order drug release of 95.8 ± 1.121% for 10 h exhibiting flux of 126.51±1.19 μg/cm2/h and lag time of 0.908 ±0.57h was optimized with the desired analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect can be obtained by using propylene glycol and oleic acid co-solvents as a penetration enhancer. The patch was also found stable at 4˚C for a period of 6.44 months. Formulation F9 comprising of 10% PG and 3% OA was selected as an optimized formulation.

https://openalex.org/W3007773598,"Collective behaviours are known to be the result of diverse dynamics and are sometimes likened to living systems. Although many studies have revealed the dynamics of various collective behaviours, their main focus has been on the information processing performed by the collective, not on interactions within the collective. For example, the qualitative difference between three and four elements in a system has rarely been investigated. Tononi et al. proposed integrated information theory (IIT) to measure the degree of consciousness Φ. IIT postulates that the amount of information loss caused by the minimum information partition is equivalent to the degree of information integration in the system. This measure is not only useful for estimating the degree of consciousness but can also be applied to more general network systems. Here, we obtained two main results from the application of IIT (in particular, IIT 3.0) to the analysis of real fish schools (Plecoglossus altivelis). First, we observed that the discontinuity on 〈Φ(N)〉 distributions emerges for a school of four or more fish. This transition was not observed by measuring the mutual information or the sum of the transfer entropy. We also analysed the IIT on Boids simulations with respect to different coupling strengths; however, the results of the Boids model were found to be quite different from those of real fish. Second, we found a correlation between this discontinuity and the emergence of leadership. We discriminate leadership in this paper from its traditional meaning (e.g. defined by transfer entropy) because IIT-induced leadership refers not to group behaviour, as in other methods, but the degree of autonomy (i.e. group integrity).

However, core creators are challenged to maintain diverse access to new ideas or alternative views that often emerge from the network periphery. In this paper, we demonstrate that creators in the network core can increase the probability of their creative success by brokering peripheral collaborators to the core. The argument is tested on a dynamic collaboration network of movie creators constructed from a unique dataset of Hungarian feature films for the 1990-2009 period. We propose a new way to capture brokers' role in core/periphery networks and provide evidence that being in the core and at the same time bridging between the core and the periphery of the network significantly increases the likelihood of award winning."
https://openalex.org/W3008693638,"Gaze perception is an essential behavior that allows individuals to determine where others are directing their attention but we know relatively little about the ways in which eye morphology influences it. We therefore tested whether eyes with conspicuous morphology have evolved to facilitate gaze perception. During a visual search task, we recorded the eye movements of human participants (Homo sapiens) as they searched for faces with directed gaze within arrays of faces with averted gaze or the reverse; the faces were large and upright, small and upright, or large and inverted. The faces had sclera that were conspicuous (white or colored lighter than the iris color) or inconspicuous (colored the same or darker than the iris color). We found that participants were fastest and most accurate in finding the faces with conspicuous sclera versus inconspicuous sclera. Our results demonstrate that eyes with conspicuous morphology facilitate gaze perception in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3008883498,"Onychomycosis, or fungal nail infection, is a common fungal infection largely caused by dermatophyte fungi, such as Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes, which affects a significant number of people. Treatment is either through oral antifungal medicines, which are efficacious but have significant safety concerns, or with topical antifungal treatments that require long treatment regimens and have only limited efficacy. Thus, an efficacious topical therapy remains an unmet medical need. Among the barriers to topical delivery through the nail are the physico-chemical properties of the antifungal drugs. Here, we explore the ability of a range of antifungal compounds with different hydrophilicities to penetrate the nail. Human nail discs were clamped within static diffusion (Franz) cells and dosed with equimolar concentrations of antifungal drugs. Using LC-MS/MS we quantified the amount of drug that passed through the nail disc and that which remained associated with the nail. Our data identified increased drug flux through the nail for the more hydrophilic compounds (caffeine as a hydrophilic control and fluconazole, with LogP -0.07 and 0.5, respectively), while less hydrophilic efinaconazole, amorolfine and terbinafine (LogP 2.7, 5.6 and 5.9 respectively) had much lower flux through the nail. On the other hand, hydrophilicity alone did not account for the amount of drug associated with/bound to the nail itself. While there are other factors that are likely to combine to dictate nail penetration, this work supports earlier studies that implicate compound hydrophilicity as a critical factor for nail penetration."
https://openalex.org/W3007197308,"Background Conservation strategies are urgently needed for tropical turtles that are increasingly threatened by unsustainable exploitation. Studies conducted exclusively in temperate zones have revealed that typical turtle life history traits (including delayed sexual maturity and high adult survivorship) make sustainable harvest programs an unviable strategy for turtle conservation. However, most turtles are tropical in distribution and the tropics have higher, more constant and more extended ambient temperature regimes that, in general, are more favorable for population growth. Methods To estimate the capacity of temperate and tropical turtles to sustain harvest, we synthesized life-history traits from 165 predominantly freshwater turtle species in 12 families (Carettochelydae, Chelidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Emydidae, Geoemydidae, Kinosternidae, Pelomedusidae, Platysternidae, Podocnemididae, Staurotypidae and Trionychidae). The influence of climate variables and latitude on turtle life-history traits (clutch size, clutch frequency, age at sexual maturity, and annual adult survival) were examined using Generalized Additive Models. The biological feasibility of sustainable harvest in temperate and tropical species was evaluated using a sensitivity analysis of population growth rates obtained from stage-structured matrix population models. Results Turtles at low latitudes (tropical zones) exhibit smaller clutch sizes, higher clutch frequency, and earlier age at sexual maturity than those at high latitudes (temperate zones). Adult survival increased weakly with latitude and declined significantly with increasing bioclimatic temperature (mean temperature of warmest quarter). A modeling synthesis of these data indicates that the interplay of life-history traits does not create higher harvest opportunity in adults of tropical species. Yet, we found potential for sustainable exploitation of eggs in tropical species. Conclusions Sustainable harvest as a conservation strategy for tropical turtles appears to be as biologically problematic as in temperature zones and likely only possible if the focus is on limited harvest of eggs. Further studies are urgently needed to understand how the predicted population surplus in early life stages can be most effectively incorporated into conservation programs for tropical turtles."
https://openalex.org/W3008047906,"Background Hepcidin is an iron regulating hormone, and exercise-induced hepcidin elevation is suggested to increase the risk of iron deficiency among athletes. Objective We compared serum hepcidin responses to resistance exercise and endurance (cycling) exercise. Methods Ten males [mean ± standard error: 172 ± 2 cm, body weight: 70 ± 2 kg] performed three trials: a resistance exercise trial (RE), an endurance exercise trial (END), and a rest trial (REST). The RE consisted of 60 min of resistance exercise (3−5 sets × 12 repetitions, 8 exercises) at 65% of one repetition maximum, while 60 min of cycling exercise at 65% of was performed in the END. Blood samples were collected before exercise and during a 6-h post-exercise (0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 6h after exercise). Results Both RE and END significantly increased blood lactate levels, with significantly higher in the RE (P < 0.001). Serum iron levels were significantly elevated immediately after exercise (P < 0.001), with no significant difference between RE and END. Both the RE and END significantly increased serum growth hormone (GH), cortisol, and myoglobin levels (P < 0.01). However, exercise-induced elevations of GH and cortisol were significantly greater in the RE (trial × time: P < 0.001). Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly elevated after exercise (P = 0.003), with no significant difference between the trials. Plasma hepcidin levels were elevated after exercise (P < 0.001), with significantly greater in the RE (463 ± 125%) than in the END (137 ± 27%, P = 0.03). During the REST, serum hepcidin and plasma IL-6 levels did not change significantly. Conclusion Resistance exercise caused a greater exercise-induced elevation in hepcidin than did endurance (cycling) exercise. The present findings indicate that caution will be required to avoid iron deficiency even among athletes in strength (power) types of events who are regularly involved in resistance exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3008392881,"The development of a schistosome vaccine has proved challenging but we have suggested that characterisation of the self-cure mechanism in rhesus macaques might provide a route to an effective product. The schistosome esophagus is a complex structure where blood processing is initiated by secretions from anterior and posterior glands, achieved by a mixture of ~40 unique proteins. The mechanism of self-cure in macaques involves cessation of feeding, after which worms slowly starve to death. Antibody coats the esophagus lumen and disrupts the secretory processes from the glands, potentially making their secretions ideal vaccine targets.We have designed three peptide arrays comprising overlapping 15-mer peptides encompassing 32 esophageal gland proteins, and screened them for reactivity against 22-week infection serum from macaques versus permissive rabbit and mouse hosts. There was considerable intra- and inter-species variation in response and no obvious unique target was associated with self-cure status, which suggests that self-cure is achieved by antibodies reacting with multiple targets. Some immuno-dominant sequences/regions were evident across species, notably including: MEGs 4.1C, 4.2, and 11 (Array 1); MEG-12 and Aspartyl protease (Array 2); a Tetraspanin 1 loop and MEG-n2 (Array 3). Responses to MEGs 8.1C and 8.2C were largely confined to macaques. As proof of principle, three synthetic genes were designed, comprising several key targets from each array. One of these was expressed as a recombinant protein and used to vaccinate rabbits. Higher antibody titres were obtained to the majority of reactive regions than those elicited after prolonged infection.It is feasible to test simultaneously the additive potential of multiple esophageal proteins to induce protection by combining their most reactive regions in artificial constructs that can be used to vaccinate suitable hosts. The efficacy of the approach to disrupt esophageal function now needs to be tested by a parasite challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3006912276,"Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common complains in orthopedic outpatient department and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is one of the most important reasons of LBP. The mechanisms of IDD contain a complex biochemical cascade which includes inflammation, vascular ingrowth, and results in degradation of matrix. In our study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the relation between tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3) expression and IDD. Loss of TIMP3 expression was found in degenerative intervertebral disc (IVD), this change of expression was closely related with the dephosphorylation of smad2/3. Overexpression of TIMP3 significantly inhibited the release of TNF-α and matrix degradation induced by Lipopolysaccharide. Vascular ingrowth was also suppressed by TIMP3 in the in vitro and in vivo models. Further, animal experiments confirmed that the degeneration of IVD was reduced after overexpression of TIMP3 in nucleus pulposus. Taken together, our results indicated TIMP-3 might play an important role in the pathogenesis of IDD and therefore be a potential therapeutic target in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3007029182,"Thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box (TOX) is a DNA-binding factor that is able to regulate transcription by modifying local chromatin structure and modulating the formation of multi-protein complexes. TOX has multiple roles in the development of the adaptive immune system including development of CD4 T cells, NK cells and lymph node organogenesis. However very few antibodies recognizing this molecule have been reported and no extensive study of the expression of TOX in reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissue has been performed to date. In the present study, we have investigated TOX expression in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues using a novel rat monoclonal antibody that recognizes its target molecule in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. A large series of normal tissues and B- and T-cell lymphomas was studied, using whole sections and tissue microarrays. We found that the majority of precursor B/T lymphoblastic, follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphomas and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas strongly expressed the TOX protein. Burkitt and mantle cell lymphomas showed TOX expression in a small percentage of cases. TOX was not found in the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelomas, marginal zone lymphomas and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. In conclusion, we describe for the first time the expression of TOX in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues. The co-expression of TOX and PD-1 identified in normal and neoplastic T cells is consistent with recent studies identifying TOX as a critical regulator of T-cell exhaustion and a potential immunotherapy target. Its differential expression may be of diagnostic relevance in the differential diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, the identification of the phenotype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and the recognition of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a follicular helper T phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3007848865,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection surgery in the minipig induces post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in a pattern similar to that seen in human patients after ACL injury. Prior studies have reported the presence of cartilage matrix-degrading proteases, such as Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 (ADAMTS-4), in the synovial fluid of injured or arthritic joints; however, the tissue origin of these proteases is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify transcriptional processes activated in the synovium after surgical induction of PTOA with ACL transection, and to determine if processes associated with proteolysis were enriched in the synovium after ACL transection. Unilateral ACL transection was performed in adolescent Yucatan minipigs and synovium samples were collected at 1, 5, 9, and 14 days post-injury. Transcriptome-wide gene expression levels were determined using bulk RNA-Sequencing in the surgical animals and control animals with healthy knees. The greatest number of transcripts with significant changes was observed 1 day after injury. These changes were primarily associated with cellular proliferation, consistent with measurements of increased cellularity of the synovium at the two-week time point. At five to 14 days, the expression of transcripts relating to proteolysis and cartilage development was significantly enriched. While protease inhibitor-encoding transcripts (TIMP2, TIMP3) represented the largest fraction of protease-associated transcripts in the uninjured synovium, protease-encoding transcripts (including MMP1, MMP2, ADAMTS4) predominated after surgery. Cartilage development-associated transcripts that are typically not expressed by synovial cells, such as ACAN and COMP, were enriched in the synovium following ACL-transection. The upregulation in both catabolic processes (proteolysis) and anabolic processes (cartilage development) suggests that the synovium plays a complex, balancing role in the early response to PTOA induction."

All patients completed 12 weeks of SOF-based regimens and had follow-up for at least 12 weeks after therapy discontinuation. The primary outcome was sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of therapy.A total of 185 patients were included, with 52, 63 and 70 taking SOF+Ledipasvir (SOF+LDV), SOF+LDV+ribavirin (RBV) and SOF+Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)+RBV (SOF+Peg-IFN+RBV) respectively. Genotype (GT) 1 was predominant at 40.0%, followed by GT3 at 37.8%, and GT6 at 22.2%. Overall 95.1% of patients in this study achieved SVR (n = 176/185), and the only factor associated with SVR was HCV genotype (p = 0.001). GT6 patients had lower SVR rates compared to GT1 and GT3 patients (82.9%, 98.6%, and 98.6% respectively) while there was no association between SVR and other factors (p >0.05) such as gender, age, BMI, underlying cirrhosis, baseline HCV viral load, or prior treatment history. No serious adverse events were reported in the present study.Sofosbuvir-based regimens in the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection were highly efficacious with excellent safety and tolerability profiles in a real-world setting; however, further research is required to establish whether or not such a regimen is an adequate treatment for all genotype 6 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3008890477,"Denned polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are invisible under the snow, therefore winter-time petroleum exploration and development activities in northern Alaska have potential to disturb maternal polar bears and their cubs. Previous research determined forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery could detect many polar bear maternal dens under the snow, but also identified limitations of FLIR imagery. We evaluated the efficacy of FLIR-surveys conducted by oil-field operators from 2004-2016. Aerial FLIR surveys detected 15 of 33 (45%) and missed 18 (55%) of the dens known to be within surveyed areas. While greater adherence to previously recommended protocols may improve FLIR detection rates, the physical characteristics of polar bear maternal dens, increasing frequencies of weather unsuitable for FLIR detections-caused by global warming, and competing false positives are likely to prevent FLIR surveys from detecting maternal dens reliably enough to afford protections consonant with increasing global threats to polar bear welfare."
https://openalex.org/W3007091585,"Bacterial production has been often estimated from DNA synthesis rates by using tritium-labeled thymidine. Some bacteria species cannot incorporate extracellular thymidine into their DNA, suggesting their biomass production might be overlooked when using the conventional method. In the present study, to evaluate appropriateness of deoxyribonucleosides for evaluating bacterial production of natural bacterial communities from the viewpoint of DNA synthesis, incorporation rates of four deoxyribonucleosides (thymidine, deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine and deoxycytidine) labeled by nitrogen stable isotope (15N) into bacterial DNA were examined in both ocean (Sagami Bay) and freshwater (Lake Kasumigaura) ecosystems in July 2015 and January 2016. In most stations in Sagami Bay and Lake Kasumigaura, we found that incorporation rates of deoxyguanosine were the highest among those of the four deoxyribonucleosides, and the incorporation rate of deoxyguanosine was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of thymidine. Whereas, incorporation rates of deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine were 0.9 and 0.2 times higher than that of thymidine. These results clearly suggest that the numbers of bacterial species which can incorporate exogenous deoxyguanosine into their DNA are relatively greater as compared to the other deoxyribonucleosides, and measurement of bacterial production using deoxyguanosine more likely reflects larger numbers of bacterial species productions."
https://openalex.org/W3008099406,"Quantitative analyses of plantar pressure images typically occur at the group level and under the assumption that individuals within each group display homogeneous pressure patterns. When this assumption does not hold, a personalized analysis technique is required. Yet, existing personalized plantar pressure analysis techniques work at the image level, leading to results that can be unintuitive and difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we introduce PAPPI: the Personalized Analysis of Plantar Pressure Images. PAPPI is built around the statistical modelling of the relationship between plantar pressures in healthy controls and their demographic characteristics. This statistical model then serves as the healthy baseline to which an individual's real plantar pressures are compared using statistical parametric mapping. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated PAPPI on a cohort of 50 hallux valgus patients. PAPPI showed that plantar pressures from hallux valgus patients did not have a single, homogeneous pattern, but instead, 5 abnormal pressure patterns were observed in sections of this population. When comparing these patterns to foot pain scores (i.e. Foot Function Index, Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire) and radiographic hallux angle measurements, we observed that patients with increased pressure under metatarsal 1 reported less foot pain than other patients in the cohort, while patients with abnormal pressures in the heel showed more severe hallux valgus angles and more foot pain. Also, incidences of pes planus were higher in our hallux valgus cohort compared to the modelled healthy controls. PAPPI helped to clarify recent discrepancies in group-level plantar pressure studies and showed its unique ability to produce quantitative, interpretable, and personalized analyses for plantar pressure images."

There are scant national data on the prevalence of disability among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The main objective was to estimate the prevalence of common disabilities among US-based individuals diagnosed with COPD.Data from the BRFSS, a national telephone survey examining health-related behaviors in 2016-2017 were analyzed. The study population consisted of individuals with self-reported COPD (N = 38352 in 2016 and N = 35423 in 2017). The prevalence of disabilities in hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, and independent living were obtained and adjusted with sampling weights. Healthcare access measures were described by type of disability.Mobility disability had the highest prevalence of 45.9 (44.8-47.0) % in 2016 and 48.4 (47.3-49.5) % in 2017 among respondents with COPD. The prevalence of disabilities was highest among those 45-64 years old, except for hearing and cognition. Hearing disabilities were most prevalent among males with COPD while cognitive and mobility disabilities were most prevalent among females with COPD. While differences in the prevalence of disabilities were observed, access to health care was similar by disability type and age group among respondents.Contrary to expectation, the highest prevalence of disabilities was found not to be among those 65 years old and above. Further research is needed to explain this age-specific shift in the burden of disability, as long-term care planning and prevention support systems should be informed by the demographical patterns of disabilities among individuals with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W3007886617,"Reinforcement of the hydroperoxide-eliminating activity in the small and large intestines should prevent associated diseases. We previously isolated a lactic acid bacterium, Pediococcus pentosaceus Be1 that facilitates a 2-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. In this study, we successfully isolated an alternative lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum P1-2, that can efficiently reduce environmental alkyl hydroperoxides and fatty acid hydroperoxides to their corresponding hydroxyl derivatives through a 2-electron reduction. Each strain exhibited a wide concentration range with regard to the environmental reducing activity for each hydroperoxide. Given this, the two lactic acid bacteria were orally administered to an oxygen-sensitive short-lived nematode mutant, and this resulted in a significant expansion of its lifespan. This observation suggests that P. pentosaceus Be1 and L. plantarum P1-2 inhibit internal oxidative stress. To determine the specific organs involved in this response, we performed a similar experiment in rats, involving induced lipid peroxidation by iron-overloading. We observed that only L. plantarum P1-2 inhibited colonic mucosa lipid peroxidation in rats with induced oxidative stress."

This study examined the levels and determinants of postpartum adherence to ART among mothers with HIV in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.In this cross-sectional analytical study, we interviewed 495 postpartum women with HIV between January and May 2018. We measured postpartum adherence using six questions probing participants' adherence behaviours since child birth. We categorised the adherence behaviours into complete adherence (mothers who reported no missed episode(s) of ART since child birth) and suboptimal adherence (mothers with any missed episode(s) of ART). Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the determinants of postpartum adherence to ART.Overall, 63.9% reported complete adherence during the postpartum period but the rates varied by socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. The adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that younger mothers were 70% less likely to report complete adherence to ART compared to mothers aged 40 and above. Likewise, mothers who currently use alcohol were 53% less likely to report complete postpartum adherence to ART compared to those who did not use alcohol. However, mothers who knew their partner's status were twice more likely to report complete postpartum adherence compared to those who did not. There was no statistically significant relationship between ART adherence and breastfeeding durations.Postpartum adherence to ART is suboptimal in the study setting, and younger mothers and those who use alcohol have a lower odds of complete adherence. Knowing a partner's status improves adherence, but infant feeding practices did not influence postpartum adherence behaviours. It is critical to design and strengthen interventions which target young mothers and alcohol users. Also, HIV sero-status disclosure should be encouraged among mothers to facilitate partner support."
https://openalex.org/W3008913437,"Introduction Iron deficiency is a treatable cause of severe anaemia in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMIC). Diagnosing it remains challenging as peripheral blood markers poorly reflect bone-marrow iron deficiency (BM-ID), especially in the context of HIV-infection. Methods Severely anaemic (haemoglobin ≤70g/l) HIV-infected adults were recruited at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. BM-ID was evaluated. Accuracy of blood markers (including hepcidin, mean corpuscular volume, mean cellular haemoglobin concentration, serum iron, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), sTfR index, sTfR–ratio) to detect BM-ID was evaluated by ROC area under the curve (AUCROC). Results Seventy-three patients were enrolled and 35 (48.0%) had BM-ID. Although hepcidin and MCV performed best (AUCROC of 0.593 and 0.545 respectively) all markers performed poorly in identifying BM-ID (ROC<0.6). The AUCROC of hepcidin in males was 0.767 (sensitivity 80%, specificity 78%) and in women 0.490 (sensitivity 60%, specificity 61%). Conclusion BM-ID deficiency was common in severely anaemic HIV-infected patients. It is an important and potential treatable contributor to severe anaemia but lack of definitive biomarkers makes it difficult to accurately assess iron status in these patients. Further investigation of the potential of hepcidin is needed, including exploration of the differences in hepcidin results between males and females."
https://openalex.org/W3006942156,"The intricate three-dimensional geometries of protein tertiary structures underlie protein function and emerge through a folding process from one-dimensional chains of amino acids. The exact spatial sequence and configuration of amino acids, the biochemical environment and the temporal sequence of distinct interactions yield a complex folding process that cannot yet be easily tracked for all proteins. To gain qualitative insights into the fundamental mechanisms behind the folding dynamics and generic features of the folded structure, we propose a simple model of structure formation that takes into account only fundamental geometric constraints and otherwise assumes randomly paired connections. We find that despite its simplicity, the model results in a network ensemble consistent with key overall features of the ensemble of Protein Residue Networks we obtained from more than 1000 biological protein geometries as available through the Protein Data Base. Specifically, the distribution of the number of interaction neighbors a unit (amino acid) has, the scaling of the structure’s spatial extent with chain length, the eigenvalue spectrum and the scaling of the smallest relaxation time with chain length are all consistent between model and real proteins. These results indicate that geometric constraints alone may already account for a number of generic features of protein tertiary structures."
https://openalex.org/W3007683736,"As a branch of the unfolded protein response, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) represses global translation in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This pathophysiological condition is associated with the tumor microenvironment in cancer. Previous findings in our lab have suggested that PERK selectively represses translation of some mRNAs, but this possibility awaits additional investigation. In this study, we show that a stem-cell marker protein, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein–coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), is rapidly depleted in colon cancer cells during ER stress, an effect that depended on the PERK-mediated translational repression. Indeed, the PERK inhibition led to the accumulation of premature, underglycosylated forms of LGR5, which were produced only at low levels during proper PERK activation. Unlike the mature LGR5 form, which is constitutively degraded regardless of PERK activation, the underglycosylated LGR5 exhibited a prolonged half-life and accumulated inside the cells without being expressed on the cell surface. We also found that Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) is subjected to a similarly-regulated depletion by PERK, whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), stress-inducible heat-shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5), and anterior gradient 2 protein-disulfide isomerase family member (AGR2) were relatively. insensitive to the PERK-mediated repression of translation.

To understand the molecular basis of phytohormone-regulated oleanolic acid metabolism, RNA-seq was used to analyze global gene expression in Achyranthes bidentata treated with 2.0 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 1.0 mg/L 6-benzyladenine (6-BA). Compared with untreated controls, the expression levels of 20,896 genes were significantly altered with phytohormone treatment. We found that 13071 (62.5%) unigenes were up-regulated, and a lot of differentially expressed genes involved in hormone or terpenoid biosynthesis, or transcription factors were significantly up-regulated. These results suggest that oleanolic acid biosynthesis induced by NAA and 6-BA occurs due to the expression of key genes involved in jasmonic acid signal transduction. This study is the first to analyze the production and hormonal regulation of medicinal A. bidentata metabolites at the molecular level. The results herein contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins accumulation and define strategies to improve the yield of these useful metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W3007941283,"New evidence from both Teotihuacan and the Maya region has brought the relationship between those two great Mesoamerican cultures into the spotlight—and hints it may have been more contentious than most researchers thought. Stone monuments from the ancient Maya city of Tikal record a pivotal event in that city9s history on 16 January 378: a possible invasion by Teotihuacan, the central Mexican metropolis 1000 kilometers away. Some archaeologists believe Teotihuacan added Tikal to a sweeping empire that may have included several Maya cities. Defaced art in Teotihuacan suggests that about the time Tikal fell under its sway, Teotihuacan may have turned against Maya expatriates who had lived there peacefully for decades. But doubts about that narrative persist. Some researchers say the events of 378 may have been a more limited case of palace intrigue, with the nobles of one powerful region elbowing their way into the politics of another. Archaeologists might even be falling for ancient propaganda: Tikal9s conquerors may have been local Maya usurpers who appropriated the symbolism of faraway Teotihuacan."
https://openalex.org/W3008472630,"Background/objective A subset of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) subjects appears to be refractory to the effects of anti-VEGF treatment and require frequent intravitreal injections. The vascular phenotype of the choroidal neovascular (CNV) lesions may contribute to the resistance. Animal studies of CNV lesions have shown that cells originating from bone marrow are capable of forming varying cell types in the lesions. This raised the possibility of a similar cell population in human nvAMD subjects. Materials and methods Blood draws were obtained from subjects with active nvAMD while patients were receiving standard of care anti-VEGF injections. Subjects were classified as refractory or non-refractory to anti-VEGF treatment based on previous number of injections in the preceding 12 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and CD34-positive cells purified using magnetic bead sorting. The isolated cells were expanded in StemSpan SFEM media to increase cell numbers. After expansion, the cells were split and plated in either endothelial or mesenchymal promoting conditions. Phenotype analysis was performed via qPCR. Results There was no significant difference in the number of PBMCs and CD34-positive cells between refractory and non-refractory nvAMD subjects. The growth pattern distribution between endothelial and mesenchymal media conditions were very similar between refractory and non-refractory subjects. qPCR and immunostaining demonstrated positive expression of endothelial markers in endothelial media, and markers such as NG2 and αSMA in mesenchymal media. However, analysis of subsequent samples from AMD subjects demonstrated high variability in both the numbers and differentiation properties of this cell population. Conclusions CD34+ cells can be isolated from nvAMD subjects and show both endothelial and pericyte-like characteristics after differentiation in certain media conditions. However, nvAMD subjects show high variability in both numbers of cells and differentiation characteristics in repeat sampling. This variability highlights the importance of taking multiple samples from nvAMD subjects for any clinical trials focused on biomarkers for the disease."

The data consisted of 279 married women, who were screened for BPD using the bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale (BSDS). Frequency distribution, chi-square test and binary logistic regression model were used respectively to determine the prevalence, identify the associated factors and quantify their effects on BPD.The prevalence of BPD among married women in Rajshahi City was 2.5%, with an additional 7.2% classified as probable BPD. A binary logistic regression analysis established the following six main factors of BPD: (1) comorbid mental disorder [AOR = 8.232, 95% CI = (1.397, 50.000), p<0.05]; (2) poor relationship with husband [AOR = 11.775, 95% CI = (2.070, 66.667), p<0.01]; (3) poverty [AOR = 1.600, 95% CI = (2.086, 122.709), p<0.01]; (4) high educational level [AOR = 0.177, 95% CI = (0.037, 0.843), p<0.05]; (5) lack of immediate treatment if sick [AOR = 2.941, 95% CI = (1.259, 6.871), p<0.05]; and (6) death of beloved one/s [AOR = 2.768, 95% CI = (1.130, 6.777), p<0.05].Our survey involved self-reporting, which is typically affected by differing levels of understanding and bias. Also, a cross-sectional, observational study cannot establish an actual cause-and-effect relationship. Some other potentially important factors such as environment, lifestyle, familial customs, effects of drugs, treatment options and outcomes, etc. were not studied. Also, save mental disorder, all other comorbidities remained undocumented.This study laid down the foundation for conducting further research on identifying different factors affecting BPD, and for studying other issues related to BPD among married women in Bangladesh. Among such factors are familial environment and culture, comorbidities, treatment options, treatment outcomes, biochemical feature, environmental factors, etc. This study also recommends that, while treating BPD patients, health professionals should focus on comorbidities and family matters."

https://openalex.org/W2990138694,"We report surface hardening or crust formation, unlike caking, during drying when a confined porous medium was heated from above using IR radiation. These crusts have higher strength than their closest counterparts such as sandcastles and mud-peels which essentially are clusters of partially wet porous medium. Observed higher strength of the crusts is mostly due to surface tension between the solid particles which are connected by liquid bridges (connate water). Qualitative (FTIR) and quantitative (TGA) measurements confirm the presence of trapped water within the crust. Amount of the trapped water was ~1.5% (this is about 10 times higher than in the samples with caking) which was confirmed using SEM images. Further, in the fixed particle sizes case, the crust thickness varied slightly (10-20 particle diameters only for cases with external heating) while with the natural sand whole porous column was crusted; surprisingly, crust was also found with the hydrophobic glass beads. Fluorescein dye visualization technique was used to determine the crust thickness. We give a power law relation between the crust thickness and the incident heat flux for various particle sizes. The strength of the crust decreases drastically with increasing hydrophilic spheres diameter while it increases with higher surface temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3008200370,"A collection of evidence suggests that conjugation of double bonds of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), increases their anticarcinogenic activity; however, the effect of such conjugation on vascular tone activity remains unknown. We propose that the mixture of conjugated PUFAs exerts higher vasorelaxation activity than the corresponding mixture of nonconjugated PUFAs. The vascular response to different concentrations of conjugated and nonconjugated isomers of EPA and DHA, among other fatty acids (FAs) naturally present in shark oil, and the role of nitric oxide (NO) as a vasorelaxant agent were investigated. Both conjugated EPA (CEPA) and conjugated DHA (CDHA) were prepared by alkaline isomerization of all PUFAs contained in shark oil. Different concentrations of conjugated and nonconjugated PUFAs were placed in contact with precontracted aortic rings of Wistar rats to assess their effect on vascular tone. All tested samples exerted a vasorelaxant effect. Compared to nonconjugated PUFAs, conjugated isomers exhibited an increase in the dilatation of the aortic rings (P<0.001) in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.001). In addition, nonconjugated PUFAs produced nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner, while conjugated PUFAs did not, suggesting that their dilatation mechanism is not totally dependent on NO."
