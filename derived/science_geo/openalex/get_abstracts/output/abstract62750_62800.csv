Visual fixation of this hand was insistent and prolonged; visually guided reaching was poor, but it improved during ten succeeding hours of exposure. Little concomitant improvement occurred in the reaching of the unexposed hand."
https://openalex.org/W1650651443,"Abstract d-Galactose transport in two mutant strains of Escherichia coli K12 lacking galactokinase has been described. These cells showed a reduction of about 50% in the capacity for galactose uptake and in the rate of exit as a consequence of osmotic shock. In the shock procedure the cells were first treated with 0.5 m sucrose containing 1 x 10-4 m ethylenediaminetetraacetate, after which the pelleted cells were rapidly dispersed in cold 5 x 10-4 m MgCl2. A factor was released into the MgCl2 solution (shock fluid) which formed a complex with galactose in vitro, detected by Sephadex chromatography. The material was heat labile and nondialyzable and behaved in several respects like a protein. More of this material appeared when cells high in galactose transport activity were used. The reduced uptake of galactose in shocked cells could be restored by first incubating them with dialyzed shock fluid. The shock fluid could be removed before measuring uptake, suggesting that some factor in the shock fluid needed for uptake could reassociate with the shocked cells. Restoration of activity was always limited to an amount less than the original level. These observations suggest that a factor necessary for galactose transport has been partially released by osmotic shock into the shock fluid. Further, the results suggest that the factor can reassociate with the cell, thereby restoring the reduced uptake of galactose nearly to the original level, but not exceeding it."
https://openalex.org/W1655592091,"The complete amino acid sequences of subtilisins BPN' (Nagarse) and Carlsberg have been determined. Subtilisin BPN' consists of a single peptide chain of 275 amino acid residues, whereas the Carlsberg enzyme contains 274 residues and differs in a total of 83 residues. The enzymes are distinct from serine proteinases of animal origin. Amino acid replacements permit preliminary identification of areas critical for structure-function relationships and some assessment of possible genetic mechanisms which have led to differences in sequence."

Three of the four infants then became severely depressed. The depression lasted about a week and was strikingly similar to the ""anaclitic depression"" of human infants who lost their mothers. When they were reunited, all four dyads showed a marked and prolonged intensification of the mother-infant relationship."

https://openalex.org/W1530363230,"Abstract The activity of δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase in mouse tissues is under the genetic control of two alleles at the levulinate (Lv) locus. δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase has been isolated and extensively purified from the livers and spleens of two strains of mice; the AKR/J strain, homozygous for the Lva allele which has high tissue δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity, and the C57BL/6J strain, homozygous for the Lvb allele which has low tissue δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity, only one-third of that seen in Lva homozygotes. δ-Aminolevulinate dehydratase isolated from liver and spleen of each genotype has identical physical, chemical, and enzymic properties, which strongly suggests that the levulinate locus acts by controlling the amount rather than the structure of δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase. The δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity in spleen, normally only one-fifth of that seen in liver, can be increased to the normal liver activity characteristic of each genotype by making the mice anemic with repeated injections of phenylhydrazine. Mouse δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase is similar in most respects to that isolated from other species. The enzyme requires sulfhydryl compounds for maximal activity, is relatively heat stable, has a pH optimum of 6.5, Km of 4 x 10-4 m, and an approximate molecular weight of 270,000. However, in contrast to δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase from other species, the mouse enzyme is activated by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, Hg2+, and Fe2+ ions."

https://openalex.org/W2078746693,"Acuity falls sharply and predictably in man as fixation is shifted away from the test stimulus. If the same ""eccentricity"" function applies to the monkey, then it can be shown that striate cortex lesions produce a smaller acuity impairment than is predicted by electrophysiological maps of the projection of retina onto the cortex. It is seen in this study that retinal lesions of the fovea and adjacent parafovea produce a more severe drop in acuity than corresponding cortical lesions, and therefore the surprisingly slight effects of the latter cannot be explained in terms of a relatively higher parafoveal acuity in the monkey. The discrepancy between retinal and cortical effects is unlikely to be due to the development of ""supersensitivity"" at the edge of the cortical lesions. An explanation is proposed in terms of lateral spread of information at retinal and/or geniculate stages of the visual system."
https://openalex.org/W2120825963,"Abstract The conversion of oleic acid to 10-d-hydroxystearic acid by a pseudomonad was studied in a medium enriched in deuterium oxide. The reaction occurred with stereospecific incorporation of 1 atom of solvent hydrogen at carbon atom 9. The location of the deuterium was established by a combination of chemical and mass spectrometric evidence. The hydroxyl function of the deuterium-labeled hydroxystearate was replaced by hydrogen through a series of standard organic reactions which should not affect the stereochemistry at carbon atom 9. The resulting deuterium-labeled stearate was incubated with a growing culture of a strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a system which stereospecifically removes hydrogen in the d configuration at carbon atom 9 of stearate in the enzymatic introduction of the Δ9-double bond of oleic acid. Retention of the labeled hydrogen in the oleate was observed, indicating that the configuration of the deuterium in the stearate, and hence in the 10-hydroxystearate, was l."

https://openalex.org/W1598526304,"Abstract Escherichia coli cells incubated in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane buffer in the absence of divalent cations (Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetate) or in Tris buffer in the presence of Mn++ (Tris-Mn++) utilize deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for the intracellular synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid. All four of the triphosphates are required, and they cannot be replaced by monophosphates or by ribonucleoside triphosphates. Based on the behavior of mutants deficient in endonuclease I and on other findings, the utilization of deoxynucleoside triphosphates after Tris-EDTA treatment is thought to be the result of (a) increased permeability and (b) the exposure of priming points for polymerase action on the cellular DNA. The specific effect of Mn++ in the Tris-Mn++ treatment is not explained; it does not depend on endonuclease I action nor does it, any more than Tris-EDTA, appear to involve the physiological operations of chromosomal replication."

https://openalex.org/W1579116430,"Abstract Immunospecifically purified rabbit antibodies to bovine serum albumin, enriched with more than 800 dl-alanine residues per molecule, were completely soluble in neutral aqueous buffers after total reduction (46 sulfhydryl groups per molecule) and exposure to 8 m guanidine hydrochloride. Hardly any antibody or antigenic properties could be detected in completely reduced polyalanyl antibody preparations which had been reoxidized either in the presence of 8 m urea or in 0.1 n acetic acid. Under optimum conditions of reoxidation, at least 25% of the initial antigen-combining capacity of the antibody preparations and at least 50% of their initial capacity to inhibit a homologous precipitin reaction could be recovered. These tests were used since the polyalanyl antibody preparations are unable to form macroscopic precipitates, even though they still form soluble complexes with the antigen and are capable of inhibiting the reaction of bovine serum albumin with antibodies to bovine serum albumin. The reoxidized antibody preparations exhibited a recovery of at least 68% of the antigenic determinants present in the untreated antibody molecules. The results of this investigation suggest that differences in specificity exhibited in antibody molecules are due to differences in the primary amino acid sequence of the constitutive polypeptide chains."

https://openalex.org/W1598698726,"Abstract A method of preparing ribonucleic acid from tadpole liver has been described. It was found that tadpole liver RNA is unstable during the isolation procedure. Various factors, including temperature, the concentration of Mg++ in the homogenizing medium, and the presence of ribonuclease inhibitors, were found to be of importance in protecting RNA during its preparation. Three peaks with sedimentation coefficients of 29 S, 18 S, and 6 S were obtained by zonal sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The 6 S RNA was found in the purified ribosomes from mitochondrial and postmitochondrial fractions. The base ratios of 6 S RNA were different from those of the 18 S and 29 S fractions and the bulk RNA, showing in particular a low concentration of UMP. Some properties of RNase from tadpole liver have been described and discussed in relation to the base composition of 6 S RNA. The most rapidly labeled RNA appeared in the transfer RNA fraction when orotic-acid-14C was administered to untreated tadpoles. The RNA heavier than transfer RNA has the highest specific radioactivity 2 days after thyroxine treatment. The base composition of this RNA was analyzed with the use of 32Pi and found to be high in uridine 5'-phosphate (25 to 35%) in spite of the low value of the UMP in bulk RNA in this area. Rapidly labeled RNA which appears in the 6 to 10 S area has the properties of messenger RNA needed for induction of the enzymes in liver associated with metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W1496310766,"Abstract The observations reported here indicate that rat liver nuclear subfractions possess the capacity to synthesize proteins by a mechanism resembling that found in the cytoplasm. The resistance of nuclear ribosomes to deoxyribonuclease, their magnesium optimum, and their sensitivity to puromycin and RNase, as well as their capacity to follow instructions dictated by either synthetic or endogenous messenger RNAs, are characteristics similar to those of cytoplasmic ribosomes. Sedimentation velocities and melting profiles of nuclear and cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA are identical. In addition, similar base ratios of ribosomal RNA suggest the origin of nuclear and cytoplasmic ribosomes from the same genetic loci."

https://openalex.org/W1483775442,"Abstract Following the chromatographic separation of the crystalline toxin of Clostridium botulinum type A into one fraction (α) containing 5 times the specific activity of the unfractionated preparation and a second fraction (β), only feebly toxic, the native toxin and the two components were analyzed in the ultracentrifuge for homogeneity and Fraction α was analyzed for molecular weight. Under all experimental conditions, crystalline toxin resolved into two peaks with s20,w values of about 7 and 13, respectively. Fraction β aggregated to a heavier component, with s20,w of 16 or 23 S, depending upon the pH and ionic strength of the solvent and the concentration of the protein. Fraction α, however, remained homogeneous. The molecular weight of Fraction α, as determined by Yphantis' method, was 128,000 ± 10%. This value is in reasonable agreement with the molecular weight of 150,000 established for this component on Sephadex G-200 columns by Andrews' method. The possibility that Fraction α is a polymer of lower molecular weight units cannot yet be ruled out, nor do we know whether β is the inactive subunit proposed by Wagman, an inactive precursor as postulated by Bonventre and Kempe, or a nonspecific contaminant which crystallizes with the toxic α fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1560119551,"Abstract The amino acid composition and chemical and immunological properties of the isomerase catalyzing the fourth step in histidine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium are reported. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is 29,000, as determined by high speed equilibrium centrifugation; it is unchanged after complete reduction and alkylation, indicating the presence of a single polypeptide chain. This conclusion is supported by the finding of a single carboxyl-terminal amino acid, valine, both by digestion with carboxypeptidase A and by hydrazinolysis. Furthermore, the number of spots seen on peptide maps of tryptic digests of carboxymethylated isomerase is approximately the same as the number of arginine plus lysine residues found by amino acid analyses. These results agree with results of genetic studies (1) which show that the structural gene for this enzyme consists of a single complementation group. The minor active isomers of the enzyme, previously described, appear to result from modifications in vitro of a single protein. Antibody specific to the isomerase has been prepared. Carboxymethylated isomerase and isomerase derived from extracts of repressed and derepressed histidine auxotrophs with mutations in all regions of the histidine operon, of constitutive mutants, and of the wild type strains LT-2 and LT-7 are antigenically identical."

https://openalex.org/W1516111347,"Abstract The involvement of metal in oxidation and coupled phosphorylation by cell-free preparations of Mycobacterium phlei was examined. The oxidation of succinate was inhibited by metal-chelating agents, but with β-hydroxybutyrate, chelating agents exhibited an uncoupling effect. The site of inhibition was found to be between the flavoprotein and the cytochrome b regions of the electron transport chain. The inhibitory action of o-phenanthroline was reversed by ferrous ions but not by other divalent metal ions. Ferrous ions restored both oxidation and phosphorylation with succinate and could effectively counteract the uncoupling action of o-phenanthroline on the oxidation of β-hydroxybutyrate. These results suggest that nonheme iron may be involved in the electron transport pathway of M. phlei."

This corpuscle was observed in one of our histochemical preparations of succinic dehydrogenase enzyme localization1. It was found situated at the inferior surface of the bulb between the leptomeninges covering and the nerve fibre layer (Fig. 1). It was orientated in a coronal plane to the bulb. It had a concentric lamellae of epithelial cells arranged like onion peel as observed in other Pacinian corpuscles in standard histological sections (Fig. 2). These lamellae are made up of continuous sheets of flat squamous epithelial cells laid one on top of the other, but not by fibroblasts as was once thought2–4. These cells are derived by a continuation of the perineural epithelium which covers the nerve fibre supplying the corpuscle5–12."

https://openalex.org/W2295751961,"Abstract The solubility of the homogeneous, nonenzymatic structural protein isolated and purified from bovine heart mitochondria when incubated with the murine toxin of Pasteurella pestis at pH 11.0 increases as the concentration of the toxin is increased. This indicates that a protein-protein interaction occurs between the monomeric units of the structural protein and the toxin. This interaction results in the decline of the toxicity of the toxin. The extent to which the toxicity is diminished depends upon the ratio of structural protein to toxin in the incubation mixture. Double diffusion gel precipitation reactions with plague murine toxin incubated with structural protein revealed that the decrease in the toxicity of the toxin is correlated with the disappearance of the bands exhibited by both toxin A and toxin B, the two protein species comprising plague murine toxin. No interaction is observed between the toxin and polymeric structural protein. There is, however, an indication of a slight decrease in the toxicity of the toxin. Under the latter conditions, the band for toxin A is not visible in double diffusion gel precipitation reactions whereas the band for toxin B remains intact. Bovine serum albumin does not interact with plague murine toxin nor does it affect its toxicity. These results suggest that the interaction between plague murine toxin and monomeric structural protein involves binding of the two proteins. The relationship that this protein-protein interaction may have to the known inhibitory effect of the toxin on the electron transport system is discussed."
