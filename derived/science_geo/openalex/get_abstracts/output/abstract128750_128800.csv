https://openalex.org/W2023145731,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a dually acylated peripheral membrane protein that targets to the Golgi region and caveolae of endothelial cells. Recent evidence has shown that eNOS can co-precipitate with caveolin-1, the resident coat protein of caveolae, suggesting a direct interaction between these two proteins. To test this idea, we examined the interactions of eNOS with caveolin-1 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Incubation of endothelial cell lysates or purified eNOS with glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase (GST)-caveolin-1 resulted in the direct interaction of the two proteins. Utilizing a series of GST-caveolin-1 deletion mutants, we identified two cytoplasmic domains of caveolin-1 that interact with eNOS, the scaffolding domain (amino acids 61–101) and to a lesser extent the C-terminal tail (amino acids 135–178). Incubation of pure eNOS with peptides derived from the scaffolding domains of caveolin-1 and -3, but not the analogous regions from caveolin-2, resulted in inhibition of eNOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS) activities. These results suggest a common mechanism and site of inhibition. Utilizing GST-eNOS fusions, the site of caveolin binding was localized between amino acids 310 and 570. Site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted caveolin binding motif within eNOS blocked the ability of caveolin-1 to suppress NO release in co-transfection experiments. Thus, our data demonstrate a novel functional role for caveolin-1 in mammalian cells as a potential molecular chaperone that directly inactivates NOS. This suggests that the direct binding of eNOS to caveolin-1, <i>per se</i>, and the functional consequences of eNOS targeting to caveolae are likely temporally and spatially distinct events that regulate NO production in endothelial cells. Additionally, the inactivation of eNOS and nNOS by the scaffolding domain of caveolin-3 suggests that eNOS in cardiac myocytes and nNOS in skeletal muscle are likely subject to negative regulation by this muscle-specific caveolin isoform."
https://openalex.org/W2017578232,"A human receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL (TRAIL receptor-1, designated DR4) was identified recently as a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. In this report we describe the identification of two additional human TRAIL receptors, TRAIL receptor-2 and TRAIL receptor-3, that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Interestingly, TRAIL receptor-2 but not TRAIL receptor-3 contains a cytoplasmic “death domain” necessary for induction of apoptosis and is hence designated death receptor-5 (DR5). Like DR4, DR5 engages the apoptotic pathway independent of the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT1. Because of its lack of a death domain, TRAIL receptor-3 is not capable of inducing apoptosis. However, by competing for TRAIL, it is capable of inhibiting TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, TRAIL receptor-3 may function as an antagonistic decoy receptor to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of TRAIL in most tissues that are TRAIL+, DR4+, and DR5+.

We now report the isolation of a cDNA encoding a 165-kDa PPARγ-binding protein, designated PBP which also serves as a coactivator.

PPARγ exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, as a consequence of alternate promoter usage in the gene encoding this receptor (8Zhu Y. Alvares K. Huang Q. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), the PPARγ2 isoform, which plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation, is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue (8Zhu Y.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Forced expression of the PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 isoforms in fibroblasts has been shown to convert these cells into adipocytes, suggesting that PPARγ exerts a pivotal role in adipocyte development and lipid homeostasis (20Tontonoz P.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). PPARγ is activated by the arachidonate metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin-J2, which appears to function as a natural ligand for this receptor, as well as a thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs (23Forman B.M.

Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPARs possess a central DNA-binding domain that recognizes PPAR-response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of their target genes (1Issemann J. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar, 7Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W.

Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). PPARs heterodimerize with RXR (RXR is the receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid) and the transcriptional regulation of target genes by PPARs is achieved through the binding of these PPAR-RXR heterodimers to PPREs (3Chu R. Reddy J.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M.

RXR also forms heterodimers with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and these interactions appear to influence the PPAR-regulated transcriptional activation because of the competition among various RXR heterodimerization partners for RXR (27Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar, 28Chu R. Lin Y. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

In addition, tissue and species responses to peroxisome proliferators and other natural PPAR ligands may depend upon pharmacokinetics and or metabolism, the relative abundance of PPAR isotype and its heterodimerization partner RXR, the structural features of PPREs and flanking sequences, and to some extent hormone levels and dietary composition (3Chu R.

Transcriptional regulation of nuclear hormone receptors involves the participation of basal transcription factors, including TATA-binding protein and TFIIB, and other cofactors, known as nuclear transcriptional coactivators or corepressors, that bridge the association between nuclear receptors and the basal transcription machinery (30Janknecht R.

Of these CBP/p300, as well as SRC-1/NCoA-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1/NCoA-2, p/CIP, and RIP140, function as nuclear receptor coactivators, whereas NCoR and SMRT function as transcriptional corepressors. In an effort to understand possible tissue- and species-specific differences in the transcriptional activity of PPAR isotypes, we initiated studies to identify cofactors that influence PPAR transcriptional activity. Using the PPARγ ligand binding domain as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse liver cDNA library, we previously identified SRC-1 as a PPAR coactivator (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and characterization of PBP, a new PPAR-binding protein. In addition, we show that PBP also binds to TRβ1, RARα, and RXRα. Functional studies reveal that PBP modestly increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and a truncated PBP (amino acids 487–735), which contains putative PPAR binding region (amino acids 626–686), acts in a dominant-negative fashion causing a decrease in the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. To isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that specifically interact with PPARγ, yeast two-hybrid screening procedure was used as described elsewhere (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this screening system employed GAL4-PPARγ (expressing GAL4-DNA-binding domain and mPPARγ-ligand binding domain fusion protein), which was cotransformed into yeast with a second vector that expressed fusion proteins between GAL4-activating domain and mouse liver cDNA. Of the 13 clones that exhibited positive interaction with PPARγ, two were identified previously as mSRC-1 (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). Of the remaining 11 clones, two revealed overlapping cDNA sequences. As these positive clones contained only partial cDNA sequences, we used RACE PCR to obtain the remaining 5′-end, and 3′-end sequences. Briefly, for 5′-RACE PCR, the first amplification was performed using the adapter primer 1 and the gene-specific primer (5′-CAATGAGAGACAGTGCTGGGGTGT-3′) for 20 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 4 min at 68 °C; 1 μl of the PCR product was used as the template for the second amplification with the adapter primer 2 and the nested gene-specific primer (5′-AGCCTGTATGGTTTCAGCCTTCCTC-3′) for 20 cycles, essentially using the same conditions as those used for the first amplification. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and three independent clones were sequenced. For 3′-RACE PCR, the sequences of the gene-specific and nested gene-specific primers were 5′-CATCCTCTCAGAATCAACATGGCAG-3′ and 5′-CCAAAGGGAAATCTCCCAGTAGG-3′, respectively. These PCR amplifications were performed using the mouse liver marathon ready cDNA (CLONTECH) and rTth DNA polymerase. The full-length cDNA we cloned has been designated PBP to reflect its ability to bind PPARs. The yeast expression vector Gal4-PPARγ, GST-PPARγ, GST-RXRα, PCMV-PPARγ, PPRE-TK-LUC, and GAL-TK-LUC have been described elsewhere (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). The vectors for in vitro transcription and translation of RARα and TRβ1 were provided by Dr. L. Madison (Northwestern University Medical School). The construction of pSV-sport-PPARα for in vitro translation was described previously (13Huang Q. Yeldandi A.V. Alvares K. Ide H. Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 6: 307-312PubMed Google Scholar, 43Chu R. Lin Y. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27670-27676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GAL-PPARγΔ12 was constructed by inserting PCR-amplified cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 174–463 of mPPARγ into EcoRI/SalI site of PGBT9 (CLONTECH). This GAL-PPARγΔ12 construct does not include the last 12 amino acids at carboxyl terminus of the mPPARγ ligand binding domain (amino acids 174–475). PCMV-PBP was generated by inserting the full-length coding region of PBP cDNA into NotI site of PCMV-FLAG-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). PCMX-PBP, for in vitro translation, was constructed by inserting the full-length PBPcDNA into the BamHI/SalI site of PCMX. To construct SK-PBT (truncated PBP consisting of residues 487–735), GST-PBP-T and PCMV-PBP-T, the partial PBP cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 487–735 was released from PGADH10-PBT clone isolated by a yeast two-hybrid system and subcloned into BamHI site of pBLUESCRIPT SK, NotI site of the modified PCMV-FLAG2, which contains a nuclear targeting signal peptide PKKKRKV, and BamHI site of pGEX-5X-2. For quantitative characterization of the interaction of PPARγ with PBP, appropriate plasmids were cotransformed into yeast HF7C, plated on selective media (containing PPARγ ligand BRL49653 at a concentration of 10−5m, or no ligand), and the plates were incubated for 4 days at 30 °C. For each assay, five colonies were suspended in 150 μl of buffer Z (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 35 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell suspension (10 μl) was diluted in 190 μl of buffer Z, and the A 600 was measured to estimate cell density. The remaining cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation, and β-galactosidase activity was determined by a chemiluminescent reporter protocol (Galacto-light kit, Tropix, Bedford, MA). PBP in PCMX was transcribed and translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. GST, GST-mPPARγ, and GST-RXRα in PGEX-3X were produced in Escherichia coli DH5α and bound to glutathione-sepharose beads according to manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). A 10 μl aliquot of GST-PPARγ fusion protein, loaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads, was incubated with 5 μl of [35S]methionine labeled full-length PBP protein for 2 h in 600 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). BRL49653 (at a final concentration of 1 × 10−5m), or 9-cis-retinoic acid (at 1 × 10−6m) was at the beginning of incubation when required. Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer, eluted by boiling for 2 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. To assay the binding of PPARα, RARα, and TRβ1 to PBP, a truncated fragment of PBP (from amino acids 487–735) which contains a putative PPARγ-binding domain was generated in E. coli, using the expression plasmid GST-PBPT, and allowed to interact with [35S]methionine-labeled PPARα, RARα, or TRβ1 produced in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte translation system. The binding was assayed in the presence or absence of specific ligands: Wy-14643 (1 × 10−4m) for PPARα, 9-cis- retinoic acid (1 × 10−6m) for RARα, and T3 (1 × 10−6m) for TRβ1. Bound proteins were washed three times with binding buffer, NETN, eluted, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. NIH3T3 or CV-1 cells (1 × 105), were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum or fetal calf serum in six-well plates, respectively, and cultured for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected for 5 h with 1.25 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid DNA, 0.75 μg of appropriate expression plasmid DNA, and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ (CLONTECH) DNA using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate-mediated transfection method (Boehringer Mannheim). Cell extracts were prepared 36 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Fifty nanograms of PBP cDNA were random-primed and used as a probe to hybridize mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). For in situ hybridization, mouse embryos from embryonic (E)9.5 days and E13.5 days and adult mouse tissues were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16–20 h at 4 °C and processed as described previously (44Alvares K. Subbarao V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both sense and antisense PBP riboprobes were generated with [α-35S]dUTP (Amersham Corp.) with T3 and T7 polymerases from pSKPBPT. Hybridization, washing, and examination of results were as described elsewhere (44Alvares K. Subbarao V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To identify novel factors involved in PPAR signaling, we employed a yeast two-hybrid assay that would detect proteins interacting with PPARγ. Of the 13 positive clones that interacted with PPARγ, two represented the overlapping sequences of mSRC-1 (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and characterization of the full-length mSRC-1 cDNA showed that SRC-1 acted as a PPARγ coactivator (42Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the characterization of two other overlapping clones, 759 and 2116 bp in size, respectively, that represented a second cDNA. Since these two clones did not contain the full-length cDNA, we used RACE PCR to obtain the remaining 5′-end and 3′-end sequences. The nucleotide sequence of putative full-length composite cDNA is shown in Fig.1. The cDNA, 5676 bp in length, contains a short 5′ (120 bp)- and a long 3′ (996 bp)-untranslated region and an open reading frame of 4680 which encodes a peptide of 1560 amino acids with the predicted molecular mass of the protein of 165 kDa. This protein was designated PBP (PPAR-binding protein) to signify its ability to bind PPARs. The start of the coding sequence was defined by the first ATG downstream of an in-frame stop codon at position −66. The sequences (GTAAGATGAGCTCC) surrounding ATG essentially conform to a consensus sequence for the translation initiation site (45Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The two partial cDNAs isolated by the two-hybrid system represented amino acid residues 487–739, and 626–1297 of PBP, respectively. Comparison of the deduced primary structure of the PBP protein with sequences in the data base revealed that the central domain of the full-length PBP cDNA shows 90% similarity to TRIP2, a 250-bp cDNA fragment isolated from human HeLa cDNA library by the two-hybrid system using TRβ1 as a bait (46Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 9: 243-254Google Scholar). Information on the full-length cDNA sequence of this TRIP-2, and its role in receptor signaling is not available. TRIP-2 cDNA fragment corresponds with the 607–686-amino acid stretch of the full-length mouse PBP. PBP contains two LXXLL (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) motifs which are at 589–593, and 630–634 amino acids, respectively. LXXLL has been recently identified as a signature motif in transcriptional coactivators that mediates binding to nuclear receptors (37Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K.

A third motif in reverse orientation (LLXXL) is present at 4–8 amino acids (Fig. 1).Figure 1The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of PBP cDNA.

PGADH10-PBPT, which was isolated the by two-hybrid system and expressed as the fusion protein between the GAL4 activation domain and truncated PBP (from 487 to 739 amino acids) in yeast, was co-transformed with GAL-PPARγ into yeast HF7C, and the β-galactosidase activity measured as an indication of the relative strength of the interaction in the presence or absence of ligand. The interaction between PPARγ and PBP resulted in a 48-fold increase in the β-galactosidase activity and this interaction is enhanced approximately 2-fold in the presence of ligand (Fig.2). Thus, the ligand can moderately increase the affinity of the interaction. The extreme carboxyl-terminal region of the ligand binding domain conserved among the nuclear receptors appears essential for the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. Deletion of this region reduces the transcriptional activation, but does not affect the ligand binding activity. To ascertain whether this region is important to the binding of mPPARγ with PBP, we used GAL-PPARγΔ12, which lacks the last 12 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the PPARγ ligand binding domain, to cotransform with PGADH10-PBPT into yeast HF7C. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of PBP did not increase the β-galactosidase activity over the control in the presence or absence of ligand, suggesting that the mutant PPARγ is unable to bind with PBP. To determine whether PBP directly interacts with PPARγ, in vitro binding was assayed with bacterially generated fusion protein of GST with PPARγ (GST-PPARγ) and in vitro translated PBP. A matrix-bound GST-PPARγ, but not GST alone, retained radiolabeled PBP in the presence or absence of PPARγ ligand (Fig.3 A). The presence of BRL49653, a PPARγ ligand in the assay mixture, increased the physical interaction (Fig. 3). We also examined the ability of PBP to bind with PPAR heterodimerization partner, RXR. As shown in Fig. 3 A(lanes 3 and 5), a matrix bound fusion protein of GST-RXRα, but not GST alone, retained [S35]methionine-labeled PBP, and the presence of RXR ligand, 9-ci"
https://openalex.org/W2040483955,"Activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a key determinant of sodium homeostasis and blood pressure. Liddle's syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension, is caused by mutations that delete or alter PY domains in the carboxyl termini of β or γ ENaC subunits, leading to increased channel activity. In this study we investigated the mechanism of this effect by analysis of wild-type and mutant ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes. By inhibiting insertion of new channels into the plasma membrane with brefeldin A, we demonstrate that the half-life of the activity of channels containing Liddle's mutations is markedly prolonged compared with wild-type channels (t½ of 30 h in mutant versus 3.6 in wild-type, p < 0.001). We investigated the involvement of clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis by co-expressing a dominant-negative dynamin mutant with wild-type ENaC in oocytes. Expression of this specific inhibitor of endocytosis leads to a large increase in the activity of wild-type channels, demonstrating that normal turnover of this channel is through the clathrin-coated pit pathway. In contrast, co-expression of Liddle's mutations and dynamin mutants leads to no further increase in channel activity, consistent with one of the effects of Liddle's mutations being the loss of endocytosis of these channels. These findings demonstrate the normal mechanism of turnover of ENaC from the cell surface and demonstrate a mechanism that can account for the increased number of channels in the plasma membrane seen in Liddle's syndrome.

These findings demonstrate the normal mechanism of turnover of ENaC from the cell surface and demonstrate a mechanism that can account for the increased number of channels in the plasma membrane seen in Liddle's syndrome.

The channel is regulated by hormones such as aldosterone, insulin, and antidiuretic hormone that increase its activity by diverse mechanisms including increase in channel synthesis, incorporation of channels from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, and induction of post-translational modifications of the channel proteins (1Eaton D.C. Becchetti A. Ma H. Ling B.N. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There are fewer known mechanisms that decrease sodium permeability in cells expressing ENaC. Recently, there have been several studies that implicate the carboxyl terminus of the channel subunits in processes that normally down-regulate its activity. Mutations in the human genes of the β and γ subunits cause a form of salt-sensitive hypertension known as Liddle's syndrome (2Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H.

Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase in sodium permeability induced by Liddle's mutations: an increase in the number of channels expressed at the cell surface, and an increase in the open probability (7Snyder P.M.

In this work, we sought to determine the mechanism that regulates the expression of channels at the cell surface and to investigate the role played by the carboxyl terminus in this process. As in other studies (5Tamura H. Schild L. Enomoto N. Matsui N. Marumo F. Rossier B.C. Sasaki S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1780-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Schild L.

A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), we have used Xenopus oocytes to express ENaC and have measured whole-cell amiloride-sensitive sodium currents. We demonstrate that channels with carboxyl-terminal truncations of the β and γ subunits have significantly longer half-life at the plasma membrane than wild-type channels. This difference is due to a very slow rate of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the truncated channels and was reproduced by single amino acid mutations βY618A and γY628A but not by αY673A. These results indicate that the tyrosine residues present in the proline-rich motifs of the β and γ subunits encode signals recognized by the endocytic machinery and that mutations or deletions of these signals result in accumulation of channels at the plasma membrane due to reduced retrieval. Since these same residues are mutated or deleted in Liddle's syndrome, the results also explain the mechanism that increases the number of cell-surface channels in Liddle's mutants. Oocyte whole-cell currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (Oocyte Clamp C-725B, Warner Instrument Corp.). Epithelial sodium channel currents were calculated as the difference in whole-cell current before and after the addition of 10 μm amiloride to the bathing solution at a holding membrane potential of −100 mV. The bath solution contained (in millimoles/liter): 100 Na as the gluconate salt, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 4 KCl, 5 BaCl2, 5 HEPES, final pH 7.4. Results are expressed as the mean ± standard error (S.E.); n (number of observations) was equal or greater than 10 for each given value. Stage V–VI oocytes were isolated, treated with collagenase, and injected with approximately 5 ng of each cRNA, either wild-type or mutant ENaC subunits alone or co-injected with wild-type or mutant dynamin, in a final volume of 50 nl. Oocytes were kept in modified Barth's solution (MBS) (in millimoles/liter: 85 NaCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 1 KCl, 0.8 MgSO4, 0.7 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, final pH 7.4) at 19 °C until experiments were performed. To prevent sodium loading and to extend the viability of oocytes by several days, oocytes were kept in MBS solution containing 1 μm amiloride prior to experiments. DNAs were propagated in the transcription competent vector pSD5 in Escherichia coli DH5α. Capped cRNAs were transcribed in vitro from linearized cDNAs with SP6 RNA polymerase according to the instructions for the mMESSAGEmMACHINE kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). For the time-course experiments, whole-cell currents were measured every 12 h after cRNA injection for up to 120 h. In experiments where the effect of brefeldin A (BFA) was examined, oocytes were voltage-clamped 2 days after injection, when the current reached a steady state, and every 4 h after the addition of BFA. Oocytes co-injected with ENaC and dynamin were also measured 2 days after cRNA injection. The cDNAs of the carboxyl-terminal truncations of β and γ subunits were constructed by the introduction of premature stop codons at amino acid positions β564 and γ566, respectively, using polymerase chain reaction. Point mutations of tyrosine for alanine residues were generated by polymerase chain reaction as follows: αY673A, βY618A, and γY628A, according to the protocol described by Nelson et al.. (10Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced at the Yale facility using an ABI 373 automated DNA sequencer employing dye terminators following a standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). We have shown previously that injection of cRNA from the rat ENaC subunits into Xenopus oocytes generates amiloride-sensitive whole-cell sodium currents that exhibit all the functional properties of wild-type channels (12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). We examined the time course of the expression of amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents in oocytes injected with wild-type α, β, and γ subunits or with wild-type α in combination with truncated β and γ using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique as described in methods. Fig.1 shows the time course of the amiloride-sensitive current expressed by oocytes injected with all three wild-type subunits or wild-type α with truncated βR564Stop and γQ566Stop subunits. The magnitude of current of wild-type channels increased in the first 2 days, and after a plateau it started to decline. Although the length of the plateau phase was variable depending on the batch of oocytes, it was consistently followed by a decrease in current. Either inactivation of channels or a change in the ratio of delivery and retrieval to the cell surface could account for the decrease in current observed several days after injection of cRNA. Oocytes expressing wild-type α and truncated β and γ subunits exhibited 3–5-fold larger magnitude of amiloride-sensitive currents than wild-type channels as has been shown previously (6Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 56699-56703Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The time course of the current of truncated channels followed a pattern different from wild-type channels; the plateau phase extended for several days with little evidence of decrement after injection. Substitution of the truncated β and γ subunits for subunits carrying point mutations βY618A and γY628A gave similar results. Mutation of the corresponding tyrosine in the α subunit Y673A did not have a significant effect in the total magnitude or in the time course of the amiloride-sensitive current (data not shown). The time-course experiments are consistent with previous reports, showing an increase in the magnitude of the amiloride-sensitive current with truncated β and γ subunits, but more importantly they show that the behavior of the current over the time of observation is significantly different between wild-type and truncated channels. These results suggest either that truncated channels are more efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane or, alternatively, that there is a process that reduces the activity of the wild-type but not of truncated channels in the plasma membrane. To determine whether the effect of Liddle's mutations is increased delivery or decreased removal from the cell surface, we inhibited delivery of new channels to the plasma membrane by adding BFA. BFA is a fungal metabolite that inhibits the secretory pathway by blocking anterograde vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and causes redistribution of the cisternae of the Golgi complex into the endoplasmic reticulum (13Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although BFA has multiple targets in vesicular transport, it does not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the plasma membrane (14Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that BFA is active in Xenopus oocytes and that it effectively inhibits protein traffic in these cells (15Mulner-Lorillon O. Belle R. Cormier P. Drewing S. Minella O. Poulhe R. Schmalzing G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Prevention of insertion of new channels into the plasma membrane permits us to directly examine the decay of the amiloride-sensitive current with the TEVC. Fig.2 (A and B) shows the effect induced by 5 μm BFA on amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents of oocytes injected with wild-type or truncated channels. BFA was added to the incubation medium (arrow pointing down) 24–36 h after cRNA injection when the current was in the plateau phase of the time course. After the addition of BFA, the amiloride-sensitive current of oocytes expressing wild-type channels progressively decreased over 24 h, with a time course well described by a single exponential fitted with a first-order rate constant k of 0.228 that corresponds to a half-life of 3.6 h (Fig. 2 C). To verify that the decrease in current was a specific effect of BFA on vesicular traffic and not simple due to a toxic effect on cells, BFA was removed after 8 h (arrow pointing up) and the incubation was continued for another 12 h in MBS alone. Oocytes recovered amiloride-sensitive current to levels similar to those of untreated cells, demonstrating that the effect of BFA was specific and fully reversible upon removal of the drug. In contrast, BFA had very little effect on the magnitude of the amiloride-sensitive current of oocytes expressing the truncated form of the channel (Fig. 2 A); we observed only a 15% reduction in current after 20 h of treatment. The data did not fit well to a single exponential but better to a linear decay, which gave a calculated half-life of approximately 30 h, much longer than the value obtained for wild-type channels (p < 0.001). The results show that the activity of wild-type channels decreases much faster than that of truncated channels. This observation is independent of delivery of new channels to the plasma membrane and, thus, rules out the possibilities of increased RNA stability, increased rate of protein synthesis, or increased rate of delivery of newly synthesized channels to the cell surface. The decrease in current of oocytes expressing wild-type channels can be attributed either to progressive inactivation or to removal of channels from the cell surface. We therefore examined whether the decrease in the activity of wild-type channels is caused by internalization of channels from the plasma membrane via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin is a large molecular weight GTP-binding protein with high intrinsic GTPase activity that is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Jun-Ping L. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-608PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamin assembles into rings around the neck of coated pits when GTP is bound inducing fission and release of vesicles upon hydrolysis of the GTP (17Takei K. McPherson P.S. Scmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt the GTP-binding domain such as lysine 44 of dynamin (DK44) lead to inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schimid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), producing a dominant negative phenotype because assembly with wild-type dynamin arrests its function. To specifically block the process of endocytosis, we co-injected cRNAs of ENaC with either wild-type dynamin or with the dynamin mutant DK44. Two days after injection, the amiloride-sensitive current was measured with the TEVC. Oocytes co-injected with wild-type ENaC and wild-type dynamin expressed currents of similar magnitude to oocytes injected only with ENaC (Fig. 3 A). This result is consistent with previous reports that showed that an excess of wild-type dynamin does not make endocytosis a more efficient process (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schimid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In contrast, oocytes injected with wild-type ENaC and DK44 had a 3-fold increase in current (p < 0.01 compared with oocytes expressing wild-type forms of ENaC and dynamin). Neither wild-type dynamin nor DK44 co-expressed with truncated channels had an effect on the magnitude of current (Fig. 3 B). The results indicate that wild-type channels are normally removed from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that the signals recognized by the endocytic machinery are encoded in the carboxyl termini of the β and γ subunits. To prove that the endocytic signal is encoded by the tyrosine residues in the proline-rich motifs of β and γ, dynamin wild-type or DK44 were co-injected with αβYγY channels. Channels carrying mutations of the tyrosine residues in the β and γ subunits did not increase amiloride-sensitive currents when co-injected with DK44 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, mutation of the tyrosine in the proline-rich domain of the α subunit had little effect on the magnitude of currents, and channels with this mutation responded to DK44 with a significant increase in current (Fig. 3 D) (p < 0.01). These data indicate that Tyr-673 in the α subunit does not play an important role in endocytosis in contrast to the corresponding residues in β and γ. The number of subunits and the stoichiometry of mature channels have not yet been elucidated. However, since both β and γ subunits have endocytic signals, it is expected to find at least two, if not more, of these signals per channel molecule. To investigate whether the endocytic signals produce an additive effect in the recruitment of channels into clathrin-coated pits, DK44 was co-injected with αβYγ, αβγY, and αβYγY channels. Channels with βY or γY exhibited approximately 5-fold more current than wild-type channels (30.08 and 28.7 μA/oocyte, respectively compared with 5.08 μA/oocyte in wild-type), and channels with both βY and γY exhibited even more current (57.7 μA/oocyte) (Table I). Co-injection of DK44 induced a significant increase in current expressed by αβγ, αβYγ, and αβγY channels (p < 0.01), but it did not have an effect in oocytes expressing αβYγY channels. From these results, we conclude that the endocytic signals in the β and γ subunits have an additive effect in the removal of channels from the plasma membrane. Inasmuch as the number of subunits in ENaC is still unknown, we cannot say how many signals are necessary to recruit channels into clathrin-coated pits. However, the data support the notion that, at least in proteins formed by association of many subunits, more than one signal renders their endocytosis more efficient.Table IEffect of mutations of tyrosines in the proline-rich motifs of the β and γ subunits and of DK44 in the magnitude of amiloride-sensitive currentsαβγαβγ + DK44αβYγαβYγ + DK44αβγYαβγY + DK44αβYγYαβYγY + DK44I(μA/oocyte)5.0822.9930.8443.9128.736.3257.7254.11S.E.0.882.403.403.932.925.215.056.27n121113912101411p<0.001<0.01<0.01NS Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated that one of the mechanisms for the increase of sodium current seen in channels bearing Liddle's mutations is a prolonged half-life at the cell surface due to a defect in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and that Tyr-618 in β and Tyr-628 in γ subunits are necessary for internalization of wild-type channels. The ability of oocytes expressing truncated channels to maintain high levels of channel activity 5 days after injection in contrast to the rapid decay of the wild-type channels demonstrates that, in a time-dependent fashion, the defect of truncated channels is in the pathway leading to the removal from the cell surface. The internalization signals of many receptors that are removed from the plasma membrane via clathrin-coated pits are short linear arrays of four amino acids that contain a tyrosine residue conforming to the sequences NPXY or YXXL (where X is any polar amino acid), both present in the carboxyl termini of the subunits of ENaC. Despite their poorly conserved sequence, tyrosine-based internalization signals adopt a sharp turn conformation that is necessary for recognition by the endocytic machinery (19Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) specifically the AP-2 adaptor complex (20Rapoport I. Miyazali M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amino acids Tyr-618 in β and Tyr-628 in γ, present in the sequences PPNYDSL and PPRYNSL, respectively, induce turns according to the predicted secondary structure of the proteins (21Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar). Substitutions by alanine residues induce loss of the turns in the carboxyl termini of β and γ as is shown in Fig. 4. Although the α subunit sequence PPAYATL also has a tyrosine, the mutant αY673A neither increases the magnitude of amiloride-sensitive current nor alters the predicted secondary structure of the carboxyl terminus. This indicates that the carboxyl terminus of α does not contain an internalization signal, consistent with the absence of mutations in the α subunit in patients with Liddle's syndrome. In all three subunits, the tyrosine residues are shared by two adjacent endocytic signals, NPXY and YXXL. Amino acids distal to the tyrosine have been examined previously by alanine mutagenesis with only minor functional effects (22Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), indicating that the preferred endocytic signals are the ones containing the proline residues. The rate of decay of the amiloride-sensitive current in oocytes expressing wild-type channels corresponds to a half-life of 3.6 h. This value does not strictly represent the rate of endocytosis, as recycling of endosomes back to the plasma membrane may result in underestimation of the rate of endocytosis (16Jun-Ping L. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-608PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of ENaC that is internalized from the plasma membrane and delivered directly to the lysosomes is not known. For other proteins, the percentage varies greatly; it can be as low as 3% for transferrin and low density lipoprotein and as high as 90% for the epidermal growth factor receptor, where internalization constitutes an important mechanism for down-regulation of receptors. In contrast to wild-type channels, the rate of decrease of amiloride-sensitive current in the truncated form is approximately 8–10-fold slower than for wild-type. It can be argued that truncated channels are normally endocytosed but the lack of a degradation signal allows them to evade targeting to the lysosomes and endocytic vesicles containing truncated channels could be recycled back to the plasma membrane. Such a degradation signal could be ubiquitination-mediated by Nedd4, a putative ubiquitin ligase that interacts with the PY motifs of the channel, as has been proposed recently (22Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 23Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

The finding that wild-type channels are normally removed from the cell surface by clathrin-mediated endocytosis suggests that this may constitute a physiological mechanism used by cells to decrease the sodium permeability of the plasma membrane. In addition, it demonstrates that one of the underlying processes that increases the activity of truncated channels is a larger expression at the cell surface due to the loss of the internalization/degradation signals in the carboxyl termini of the β and γ subunits. Inhibition of endocytosis of wild-type channels by co-expression with mutant dynamin resulted in a 3-fold increase in activity, slightly smaller than that of the truncated channels. Expression of mutant dynamin is expected to markedly inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis but not to abolish it completely, inasmuch as it interacts with the endogenous endocytic machinery of the oocyte. Therefore, the experiments may underestimate the contribution of endocytosis in increasing the amiloride-sensitive current. Alternatively, the inability of dynamin mutant to increase the current to the same levels expressed by truncated channels may be due to an additional effect produced by the truncations, such as an increase in open probability as has been proposed previously (8Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, the striking similarity in the activity of truncated channels with wild-type channels when clathrin-coated pit endocytosis has been inhibited, in conjunction with the known requirement of NPXY for endocytosis, leads us to infer that the Liddle's defect may not require a second mechanism. Further experiments will be necessary to directly examine changes in degradation and the kinetics of truncated channels. We thank P. De Camilli for wild-type and mutant dynamin cDNAs."

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10646-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Oh Y. Nagalla S.R. Yamanaka Y. Kim H.-S. Wilson E. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30322-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Only a small fraction of unbound IGF-I and IGF-II remain in the circulation, the majority is bound to specific IGFBPs. IGFBP-3 is the major binding protein in human serum and serves as a carrier for the IGFs, prolonging their half-life in the circulation and maintaining an IGF reservoir (5Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In addition IGFBP-3 is secreted by a number of cell types and can directly modulate IGF actions in tissues (6Neely K. Rosenfeld R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both inhibiting and enhancing effects of IGFBP-3 on IGF-I action have been reported; inhibition appears to result from soluble IGFBP-3 sequestering IGF-I and preventing receptor interaction. One possible mechanism for potentiation of IGF-I action is by the cell surface binding of IGFBP-3 facilitating the binding of IGF-I to its receptor (7Conover C.A. Ronk M. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2795-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest an inhibitory role for IGFBP-3 that is independent of IGF-I. Purified mouse IGFBP-3 has been shown to bind to the chick embryo fibroblast cell surface and inhibit cell growth (9Delbe J. Villaudy J. Blat C. Desauty G. Golde A. Harel L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Oh et al. (10Oh Y. Muller M.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Oh Y. Muller M.L. Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated the presence of specific IGFBP-3 binding sites on the surface of the breast cancer cells, Hs578T, and have shown that exogenous IGFBP-3 can inhibit monolayer growth in these cells by a mechanism that is IGF-independent. One of the aims of this study was to determine if the inhibitory action of IGFBP-3 in the Hs578T cells was as a result of apoptosis. Cell growth is a balance between proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis occurs in individual cells and is a strictly controlled, genetically regulated program operating under physiological conditions. It consists of a series of distinctive morphological changes: early nuclear compaction, cytoplasmic condensation followed by extensive nuclear fragmentation, after which the cell disintegrates into discrete membrane-bound apoptotic bodies that are engulfed by neighboring cells or phagocytic cells (12Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12926) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppresser gene is involved in the control of cell growth, and over-expression of this gene induces stimulation of cell death pathways (13Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 14Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that p53 may regulate IGFBP-3 expression; over-expression of cellular p53 in EB1 colon carcinoma cells can induce the synthesis and secretion of a biologically active form of IGFBP-3 that can inhibit cell growth (15Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The link between p53 and IGFBP-3 suggests a potential role for the latter in p53-mediated cellular growth control. In addition to investigating the possibility that IGFBP-3 could induce apoptosis directly in Hs578T cells, there was also the possibility that it could modulate the signal pathway of a physiological trigger of programmed cell death. To investigate the latter, we established a cell model for inducible apoptosis. There are numerous agents available to induce apoptosis; however, not all act via physiological signaling pathways with which possible modulators, such as IGFBP-3, could interact. The sphingomyelin pathway in cells mediates the signaling for programmed cell death induced by radiation and several cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β. These cytokines stimulate cell surface receptors activating a plasma membrane sphingomyelinase that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to generate ceramide and phosphocholine. The ceramide then acts as a second messenger to activate the apoptotic process (16Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The precise downstream signaling events are presently unclear. Studies have shown that elevation of cellular ceramide levels by addition of synthetic ceramide analogues or bacterial sphingomyelinase mimicked tumor necrosis factor α action to induce apoptosis (17Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Witty J.P. Bridgham J.T. Johnson A.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5269-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present work, a synthetic ceramide analogue C2 was used to induce apoptosis in the human breast cancer cell line Hs578T. This enabled us to investigate the possibility that IGFBP-3-induced inhibition of cell growth was due to enhancement of a physiological signal pathway for programmed cell death. Recombinant human non-glycosylated IGFBP-3 (ngIGFBP-3) was a kind gift from Dr. C. Maack, Celtrix, CA. Recombinant human IGF-I and the IGF-I analogues DES 1–3 IGF-1 and LR3IGF-1 were purchased from GroPep Adelaide, Australia. The ceramide analogue C2 was purchased from Sigma Corp. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Corp. Tissue culture plastics were obtained from Nunc, Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland. The human breast cancer cell line Hs578T was purchased from ECACC, Porton Down, Wiltshire, UK and were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax-1 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (5000 IU/ml), and streptomycin (5 mg/ml) growth media (GM). Experiments were performed on cells in serum-free HEPES, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's nutrient mix F-12 (SFM) with sodium bicarbonate (0.12%), bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml), transferrin (0.01 mg/ml), and supplemented as before. The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay that crudely measures cell viability. MTT is a yellow-colored tetrazolium that is taken up and cleaved only by metabolically active cells, reducing it to a colored, water-insoluble formazan salt. Once the formazan has been solubilized, it can be easily and rapidly read in a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at 595 nm. The absorbance directly correlates with cell number. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml (150 μl/well) in 96-well plates and grown for 24 h in GM. All plates were switched to SFM (100 μl/well) for 24 h prior to dosing. Plates were dosed as described under “Results” for the appropriate incubation times. Following this, MTT reagent (7.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline was added (10 μl/well), and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of acidified Triton buffer (0.1 m HCl, 10% (v/v) Triton X-100; 50 μl/well), and the tetrazolium crystals were dissolved by mixing on a Titertek plate shaker at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were measured on a Bio-Rad 450 plate reader at a test wavelength of 595 nm and a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of 5 wells from one experiment that is representative of experiments repeated at least three times. The results are optical density readings expressed as a percentage of controls. Cells were seeded at 0.5 × 106 cells/T25 flask and grown in GM for 24 h before switching to SFM for a further 24 h. The cells were dosed as described under “Results.” For analysis, both the floating cells in the supernatant and the phosphate-buffered saline wash were collected from each flask prior to trypsinization. Trypsinized cells were then added to the previous collected solutions. To assess cell viability, aliquots of cells were mixed with trypan blue (1:1) and loaded onto a hemocytometer, and the percentage of dead cells per sample was calculated. Each sample of cells was then fixed in 70% ethanol for a minimum of 24 h prior to analysis by flow cytometry. The fixed cells were pelleted (6000 rpm; 5 min) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (6000 rpm; 5 min). The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in reaction buffer (0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.02 mg/ml RNase A, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.3) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min prior to measurement on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson) by an argon laser at 488 nm for excitation. The data were analyzed using the Cell Quest software package (Becton & Dickinson). To determine that C2-induced cell death gave rise to the classical morphological features associated with apoptosis, an aliquot of cells was taken from untreated and treated cells following the appropriate incubation times. The cells were cytospun and stained with the Wright stain in an automated stainer (19Lillie R.D. H. J. Conn's Biological Stains. 9th Ed. Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, MD1977: 605-606Google Scholar). Photomicrographs were taken of the cells under oil immersion at a magnification× 100. From the T25 flasks set up to determine flow cytometry and cell viability, the supernatants were collected and the cells spun out. The remaining solution was concentrated 10-fold using Millipore Ultrafree-MC filter units. The pattern of IGF-binding proteins secreted by the cells in response to various treatments and subsequent immunoblotting of the membranes for IGFBP-3 was determind using the methods described previously (20Coulson V.J. Wass J.A.H. Abdulla A.F. Cotterill A.M. Holly J.M.P. Growth Regulation. 1991; 1: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cwyfan-Hughes S.C. Johnson M.R. Heinrich G. Holly J.M.P. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were then transferred onto a nylon membrane and probed with a mixture of125I-labeled IGF-I and 125I-labeled IGF-II. The same nylon membranes were then incubated with a specific polyclonal antibody for IGFBP-3 (SCH-2/6 at 1:15000) overnight at room temperature. Following the removal of excess unbound antibody, an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma, at 1:10000) was added for 1 h. Binding of the peroxidase was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer instructions (Amersham International). The data were analyzed using the Microsoft Excel Version 4.0a software package. Significant effects were determined using Student's t-test. A statistically significant difference was considered to be present at p < 0.05. We first investigated the response of the Hs578T cells to exogenous IGF-I and ngIGFBP-3 in the MTT assay. Fig.1 A shows that exogenously added IGF-I did not stimulate cell proliferation following 24 and 48 h incubation periods, even at the highest concentrations of IGF-I (1000 ng/ml). Exogenously added ngIGFBP-3 (Fig. 1 B) caused cell growth inhibition following the same incubation periods although the effect was only small. After 48 h at 1000 ng/ml, this growth inhibition (∼30%) was significant (p < 0.001) in comparison with untreated cells. The ceramide analogue, C2 was used as an apoptotic trigger in the Hs578T cells. The cells were dosed with C2 (1–30 μm) for 24 h and assayed for MTT activity (Fig.2), as a crude measurement of cell viability. C2 caused a dose-dependent decrease in metabolic activity of the cells. To establish that the decrease in metabolic activity seen with C2 was due to cell death, trypan blue uptake by dead cells was determined using a hemocytometer, and the percentage of dead cells in a given sample was calculated. Fig. 3 illustrates such an experiment in which cells were incubated with 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 10 μm concentrations of C2 for 24 h. It is evident that C2 causes a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of dead cells. The effect was significant from a dose of 4 μm C2 (p < 0.001). To establish that the cell death induced by C2 was due to programmed cell death, a number of different techniques were employed. This technique was used to quantitate the amount of apoptosis present in any given sample. Apoptotic cells have a lower DNA content than normal cells and appear as a pre-G1peak on a DNA cell-cycle histogram. Fig. 4illustrates the percentage of cells in the pre-G1 peak of samples treated with 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 10 μm C2 for 24 h. There was a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells with increasing dose of C2. The 4 μm dose of C2 caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of cells in the pre-G1phase of the cell cycle when compared with untreated cells. Fig.5 A represents a normal untreated Hs578T cell. The progression of a cell through the different morphological stages of apoptosis, following treatment with 5 μm C2 for 24 h, is represented in Fig. 5,B-D. C2-induced apoptosis in Hs578T cells exhibits the classical morphological features of apoptosis. To determine if IGF-I can prevent C2-induced cell death in Hs578T cells, the cells were incubated with C2 (1–30 μm) with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-I, 100 ng/ml DES 1–3 IGF-I, and 100 ng/ml LR3 IGF-I for 24 h and then assayed for MTT activity (Fig.6). Both of the IGF-I analogues, DES 1–3 IGF-I and LR3 IGF-I, bind to the IGF-I receptor. However, DES 1–3 IGF-I only binds IGFBP-3 with a third of the affinity of IGF-I and LR3 IGF-I does not bind any of the binding proteins. From the figure, it is evident that IGF-I cannot prevent C2-induced cell death in Hs578T cells. In addition, this lack of an IGF-I effect is not due to interference from endogenous IGFBPs since the IGF analogues behaved in a similar manner to IGF-I. Even though ngIGFBP-3 alone had no marked inhibitory effect on Hs578T cell growth, we considered that it may be able to interact with the apoptotic pathway initiated by the ceramide analogue, C2, in these cells. This was examined at a low dose of C2 (2 μm), which elicited a minimal growth inhibitory effect in the MTT assay, and at a high dose (5 μm), which cells were coincubated with ngIGFBP-3 (1–100 ng/ml) and C2 (2 or 5 μm) for 24 h with or without a prior 24-h preincubation with ngIGFBP-3 (1–100 ng/ml; Fig.7, A and B). It was clear that a 24-h preincubation (Fig. 7 A) with ngIGFBP-3 dramatically accentuated the growth inhibitory effect of both 2 and 5 μm C2, almost completely abolishing metabolic activity at both doses when 100 ng/ml of ngIGFBP-3 was used. To determine if ngIGFBP-3-accentuated C2 induced cell death by causing an increase in the amount of programmed cell death, cells treated with 0 or 4 μm C2, or 100 ng/ml ngIGFBP-3, or coincubated with 4 μm C2 and 100 ng/ml ngIGFBP-3 with or without a 24-h preincubation with 100 ng/ml ngIGFBP-3 were analyzed for the pre-G1 apoptotic peak by flow cytometry (Fig. 8). The 4 μm dose of C2 caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percent of cells in the pre-G1 peak when compared with the control. The cells treated with the 24-h preincubation with 100 ng/ml ngIGFBP-3 prior to the coincubation with 4 μm C2 and 100 ng/ml ngIGFBP-3 have a highly significant increase in the percent of cells in the pre-G1 peak in comparison with both untreated (p < 0.001) and 4 μm C2-treated cells (p < 0.001). Preliminary results indicate that after concentrating the conditioned media 10-fold, the Hs578T cells secrete just detectable traces of IGFBP-3 following addition of C2. With addition of exogenous ngIGFBP-3 to the Hs578T cells for 24 and 48 h, a number of IGFBP-3 fragments (13, 19, and 20 kDa) were seen in addition to the intact material in the conditioned media (data not shown). These results would suggest that the exogenously added ngIGFBP-3 is being processed by a protease produced by the cells. To maintain tissue homeostasis, a balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death is essential; in tumors this balance is obviously lost. The IGFs are the most prevalent growth factors in the body that, as well as being general mitogens, are also potent survival factors for many cells and can therefore impact on both aspects of this tissue balance. Studies of transplantable tumors in vivo and of cell transformations in vitro have shown that activation of the IGF-I receptor plays a critical role in malignant transformation. The IGF-I receptor is overexpressed in many human tumors, and while a decrease in the number of IGF-IR is associated with massive apoptosis, overexpression of IGF-IR protects cells from apoptosis (22Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar). The IGFBPs are a complex family of seven closely related proteins that act as modulators of IGF availability (3Shimasaki S. Shimonaka M. Zhang H.P. Ling N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10646-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Oh Y. Nagalla S.R. Yamanaka Y. Kim H.-S. Wilson E. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30322-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition to the ability to both potentiate and inhibit the action of the IGFs (23Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is becoming increasingly apparent that a number of IGFBPs can exert IGF-independent effects. IGFBP-1 has been shown to specifically bind to the α5β1 integrin receptor on the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells and stimulates cell migration, independently of the IGFs (24Jones J.L. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A direct growth inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 has been shown in Hs578T mammary cells. The binding protein binds to specific sites on the cell surface and directly inhibits growth of these cells in an IGF-independent manner (11Oh Y. Muller M.L. Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β stimulates IGFBP-3 production and has an anti-proliferative effect on breast epithelial cells; this inhibition is lost if the increase in IGFBP-3 production is blocked (25Huynh H. Yang X. Pollak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1016-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Despite the structural and functional similarities among the seven IGFBPs, there are numerous differences that may allow for such specific IGF-independent actions, and this may explain the requirement for such a variety of different binding proteins. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers (26Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7478) Google Scholar). It is linked to growth regulatory processes including cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis (14Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified IGFBP-3 to be a p53-regulated target gene. Induction of IGFBP-3 expression by wild-type p53 leads to an active form of IGFBP-3 capable of inhibiting cell growth (15Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). This suggests that there may be a link between p53 and IGFBP-3 in regulating cellular growth, transformation, and survival. In this study we have demonstrated that an analogue (C2) of ceramide, which is a physiological mediator of programmed cell death, induces apoptosis in Hs578T breast cancer cells as assessed by morphological criteria and flow cytometry. In these cells, exogenously added ngIGFBP-3 had only a small direct growth inhibitory effect. We have also shown that the Hs578T cells are nonresponsive to the IGFs in terms of both proliferation and cell survival. However, a preincubation with ngIGFBP-3 accentuated the apoptotic response of these cells to C2. These results indicate that IGFBP-3 can interact with the apoptotic pathway initiated by ceramide in an IGF-independent manner. The added IGFBP-3 was proteolytically modified by the cells, and it is not clear whether the enhanced apoptosis was effected by the intact IGFBP-3 or a fragment thereof. A fragment of IGFBP-3 has recently been reported to inhibit the growth of chick embryo fibroblasts (27Lalou C. Lassarre C. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3206-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus IGFBP-3 may not only be a passive modulator of the IGF-induced mitogenic and survival signals but could also be an active regulator of a process that counterbalances these effects. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 are the most prevalent growth factor and the most prevalent binding protein, respectively; they are normally present in the body in association with each other in equimolar concentrations. This association may represent a balance between a survival signal and a signal for apoptosis; this balance may play an important role in tissue homestasis. We are grateful to Dr A. E. Wakeling for helpful advice. We are also grateful to Dr C. Maack (Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, CA) for kindly providing the recombinant IGFBP-3."
https://openalex.org/W2073484019,"To elucidate the physiological role of human stromelysin-3 (hST-3) in tumor progression and/or wound healing, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) was analyzed as a potential physiological substrate. hST-3 proteolysis generates two fragments of 16 and 9 kDa that react with IGFBP-1 monoclonal antibody, although they do not bind insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in ligand blot. N-terminal sequencing shows that hST-3 cleaves IGFBP-1 at the His140-Val141 bond located in the IGFBP-1 midregion. We show that IGFBP-1 inhibits IGF-I-induced survival and proliferation of BAF/3 cells, as well as IGF-I-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Co-incubation of the IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complex with hST-3 restores IGF-I-induced proliferation and PI 3-K kinase activity in these cells. BAF/3 proliferation is significantly increased with the hST-3-treated IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complex compared with that obtained using IGF-I alone. To produce this enhanced proliferation, IGF-I must bind to IGFBP-1 before hST-3 proteolysis, demonstrated using an IGF-I variant that does not bind IGFBP. IGFBP-1 also inhibits IGF-I-induced proliferation of the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, and this inhibition was not seen in hST-3-transfected MCF-7 cells. Such proteolysis may thus play a role in in vivo tumor progression. These results indicate that hST-3 may regulate IGF-I bioavailability by proteolyzing IGFBP, thus favoring cell survival and proliferation.

Proteolysis is central to the regulation of a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of the matrix metalloproteinases is controlled by their expression as proenzymes that are processed to active forms through proteolysis, as well as by specific physiological tissue inhibitors (TIMP). MMP are believed to mediate many biological processes in which tissue remodeling is implicated, such as embryo implantation and morphogenesis, cell migration, metastasis, tumor invasion, and wound healing (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Human stromelysin-3 (hST-3, MMP-11) was first described in fibroblasts surrounding neoplastic cells in both primary and metastatic breast tumors, and classified as an MMP on the basis of sequence homology (4Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). High ST-3 expression has been correlated with increased local tumor aggressiveness (5Wolf C. Rouyer N. Lutz Y. Adida C. Loriot M. Bellocq J.P. Chambon P. Basset P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Linder S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that hST-3 expression promotes tumor formation in nude mice (7Noël A.C. Lefebvre O.

Putative mature forms of hST-3 nevertheless appear unable to degrade any major ECM component (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

Several insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) have been described as MMP substrates. MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 degrade IGFBP-3 (14Fowlkes J.L. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Nagase H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1991; 148: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Identification of new hST-3 substrates is a necessary step for the understanding of its physiological relevance. To date, hST-3 proteolytic activity has been described only for the nonspecific MMP substrates β-casein and α2-macroglobulin. When physiologically relevant substrates were sought among tumor cell line-derived secretory products, the unique major hST-3 target molecule was α1-protease inhibitor (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that hST-3in vivo may contribute to tumor cell survival rather than to tumor invasion (7Noël A.C. Lefebvre O. Maquoi E. VanHoorde L. Chenard M.P. Mareel M. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); this effect on cell viability may thus be mediated by regulating the activity of survival factors such as IGF-I or -II. As a part of a larger study of the relationship between hST-3 and IGF axis on tumor cell proliferation and survival, we tested whether hST-3 might act as an IGFBP-1 protease, thus controlling IGF-I activity at the cellular level. Our data show that (i) IGFBP-1 is a substrate for hST-3 in vitro and in vivo, (ii) this protease produces a single cleavage site in the midregion of IGFBP-1, and (iii) the proteolytic cleavage modifies IGFBP-1 affinity for IGF-I which, in turn, causes the recovery of the IGF-I biological activity. This supports the idea that hST-3 may control IGF bioavailability in the immediate area surrounding the tumor or regenerating tissue, favoring cell survival in a tissue environment not initially permissive for cell growth. Recombinant hST-3 (MMP-11), human stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), matrilysin (MMP-7), and gelatinase A (MMP-2) were expressed in the baculovirus system as described (21López de Turiso J.A. Fernández P.

Recombinant human IGF-I, des(1–3)IGF-I, and rhIGFBP-1 were from Peptide Hormones (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Stockholm, Sweden), and IGF-I was biotinylated as described (24Wofsy L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 472-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The anti-hST-3 polyclonal antiserum2 and the anti-IGFBP-1 mAb KW5A3 3S. Mañes, L. Kremer, C. Gomez-Mouton, B. Vangbo, R. Llodis, and C. Martı́nez-A, manuscript in preparation. were obtained in our laboratory; the anti-IGF-I mAb KM5A1, which recognizes IGF-I after binding to either IGFBP or IGF-1R, has been previously described (25Mañes S. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Mark C. Llopis R. Martı́nez-A C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10), a polyclonal antibody to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit (anti-p85) and anti-rat insulin substrate-1 (IRS-1) mAb were obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Urokinase, plasmin, aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, β-mercaptoethanol, agarose-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (strep-PO) were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Thymidine, [γ-32P]ATP, peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (SAM-PO), nitrocellulose sheets, and the ECL detection system were from Amersham. ProBlot membranes were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) micelles from Avanti Polar Lipids (Burlington, AL). IGFBP-1 was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Brij-35) with the proteases. Stromelysin-1, matrilysin, and gelatinase A were added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, plasmin at 1 μg/ml, urokinase at 1.3 units/ml, and hST-3 at 10 and 100 μg/ml. When indicated, BB-94, aprotinin, or TIMP-2 were included in the mixture. Reactions were terminated by addition of sample buffer with or without the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and resolved in 15–20% SDS-PAGE. Western ligand blots were performed after sample transfer to nitrocellulose membranes by incubation with biotinylated IGF-I (2.5 μg/ml) in PBS-Tween 20 (0.05% v/v) plus 1% (w/v) BSA, followed by strep-PO incubation and ECL. The filters were stripped using standard protocols and reprobed with either anti-IGFBP-1 mAb KW3A5 or anti-hST-3 polyclonal antibody diluted in 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in PBS-Tween 20 (0.1% v/v). Reactions were developed using SAM-PO followed by ECL. The human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line was transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation using pREP9-ST3, an expression vector containing hST-3 cDNA (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. S. J. Weiss, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) or the pREP9 vector as a control. MCF-7 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum and, after 48 h, the cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml). Clonal cell lines were maintained in selective media. Positive clones were screened in Northern and Western blot analyses using an hST-3 cDNA probe and a polyclonal antiserum against the full-length hST-3 form, respectively. Murine IL-3-dependent BAF/3 cells (26Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10% conditioned medium from the IL-3-producing cell line WEHI-3B (WEHI-CM). Cell growth assays were performed under serum-free conditions as described (25Mañes S. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Mark C. Llopis R. Martı́nez-A C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BAF/3 or MCF-7 cells (2 × 104cells/well) were seeded in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, containing l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate as above and 0.5% BSA. In BAF/3 cell experiments, 5% WEHI-CM, IGF-I, des(1–3)IGF-I, IGFBP-1, or the IGFBP-1·IGF-I and IGFBP-1·des(1–3)IGF-I complexes were incubated for 18 h with hST-3 (0–50 μg/ml) as described above before being added to cells. In MCF-7 cell experiments, either IGF-I or IGF-I preincubated with IGFBP-1 were added to the starved cells. After 20 h, cells were pulsed for either 4 h (for BAF/3 cells) or 24 h (for MCF-7 cells) with 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine and nuclei were harvested on glass fiber filters using a cell harvester. DNA [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The results are the mean and S.D. of three independent experiments. BAF/3 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 3 h at 107cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 1% (w/v) BSA. Cells were stimulated for the indicated times at 37 °C with IGF-I, IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complex, or IGF-I·IGFBP-1 treated with hST-3. After stimulation, cells were cooled to 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold RPMI, and homogenized with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 145 mm NaCl) supplemented with a phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixture for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were then cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min) and immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-I mAb KM5A1 and agarose-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and the immunoprecipitated proteins resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, filters were incubated with PO-anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-IRS-1, and anti-p85 antibodies. Stripping steps were as above. The assay of PI 3-kinase activity on BAF/3 cells was performed as described previously (27Mérida I. Dı́ez E. Gaulton G.N. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2202-2207PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, twice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mLiCl, 100 μm Na3VO4 and twice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Pellets were then resuspended in 25 μl of Tris buffer containing PI micelles at 0.2 mg/ml. After preincubation (5 min, 25 °C), the kinase reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), 200 μm adenosine, and 20 mmMgCl2, and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 25 °C. During this incubation period, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate formation rate was constant. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl and 200 μl of a methanol:chloroform mixture (1:1, v/v). Extracted phospholipids were resolved in thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Silica Gel 60, Merck) on 1% oxalate-coated plates and developed in chloroform:methanol:water:ammonia (60:47:11.3:3.2, v/v). The radioactive products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning laser densitrometry. IGFBP-1 (10 μg) was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in assay buffer with hST-3 (10 μg) in a final volume of 60 μl and the reaction terminated by adding reducing sample buffer. The sample was resolved in 20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a ProBlot membrane, and stained for 1 min with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol. The membrane was destained overnight with 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol, and the filter washed in distilled water. Desired bands were N-terminal sequenced by automated Edman degradation (TOPLAB, München, Germany). We have tested the ability of several MMP and serine proteinases, known to degrade other IGFBP, to proteolyze IGFBP-1. All enzymes tested, with the exception of urokinase, degrade IGFBP-1 (Fig.1). Stromelysin-1, matrilysin, and hST-3 show a similar degradation pattern, with 16- and 9-kDa immunoreactive bands; gelatinase A and plasmin generate a major band of approximately 21 kDa. The fact that urokinase does not degrade IGFBP-1 is not due to loss of enzyme activity, as it proteolyzes other substrates (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first description of hST-3 proteolytic activity on IGFBP; we thus undertook detailed characterization of IGFBP-1 proteolysis by this enzyme. To demonstrate that hST-3 cleavage of IGFBP-1 is specific, several MMP (BB-94 and TIMP-2) and serine protease inhibitors (aprotinin) were used. BB-94 and TIMP-2 inhibit IGFBP-1 degradation at least partially, whereas aprotinin does not modify the hST-3 proteolytic activity, as analyzed in ligand (Fig. 2 A) or Western blot (Fig. 2 B). The failure of aprotinin to inhibit IGFBP-1 proteolysis indicates that the IGFBP-1 degrading activity of hST-3 cannot be attributed to contaminant serine proteases. The possibility of sample contamination by other MMP was ruled out by gelatin and casein zymograms, showing that this hST-3 has no gelatinolytic or caseinolytic contaminant activities (data not shown). These data suggest that ST-3 is responsible for the IGFBP-1 cleavage observed. The proenzyme form of hST-3 expressed in the baculovirus system was used as starting material. Although the apparent molecular mass of hST-3 is 60 kDa, during the incubation period hST-3-specific bands, probably generated by autoproteolytic processing, are detected in Western blot (data not shown).2 This autoproteolytic processing of our hST-3 preparation concurs with earlier observations showing that prolonged incubation favors autolytic processing to smaller molecular size hST-3 forms (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data are insufficient to confirm the species responsible for the proteolytic activity on IGFBP-1, since several of these forms have endoproteolytic activity on α2-macroglobulin.2 ST-3 proteolysis of IGFBP-1 was analyzed by ligand blot (Fig.2 A). IGFBP-1 fragments generated by hST-3 proteolysis were unable to bind IGF-I with significant affinity and can only be detected in Western blot using specific anti-IGFBP-1 mAb (Fig. 2 B). These results thus suggest that, following IGFBP-1 proteolysis, the binding protein loses its IGF-I binding capacity. To determine the cleavage site produced by hST-3, IGFBP-1 proteolytic fragments were N-terminal sequenced directly from the bands electrotransferred to nylon membranes (Fig.3 A), and hST-3 was deduced to cleave IGFBP-1 at the His140-Val141 bond (Fig.3 B). The estimated molecular weight for each fragment matches the migration positions observed in SDS-PAGE. Although the native protein migrates at 30 kDa in SDS-PAGE, addition of the molecular size of both fragments conforms to the deduced molecular weight of IGFBP-1. In earlier studies, we showed that IGFBP-1 abolishes 95% of IGF-I-induced proliferation of the IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line BAF/3 (25Mañes S. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Mark C. Llopis R. Martı́nez-A C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since IGFBP-1 fragments generated by proteolysis do not bind IGF-I, IGFBP-1 treatment with ST-3 should reverse the inhibitory activity of the binding protein on IGF-I biological activities. Preincubation of the IGFBP-1·IGF-I complex with hST-3 blocks IGFBP-1 inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting either IL-3- or IGF-I-induced proliferation in this cell line (Fig. 4). A significant increase (140%) is observed in the DNA synthesis promoted by the hST-3-treated IGFBP-1·IGF-I complex compared with that obtained with IGF-I alone over a range of hST-3 concentrations. To determine the possible mechanisms responsible for the potentiation effect produced by the hST-3-treated IGFBP-1·IGF-I complex, we analyzed the effect of IGFBP-1 preincubation with hST-3 before IGF-I addition compared with protease treatment of the IGFBP-1·IGF-I complex (Fig. 5 A). The enhanced proliferative response of BAF/3 cells is observed only when the preformed IGFBP-1·IGF-I is submitted to degradation by hST-3. Conversely, incubation of IGF-I with hST-3-pretreated IGFBP-1 only restores the proliferative response obtained with IGF-I alone. These results indicate that IGF-I binding to IGFBP-1 before proteolytic degradation by hST-3 is necessary for the enhanced proliferative response. This conclusion is further supported by the use of the natural des(1–3)IGF-I form, which does not bind IGFBP (28Wang L.M. Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Heidaran M.A. Gutkind J.S. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4899-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this case, no response enhancement was observed, regardless of whether hST-3 treatment was carried out before or after des(1–3)IGF-I incubation with IGFBP-1 (Fig. 5 B). The consequences of IGFBP-1 proteolysis on IGF-I-induced signal transduction were analyzed. BAF/3 cells were incubated with IGF-I, and anti-IGF-I mAb-immunoprecipitated lysates were obtained (Fig.6). Time course experiments show that IGF-I cell stimulation induces the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of two major, IGF-1R-associated proteins of 98 and 170 kDa, with maximum stimulation at 5 min (Fig. 6 A). A similar phosphoprotein banding pattern is obtained in mouse fibroblasts upon IGF-I stimulation. The 98-kDa band probably corresponds to the IGF-1R β-subunit, which is autophosphorylated after IGF-I binding (29Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, the 170-kDa phosphoprotein band corresponds to the IRS-1 docking protein (30White M.F. Marron R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1985; 318: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), as it is readily recognized by anti-IRS-1 mAb (Fig. 6 B). The 170-kDa phosphoprotein band in BAF/3 is not, however, recognized by anti-IRS-1 antibodies (Fig.6 B). Besides tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, IGF-I stimulation of BAF/3 cells promotes IGF-1R association of p85, the regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase (Fig. 6 B). A substantial increase in IGF-1R-associated PI 3-K activity is observed after IGF-I treatment, as determined by PI conversion to PI 3-phosphate in an in vitroreaction (Fig. 6 C). IGFBP-1·IGF-I complex stimulation of BAF/3 reduces PI 3-kinase activity to background levels, and hST-3 treatment of this complex restores IGF-I-induced values (Fig.6 C). Finally, to analyze the physiological relevance of IGFBP-1 proteolysis by hST-3, we used the human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line, since IGF-I is mitogenic for this cell line (20Camacho-Hubner C. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were transfected either with an expression vector containing the cDNA coding for hST-3 or with the empty vector (control MCF-7 cells). As described for BAF/3 cells, IGFBP-1 inhibits IGF-I-induced proliferation in the control MCF-7 cell line, which does not express hST-3, but not in those clones expressing the protease (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, when the IGFBP-1 present in the cell culture medium was analyzed, only those clones expressing the protease showed a processed binding protein yielding the 16- and 9-kDa fragments obtained in vitro (Fig.7 B). These results suggest that hST-3 secreted by these cells may also degrade IGFBP-1 in vivo. Matrix metalloproteinases are generally considered to degrade ECM macromolecules, but action on substrates other than matrix components has recently been reported (3Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Human ST-3 is distinguished from other MMP family members by its weak activity against ECM targets (31Murphy G. Segain J.-P. O'Shea M. Cockett M. Ioannou C. Lefebvre O. Chambon P. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15435-15441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic activity of hST-3 has been described only for the nonspecific MMP substrate β-casein, and for two proteinase inhibitors, α2M and α1-PI (8Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed IGFBP-1 as a new hST-3 substrate, which might explain its physiological role in tumor progression. The IGFBP are substrates for kallikreins (32Cohen P. Peehl D.M. Graves H.C.B. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 142: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 33Rajah R.R. Bhala A. Nunn S.E. Peehl D.M. Cohen P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), neutral and acid-activated cathepsins (34Conover C.A. Perry J.E. Tindall D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 987-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MMP (16Fowlkes J.L. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Thrailkill K.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2810-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Proteolysis has been demonstrated for IGFBP-2, -3, -4, and -5 (29Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas only weak IGFBP-1 activity has been observed with 7 S nerve growth factor (33Rajah R.R. Bhala A. Nunn S.E. Peehl D.M. Cohen P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An unidentified protease for IGFBP-1 has been suggested to be present in human amniotic fluid (29Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that hST-3 readily degrades IGFBP-1 as well as other MMP (gelatinase A, stromelysin-1, and matrilysin) and the serine protease plasmin, which have been shown to have other IGFBP as substrates (14Fowlkes J.L. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25742-25746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thrailkill K. Quarles L.D. Nagase H. Suzuki K. Serra D.M. Fowlkes J.L.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Most MMP have proteolytic activity over a wide substrate range; however, ST-3 should be considered a MMP with a narrow substrate specificity. Our results demonstrate that IGFBP-1 is a new hST-3 substrate. ST-3 specificity is demonstrated by the fact that, although hST-3 shares IGFBP-1 proteolytic activity with other MMP, hST-3 does not proteolyze other MMP targets such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and laminin (data not shown). IGFBP-1 cleavage by hST-3 results in the generation of two fragments that do not bind IGF-I in ligand blot. Sequence analysis revealed that hST-3 cleaves IGFBP-1 principally at His140-Val141 in the midregion of the molecule. This region has little similarity to other IGFBP (36Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1991; 51: 5107-5112Goo"
https://openalex.org/W1993418944,"In this study, we have identified and characterized a new protein present in human high density lipoprotein that we have designated apolipoprotein L. Using a combination of liquid-phase isoelectrophoresis and high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, apolipoprotein L was identified and partially sequenced from immunoisolated high density lipoprotein (Lp(A-I)). Expression was only detected in the pancreas. The cDNA sequence encoding the full-length protein was cloned using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The deduced amino acid sequence contains 383 residues, including a typical signal peptide of 12 amino acids. No significant homology was found with known sequences. The plasma protein is a single chain polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. Antibodies raised against this protein detected a truncated form with a molecular mass of 39 kDa. Both forms were predominantly associated with immunoaffinity-isolated apoA-I-containing lipoproteins and detected mainly in the density range 1.123 < d < 1.21 g/ml. Free apoL was not detected in plasma. Anti-apoL immunoaffinity chromatography was used to purify apoL-containing lipoproteins (Lp(L)) directly from plasma. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of Lp(L) showed two major molecular species with apparent diameters of 12.2-17 and 10.4-12.2 nm. Moreover, Lp(L) exhibited both pre-beta and alpha electromobility. Apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, A-IV, and C-III were also detected in the apoL-containing lipoprotein particles."
https://openalex.org/W2064231933,"Prostaglandin E2(PGE2) modulates a variety of physiological processes including the production of inflammatory cytokines. There are two cyclooxygenase (Cox) enzymes, Cox-1 and Cox-2, that are responsible for initiating PGE2 synthesis. These isozymes catalyze identical biosynthetic reactions but are regulated by different mechanisms in the cell. This report examines differences in the roles of Cox-1 and Cox-2 in regulating cytokine synthesis in macrophages. We employed agents that selectively modulate the activity of each isozyme and measured their effects on synthesis of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α by peritoneal macrophages. Among these three cytokines, only IL-6 synthesis was stimulated by production of endogenous PGE2. This effect was specifically linked to activation of Cox-2 and not Cox-1. The specificity derives, partly, from the timing of the production of PGE2 following stimulation of each isozyme and from induction of ancillary signals that control the response to PGE2. The experimental findings demonstrate that the effects of Cox-1 and Cox-2 activity on macrophage IL-6 synthesis are segregated. This provides a mechanism for IL-6 to be induced selectively during inflammation.

Both enzymes utilize arachidonic acid as the predominant substrate, and both catalyze the same cyclooxygenase and peroxidase reactions that constitute the first two steps of eicosanoid metabolism (6Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar). Although indistinguishable in their biosynthetic catalytic activities, the two isozymes appear to have different physiological functions. Cox-1 (prostaglandin synthase-1, EC 1.14.99.1) protein is expressed constitutively in most cell types and is thought to be responsible for regulating normal physiological functions such as gastric acid secretion and kidney function (7Roth G.J.

The cellular activity of Cox-1 is regulated primarily through substrate availability, e.g. from the release of free arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Cox-2 is an inducible enzyme expressed in activated macrophages (5Feng L. Sun W. Xia Y. Tang W.W. Chanmugam P. Soyoola E. Wilson C.B. Hwang D. Arch. Biochem.

Due to small differences in the amino acid sequences near the cyclooxygenase catalytic site, Cox-1 and Cox-2 can be inhibited differentially by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS (29Gierse J.K.

For example, aspirin and indomethacin inhibit both isozymes but second generation NSAIDS such as NS-398 inhibit Cox-2 preferentially (32Futaki N. Arai I. Hamasaka Y. Takahashi S. Higuchi S. Otomo S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1992; 45: 753-755Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These drugs can be used to distinguish between the activities of Cox-1 and Cox-2 within the cell. A substantial body of work indicates that PGE2 modulates production of inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 33Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Mediat. Inflamm. 1992; 1: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Different effects of PGE2 are observed depending on the experimental system employed.

Shacter E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and TNF-α (39Renz H. Gong J. Schmidt A. Nain M. Gemsa D. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2388-2392PubMed Google Scholar) synthesis. Since macrophages are a major source of PGE2 during inflammation (40Humes J.L. Bonney R.J. Pelus L. Dahlgren M.E. Sadowski S.J. Kuehl F.A. Davies P. Nature. 1977; 269: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and since they also have receptors for and respond to this eicosanoid (41Arakawa T. Laneuville O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29569-29575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the PGE2 generated by macrophages may regulate cytokine synthesis in an autocrine fashion (in contrast to paracrine regulation achieved through adding exogenous PGE2 to cells). Previous studies have implicated a positive association between endogenous PGE2 production and IL-6 synthesis in vitro (14Hinson R.M. Williams J.A. Shacter E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,42Ogle C.K. Guo X. Szczur K. Hartmann S. Ogle J.D.

Immunopharmacol. 1991; 13: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and animal models of chronic inflammation show that PGE2 is a stimulator of IL-6 production in vivo(14Hinson R.M. Williams J.A. Shacter E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. McGarity K.L. Bremer M.E. Isakson P.C.

Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we found that inflammatory agents that induce IL-6 synthesis in macrophages in vitro also induce expression of Cox-2 (14Hinson R.M. Williams J.A. Shacter E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Significantly, both Cox-2 mRNA expression and IL-6 protein were co-elevated in inflammatory exudates in vivo. Inhibition of Cox-2 activity by NS-398 in vitro inhibited IL-6 synthesis. These results suggested that Cox-2 activity might be responsible for modulating IL-6 production. The question addressed in this report is whether stimulation of PGE2 synthesis from Cox-1 has the same effect on macrophage cytokine synthesis as stimulation of PGE2 production from Cox-2. Because Cox-1 protein is expressed constitutively, prostaglandin synthesis is activated within minutes after addition of an appropriate stimulus (e.g. free arachidonic acid). In contrast, synthesis of PGE2 from Cox-2 is delayed by several hours due to the requirement for de novo mRNA and protein synthesis. The two isozymes are also localized in different membrane compartments within the cell (47Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the PGE2 synthesized from the two cyclooxygenase enzymes may control different functions in the cells in which it is formed. We find that among the three pro-inflammatory cytokines examined here (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α), only IL-6 production is stimulated by PGE2 produced by macrophages. Moreover, the regulation of IL-6 is uniquely linked to Cox-2 activation; agents that stimulate Cox-1 fail to induce IL-6 synthesis. BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and fed Purina laboratory chow and water ad libitum. Animals were cared for in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care Guidelines. Female mice (8–16 weeks old) received a single 0.5-ml intraperitoneal injection of pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane). Peritoneal lavage samples were collected 2–4 months after pristane treatment (48Shacter E. Arzadon G.K. Williams J. Blood. 1992; 80: 194-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peritoneal macrophage population was isolated as described previously (48Shacter E. Arzadon G.K. Williams J. Blood. 1992; 80: 194-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils and macrophages were separated by density gradient centrifugation (49Shacter E. Beecham E.J. Covey J.M. Kohn K.W. Potter M. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Macrophages were purified further by plating at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml (1.25 × 106 cells/well) in 24-well plastic tissue culture plates in DMEM containing antibiotics and allowing cells to adhere at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with DMEM. Cell numbers and viability were quantified by hemocytometry with trypan blue. Cell differentials were analyzed from Diff-Quick stained cytocentrifuge slides. Macrophages were stimulated with a bovine serum albumin (pAlb) preparation from Boehringer Mannheim (catalog number 100 069; lot 108303) that contains roughly 4% albumin polymers. This material was characterized previously and shown to stimulate macrophage IL-6 production both in vitro and in vivo (50Shacter E. Arzadon G.K. Williams J.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 2853-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 synthesis was also stimulated with exogenous arachidonic acid (Sigma), prepared freshly as a 400 μm stock in 50% ethanol. Macrophages were cultured in DMEM at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and stimulated by addition of either pAlb (50–200 μg/ml) or arachidonate (10 μm). Where indicated, indomethacin (1 μm) or NS-398 (1 μm) was added to the cell cultures 30 min before adding the stimulus. After various times of incubation, the culture medium was removed from each well and centrifuged. In experiments that contained no added protein, ultrapure bovine serum albumin (Boehringer Mannheim, catalog 238 031) was added to each macrophage supernatant at the time of collection to decrease the adsorption of cytokines to the walls of the collection tube. Supernatants were stored frozen at −20 °C until assayed for the presence of cytokines or PGE2. Total RNA was purified from in vitro plated macrophages after various times of incubation using TRIzol® (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. RNA samples (4 or 15 μg each) were run on 1% agarose, 0.7% formaldehyde gels containing ethidium bromide and transferred to nitrocellulose.32P-Labeled IL-6, Cox-2, and actin cDNA probes were prepared using a random priming system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.). Blots were hybridized overnight with probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml; 5 × 108 cpm/μg) at 65 °C in Hybrisol II solution (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and then washed by standard procedures. Autoradiography was performed using Kodak XAR film. Films were scanned (Microtek Scanmaker) and analyzed using the Macintosh densitometry program NIH Image. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm DTPA) and heated at 100 °C for 12 min. Protein (5 × 105 cell equivalents) was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Inc). Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-murine Cox-2 antibody (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI; catalog number 160106) or anti-Cox-1 antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnologies; catalog number 4050-05). Immunopositive protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Renaissance kit, NEN Life Science Products) and exposure of x-ray film. IL-6-dependent B9 hybridoma cells (51Helle M. Boeije L. Aarden L.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) were cultured in a serum-free medium (52Shacter E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 99: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and IL-6. Prior to the assay, the B9 cells were washed to remove IL-6 and were then cultured in flat-bottom 96-well plates at 3000 cells/well. Samples to be assayed for IL-6 activity were added at serial 2-fold dilutions. Standard curves with recombinant murine IL-6 were run to control for interassay variation. After 3 days of culture at 37 °C, the number of viable cells was assayed using the colorimetric reagent 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, 0.55 mg/ml (48Shacter E. Arzadon G.K. Williams J. Blood. 1992; 80: 194-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46885) Google Scholar). The data were calculated using a four-parameter fit analysis. A unit of activity is defined as the dilution that gives half-maximal B9 cell growth in 3 days and corresponds to approximately 2 pg/ml homogeneous murine recombinant IL-6. Specificity of the assay was confirmed by blocking all activity with a polyclonal anti-IL-6 antibody. Results of the B9 bioassay were very similar to those obtained using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for mouse IL-6 (Endogen, Cambridge, MA). IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α were measured using EIA kits from Endogen (Woburn, MA). PGE2 was assayed using a monoclonal antibody/enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman Chemical. The linear range of the assay was from 10 to 1000 pg/ml. Escherichia coli LPS 055:B5 was from Difco. Indomethacin, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, PGE2, and arachidonate were from Sigma. NS-398 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Pristane was from Aldrich. A cDNA probe for murine IL-6 (0.65 kb) was a gift from Dov Pluznik (FDA/CBER). A cDNA probe for murine Cox-2 (1.7 kb (11Farber J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) was a gift from Joshua Farber (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). A cDNA probe for murine β-actin (2 kb) was provided by Konrad Huppi (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Probes were purified from plasmids according to standard procedures. Murine recombinant IL-6 purified to homogeneity was a gift of Bob Brown (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Pristane-elicited macrophages spontaneously secrete low levels of IL-6 and PGE2 (48Shacter E. Arzadon G.K. Williams J. Blood. 1992; 80: 194-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with either LPS or polymerized albumin (pAlb) promotes an increase in the expression of the Cox-2 and IL-6 genes (Fig. 1). We employ pAlb for our in vitro studies because it is pro-inflammatory in vivo and yet is less toxic than LPS to macrophages (50Shacter E. Arzadon G.K. Williams J.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 2853-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of expression of IL-6 and Cox-2 mRNAs after induction by pAlb is shown in Fig. 2. Elevated Cox-2 mRNA expression is first seen 30 min after addition of pAlb to the cells. By comparison, the elevation in IL-6 expression is not detected until 45 min after stimulation.Figure 2Time course of induction of Cox-2 and IL-6 mRNAs. Peritoneal macrophages were prepared as described in the legend to Fig. 1. At time 0, the cells were stimulated by addition of 200 μg/ml pAlb. Total RNA was isolated at the times indicated. The figure shows a representative Northern blot probed simultaneously for Cox-2 (1.7-kb probe, 1 × 106 cpm/μg) and IL-6 (0.7-kb probe, 1 × 106 cpm/μg).

A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This conclusion was drawn from the finding that induction of IL-6 mRNA expression is inhibited 50–75% in the presence of NS-398, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that selectively inhibits Cox-2 activity (14Hinson R.M. Williams J.A. Shacter E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,54Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Since PGE2 can modulate production of other inflammatory cytokines, we sought to determine how inhibition of Cox-2 activity would affect macrophage production of IL-1 and TNF-α. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that IL-6 is most significantly affected by NS-398, showing roughly 50% inhibition by the drug. TNF-α synthesis is augmented by 24 ± 12% (mean ± S.D., n = 5), and IL-1 levels are not significantly affected by the presence of NS-398. These data suggest that the PGE2 responsible for modulating pAlb-induced IL-6 secretion derives primarily from Cox-2. In addition, they show that of the three cytokines examined here, only IL-6 is induced by endogenous PGE2 production. To test further whether Cox-1 might be involved in pAlb-stimulated synthesis of PGE2 and IL-6, we looked for Cox-1 protein induction by pAlb. Cox-2 protein is induced approximately 300-fold in 5 h by stimulation with pAlb (Fig.4 A). The levels of Cox-1 protein are low but remain constant over the same time period (Fig.4 B). Since Cox-1 activity is generally regulated through modulation of substrate availability and not through gene induction (55Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar), the absence of a change in Cox-1 protein levels does not preclude a change in Cox-1 activity. To test whether pAlb stimulates any Cox-1 activity, macrophages were pretreated with aspirin, washed, and then stimulated for 6 h with pAlb. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenases by acetylating a serine residue near the cyclooxygenase active site (6Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 179-194PubMed Google Scholar). Since Cox-2 is not present at the time of the aspirin pretreatment, the drug only inactivates pre-existing Cox-1. As shown in Fig. 5, pAlb-induced PGE2synthesis was lowered by roughly 16% following pretreatment with aspirin, and IL-6 synthesis was decreased by approximately 20%. This small effect may have derived from incomplete elimination of aspirin from the cells by the washing procedure. In contrast, when aspirin was present throughout the incubation period with pAlb, PGE2production was 98% inhibited (consistent with the ability of aspirin to inhibit the activities of both Cox-1 and Cox-2), and IL-6 synthesis was reduced by 56%. Taken together, the data presented thus far suggest that pAlb stimulates IL-6 synthesis by inducing Cox-2 activity and that Cox-1 is not involved in this particular process.Figure 5Effect of aspirin pretreatment on pAlb-induced expression of IL-6 and PGE2.Pristane-elicited macrophages were treated with aspirin (200 μg/ml) for 30 min (aspirin-pre), washed thoroughly, and then stimulated with pAlb (100 μg/ml). Supernatants were collected after a 6-h incubation and assayed for IL-6 and PGE2. Control cultures were untreated. Aspirin-full indicates that aspirin was present throughout the entire incubation period.Bars are mean ± S.D. of triplicate cultures. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because pAlb stimulates PGE2 synthesis by activating Cox-2 selectively, the above results do not reveal whether Cox-1 activity would induce IL-6 synthesis if the enzyme became activated. To examine this possibility, we tested the effect of arachidonic acid on PGE2 and IL-6 synthesis. Arachidonate is the substrate for cyclooxygenases, and it stimulates PGE2 synthesis by Cox-1 in macrophages (56Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 10 μmarachidonic acid did not induce any measurable IL-6 production even though substantial PGE2 was generated (Fig.6). In control experiments, we verified that addition of exogenous arachidonic acid to these cells stimulates PGE2 synthesis from Cox-1 and not Cox-2. First, we examined the time course of PGE2 synthesis by this agent. As shown in Fig.7, arachidonic acid stimulated rapid secretion of PGE2 (within 30 min) compared with pAlb (2–3 h). This time course of arachidonate-induced prostaglandin synthesis is similar to that documented previously by others (57Scott W.A. Zrike J.M. Hamill A.L. Kempe J. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The production of PGE2 from arachidonate-stimulated macrophages occurred in the absence of detectable Cox-2 protein, determined by Western blot immunoassay of cell extracts collected at each of the time points shown in Fig. 7 (data not shown). Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with aspirin for 30 min prior to addition of arachidonate completely inhibited PGE2 production (Fig.8). Since there was no Cox-2 protein present in the cells during the preincubation period, the inhibition had to derive from an effect on Cox-1. This result can be contrasted to the effect of aspirin pretreatment on pAlb-stimulated PGE2production (see Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that arac"

Unlike UCP1 and UCP2, UCP3 is expressed preferentially and at high levels in human skeletal muscle and exists as short and long form transcripts,UCP3 S and UCP3 L.UCP3 S is predicted to encode a protein which lacks the last 37 C-terminal residues of UCP3 L. In the present study, we have defined the intron-exon structure for the human UCP3 gene and determined that UCP3 S is generated when a cleavage and polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) located in the last intron prematurely terminates message elongation. In addition we have mapped UCP3 to the distal segment of human chromosome 11q13 (between framework markers D11S916 and D11S911), adjacent to UCP2. Of note, UCP2 and UCP3 in both mice and humans colocalize in P1 and BAC genomic clones indicating that these two UCPs are located within 75–150 kilobases of each other and most likely resulted from a gene duplication event. Previous studies have noted that mouse UCP2 maps to a region of chromosome 7 which is coincident with three independently mapped quantitative trait loci for obesity. Our study shows that UCP3 is also coincident with these quantitative trait loci raising the possibility that abnormalities in UCP3 are responsible for obesity in these models.

The control of body weight involves a regulated balance between energy intake and expenditure. Energy expenditure can be divided into three components (1Ravussin E. Swinburn B.A. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 403-422Google Scholar): resting metabolic rate, physical activity, and adaptive thermogenesis, the latter being defined as the component of energy expenditure that changes in response to environmental stimuli such as cold exposure or chronic dietary excess. In rodents, an important site of adaptive thermogenesis is brown adipose tissue (reviewed in Ref. 2Himms-Hagen J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1989; 28: 67-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) where uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; BBS1, Bardet-Beidl syndrome type 1; EST, expressed sequence tag; UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); cR, centiroentgens; cM, centimorgans; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. expressed exclusively in brown adipocytes (3Jacobsson A.

UCP1 decreases the proton electrochemical potential gradient, uncoupling fuel oxidation from ADP availability (reviewed in Refs. 5Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol.

Activation of UCP1, therefore, causes increased consumption of calories and generation of heat. UCP1-mediated effects on energy expenditure are regulated by changes in the level of sympathetic nervous system activity in brown fat. Cold exposure and overfeeding cause increased sympathetic stimulation of brown fat, simulating UCP1-mediated uncoupling and energy expenditure. The importance of this is demonstrated by the fact that mice lacking UCP1 are cold-intolerant (7Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). UCP1 is also regulated by purine di- and trinucleotides (ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP) and free fatty acids, which inhibit and stimulate uncoupling activity, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 5Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar and 6Klingenberg M. Trends Biochem.

This difference could be significant because the region in question is homologous to a domain in UCP1 thought to mediate inhibition of uncoupling activity by purine nucleotides (17Murdza-Inglis D.L.

The abundant and relatively selective expression of UCP3 in skeletal muscle suggests that it may be a mediator of adaptive thermogenesis in humans. Here we define the intron-exon structure of the human UCP3 gene, establish its chromosomal localization at 11q13, within 75–150 kb of UCP2, and define the genetic basis for the two UCP3 S and UCP3 L mRNA transcripts. Six sense and antisense PCR primer pairs corresponding to cDNA sequence were used to amplify genomic fragments from human genomic DNA (see TableI). The genomic PCR fragments were subcloned using the TA cloning system (pCR2.1 plasmid, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion plus agarose gel electrophoresis and dideoxy sequencing using M13, T7, and internal UCP3 gene-specific primers. 3′RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was used to clone the 3′ ends of UCP3 S and UCP3 L. 3′RACE was performed using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit, human skeletal muscle Marathon-Ready cDNA (both fromCLONTECH) and a sense UCP3 primer (TCAGCCCCCTCGACTGTA) located in exon 6 (cDNA position relative to ATG = +761 to +778).Table IPCR primers used to amplify the human UCP3 genePCR primers used to amplify human UCP3 gene Position of primers in cDNA (relative to ATG)Position of primers in gene Size of amplified PCR productkbSense:GAGGGGCCATCCAATCC−183 to −165Exon 12.0Antisense:AAGGCTTCAGTCCAACCATAG+19 to −2Exon 2Sense:AGGACTATGGTTGGACTGAA−6 to +14Exon 20.12Antisense:GGCGGACCTTGGCTGTGT+121 to +104Exon 2Sense:AACTCGTTACCTTTCCACTG+83 to +102Exon 21.3Antisense:GGTTCTGTAGGCGTCCATA+504 to +486Exon 4Sense:AACTCGTTACCTTTCCACTG+83 to +102Exon 23.0Antisense:GGGCCACCATCTTTATCA+796 to +779Exon 6Sense:TCGCCAGGGAGGAAGGA+506 to +522Exon 41.7Antisense:GTCGAGGGGGCTGAAGTAC+774 to +756Exon 6Sense:TCAAGGAGAAGCTGCTGGACTA+608 to +629Exon 62.5Antisense:CATTCTTAACTGGTTTCGGACAC+991 to +969Exon 7 Open table in a new tab RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (19Vidal-Puig A.

To obtain 5′ upstream cDNA sequence of human UCP3, 5′RACE on human skeletal muscle Marathon cDNA was performed (16Vidal-Puig A. Solanes G. Grujic D. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Different clones were obtained and sequenced, and the longest ones were found to contain 183 bp 5′ upstream of the ATG. Thus, at least one exon containing UCP35′-untranslated sequence was detected (exon 1). Sequence analysis indicated that the 3′-UTR of UCP3 S and the intron region between exon 6 and the AATAAAS in intron 6 were identical (see Fig. 1). The protein predicted to be generated by the UCP3 S transcript is truncated by an in-frame stop codon (tga) which follows a preserved glycine (G) codon (GGg) at residue position 275. This glycine codon in UCP3 L (GGA) is located at the splice junction between exons 6 and 7. An RNase protection assay probe corresponding to the UCP3 L transcript, spanning exons 6 and 7, was prepared. This probe contained 193 bp of exon 6 sequence and 100 bp of exon 7 sequence. As is shown in Fig.2, two bands were protected, one of ∼290 bp representing UCP3 L and another of ∼190 bp representing UCP3 S. Additional RNase protection assays were performed using a probe corresponding to UCP3 S (data not shown). This probe contained 200 bp of exon 6 and 77 bp of adjacent 3′ sequence corresponding to the UCP3 S 3′-untranslated region (3′UTRS, see Fig. 1). As would be predicted, two protected bands were obtained, one of ∼280 bp representing UCP3 S and another of ∼200 bp representing UCP3 L (data not shown). Quantitation of RNase protection assay results using in vitro transcribed sense UCP3 transcripts as a standard curve and total RNA extracted from five lean subjects (rectus abdominis muscle) revealed that there were ∼15 amol (per μg of total RNA) of UCP3 Ltranscripts and ∼18 amol (per μg of total RNA) of UCP3 S transcripts.

See Fig. 3for the order of markers in this region and the position of framework markers on the genetic map. Given the proximity of human UCP2 and UCP3 by radiation hybrid mapping, we investigated whether human UCP2 and UCP3 might be found together on P1 genomic clones. P1 genomic clones generally have genomic inserts of ∼75–100 kb. In addition, we also investigated whether mouse UCP2 and UCP3 might be found together on P1 and BAC mouse genomic clones. BAC genomic clones generally have a genomic insert of ∼150 kb. Analysis for mUPC3 was possible because we had recently cloned its corresponding cDNA. 3D. Grujic, C.-Y. Zhang, G. Solanes, A. Vidal-Puig, J. S. Flier, and B. B. Lowell, unpublished data. Mouse UCP3 is 87% identical to human UCP3 at the amino acid level,3 but is only 55% identical to mUCP1 and 72% identical to mUCP2. As is shown in Table II, 3 of 3 human P1 clones, 3 of 4 mouse P1 clones, and 2 of 3 mouse BAC clones contained both UCP2 and UCP3. Thus,UCP2 and UCP3 genes in mice and humans are located within 75–150 kb of each other. In the present study we have analyzed the human UCP3 gene. It contains at least 7 exons spread over ∼8.5 kb and is located on chromosome 11 (11q13), adjacent to UCP2. The UCP3 gene generates two mRNA transcripts,UCP3 L and UCP3 S, which are predicted to encode long and short UCP3 proteins, differing only by the presence or absence of 37 residues on the C terminus (15Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). These 37 residues are encoded by exon 7 which is missing from UCP3 S. Intron 6 contains a cleavage and polyadenylation signal (designated AATAAAS in Fig. 1). The AATAAAS signal terminates message elongation ∼50% of the time, thus generating UCP3 S. When the AATAAAS signal is bypassed, which seems to occur ∼50% of the time, message elongation continues until the AATAAALsignal (located ∼1.1 kb downstream of exon 7) is reached, thus generating UCP3 L. The domain encoded by exon 7 is highly homologous to C-terminal residues found in UCP1 and UCP2, thus UCP3 S is unique in lacking these residues. Since this region is believed to participate in purine nucleotide-mediated inhibition of UCP1 uncoupling activity (17Murdza-Inglis D.L. Modriansky M. Patel H.V. Woldegiorgis G. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7435-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bouillaud F. Arechaga I. Petit P.X. Raimbault S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Casteilla L. Laurent M. Rial E. Ricquier D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar),UCP3 S may have increased uncoupling activity. Alternatively, UCP3 S could have reduced activity or no activity due to the possible absence of critical residues. The biological significance of UCP3 S will need to be the focus of future investigations. The human UCP3 gene maps to the distal segment of 11q13, adjacent to UCP2. Human UCP1, on the other hand, is located on chromosome 4 (24Cassard A.M. Bouillaud F. Mattei M.G. Hentz E. Raimbault S. Thomas M. Ricquier D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that UCP2 and UCP3 are more similar to each other than to UCP1. Both mouse and human UCP2 and UCP3 genes colocalize on P1 and BAC genomic clones, indicating that these two UCPs are within 75–150 kb of each other. Given this and the high degree of similarity between UCP2 and UCP3 (∼70% at the nucleotide level), it is likely that one UCP gene arose from the other via a duplication event. However, despite their common origin and similar sequence, the two UCPs are unique, being distinguished by their different patterns of expression and the existence of a short form for UCP3, but not UCP2.3 The close proximity of UCP2 and UCP3 and the similarity in nucleotide sequence have additional implications. Unequal crossovers during meiosis could generate alleles with deletions, duplications, or gene conversions of UCP2 and/or UCP3, as observed with α-globin (25Michelson A.M. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15245-15254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 21-hydroxylase (26White P.C. New M.I. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and 11β-hydroxylase (27Lifton R.P. Dluhy R.G. Powers M. Rich G.M. Cook S. Ulick S. Lalouel J.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) genes. Also, the close proximity of UCP2 and UCP3 will prevent genetic linkage studies from discriminating between UCP2 and UCP3. Of interest, a prior study mapped mUCP2 to chromosome 7 (13Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), tightly linked to the tubby mutation. This region is coincident with a quantitative trait locus for obesity in three mouse models (28Warden C.H. Fisler J.S. Pace M.J. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. J. Clin.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1545-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Since mUCP2 and mUCP3 are adjacent, it is possible that an abnormality in one or both of these genes is responsible for obesity. In humans, the Bardet-Beidl syndrome (BBS1, MIM#209901) consisting of retinal degeneration, polydactyly, hypogonadism, mental retardation, and obesity has been linked to 11q13 (32Leppert M. Baird L.

However, in this case UCP2 and/or UCP3 are unlikely candidate genes given that they are positioned at least 12 cM distal to BBS1 (no significant linkage between BBS1 and marker D11S916). In summary, genes for UCP2 and UCP3 are highly homologous and are located in close proximity on chromosome 11q13.UCP3 is distinguished from UCP2 and UCP1, however, by its selective and high level expression in skeletal muscle and the expression of a short form transcript,UCP3 S, generated by a cleavage and polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) located in the last intron. Given its proximity to the UCP2 gene, the mouse UCP3 gene is also coincident with 3 independently mapped quantitative trait loci for obesity (28Warden C.H. Fisler J.S. Pace M.J. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Seldin M.F. Mott D. Bhat D. Petro A. Kuhn C.M. Kingsmore S.F. Bogardus C. Opara E. Feinglos M.N. Surwit R.S.

Genomics. 1996; 34: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that abnormalities in UCP3 are responsible for obesity in these models. Thus, human linkage studies for the UCP2/UCP3 locus along with mutational analyses of mouse and human UCP2 and UCP3 genes should be the focus of future investigations.

Single cell quantitative methods, such as those used in this study, should permit a more detailed understanding of the relationships between delivered plasmid and transgene expression. Intracellular plasmid delivery and transgene expression were measured simultaneously using photoconjugated ethidium monoazide as an intracellular plasmid delivery marker and green fluorescent protein (GFP(S65T)) as a transgene expression marker. Quantitative flow cytometry was used to estimate plasmid copy number and GFP(S65T) molecules in single cells. The plasmid was delivered to HeLa cells with a cationic liposome vehicle containing 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium-propane and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (1:1 mol/mol). Treatment was carried out continuously for 24 h. Flow cytometry measurements on 20,000 cells were performed during treatment and for 48 h post-treatment. On a single cell basis, transgene expression efficiency and average GFP(S65T) expression level increased with intracellular plasmid copy number. After 3-h exposure to the liposomal vector, more than 95% of the cells were positive for plasmid entry, but none had detectable transgene expression. Maximum transgene expression was achieved at 24 h and remained unchanged at the 72-h measurement. At 24 h, the average positive cell contained 1.6 × 105plasmid copies and 2.3 × 106 GFP(S65T) molecules. Importantly, the measurement strategies revealed that transgene expression varied widely within the entire cell population. Although only 30% of all cells expressed transgene, the subpopulation of cells that rapidly incorporated the vector demonstrated 100% efficiency in transgene expression.

This study identifies parameters that modulate highly efficient transgene expression from plasmid delivery by cationic liposomes. Gene delivery has been achieved by a variety of techniques, but much current effort is focused on either a viral or a cationic liposomal vector (1Mulligan R.C.

Science. 1995; 270: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Liposomes possess many physical characteristics that make them attractive candidates as gene delivery vectors (4Lasic D.D. Papahadjopoulos D. Science. 1995; 267: 1275-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The safety of cationic liposomal vectors, for example, has been demonstrated in both single use and repeated dose protocols (5Nabel G. Nabel E.G. Yang Z.Y. Fox B.A. Plautz G.E. Gao X. Huang L. Shu S.

In addition to clear prospects for in vivo therapeutic use, cationic liposomal vectors are also an appropriate ex vivo transfection method. A major limitation of cationic liposomal vectors is low transgene expression efficiency. Significant efforts to improve liposomal vector performance are underway in a number of academic and industrial laboratories. The search for improved transgene expression is primarily focused on the development of new liposome formulations (7Schreier H. Moran P. Caras I.W. J. Biol.

The fundamental mechanisms and rates of liposomal gene delivery and subsequent intracellular processing of the delivered transgene are, however, not well understood. Optimization of liposomal vector performance is currently performed empirically using transgene protein in the final cell lysate as the primary indicator of efficiency. Unfortunately, interpretation of these studies rarely considers the biophysical interactions between liposomal vector and cells. Early reports (16Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 17Friend D.S. Papahadjopoulos D. Debs R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

A quantitative and systematic analysis of the delivered plasmid characteristics and transgene expression on a cellular basis has not been described. The objective of this study is to quantify relationships between delivered plasmid and transgene expression in a cell population. Single cell fluorescence techniques were developed to examine plasmid delivery and intracellular processing kinetics as a function of DNA dosage across a population of clonal cells. Two independent fluorescent probes were used in this technique, ethidium monoazide (EMA) 1The abbreviations used are: EMA, ethidium monoazide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FL1, FL2, and FL3, fluorescence emissions centered at 530, 580, and 610 nm, respectively; ANOVA, analysis of variance; CMF, calcium- and magnesium-free; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. -conjugated plasmid and the transgene product, a mutated Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP(S65T)) (19Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The plasmid contains the reporter sequence for GFP(S65T), a protein which is fluorescent after synthesis and folding (20Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar). GFP(S65T) fluorescence was used to obtain single cell measurement of transgene expression. EMA, a fluorescent intercalating DNA probe, spectrally similar to ethidium bromide, was used to label plasmid by covalent bonding after photoactivation. EMA fluorescence was used to estimate the plasmid copy number associated with each cell. Flow cytometry provided single cell measurements of plasmid copy number and transgene expression by simultaneous application of two independent fluorescent markers. The pGreenLantern-1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.; pGL1) is 5.0-kb long with a cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid contains a humanized sequence (21Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coding for GFP(S65T). pGL1 was amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α by a standard procedure (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and isolated using a commercial purification kit (Qiagen). EMA (Molecular Probes) intercalates between DNA/RNA base pairs with the same fluorescent excitation and emission properties as ethidium bromide. Unlike ethidium bromide, EMA forms covalent bonds with DNA bases after photoactivation, providing a stable fluorescent reporter of the bound DNA/RNA. The labeling of plasmid with EMA by photoactivation was carried out as described previously (23Tseng W.C. Purvis N.B. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. Biotech. Bioeng. 1996; 50: 548-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EMA-conjugated, fluorescent pGL1 is denoted as EMA-pGL1 in this study. A total mass of 20 mg of 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium-propane (50 mol %) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (50 mol %; Avanti Polar Lipids) was dissolved in a 100-ml flask containing 5 ml of chloroform. The cationic liposomes containing 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium-propane and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were prepared by vacuum evaporation followed by extrusion to yield unilamellar liposomes of 0.1 μm as described previously (23Tseng W.C. Purvis N.B. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. Biotech. Bioeng. 1996; 50: 548-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection reagent contained a constant total dose of 2000 ng of DNA per 35-mm Petri dish of cultured HeLa cells. The total DNA dose (total pGL1) was composed of EMA-pGL1 and unlabeled pGL1. EMA-pGL1, covalently labeled with EMA, cannot participate in transgene expression because the EMA-DNA conjugate bonds prevent transcription. The EMA-pGL1 plasmid offers detection of plasmid entry across the cell membrane, and the unlabeled pGL1 plasmid provides measurement of transgene expression. Both the transgene expression and plasmid copy number can be determined simultaneously in individual cells by this technique. Combinations of EMA-pGL1 and pGL1 plasmid were used to examine the effects of DNA dosage. Four independent series of experiments were carried out with unlabeled pGL1 plasmid of 1000, 500, 100, or 10 ng with sufficient EMA-pGL1 plasmid to provide a total plasmid level of 2000 ng in all experiments. For each 35-mm Petri dish of HeLa cells, EMA-pGL1 and pGL1 plasmid were well mixed in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) before the addition of 12 μg of liposome. The transfection mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15–30 min and then gently mixed with an additional 0.9 ml of Opti-MEM that had been prewarmed to 37 °C. The resulting complex formed from the interaction between cationic liposome and plasmid is described in this study as the liposomal vector. Cells were cultured with this medium for 24 h under standard conditions. Fresh cell culture medium, containing serum but without the liposomal vector, replaced the Opti-MEM medium at 24 h and was maintained until the end of the experiments. Three 35-mm Petri dishes were harvested at each desired incubation time (control, 0.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) for analysis. HeLa cells (a human epithelioid cell line; ATCC-CCL-2) were maintained at 37 °C, 100% humidity in complete medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% glutamine, and 1% antibiotics of penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin. Cells were maintained in T-175 flasks with regular medium changes over 3–4 days and were split after achieving complete confluence. Cells were harvested from the T-175 flasks 16–18 h before transfection and seeded onto 35-mm Petri dishes at 20,000 cells/cm2. At the conclusion of a sampling interval, the cells were washed with cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered solution (CMF-PBS, pH 7.2) twice. Cell harvest was done by incubation with 1 ml of 0.15% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA. After incubation, 1 ml of complete medium was added, and cells were fixed in the presence of 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then washed three times with CMF-PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. The final pellet was resuspended in CMF-PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 °C for flow cytometric analysis. Cell samples were analyzed by a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) flow cytometer that has an argon laser exciting at a wavelength of 488 nm. For each sample, 20,000 events were collected by list-mode data, which consisted of side scatter, forward scatter, and fluorescence emissions centered at 530 nm (FL1), 580 nm (FL2), and 610 nm (FL3). No electronic compensation was performed. Software-based compensation, however, was used as described below. Winlist (Verity Software House) software was employed to analyze the list-mode data. Flow cytometric measurement of EMA and GFP(S65T) was calibrated using polystyrene beads with a known degree of adsorbed fluorophore. Polystyrene beads (Polysciences, Inc.) were washed with CMF-PBS three times. A final concentration of 4 × 107/ml beads was incubated with 0.18 mg/ml EMA-pGL1 at room temperature for 18 h with gentle mixing. The coated beads were washed twice with CMF-PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C. The mutated green fluorescent protein was prepared in our laboratory for calibration through a previously described technique (24Niswender K.D. Blackman S.M. Rohde L. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Microsc. 1995; 180: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutated GFP(S65T) was fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and amplified in E. coli. The fusion protein (GST-GFP(S65T)) was purified through a GST affinity column. The humanized, mutated GFP plasmid used in this study codes for a GFP with the same structure as the mutated GFP(S65T). The fused GST-GFP(S65T) has the same fluorescence intensity as the GFP(S65T) when excited at the same wavelength (24Niswender K.D. Blackman S.M. Rohde L. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Microsc. 1995; 180: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). GST-GFP(S65T) adsorption onto polystyrene beads was carried out as described for EMA-pGL1 coating but with a final concentration of 23.5 μg/ml GST-GFP(S65T) per 4 × 107/ml beads. The amount of the fluorophore that remained in the supernatant after coating was determined spectrofluorometrically for both EMA-pGL1- and GST-GFP(S65T)-coated bead preparations. The amount of fluorophore removed from the fluid phase during coating was presumed to be adsorbed onto all the beads uniformly. The coated bead concentration was measured with an electronic particle counter. Molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome per bead was calculated by dividing the total adsorbed molecules of fluorophore by the total number of beads. Control HeLa cells excited at 488 nm were autofluorescent in FL1, FL2, and FL3. EMA fluorescence was significant in FL2 and FL3, but not detectable in FL1. GFP(S65T) fluorescence occurs primarily in FL1 but is also detectable in FL2 and FL3. Compensation for the spectral overlap among cellular autofluorescence, GFP(S65T) and EMA fluorescence is based on fluorescence intensity linear superposition in each spectral region (25Bagwell C.B. Adams E.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 677: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Simply described, the fluorescence intensity measured in each channel is the sum of cellular autofluorescence, GFP(S65T) and EMA fluorescence. Information on the degree of spectral overlap using single fluorophore controls permits decoupling of the fluorescence measurement among each source. The decoupling is known in flow cytometry as compensation and can be expressed mathematically as a matrix operation FL1FL2FL3=G1E1A1G2E2A2G3E3A3GFP(S65T)EMAauto_1Equation 1 where FL1, FL2, and FL3 are the measured fluorescence intensities, GFP(S65T) and EMA are the known surface concentrations of fluorophore on the calibration beads, and auto_1 is the cellular autofluorescence in FL1. The matrix composed of the compensation coefficients G i, E i, and A i is determined from FL1, FL2, and FL3 measured for each of the three calibration samples. In this system, no EMA is detectable in FL1, forcing E 1 = 0. Calibration of cellular autofluorescence in FL2 and FL3 is relative to the measurement in FL1, forcing A 1 = 1. GFP(S65T), EMA, and autofluorescence are estimated in experimental samples from the measured FLi by premultiplying both sides of the compensation equation with the inverse of the compensation coefficient matrix. Fluorescence intensities of the GFP(S65T) and EMA fluorophores were obtained from the intensities of coated beads divided by their respective molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome in each experiment. The applied gene dosage consisted of a controlled combination of EMA-pGL1 and pGL1 plasmid. The EMA-pGL1 and pGL1 plasmid associate with cells at similar rates after conjugation with cationic liposomes (16Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

The copy number of EMA-pGL1 plasmid associated with each cell was estimated from dividing the intensity of the compensated EMA fluorescence by the intensity of each EMA molecule. The total copy number of plasmid and the copy number of pGL1 plasmid associated with each cell was estimated from the known fraction of EMA-pGL1 plasmid. Similarly, the number of GFP(S65T) molecules within each cell was obtained by dividing the intensity of the compensated GFP(S65T) fluorescence by the intensity of each GFP(S65T) molecule. Determination of GFP(S65T) positive events was performed by a standard gating technique. Briefly, the control sample was displayed as a dot plot of EMA versusGFP(S65T) in terms of compensated signals. The gate was drawn along a line of maximum detected GFP(S65T) intensity for control samples. To improve reproducibility and sensitivity, the drawn gate included 0.5% of the total events in the control sample. The gate was held unchanged through the analysis of all measurements in the same experiment. The percentage of positive events was calculated as the events within the gate divided by total number of events. Cellular fluorescence in FL2 and FL3 increased during plasmid treatment due to cellular incorporation of the EMA fluorophore (Fig. 1). Cells exposed to the liposomal vector consistently produced a log normal unimodal population of fluorescence intensity in FL3. The unimodal population shifted toward increased fluorescence intensities in cell samples that were incubated with the liposomal vector for more than 3 h (Fig.1 A). Cellular fluorescence decreased beyond 24 h, after removal of the vector from the medium (Fig. 1 B). This decrease is consistent with dilution of EMA fluorescent label expected following cell division. As shown in Fig. 2, total intracellular plasmid delivery was irrespective of EMA-pGL1 fraction while holding total administered plasmid copy number constant (ANOVA;p < 0.05). This result is consistent with an earlier study (16Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) that reports that EMA labeling does not significantly alter the rate of transmembrane transport. Kinetic trends of plasmid incorporation include rapid DNA uptake immediately after the liposomal vector was applied to the cells. After 0.5 h, each cell contained 2 × 104 plasmid molecules on average; the average intracellular plasmid copy number reached 1.5 × 105per cell after 24 h incubation. The rate of plasmid entry decreased 10-fold from 0.5 to 24 h. After the liposomal vector was replaced with complete medium at 24 h, the average plasmid copy number per cell decreased with an average half-life (t½ of 32 h). Detection of GFP(S65T) offers a direct measurement of transgene expression within many single cells using flow cytometry. The fluorescence of the transfected cell population is composed of the pretransfection cellular autofluorescence with the appearance of highly fluorescent subpopulation, which represents the cells synthesizing GFP(S65T) (Fig. 3) (26Ropp J.D. Donahue C.J. Wolfgang-Kimball D. Hooley J.J. Chin J.Y. Hoffman R.A. Cuthbertson R.A. Bauer K.D. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A region of elevated FL1 fluorescence, presumed to represent intracellular GFP(S65T), was identified through flow cytometric gating for subsequent analysis. Cells which possessed sufficient FL1 fluorescence (i.e. within the gate) were designated as positive for GFP(S65T) synthesis. This gating was used to produce two histograms from each cell population, negative cells that had FL1 fluorescence equivalent to the cellular autofluorescence of untreated controls and GFP(S65T)-positive cells that had significantly increased FL1 fluorescence. These populations are identified in Fig. 3 with GL1 dose as a parameter. The fluorescence intensity of the GFP(S65T)-positive cell population had a maximum of 104units compared with 26 units in the untreated control cell population and was a function of applied pGL1 plasmid. Cells exposed to higher concentration of pGL1 plasmid had greater average intracellular GFP(S65T) levels. Increasing the pGL1 plasmid level also produced a distribution with a longer tail, suggesting that greater pGL1 plasmid entry resulted in increased heterogeneity in transgene expression. The fraction of all cells that were positive for GFP(S65T) expression increases sharply after 6 h of liposomal vector incubation and achieves a maximum of 30% after 48 h (Fig.4). After 12 h, the GFP(S65T)-positive percentages were a significant function of applied pGL1 plasmid at each sampling time (ANOVA; p < 0.05). A positive population was detected in the 1000 ng/2000 ng and 500 ng/2000 ng treatments after 12 h. The positive percentages reached a plateau under these conditions after 24 h. Treatment with 100 ng/2000 ng delayed the detection of a significant positive population until 24 h. For the 10 ng/2000 ng treatments, the GFP(S65T)-positive percentages never exceeded 3% and were indistinguishable from the control samples, suggesting that undetectable transgene expression occurred at this level of pGL1 plasmid exposure. The maximum fraction of GFP(S65T)-positive cells responded to pGL1 plasmid level in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.5). As the initially applied pGL1 plasmid increases from 100 to 1000 ng in the treatments, the maximum positive percentage increases from 12 to 30%. The fraction of cells positive for GFP(S65T) is a nonlinear function of the applied pGL1 plasmid dosage. The average number of GFP(S65T) molecules contained in each positive cell increased during the 24-h liposomal vector incubation (Fig.6). Cell division in the absence of plasmid, which occurred after the removal of liposomal vector at 24 h, reduces the GFP(S65T) level per positive cell measured at 48 and 72 h. A correction for cell division, shown as the dashed line for the 1000 ng/2000 ng treatment, suggests that GFP synthesis continues for at least 72 h. Similar continuation of transgene expression after liposomal vector removal was also estimated for other treatments (not shown). After fluorescence intensity compensation, the GFP(S65T) detection limit was about 2 × 105 molecules/cell, equivalent to 80 nm for a cell size of 20 μm. The detection limit of wild type GFP by confocal microscopy was reported as 7000 nm (24Niswender K.D. Blackman S.M. Rohde L. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Microsc. 1995; 180: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After 3-h exposure to the liposomal vector, more than 95% of the cells were positive for plasmid entry but without detectable transgene expression (Fig. 7). Maximum transgene expression was achieved after 24 h and remained constant up to 72 h. After 24 h, the average GFP(S65T)-positive cell percentage was 30% (Fig. 7). These results are the population average measurements from the unique dual fluorescence, single cell technique developed here. A subpopulation analysis was performed to further investigate the quantitative relationships between the positive cell percentage and the amount of delivered plasmid. From the dot plot of GFP(S65T) number versus intracellular plasmid copy number (Fig. 8), each of the 128 EMA channels (one example is shown as a rectangle in Fig. 8) was used as a subpopulation in which the positive cell percentage was calculated. Each channel represents a different EMA fluorescence intensity, which is associated, by calculation, with intracellular plasmid copy number. The following results were obtained by dividing each result of five experiments into 128 channels and averaging the response across experiments in each channel.Figure 8Simultaneous measurements of intracellular plasmid copy number and GFP(S65T) synthesis in individual cells.Intracellular plasmid copy number and GFP(S65T) expression were simultaneously estimated in 20,000 single cells by flow cytometry. Cells were exposed to 1000 ng/2000 ng for 24 h and harvested 24 h post-exposure. Cells which are positive for GFP(S65T) synthesis are identified by black dots, while cells whose autofluorescence masks detectable GFP(S65T) are shown as gray dots. Cells that express GFP(S65T) strongly also contain a high intracellular pGL1 copy number. Subsequent calculations, shown in Fig.9, were performed on subpopulations that were one channel wide in plasmid copy number and all 128 channels wide in GFP(S65T) number. One example of such a subpopulation is shown here as a rectangle. This is a representative result selected from five similar experiments of identical treatments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fraction of cells that express transgene increased with intracellular pGL1 plasmid copy number in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 9). This behavior is conserved at all incubation times. The highest achievable GFP(S65T)-positive percentage increased with liposomal vector exposure time. Each curve represents the GFP(S65T)-positive cellular distribution of its corresponding population average for 1000 ng/2000 ng treatment (Fig.5). After 12 h of incubation, less than 50% of the cells with the highest intracellular plasmid copy number were GFP(S65T)-positive. After 24 h, however, subpopulations composed of 100% GFP(S65T)-positive cells were found at the highest intracellular plasmid levels of greater than 106 copies of plasmid per cell. The absolute number of such cells, however, is low as shown in the intracellular plasmid copy number histogram (Fig. 9). The average fraction of GFP(S65T)-positive cells for the entire population is identified in each curve of Fig. 9 with a hollow symbol. These complete population averages reflect the skewed distribution of cell number as a function of intracellular plasmid content. The same effect of delivered pGL1 plasmid on GFP(S65T)-positive percentage was found in other treatments, but not shown. A common indicator for evaluating transfection efficiency is the amount of transgene product in the cell lysate, typically reported as units/mg of total cell protein. In this study, simultaneous fluorescence measurements of EMA-pGL1 plasmid and GFP(S65T) expression by flow cytometry were used to establish quantitative relationships in individual mammalian cells among the applied gene dosage, the delivered plasmid copy number, and the transgene expression. Greater than 95% of the treated cells contain significant plasmid after a 3-h exposure to liposomal vector (Figs. 1 and 7). Transgene expression, however, is delayed relative to plasmid delivery and achieves a maximum of 30% after 48 h (Figs. 4 and 7). These results are consistent with previous evidence (16Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 23Tseng W.C. Purvis N.B. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. Biotech. Bioeng. 1996; 50: 548-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that the transmembrane transport of cationic liposomal vectors is not a limiting step in transgene expression. Nevertheless, intracellular plasmid copy number is strongly correlated with transgene expression percentages and levels (Figs. 5, 6, and 9). Specifically, subpopulations with nearly complete transgene expression were found within the whole population for cells containing the greatest intracellular plasmid copy number (>106 plasmid copies per cell) (Fig. 9). Although few cells in the whole population achieve this level of intracellular plasmid, this result suggests that 100% transfection efficiency for transgene expression is achievable using cationic liposomal vectors. When a higher gene dosage (2000 ng/4000 ng) was applied in an attempt to achieve greater average GFP(S65T)- positive percentage expression, many transfected cells were damaged, presumably due to cytotoxicity (data not shown). Based on these findings, a DNA-liposome formulation with low cytotoxicity but with the capability of delivering plasmid at a rapid rate will presumably enhance transgene expression. Competition between plasmid delivery and intracellular heterologous DNA degradation is one hypothesis that explains the observed relationship between transgene expression and plasmid delivery. At constant exposure time and cell surface area, cells that contain the greatest number of plasmid copies experience the greatest average transmembrane plasmid flux. In some cells, the plasmid flux across the cell membrane exceeds the intracellular heterologous DNA degradation rate. This degradation is the sum of all intracellular events that prevent correct plasmid transcription, presumably including endocytotic processing and cytosolic nuclease activity. The resulting intact plasmid is available for transgene expression. For a sufficiently small plasmid flux, complete intracellular plasmid degradation is rapidly achieved and limits intact plasmid access to the nucleus. A rate, rather than concentration, dependence explains the observation of cell subpopulations with intracellular plasmid that fail to participate in transgene expression (Fig. 9). Although the mechanism of plasmid entry into the nucleus is still unclear, a high transmembrane plasmid flux presumably increases the cytosolic intact plasmid concentration, enhances the opportunity for intact plasmid access to the nucleus, and results in more GFP(S65T)-positive cells and a higher level of GFP(S65T). Cells containing less than 2 × 104 copies of pGL1 plasmid weakly express the transgene (Fig. 9), suggesting an average intracellular heterologous DNA degradation rate of 30 intact plasmid copies/cell/min within the first 12 h. Cells that incorporated more than 106 copies of plasmid were 100% positive for transgene expression. The corresponding maximum intracellular heterologous DNA degradation rate under these conditions is estimated to be 1400 copies/cell/min. Therefore, the intracellular heterologous DNA degradation rate might range at least from 30 to 1400 copies/cell/min within the whole population. When the rate of plasmid entry is less than the heterologous DNA degradation rate, the incorporated plasmid is likely to be degraded before reaching the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 5, a 10 ng/2000 ng treatment did not achieve significant detectable GFP(S65T)-positive percentage. The highest GL1 plasmid entry rate for this treatment was estimated to be 3.5 copies/cell/min during the first 3 h. The percent of all cells that express GFP(S65T) depends on the pGL1 plasmid dose (Fig. 5). The same behavior is observed from the heterogeneous intracellular plasmid copy number within an identically treated cell population (Fig. 9). The effect of intracellular plasmid delivery heterogeneity on transgene expression is an important factor in optimizing gene therapy. Strategies that seek to optimize average transgene expression efficiency by increasing only plasmid dosage are limited by the asymptote at high intracellular pGL1 copy number (Fig.5). Current transgene measurement techniques that average a large population of cells are unable to explore these relationships. The transmembrane efficacy, defined as the ratio of total intracellular plasmid to initially applied plasmid, provides a measure of vehicle effectiveness. The total intracellular plasmid copy number in an entire population may be obtained by integration of the plasmid distribution histogram multiplied by the total cell number. Exposure to 1000 ng/2000 ng treatment results in total intracellular plasmid delivery of 4.8 × 1010 (12 h), 7.4 × 1010 (24 h), 7.2 × 1010 (48 h), and 7.4 × 1010 (72 h) copies. These results are shown in Fig. 2 and are scaled for actual cell number as a function of time. Since the total intracellular plasmid copy number is 7.4 × 1010and the applied plasmid copy number in a 1000 ng/2000 ng treatment is 3.7 × 1011, the transmembrane efficacy of this cationic liposome vector is 20% at 24 h incubation. The flow cytometry strategy employed here has significant advantages over existing methods. For example, a common strategy for optimizing liposomal vectors is to search for the highest transgene expression level in the cell lysate. At least two potential difficulties are poorly addressed by this simple strategy. The positive percentage of cells expressing transgene and the level of transgene expression are optimized at high plasmid doses (Figs. 4 and 6). Transgene expression heterogeneity, however, also increases with plasmid dose (Fig. 3). Metabolic engineering has shown that cellular metabolism can be altered by inducing abnormally high enzyme activity. Overexpression of heterologous genes in E. coli, for example, induces misincorporation of amino acids during translation (27Barak Z. Lindsley D. Gallant J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cellular and molecular effects of transgene overexpression in gene therapy remain in question. The effect of expression heterogeneity on overall gene therapy effectiveness has been overlooked to date. The functional effectiveness of transfection formulations might be improved by seeking a more uniform expression population with moderate expression level yet a high percentage of cellular participation. Cell damage resulting from cationic liposomal vector treatment has been observed in this work at the elevated concentration of 2000 ng/4000 ng. Simply increasing the plasmid dosage in an effort to improve transgene expression is limited by cell damage at these extreme conditions. Although the reduction in transgene expression induced by cell damage can be detected by bulk measurement techniques, more explicit recognition of these problem may lead to minimization of cell damage as an additional dimension for functional optimization of gene delivery systems. Transgene expression level measured in the cell lysate, as reported by others, is the product of average transgene expression and the transgene-positive percentage. Transgene expression in single cells cannot be extracted from such a bulk measurement. The transgene expression histograms determined in this work, however, can be integrated to obtain the total GFP(S65T) molecules per 20,000 cells, a measurement equivalent to the single value obtained from a cell lysate (a combination of Figs. 4 and 6 shown as TableI). Populations treated with 500 ng/2000 ng and 1000 ng/2000 ng have a similar percent of GFP(S65T)-positive cells. The average number of GFP(S65T) molecules within each positive cell, however, differs by a factor of 1.5. The 1000 ng/2000 ng treatment produced 1.8 times greater GFP(S65T)-positive percentage than the 100 ng/2000 ng treatment but with 3.3 times the average GFP(S65T) molecules per positive cell. Since transgene expression level is a stronger function of intracellular plasmid copy number than the GFP(S65T)-positive percentage, cell lysate techniques provide a skewed focus on transgene expression level at the expense of the cell fraction that is expressing transgene. The differences among cationic liposome formulations and gene dosages might be masked by single, averaged measurements of transgene expression in the cell lysate, which cannot independently evaluate gene transfer efficacy in terms of the expression percentage and the heterogeneity of cellular expression level.Table IGene dosage modulates the cell fraction that expresses transgene GFP(S65T) and the level of synthesized proteinGene dosage treatment (pGL1/total-pGL1)Relative GFP(S65T)- positive cell percentageRelative average GFP(S65T) molecules per cellRelative GFP(S65T) molecules per 20,000 events100 ng/2000 ng1.001.001.00500 ng/2000 ng1.71 ± 0.112.19 ± 0.173.97 ± 0.271000 ng/2000 ng1.78 ± 0.153.27 ± 0.146.26 ± 0.29 Open table in a new tab Plasmid delivery heterogeneity, measurable by flow cytometry, plays a significant role in transgene expression heterogeneity and inefficiency. Techniques that report a single measure of gene delivery and/or transgene expression based on a population average fail to detect the important effects of cell heterogeneity shown here. Every cell is capable of incorporating the cationic liposomal vector, but not every cell is capable of transgene expression using this delivery system. Our study suggests that complete transgene expression is achievable when cells contain high levels of intracellular plasmid. These results, however, also suggest that transgene expression is not a single deterministic function of intracellular plasmid copy number. Modulation of transgene expression by the rate of plasmid entry is one hypothesis consistent with these observations. Competition between plasmid delivery and intracellular plasmid inactivation may play an important role in controlling transgene expression. Conditions which permit the plasmid entry flux to exceed the intracellular DNA degradation rate presumably enhance transgene expression efficacy. Increasing the applied plasmid dose results in a higher average transgene expression but wider expression level heterogeneity. Gene therapy strategies might be more functionally optimized by selecting liposomal transfection formulas designed to obtain high percentage expression with a relatively uniform transgene expression level at low cytotoxicity instead of optimizing total transgene expression in the cell lysate. Simultaneous measurements of transgene expression and delivered plasmid by flow cytometry provide a useful tool to evaluate different liposomal gene delivery methods.

Each recombinant REG stimulates cleavage of fluorogenic peptides by human red cell proteasomes. The pattern of activated peptide hydrolysis is virtually identical for REGα and REGβ. These two subunits, alone or in combination, stimulate cleavage after basic, acidic, and most hydrophobic residues in many peptides.

Using filter binding and gel filtration assays, recombinant REGγ subunits were shown to bind themselves but not α or β subunits. REGγ differs from REGα and REGβ in that it markedly stimulates hydrolysis of peptides with basic residues in the P1 position but only modestly activates cleavage of LLVY-MCA or LLE-βNA by the proteasome.

These two proteins associate to form four rings stacked upon one another to produce a cylinder roughly 10 nm in diameter and 15 nm in length (4Kopp F. Steiner R. Dahlmann B. Kuehn L. Reinauer H.

In higher eukaryotes, there are 7 genes encoding α subunits and 10 genes encoding β subunits (11Heinemeyer W. Trondle N. Albrecht G. Wolf D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12229-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The β subunits confer upon the proteasome at least five distinct activities that cleave peptide bonds following basic, acidic, hydrophobic, branched chain, and small neutral amino acids (12Orlowski M.

In higher eukaryotes, the two α-rings interact with regulatory complexes to produce either a large 26 S energy-dependent protease or an activated peptidase. A 700-kDa regulatory complex composed of approximately 15 subunits binds eukaryotic proteasomes to form the 26 S protease that degrades ubiquitylated or unmodified proteins in an ATP-dependent fashion (14Hough R.

These in vitro findings suggest that the proteasome and its regulators play an important role in the processing of antigenic peptides. In support of this idea, in vivo evidence indicates that LMP2 and LMP7, two proteasome β subunits, are up-regulated by γ-interferon (33Yang Y. Waters J.B. Früh K. Peterson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice lacking genes for LMP2 or LMP7 exhibit reduced capacity to present antigens on MHC-I molecules (36Van Kaer L. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Eichelberger M. Gaczynska M. Nagashima K.

Muller U. von Boehmer H. Science. 1994; 265: 1234-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). And recently, it has been reported that overexpression of REGα subunits in mouse cells leads to increased antigen presentation (38Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.M. Nature. 1996; 381: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings constitute strong circumstantial evidence that the 11 S REG and the proteasome are involved in production of peptides presented on MHC-I molecules. We proposed earlier that the K i antigen, a protein homologous to the REGα and REGβ subunits, would also be a proteasome activator (39Realini C.A. Rechsteiner M.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the activation properties of recombinant REGα, REGβ, and K i antigen, which we call REGγ. We have found that although REGα and REGβ subunits can independently activate the peptidase activity of the proteasome, together these two proteins form a superactivating αβ complex. The γ subunit did not interact with either α or β subunits. REGγ is, nonetheless, able to bind the proteasome and activate hydrolysis of certain fluorogenic peptides. The fluorogenic peptides Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA (FSR-MCA), Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA (VLK-MCA), Boc-Glu-Lys-Arg-MCA (GKR-MCA), N-glut-Gly-Gly-Phe-MCA (GGF-MCA), Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA (LLVY-MCA), Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-MCA (AAF-MCA), Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA (LRR-MCA) and Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA (PFR-MCA) were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (Belmont, CA). Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-MCA (GGL) was from Bachem Biosciences Inc. (King of Prussia, PA), while benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-βNA (LLE-βNA), Suc-Leu-Tyr-MCA (LY-MCA) and ubiquitin were from Sigma. Nitrocellulose membrane filters (0.1 μm) were from Schleicher and Schuell. Affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Organon Teknika (West Chester, PA). The Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent was obtained from DuPont NEN. The Sequenase® DNA-sequencing kit was from U.S. Biochemical Corp., and the Gene Amp® polymerase chain reaction (PCR) components were purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Sequencing grade [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol), l-[35S]methionine (>800 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]CTP, and 45Ca2+ were supplied by NEN Life Science Products, and amino acid mixtures were from Promega (Madison, WI). The λ ZAP II cDNA library, the pBluescriptR KS, and the XL1 Blue Escherichia coli strain were all from Stratagene (San Diego, CA), while the BL21(DE3) E. coli strain was from Novagen (Madison, WI), and the Library Efficiency DH5α competent cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. Reverse transcriptase avian myeloblastosis virus,NdeI, ClaI, SphI, isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and hog brain calmodulin were from Boehringer Mannheim. The cloning and in vivo expression of the α subunit of human regulator was described earlier (18Realini C. Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20727-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the screening for REGα, a 235-bp partial cDNA for REGβ was isolated. Using this partial clone, [α-32P]CTP-labeled random-primed probes were generated (Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit, Boehringer Mannheim) and used to screen approximately 105 bacteriophages from a λ ZAP II HeLa cell cDNA library as described for the cloning of REGα (18Realini C. Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20727-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A full-length clone for REGβ activator was isolated, sequenced, and subcloned into the pAED4 expression vector. The published sequence of KI-antigen (40Nikaido T. Shimada K. Shibata M. Hata M. Sakamoto M. Takasaki Y. Sato C. Takahashi T. Nishida Y. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 79: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used to design a nondegenerate oligonucleotide primer specific for the 3′-untranslated region of the REGγ gene (5′-AGACCGACATTGCC-3′). The primer served to generate a gene-specific cDNA upon reverse transcription of CsCl2-purified total HeLa cell RNA with reverse transcriptase avian myeloblastosis virus. The resulting cDNA and two primers specific for the N and C terminus of the REGγ gene (5′-ATGGCCTCGTTGC-3′ and 5′-AGGAGTCATGTCTCAGAG-3′, respectively), were combined in PCRs. The EditSeq, MegAlign, and Protean algorithms (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) and data base were used to analyze the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of cloned PCR products. Mutation-free clones were subcloned into expression vectors as described below. Recombinant REGα was prepared as described previously (18Realini C. Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20727-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length cDNAs for REGβ and REGγ were ligated into the NdeI/ClaI or NdeI/BamHI sites, respectively, of the T7 polymerase-dependent expression vector pAED4. Recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3), treated with IPTG according to the manufacturer's instructions, were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mmdithiothreitol. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 39,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble recombinant proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE Sephadex A50 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using a 0–1 m KCl gradient in TSD, pH 8.8, followed by sizing chromatography on a Superdex 200 (26/60) column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mmdithiothreitol. The purity of the recombinant proteins was determined by Coomassie Blue and silver staining of the proteins separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The identity and integrity of the recombinant proteins were assessed by Edman degradation and electrospray mass spectrometry. The purified recombinant proteins were tested for the presence of contaminating proteases and peptidases using ubiquitylated or unmodified 125I-lysozyme and a panel of 12 fluorogenic peptides. In particular, the preparations were tested for E. coli ATP-dependent HslVU protease activity using GGL-MCA, AAF-MCA, and LLVY-MCA as substrates (41Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.-C. Moerschell R.P. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). By a combination of PCR and cloning approaches, we have isolated cDNAs for a number of REG variants. Four of these REG mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified. The four mutant REGs are REGαT, which contains a 17-amino acid extension at the C terminus and forms an inactive heptamer; REGmα, which is an inactive monomer; REGmβ, an inactive monomer; and REGmγ, an inactive heptamer. These four proteins served to control for the presence of E. coli factors that might copurify with the recombinant REGs and fortuitously stimulate the proteasome or cleave fluorogenic peptides directly. In all cases, the purified mutant REGs were completely inactive as proteasome activators, and the final purified fractions did not cleave any fluorogenic peptides. We therefore conclude that none of the activities reported in this paper can be attributed to E. coli proteins. Recombinant BL21(DE3) E. coli carrying the gene for each recombinant protein were exposed to IPTG andl-[35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml) in the presence of an amino acid mixture lacking methionine as described (42Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) host cells containing the empty vector pAED4 plasmid were used to prepare radiolabeled cell lysate. Radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gel was exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or to a PhosphorImager screen. Radiolabeled proteins were diluted in PBS (2.6 mm KCl, 136.8 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNaH2PO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4) containing 5% nonfat milk and were used in a protein blot assay. Recombinant proteins purified from BL21(DE3) E. coli were applied to a nitrocellulose filter using a dot blot apparatus. The filter was stained with Ponceau S, blocked for 60 min in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.04% Tween 20), and then incubated with polyclonal rabbit serum (1:2000 dilution) directed against either REGα or REGβ, washed in TBS, and then incubated for 4 h in the presence of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The peroxidase reaction was performed at room temperature following the manufacturer's instructions for the Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent and exposed to X-OMAT AR films. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in New Zealand White rabbits injected subcutaneously with purified recombinant REGα or recombinant REGγ. Polyclonal antiserum against REGβ was obtained by injecting a ubiquitin fusion protein containing a C-terminal extension specific for the REGβ insert (Ub-DPPPKDDEMETDKQEKKEC). The fusion protein was produced as described earlier (43Yoo Y. Rote K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17078-17083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels were composed of a 4% stacking gel in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, and a 10–20% resolving gel in 37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 0.1% SDS. Gels were run at room temperature in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 200 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS using a Mini-Protean apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by staining in 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 22.5% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid or by silver staining (Bio-Rad). Spectrofluorometric assays were performed in the presence of 100 μm fluorogenic peptides and various amounts of proteasome and REGα, REGβ, or REGγ in a final volume of 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.45. Proteasome and recombinant REG proteins were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of fluorogenic peptide substrates. Reactions were performed at 25 °C or at temperatures indicated in the figure legends and were terminated by adding 200 μl of cold 100% ethanol. Fluorescence was measured with a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer using excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm for peptides containing MCA; hydrolysis of substrates containing βNA was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 335 and 410 nm, respectively. Proteasomes were purified from human red blood cells as described previously (44Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described, and 125I-lysozyme-Ub conjugates were prepared as described (Refs. 45Mahaffey D. Yoo Y. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21205-21211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 46Hough R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2391-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, respectively).Xenopus egg extracts (22.5 μg) were mixed with 25 μl of125I-lysozyme-Ub conjugates (approximately 420 cpm/μl) or unmodified 125I-lysozyme (approximately 106cpm/μl) and various amounts of REGα, REGβ, and REGγ. Alternatively, purified human proteasomes, or proteasome-REG complexes were tested for the presence of ATP-dependent or ATP-independent proteolytic activity using conjugated or unmodified125I-lysozyme. The incubations were at 23 °C, and the fraction of hydrolysis of 125I-lysozyme was determined by acid precipitation (45Mahaffey D. Yoo Y. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21205-21211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual REGα, REGβ, or REGγ or mixtures of REG homologs were separated on a Superdex 200 (26/60) column at 1 ml/min of TSD (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1.0 mmdithiothreitol). The elution of REGα, REGβ, REGγ, REGα/β, and REGmα was compared with the elution positions of calibration proteins II (Combitek, Boehringer Mannheim). Selected fractions (20 μl) were analyzed for proteasome-stimulating activity using LLVY-MCA or LRR-MCA as substrates. Proteins in active fractions were separated by RP-HPLC as indicated in the figure legends. Alternatively, selected fractions were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter after separation on a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel or directly applied to the filter using a dot blot apparatus. The fractions were then analyzed for the presence of α, β, or γ subunits using homolog-specific antibodies. The direct binding assay relies on a monoclonal antibody, MCP20 (a kind gift from K. Hendil (University of Copenhagen)), which binds the proteasome but does not prevent binding of REG homologs. Microtiter wells in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate were coated with 200 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG at 20 μg/ml in 0.05 m carbonate, pH 9.6. The wells were then rinsed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and blocked with 200 μl of 1.5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 2 h. The wells were then filled with 200 μl of a 1:2500 dilution of ascites fluid containing MCP20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with TBS-T, each well was filled with 200 μl of human red cell proteasomes at 30 μg/ml in TBS-T and incubated overnight. The wells were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with REG homologs in 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, for 20 min at 37 °C followed by an additional 150 min at 4 °C. Each well was then quickly rinsed twice with an excess of cold 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20 and once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The bound REG proteins were eluted with 200 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the high salt eluate was dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose for subsequent detection with REG homolog-specific antibodies. cDNAs encoding the α and β subunits of the human 11 S REG were isolated from a λ ZAPII cDNA library containing HeLa sequences. A cDNA for REGγ was amplified from purified HeLa cell RNA using PCR primers designed on the basis of the published sequence (40Nikaido T. Shimada K. Shibata M. Hata M. Sakamoto M. Takasaki Y. Sato C. Takahashi T. Nishida Y. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 79: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences for α and γ subunits match those published earlier (18Realini C. Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20727-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nikaido T. Shimada K. Shibata M. Hata M. Sakamoto M. Takasaki Y. Sato C. Takahashi T. Nishida Y. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 79: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the HeLa REGβ subunit agree with the published sequence except for Ser2 and Asn229, which were identified by Ahn et al. (19Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shimbara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as Ala2and Thr229, respectively. Interestingly, position 229 is also Asn in the REGβ subunit from rats (19Ahn J.Y. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shimbara N. Willy P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A presents the sequence of each subunit aligned to emphasize the homology between the proteins except for highlighted regions that we call subunit-specific “inserts.” The degree of sequence similarity between the three REG homologs is 35–50% using the J. Hein or Clustal methods (Fig. 1 B). Expression of each REG subunit in E. coli BL21(DE3) was initiated by the addition of IPTG to growing cells, and the recombinant proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography, followed by gel filtration (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each subunit constituted more than 90% of the protein pooled after gel filtration (see Fig. 1 C). The molecular masses determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 B) are in good agreement with masses expected for each protein lacking its N-terminal methionine. Size exclusion chromatography demonstrated a marked difference in the apparent size of REGβ as compared with REGα and REGγ. The latter two proteins chromatographed with apparent molecular weights of about 200,000. By contrast, REGβ eluted from Superdex 200 at a size expected for a monomer or dimer (see Fig. 6). Extensive structural analysis, including equilibrium sedimentation and x-ray crystallography, demonstrate that recombinant REGα is a heptamer. 2Johnston, S. C., Whitby, F., Realini, C., Rechsteiner, M., and Hill, C. P. (1997) Protein Sci., in press. Each recombinant REG subunit was tested for its ability to stimulate peptide hydrolysis by proteasomes. Human red blood cell proteasomes were incubated with increasing amounts of each recombinant subunit, and hydrolysis of LLVY-MCA was measured. It is clear from the activation profiles shown in Fig. 2 A that the three subunits differ in their ability to stimulate cleavage of LLVY-MCA. Although high concentrations of REGα and REGβ produce equivalent extents of activation, the two homologs differ significantly at lower concentration. Activation by REGβ is biphasic, with modest stimulation of LLVY-MCA cleavage at concentrations below 30 ng/μl and stimulation equivalent to REGα at higher concentrations (Fig.2 B). The complex activation curve for REGβ was observed in three separate titrations. Mixtures of REGα and REGβ produce 2-fold greater activation than either protein alone. Stimulation of LLVY-MCA cleavage by REGγ was only 2–4-fold, far less than the 30–50-fold stim"
https://openalex.org/W2128819566,"In prior work we showed that a metallogelatinase is secreted from dog mastocytoma cells and directly activated by exocytosed mast cell α-chymase. The current work identifies the protease as a canine homologue of progelatinase B (92-kDa gelatinase, MMP-9), determines the sites cleaved by α-chymase, and explores the regulation of gelatinase expression in mastocytoma cells. To obtain a cDNA encoding the complete sequence of mastocytoma gelatinase B, a 2.3-kilobase clone encoding progelatinase was isolated from a BR mastocytoma library. The sequenced cDNA predicts a 704-amino acid protein 80% identical to human progelatinase B. Regions thought to be critical for active site latency, such as the Cys-containing propeptide sequence, PRCGVPD, and the catalytic domain sequence, HEFGHALGLDHSS, are entirely conserved. Cleavage of progelatinase B by purified dog α-chymase yielded an ∼84-kDa product that contained two NH2-terminal amino acid sequences, QTFEGDLKXH and EGDLKXHHND, which correspond to residues 89–98 and 92–101 of the cDNA predicted sequence, respectively. Thus, α-chymase cleaves the catalytic domain of gelatinase B at the Phe88-Gln89 and Phe91-Glu92 bonds. Like BR cells, the C2 line of dog mastocytoma cells constitutively secrete progelatinase B which is activated by α-chymase. By contrast, non-chymase-producing C1 cells secrete a gelatinase B (which remains in its proform) only in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Whereas 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation of BR cells produced a ∼15-fold increase in gelatinase B mRNA expression, dexamethasone down-regulated its expression by ∼5-fold. Thus, extracellular stimuli may regulate the amount of mast cell progelatinase B expressed by mast cells. These data further support a role for mast cell α-chymase in tissue remodeling involving gelatinase B-mediated degradation of matrix proteins.

Whether initiated by reagents such as chaotropes, oxidants, or proteases, MMP activation proceeds along a putative common pathway which involves disruption of an intramolecular interaction between a propeptide Cys and Zn2+ in the active site, a mechanism which has been termed the cysteine switch (8Springman E.B. Angelton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Gelatinase B, like other MMP's, appears to be biologically ubiquitous. It has been identified in all major organ systems and implicated in numerous homeostatic and pathological processes. Wound injury models suggest a unique role for the enzyme in remodeling of basement membranes, which are composed mainly of collagen IV, its principal collagenous substrate (9Salo T. Makela M.

Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Bartlett J.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 622-633PubMed Google Scholar). While mechanisms regulating MMP activation in vivo remain unclear, activation pathways involving proteases are likely. Proteolytic cleavage on the COOH-terminal side of the propeptide domain sequence, PRCGVPD, disrupts the cysteine switch and permits further zymogen processing by autocatalytic cleavages. Autolysis truncates the proenzyme at both the NH2 and COOH termini to yield enzymatically active forms (8Springman E.B. Angelton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Serine proteases, such as plasmin and furin (13He C. Wilhelm S.M. Pentland A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

Mast cells are widespread, extravascular mononuclear cells which release serine proteases during degranulation. They produce and store tryptic and chymotryptic enzymes (tryptases and chymases, respectively) which have been implicated in MMP activation pathways (19Schulman E.S. Crit. Rev.

We previously reported that BR dog mastocytoma cells constitutively release a 92-kDa gelatinolytic protease similar to gelatinase B, but secrete its activator, α-chymase, only in response to a degranulating stimulus (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Those data predicted that activation of gelatinase by α-chymase would occur in the setting of mast cell degranulation by agents such as anaphylatoxins, substance P, or antigen-bound IgE (19Schulman E.S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 13: 35-70PubMed Google Scholar). Once released into the neutral extracellular environment, α-chymase readily activates gelatinase B without intermediary proteases or cofactors (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the present work, we identify the sites in progelatinase B cleaved by α-chymase and explore the expression of mast cell gelatinase B. To screen the dog BR mastocytoma λgt10 cDNA library (25Vanderslice P. Craik C.S. Nadel J.A. Caughey G.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4148-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a 235-base pair fragment of human gelatinase B corresponding to nucleotides 1291–1526 (26Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E.

This fragment, which encodes a portion of the α2-collagen V-like region that is unique to gelatinase B, was a gift of R. Dehiya. Phage from the library were plated in agarose, incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, and then transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham). The membranes were pre-hybridized in buffer containing: 0.75 m NaCl, 0.05 mNaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), and 5 mm EDTA (5 × SSPE); 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (5 × Denhardt's reagent); and 0.5% SDS with 150 μg/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm (Sigma) for 1 h at 65 °C. Immobilized phage DNA was then hybridized to 100 ng of denatured fluorescein-labeled probe in the same solution for 16 h at 65 °C. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 21 °C, and twice in 1 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 50 °C. For signal generation and detection, the membranes were handled according to the manufacturer's instructions for the ECL random prime labeling system (Amersham). Strongly hybridizing clones were plaque-purified and rescreened. Phage DNA from several clones was purified by the plate lysate method, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane, and hybridized to the labeled probe. The largest oligonucleotide fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK+ phagemid (Stratagene). pBluescript T3 and T7 primers or synthetic oligonucleotides (Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco) based on previously determined sequences were used to prime the sequencing reactions. Sequences were analyzed and aligned using GeneWorks software (Intelligenetics). BR dog mastocytoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H16 medium supplemented with 2% bovine calf serum and harvested as described previously (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). C1 and C2 dog mastocytoma cells were cultured in the same manner and were a gift of S. Lazarus. BR, C1, and C2 dog mastocytoma cells were harvested by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min, washed three times in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, and then resuspended in serum-free media to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were incubated in the presence of 10−8m12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or 10−8m soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) at 37 °C. The conditioned medium was harvested after 24 h and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove cells and debris, and then stored at −20 °C. Aliquots of conditioned medium were concentrated ∼10-fold using a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon). Gelatinolytic activity was assayed by gelatin substrate zymography performed as described previously (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To generate medium rich in unactivated progelatinase B, BR and C2 cells were co-incubated in the presence of 3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10−8m TPA at 37 °C for 18 h. The conditioned medium was harvested after 18 h and centrifuged at 500 × g to remove cells and debris; decanted supernatant was stored at −20 °C. For isolation of gelatinase B mRNA transcripts, BR cells were resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H16 at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated alone or with either 10−8m TPA, 10−10m dexamethasone, or 10−10minterleukin (IL)-1β for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 18 h more in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H16 medium either alone or with the same concentrations of TPA, dexamethasone, or IL-1β. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, the cell pellets and decanted supernatants were harvested and stored separately at −70 °C. Progelatinase B was purified from media conditioned by BR cells as described previously (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Crude media conditioned by C2 cells were processed in a similar manner to isolate purified proenzyme. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C with Ca2+- and Brij-free gelatin column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.02 m EDTA). In brief, crude medium was brought to a final concentration of 0.5 m NaCl and 0.02 m EDTA, and then subjected to sequential chromatography using DEAE-cellulose, gelatin-agarose, and lentil lectin-Sepharose (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Bound enzyme was eluted with buffer containing 0.5 m α-methylmannoside and concentrated using a YM-10 filtration membrane (Amicon). To remove α-methylmannoside, the eluate was dialyzed against 10 mm NH4HCO3overnight. The purified enzyme was then stored at −20 °C. α-Chymase was purified from dog mastocytoma cell homogenates as described previously (27Caughey G.H. Viro N.F. Lazarus S.C. Nadel J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). α-Chymase activation of progelatinase B was shown in our laboratory to proceed directly without the need for participation by other proteases or cofactors (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Aliquots of media conditioned by C1 cells or progelatinase B purified from media conditioned by BR or C2 cells were incubated with 40 nm α-chymase at 37 °C for 20 min. To detect α-chymase-mediated cleavage of progelatinase B in these conditioned media, samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography under nonreducing conditions. To examine cleavage in a reconstituted system using purified enzymes, ∼20 μg of purified progelatinase B were incubated with 10−8m α-chymase, with heparin in a mass ratio of 1:1, for 18 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2. To block autocatalytic cleavages following the initial α-chymase activation, reactions were carried out at 0 °C (20Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18134-18140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by cooling to −20 °C. To identify progelatinase B products of α-chymase cleavage, an aliquot of the reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The bulk of the reaction mixture was processed for amino acid sequencing, as described below. Activation of progelatinase B (2 μg/ml in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Brij-35) for radiolabeled substrate assays was performed by incubation of the proenzyme (in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2) with different concentrations of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) or α-chymase (in the absence or presence of bovine lung heparin (Sigma)) for different time intervals. Amino acid sequence was determined by the Biomolecular Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The reaction mixture containing the gelatinase B products of α-chymase cleavage was electrophoresed onto an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm CAPS buffer containing 10% methanol for 4 h at 4 °C. Following blotting, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands at ∼84 kDa were cut from the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation using a 470A gas-phase sequencer with an on-line 120A PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Protein sequence data base searches were carried out using GeneWorks software (Intelligenetics). Determination of soluble gelatinase B activity using [3H]collagen substrate was performed as described previously (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, [3H]collagen was denatured to [3H]gelatin by boiling for 5 min immediately prior to use in assays. Aliquots of dog progelatinase activated by α-chymase (in the absence or presence of heparin) or trypsin were removed at various intervals and the reactions were terminated by addition of 62.5 μm SBTI, 3 μm aprotinin, or 10 μml-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe chloromethylketone (Sigma) and placed at 0 °C. The gelatinase samples were diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) with 5 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 2 mg/ml ovalbumin and then added to an equal volume of [3H]gelatin. After incubation at 37 °C for different time periods, the reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots of supernatants were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry to detect acid-solubilized gelatin peptides. One unit (U) of gelatinolytic activity was defined as 1 μg of gelatin digested per min at 37 °C. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from BR mastocytoma cells incubated alone or in the presence of TPA, dexamethasone, or IL-1β using a poly(A)+ RNA extraction kit (Micro-Fast Track, InVitrogen). After denaturation in 3.7% formaldehyde, 50% formamide at 65 °C for 15 min, poly(A)+ RNA was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6.1% formaldehyde, transferred to Nytran Plus nylon membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar), and vacuum-baked at 80 °C. The membrane was prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide containing 5 × Denhardt's reagent and 5 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS and 150 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The 2.3-kilobase dog gelatinase B cDNA was random-prime labeled with [α-32P]ATP (Amersham) and hybridized to the filter at 42 °C overnight. The filters were washed twice in 6 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, twice in 1 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 15 min, and once in 0.1 × SSPE with 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 15 min. To remove previously bound probe, blots were incubated in 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% pyrophosphate, and 0.1 × Denhardt's reagent at 65 °C for 5 h. Densitometric data were obtained by analysis of autoradiographic signals generated by hybridizing the blot with a labeled probe. To account for possible variations in signal intensity due to differing concentrations of total mRNA present in each lane, the blot was also hybridized with a labeled probe for γ-actin. Densitometric data were then compared with control values obtained with the γ-actin probe. Screening of ∼106 plaques of the BR dog mastocytoma λgt10 cDNA library with a human gelatinase B cDNA fragment yielded 16 hybridizing clones. A 2.3-kilobase cDNA isolated from these clones contains an open reading frame of 2115 base pairs that encodes a 704-amino acid protein as seen in Fig. 1. 166 base pairs following the stop codon are untranslated in the 3′-region. Processing of a 19-residue signal peptide yields a cDNA-predicted proenzyme NH2-terminal sequence that differs by one residue from the previously reported dog mastocytoma NH2-terminal progelatinase sequence (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Edman degradation of the purified enzyme yielded the sequence, APXPNKPTVVVFP, with an indeterminate residue in position 3. The dog cDNA predicts the sequence, APRPHKPTVVVFP, which includes His at position 5. This is consistent with a less intense His peak also previously detected by Edman degradation (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The dog nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are 78 and 80% identical, respectively, to the corresponding human gelatinase B sequences. Whereas the dog protein sequence is ∼70% identical to mouse and rat sequences, it is 81% identical to the rabbit sequence (29Fini M.E. Bartlett J.D. Matsubara M. Rinehart W.B. Mody M.K. Girard M.T.

Commun. 1993; 190: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Regions critical for MMP active site latency and structural stability are highly conserved. As seen in Fig.2, the dog propeptide sequence, PRCGVPDLG (78–86), and catalytic domain sequence, HEFGHALGLDHSSVPE (382–392), are identical to the corresponding mammalian sequences. These regions contain the Cys and His residues essential for ligation of the catalytic Zn2+ in MMP's (32Lovejoy B. Cleasby A. Hassell A.M. Longley K. Luther M.A. Weigl D. McGeehan G. McElroy A.B. Drewry D. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Science. 1994; 263: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The dog and human peptide sequences also share 19 conserved Cys residues as shown in Fig. 2. Two of these residues, Cys446 in the collagen V-like region unique to gelatinase B and Cys652 at the COOH terminus, do not occur in other types of MMP's. The dog enzyme also shares 2 of 3 putative N-glycosylation sites identified in other gelatinase B's. As seen in Fig. 2, the dog consensus site at Asn19 also exists in the human, mouse, and rat sequences, but is absent in the rabbit sequence. A second site at Asn108 is shared by the human, mouse, and rabbit sequences, but not by the rat sequence. The dog enzyme lacks another potential glycosylation site at residue 101 shared by the other species. The dog cDNA contains a unique 9-base pair in-frame deletion in the 54 residue collagen V-like region that predicts the absence of 3-amino acid residues beginning at Pro438 as indicated in Fig.2. In addition to the BR line of dog mastocytoma cells, several other mast cell lines expressed gelatinase B. As seen in Fig. 3, crude media conditioned by C1 and C2 dog mastocytoma cells demonstrated gelatinolytic activity with an electrophoretic profile characteristic of gelatinase B. Expression of gelatinase B by C2 cells in the presence of TPA or SBTI was similar to that previously observed for BR cells (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). C2 cells expressed gelatinase B constitutively and increased expression in response to TPA stimulation. Gelatinolytic activity occurred predominantly at ∼92 kDa, with another band visible at ∼68 kDa. The lower band was absent in media conditioned by cells co-incubated with TPA and SBTI (an inhibitor of α-chymase), as shown in lane 3 of Fig. 3. This suggests that C2 progelatinase B is also activated extracellularly by α-chymase released during spontaneous degranulation or cell lysis (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). By contrast, C1 cells expressed gelatinase B only in response to TPA stimulation. No gelatinolytic activity appeared at a molecular mass below 92 kDa in media conditioned by cells in the presence of TPA alone. These data suggest that progelatinase B secreted by C1 cells is inactive probably due to the absence of α-chymase. C2 cells release measurable amounts of α-chymase, but C1 cells do not (33DeVinney R. Gold W.M. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in lane 5 of Fig. 3, incubation of purified BR or C2 progelatinase B and crude TPA-induced C1 progelatinase B with purified dog α-chymase generated lower molecular weight bands of gelatinolytic activity. We previously determined that α-chymase cleavage of purified dog mastocytoma gelatinase B yields products which digest 3H-labeled gelatin substrate in solution (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of heparin on α-chymase-mediated activation of progelatinase B, soluble gelatinase B activity was determined following proenzyme activation by either α-chymase alone or α-chymase reconstituted with heparin, as shown in Fig. 4. As previously shown, gelatinase activity detected at time 0 reflects the presence of active forms resulting from autoactivation during purification or storage. In the absence of heparin, α-chymase-activated gelatinase B activity increases ∼1.8-fold at 3 h and then declines. As shown in Fig.5, the maximal specific activity of α-chymase-activated gelatinase B is 735 units/mg which represents 55% of the maximal specific activity of trypsin-activated gelatinase B (1335 units/mg). By contrast, gelatinase B activity peaks at 1 h when α-chymase is reconstituted with heparin (in a 1:100 heparin:α-chymase mass ratio) and demonstrates a similar ∼1.7-fold increase in activity. Increasing heparin:α-chymase mass ratios precludes detection of gelatinase B activity, suggesting rapid proenzyme activation and inactivation (data not shown). Addition of heparin did not increase the low levels of gelatinolytic activity attributed to α-chymase itself, as described previously (data not shown) (24Fang K. Raymond W. Lazarus S. Caughey G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of heparin, peak activity of α-chymase-activated gelatinase B occurs earlier, while its magnitude remains unchanged.Figure 5Activation of progelatinase B by α-chymase and trypsin. Purified dog progelatinase B (6.8 nm) was incubated with the following concentrations of trypsin (1.5 pm, 15 pm, 150 pm, 1.5 nm, 15 nm, and 75 nm) in Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm CaCl2 at 22 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 μm aprotinin and then placed at 0 °C. Purified dog gelatinase B was also incubated with α-chymase (1.3 pm, 13 pm, 130 pm, 1.3 nm, 13 nm, 65 nm) in the same buffer containing a molar excess of heparin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μm Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe chloromethylketone and placed at 0 °C. Soluble gelatinase activity was determined by incubation of samples with [3H]gelatin. Maximal specific activity of α-chymase-activated progelatinase B (735 units/mg) is 55% of that of trypsin-activated progelatinase B (1335 units/mg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As seen in Fig.6, incubation of progelatinase B with α-chymase results in a decrease in the proenzyme form and the appearance of two bands at ∼88 and ∼84 kDa. Addition of heparin in a mass ratio of 1:1 with α-chymase accelerated the cleavage of progelatinase B compared with α-chymase alone (data not shown). Increasing the enzyme:substrate ratio resulted in greater conversion of the proenzyme to the ∼84-kDa band, without any increase in the faint ∼88-kDa band as seen in lane 3. Whereas bands corresponding to the ∼92-kDa proform and the ∼84-kDa α-chymase cleavage product were visible on the membrane following blotting and detection by Coomassie Blue staining, the ∼88-kDa band was variabl"
https://openalex.org/W2053789319,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 2 and 3 (β-adrenergic receptor kinases 1 and 2 (βARK1 and -2)) mediate the agonist-dependent phosphorylation and uncoupling of many G protein-coupled receptors. These two members of the GRK family share a high degree of sequence homology and show overlapping patterns of substrate specificity in vitro. To define their physiological roles in vivo we have generated mice that carry targeted disruption of these genes. In contrast to GRK2-deficient mice, which die in utero (Jaber, M., Koch, W. J., Rockman, H., Smith, B., Bond, R. A., Sulik, K. K., Ross, J. JR., Lefkowitz, R. J. Caron, M. G., and Giros, B. (1996)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 12974–12979), GRK3 deletion allows for normal embryonic and postnatal development. GRK3 is expressed to a high degree in the olfactory epithelium, where GRK2 is absent. Here we report that cilia preparations derived from GRK3-deficient mice lack the fast agonist-induced desensitization normally seen after odorant stimulation. Moreover, total second messenger (cAMP) generation in these cilia preparations following odorant stimulation is markedly reduced when compared with preparations from wild-type littermates. This reduction in the ability to generate cAMP is evident even in the presence of nonodorant receptor stimuli (GTPγS and forskolin), suggesting a compensatory dampening of the G protein-adenylyl cyclase system in the GRK3 (−/−) mice in the olfactory epithelium. These findings demonstrate the requirement of GRK3 for odorant-induced desensitization of cAMP responses. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 2 and 3 (β-adrenergic receptor kinases 1 and 2 (βARK1 and -2)) mediate the agonist-dependent phosphorylation and uncoupling of many G protein-coupled receptors. These two members of the GRK family share a high degree of sequence homology and show overlapping patterns of substrate specificity in vitro. To define their physiological roles in vivo we have generated mice that carry targeted disruption of these genes. In contrast to GRK2-deficient mice, which die in utero (Jaber, M., Koch, W. J., Rockman, H., Smith, B., Bond, R. A., Sulik, K. K., Ross, J. JR., Lefkowitz, R. J. Caron, M. G., and Giros, B. (1996)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 12974–12979), GRK3 deletion allows for normal embryonic and postnatal development. GRK3 is expressed to a high degree in the olfactory epithelium, where GRK2 is absent. Here we report that cilia preparations derived from GRK3-deficient mice lack the fast agonist-induced desensitization normally seen after odorant stimulation. Moreover, total second messenger (cAMP) generation in these cilia preparations following odorant stimulation is markedly reduced when compared with preparations from wild-type littermates. This reduction in the ability to generate cAMP is evident even in the presence of nonodorant receptor stimuli (GTPγS and forskolin), suggesting a compensatory dampening of the G protein-adenylyl cyclase system in the GRK3 (−/−) mice in the olfactory epithelium. These findings demonstrate the requirement of GRK3 for odorant-induced desensitization of cAMP responses. Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). show diminished ability to signal and couple to G proteins after prolonged or repeated agonist stimulation. This phenomenon, referred to as agonist-mediated desensitization, occurs very rapidly and is initiated via receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) that serve to uncouple the receptor from its G protein (1Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 33-42Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas the function of these proteins has been mostly studied in vitro and in tissue culture the physiological relevance of the mechanisms initiated by them have just begun to be explored. While there is some evidence of substrate specificity among the different members of the GRK family, most show activity toward a wide variety of agonist-occupied receptors in vitro. This, in addition to their ubiquitous tissue expression, has made it difficult to precisely determine the role of the GRKs in vivo. To clarify the physiological role of the individual members of this family, we have generated mice that carry targeted disruptions of the GRK2 or GRK3 (βARK2) genes. GRK2 deletion is embryonically lethal as homozygous mice die in utero before gestational day 15.5 of severe cardiac malformations (2Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K.

Whereas GRKs 2 and 3 show 81% amino acid identity (3Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an overlapping pattern of tissue expression (4Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M.J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14939-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GRK3 apparently is not able to compensate for the loss of GRK2 in embryogenesis. In most tissues examined GRK2 is the predominant form. However, in the olfactory epithelium GRK2 is virtually absent, and GRK3, as well as the second messenger-dependent protein kinases PKA and PKC, is thought to be responsible for the desensitization of olfactory receptors (5Schleicher S. Boekhoff I. Arriza J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which are members of the GPCR superfamily (6Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar). Here we report that ablation of the GRK3 gene by homologous recombination indeed leads to a phenotypic abnormality of the olfactory system. Unlike GRK2-deficient mice, the GRK3-disrupted mice develop and breed normally but show a loss of odorant receptor-mediated desensitization. In addition, the marked down-regulation in odorant receptor-mediated cAMP generation in olfactory epithelia of these mice suggests that major adaptive changes in the second messenger generating system have occurred in response to the lack of GRK3. The odorants citralva (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadiennitrile), hedione (3-oxo-2-pentyl cyclopentaneacetic acid methyl ester), eugenol (2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)phenol), geraniol (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol), and menthone (5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)cyclohexanone) were provided by DROM (Baierbrunn, Germany). GTPγS, forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and the goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (horseradish peroxidase) were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Radioligand assay kits for cAMP as well as the enhanced chemiluminescence systems (ECL) for Western blots were provided by Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany). RNAzol reagent was from Tel-Test, and the Nytran membranes and turboblotter kits used for nucleic acid transfer were from Schleicher & Schuell. All primers were from Genosys. The Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were from Sigma. All chemicals were of the highest purity available. A bacteriophage λ library of mouse 129SVJ genomic DNA (Stratagene) was screened with a cDNA for rat GRK3 (3Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive phages were identified and analyzed by restriction digest. A 2.4-kb BamHI fragment was shown to contain two exons encoding part of the catalytic subdomain I. The second exon located in this fragment contains the consensus GXGXXG motif of protein kinases (7Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was assembled by subcloning a 1.9-kbSalI-BamHI fragment, located immediately 5′ to the exon a and b containing BamHI fragment into plasmid pBS SK (Stratagene). A 3.9-kbBamHI-NotI fragment containing exon c(3′ of the 2.4-kb fragment containing exons a and b) was then added. Finally this construct was digested with BamHI, and a 1.9-kb cassette containing the neomycin resistance gene under control of the human glycerol phosphate kinase promoter (from plasmid pD383, R. Hen, Columbia University, New York) was inserted in antisense orientation. This cassette contains a single EcoRI site which was used to analyze homologous recombinants. The entire targeting vector was sequenced. This targeting vector was digested with SalI, gel-purified, and electroporated into mouse embryonic stem cells. Electroporation, cell culture, and G418 selection and generation of chimeric animals were as described (8Koller B.H. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8932-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). After electroporation, 54 G418 resistant clones were analyzed by Southern blotting of EcoRI-restricted DNA. Two clones positive for one event of homologous recombination were found. One clone, termed EP 149-7, was karyotyped and used for blastocyst injection. It generated two chimeric male animals, one of which transmitted the stem cell character to its offspring. All mice were cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (25Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals NIH publication No. 85-23. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1985Google Scholar). Mouse tail DNA was isolated following overnight digestion with proteinase K in 1% SDS at 65 °C. Approximately 10 μg of DNA was digested overnight with EcoRI, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The 5′ probe was a 189-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment located 5′ to the targeting vector. The 3′ probe was a 200-bp DNA fragment that was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-TATAGTGCACACCAGCTC-3′ and 5′-CACTGAGGTGGCTGAGAG-3′. All DNAs used as probes were gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Stratagene's random primer labeling kit. Prehybridization and hybridization were done at 55 °C in 4 × SSC, 25% formamide, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml tRNA, and 10% dextran sulfate. Following overnight hybridization the filters were washed initially in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C. The final wash was in 0.2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 70 °C. The filters were exposed to X-R Kodak film for up to 3 days. Total brain RNA was isolated using the RNAzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test). The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out with antisense primer 5′-atatctagaCAGTGCTAACGAGAGACAGCATGATCC-3′ (position 719–745 of the rat GRK3 cDNA) for 1 h in 1 × superscript buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) including 4 units of RNAsin (Promega) at 45 °C using 5 μg of total mouse brain RNA and 2 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 20 μl. This reaction was then used for a PCR reaction in a total volume of 100 μl, containing 1 × Thermo Buffer, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 500 nm of each oligonucleotide primer. PCR was carried out using the same primer as was used for the RT reaction and sense primer 5′-attgaattcCGGCAGATGTACGACGCCTACATCATG-3′ (position 316–342 of the rat GRK3 cDNA) under standard conditions (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.20Google Scholar). Reactions were assembled on ice without polymerase and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) were added. Reactions were cycled 35 times for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C with a final extension time of 5 min at 72 °C. Following gel electrophoresis on an 1% agarose gel the PCR products were denatured and transferred to nylon membrane and hybridized with the end-labeled sense primer 5′-CCAAGAAGCAGGTGACGC-3′ (position 413–430 of the rat GRK3 cDNA). The deletion introduced into the GRK3 gene spans nucleotides 506–650 of the GRK3 cDNA. In addition, PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XbaI (underlined in sequence above), subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), and sequenced. 20 μg of total RNA was denatured with glyoxal, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to Nytran membrane using Schleicher & Schuell's turboblotter kit for 2 h in 10 mm NaOH, 3 × SSC. Following neutralization and UV crosslinking the membranes were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as described above for the Southern blots. The probes used were rat cDNAs for GRK2, GRK3, and actin. Partially purified preparations of chemosensory cilia from mouse olfactory epithelium were isolated with the calcium shock method (10Anholt R.R.H. Aebi U. Snyder S. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1403-1406Crossref Google Scholar). A rapid kinetic system was used to determine odorant-induced changes of second messenger concentrations in the subsecond time range. Stimulation experiments were performed at 37 °C as described previously (11Breer H. Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Nature. 1990; 345: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). For stimulation experiments requiring IBMX, cilia preparations were pretreated on ice for 5 min with 1 mm IBMX and subsequently incubated with the stimulation buffer for 2 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C before the reaction was terminated. The stimulation buffer, cilia preparation, and stop solution were the same as in the subsecond time range stimulation experiments, except that 1 mm IBMX was applied in the stimulation buffer. Quenched samples were stored on ice for 20 min and then analyzed for second messenger concentrations as described previously (12Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Strotmann J. Breer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated by the method described by Pershadsingh and McDonald (13Pershadsingh H.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); magnesium and calcium present in the tissue were not included in the calculation. Different tissues from normal and GRK3-knockout mice were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (14Krieger J. Schleicher S. Strotmann J. Wanner I. Boekhoff I. Raming K. De Geus P. Breer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blots were stained with Ponceau S, dried, and stored at 4 °C until use. For analysis, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Naturaflor) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies against GRK3 (1:5000 in TBST, containing 3% nonfat dry milk). After three washes with TBST, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 in TBST, 3% nonfat dry milk) was applied, and the ECL system was used to monitor bound antibodies. A 129SVJ mouse genomic library in bacteriophage λ (Stratagene) was screened with a rat cDNA probe to GRK3. 12 positive clones were identified. Restriction analysis indicated that they were overlapping, and primer hybridization and DNA sequencing confirmed the location of three exons (Fig. 1). The intron-exon boundaries between GRKs 2 and 3 are conserved for the exons examined; however the average intron size for the GRK3 gene is considerably larger than that of the GRK2 gene and they share no sequence homology (data not shown). Exon b contains the GRGGFGEV motif of the catalytic subdomain I known to be involved in ATP binding and essential for enzyme activity (7Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). This exon is homologous to exon 8 of the GRK2 gene (2Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) given the conservation of the exon boundaries between these two genes. A BamHI fragment containing exons a and b was removed by homologous recombination and replaced with the neomycin resistance marker. Of 54 G418-resistant colonies two were found to have undergone a single homologous replacement event. One of the clones (designation 149-7) was karyotyped and used for injection into blastocysts. The resultant chimeric animals passed the stem cell character on to their offspring, and sibling mating between heterozygous animals generated homozygous GRK3 (−/−) mice with the expected frequency. Gross pathological examination of GRK3 gene-deleted animals was unremarkable (data not shown). This indicates that GRK3 deletion is compatible with normal development. This is in stark contrast to the deletion of the highly homologous GRK2 gene, which results in embryonic heart failure and death in utero(2Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA extracted from brain of GRK3 (−/−) mice demonstrated that the gene was still transcribed and GRK3 mRNA still present, albeit at a somewhat lower level (Fig.2 A). Therefore we used RT-PCR analysis to confirm the absence of the ATP binding motif located in the catalytic subdomain I (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis of nasal epithelium, where GRK3 is most highly expressed, and cerebral cortex demonstrated the absence of the GRK3 protein in the GRK3 (−/−) mice, indicating that the residual transcribed RNA for GRK3 does not give rise to functional protein (Fig.3 B).Figure 3GRK3 expression and time course of odor-induced cAMP formation in olfactory cilia from GRK3 (−/−) and control mice. A, olfactory cilia isolated from GRK3-knockout (−/−; open squares) and wild-type (+/+; solid circles) mice were stimulated with an odorant mixture (citralva, hedione, eugenol, each 1 μm), and the concentration of cAMP was determined at various time intervals. The results are expressed as odorant-induced changes in the concentration of cAMP (pmol/mg). Data are the means of three independent experiments.Inset, B, fractions of isolated olfactory cilia were assayed for GRK3 expression using GRK3-specific antibodies. The blots were incubated with the polyclonal GRK3-antiserum (1:5000) overnight at 4 °C; immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL system. The positions and molecular sizes (kDa) of standard proteins are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GRK3 is normally highly expressed in the olfactory epithelium (5Schleicher S. Boekhoff I. Arriza J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, at least one other member of the GRK 4–6 subfamily is expressed there, as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Using polyclonal anti-GRK2 or -3 antibodies in permeabilized rat olfactory cilia preparations the involvement of GRK3 (but not GRK2) as well as cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the desensitization of the odorant-induced cAMP generation has been demonstrated (5Schleicher S. Boekhoff I. Arriza J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We, therefore, isolated olfactory cilia from GRK3 (−/−) and wild-type mice and examined second messenger generation over time following stimulation with an odorant mixture. Whereas stimulation of cilia preparations isolated from wild-type mice generates the typical biphasic response indicative of rapid agonist-induced desensitization, cilia preparations from GRK3 (−/−) mice do not show any evidence of desensitization. However, the maximal rise in cAMP generated in these cilia preparations is markedly reduced when compared with preparations isolated from wild-type mice (Fig.3 A). This is evident even in the presence of the phophodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, suggesting that up-regulation of this enzyme is not responsible for the decreased cAMP-generating capacity of these cilia preparations (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, this reduced ability to generate cAMP was independent of the type of odorant stimulus (geraniol or menthone), and hence odorant receptor, used (Fig.4, B and C). The dampening of the second messenger generating capacity observed in GRK3-deleted epithelia preparations might be attributed to a down-regulation of the odorant receptors. However, because of the multitude of odorant receptor subtypes present in olfactory cilia (6Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar) and the lack of procedures to quantitate these receptors, this issue cannot easily be addressed. Alternatively, in an attempt to adapt to the lack of GRK3, reduction in the G protein or in the level of adenylyl cyclase type III could account for the diminished cAMP response. To address some of these questions we treated cilia preparations from wild-type or GRK3 (−/−) mice with GTPγS to directly stimulate the G protein or with forskolin, a stimulator of adenylyl cyclase. As can be seen in Fig. 4, D and E, treatment with GTPγS as well as forskolin leads to a significantly reduced cAMP accumulation in cilia preparations from GRK3 (−/−) mice. The level of reduction is virtually the same as that seen following odorant stimulation (compare with Fig. 4 A). This strongly suggests reduced activity of the odorant receptor-associated G protein-adenylyl cyclase complex. This dampening of the cAMP generating capacity however is restricted to the olfactory epithelium and was not seen in membrane preparations from brain, heart, kidney, or testis of GRK3 (−/−) mice treated with GTPγS or forskolin (data not shown). Repeated or prolonged agonist stimulation of many GPCRs, including odorant receptors, rapidly leads to a loss of further signal transduction, a process termed desensitization, that is initiated by the phosphorylation of the activated receptor (15Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Both GRKs and/or second messenger-dependent kinases can be involved in this event. GRKs are a family of kinases that specifically phoshorylate only the active conformation of the receptor leading to homologous desensitization. In the visual system, rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) initiates quenching of signal transduction from activated rhodopsin by phosphorylation of the receptor. This in turn leads to the binding of a cytosolic protein, termed arrestin, to rhodopsin, which sterically interdicts its further coupling to the G protein transducin (16Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). An analogous situation exists for the β2-adrenergic receptor and other GPCRs (15Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar, 17Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Recent evidence is beginning to suggest that alteration in GPCR desensitization mechanisms may have profound biochemical and physiological consequences. Mutations in both the rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) gene (19Yamamoto S. Sippel K.C. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and the retinal arrestin (20Fuchs S. Nakazawa M. Maw M. Tamai M. Oguchi Y. Gal A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) gene lead to Oguchi disease, a form of stationary night blindness caused by the prolonged activity of photoactivated rhodopsin. In the Drosophila system, inactivation of arrestin leads to the degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in a light-dependent manner (21Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socoloch M. Zuker C.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and in the well studied β-adrenergic system, overexpression of an inhibitor of GRKs 2 and 3 (β-adrenergic receptor kinases 1 and 2) in a heart-specific manner, leads to an increased contractile response to β-agonist stimulation in transgenic mice (22Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition, gene inactivation of GRK2 causes embryonic lethality in mice via severe cardiac malformation and heart failure (2Jaber M. Koch W.J. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the up-regulation of GRK2 seen in patients with heart failure might contribute to the etiology of this condition (23Ungerer M. Böhm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 24Ungerer M. Parruti G. Böhm M. Puzicha M. DeBlasi A. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In light of these findings it is somewhat surprising that gene inactivation of GRK3 has no immediately obvious phenotype. GRK3 (−/−) mice develop and breed normally. This may be due to the compensation of GRK3 activity by the highly homologous GRK2. In most tissues GRKs 2 and 3 are co-localized, with GRK2 usually being the predominant isoform. We have previously shown the involvement of GRK3 in the desensitization of olfactory signal transduction (5Schleicher S. Boekhoff I. Arriza J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In olfactory epithelium GRK2 is virtually absent and GRK3 is highly expressed. Consistent with this finding we show here that GRK3 gene ablated mice completely lack the fast odorant-induced desensitization of second messenger generation (Fig. 3 A). However, a previously unappreciated counterregulatory feature of this system was also seen. Total cAMP generation in isolated cilia preparations past 500 ms, i.e. following desensitization in wild-type mice, is almost indistinguishable between GRK3 (−/−) and GRK3 (+/+) mice. This dampened response is likely due to a compensatory down-regulation of G protein or adenylyl cyclase (or both) because direct stimulation of the signal transduction pathway, via GTPγS or forskolin, leads to the same reduced second messenger generation in olfactory epithelium. In conclusion, gene deletion in vivo can serve as a valuable tool to differentiate the physiological functions of highly homologous members of the GRK family that cannot be immediately appreciated through in vitro assays. In addition, adaptive mechanisms can compensate somewhat for the loss of GRK3, but not GRK2, activity. We thank Dr. B. H. Koller for the generation of homologous recombinant murine stem cells and chimeric mice, Dr. Richard Premont for critical reading of the manuscript, and Mary Holben and Donna Addison for expert secretarial assistance."

Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar) that are formed by the recruitment and assembly of cytosolic coat components upon the ER membrane (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 3Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three cytoplasmic factors, collectively termed COPII, have been shown to be required for vesicle formation: the Sec31p-Sec13p protein complex, the Sec23p-Sec24p protein complex, and the small GTP-binding protein Sar1p (4Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 5Salama N. Yeung R. Schekman R.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The addition of these three factors to urea-washed ER membranes stimulates the formation of coated, fusion-competent vesicles (4Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Although in vitro analysis has defined soluble components required for vesicle assembly, membrane-associated factors have remained less accessible to biochemical study. Thus, the mechanism of COPII recruitment and assembly onto the membrane is still unknown. However, converging evidence suggests that Sec16p, an essential 240-kDa multidomain protein, may be involved intimately in this process.SEC16 is required for transport vesicle formation (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Kaiser C. Schekman R.

Chuang J.S. Schekman R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sec16p is tightly associated with the periphery of the ER and is also found on ER-derived transport vesicles (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); Sec16p cannot be extracted from membranes by urea (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Membranes prepared from sec16 mutant strains exhibit a marked deficit in the release of vesicle cargo molecules (11Campbell J.L. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, Sec16p directly binds the COPII subunits Sec23p and Sec24p (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We now report that Sec16p also binds the COPII subunit Sec31p; we show this interaction is required for ER to Golgi transport. Yeast manipulations were performed by standard methods (13Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using the following antibodies: anti-HA (12CA5; 1/1000; BAbCO); anti-Sec23 (1/250) (14Hicke L. Yoshihisa T. Schekman R. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The antibodies against Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec31p were generously provided by R. Schekman. A two-hybrid screen was performed in the strain CKY554, which is the indicator strain L40 (16Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) with the plasmid pDS99, carrying amino acids 447–1235 of Sec16p fused to LexA in the pBTM116 vector (19Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). CKY554 was transformed with an activation domain fusion library (generously provided by M. White) in the pGADGH vector (20Hannon G.J. Demetrik D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Interactions were tested as described (18Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 21Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Sec31p truncation constructs in pGADGH were subsequently constructed using the cloned SEC31 locus (10Salama N.R. Chuang J.S. Schekman R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), generously provided by R. Schekman. LexA fusion constructs were made in pBTM116 and represent the entire coding sequence of yeast Sec13p (pDS138) (15Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 867-875Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and human Sec13Rp (pDS168) (22Swaroop A. Yang-Feng T.L. Liu W. Gieser L. Barrow L. Chen K.-C. Agarwal N. Meisler M.H. Smith D.I.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 679-777Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and amino acids 666–926 of Sec24p (pDS272) (8Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and amino acids 447–1043 of Sec16p (pDS116) (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of yeast Sec23p (14Hicke L. Yoshihisa T. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was inserted into pGilda to generate pDS72. pGilda represents a derivative of the pEG202 lexA fusion vector (18Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) that retains the multiple cloning sites of pEG202 but that utilizes the GAL1 promoter instead of the ADH1 promoter; the vector backbone of pGilda is from pRS313 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain CKY556, which is EGY40 (17Golemis E.A. Brent R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) transformed with the indicator plasmid pSH18-24 (18Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), was co-transformed with LexA and activation domain fusion plasmids. Transformants containing a pBTM116-derived LexA fusion plasmid were grown to exponential phase in selective medium containing glucose. Transformants containing a pGilda-derived LexA fusion plasmid were grown to exponential phase in selective medium containing 2% raffinose and then galactose was added to 2%, and growth continued for another 4 h. At least three independent transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (13Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The mean activity of the transformants is given and expressed in Miller units (1000 × A 420/(reaction time × A 600 units assayed)) (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). All values above background were within 35% of the mean value. Recombinant Sec23p and Sec24p were were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromotography, and then released by thrombin cleavage of the GST moiety (12Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sec13p (kindly provided by K. Saxena and E. Neer) was purified as a His6 fusion protein from E. coli (26Saxena K. Gaitatzes C. Walsh M.T. Eck M. Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15215-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The HA epitope-tagged Sec16 protein was prepared by insertion of a fragment encoding amino acids 447–1043 of SEC16 into the pGAL10-HA expression vector pRH165 2R. Gimeno, unpublished observations. to generate pDS216. This plasmid was transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain CKY557 (MATα ura3-52 trp1::hisG GAL +). Cells were grown to exponential phase in selective medium containing 2% raffinose and then supplemented with 2% galactose for 4–6 h to induce expression of the epitope-tagged protein. These cells were then washed in LBB-100 (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 6.8, 80 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml) as well as EDTA (0.5 mm) and then frozen by drops in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell pellets were lysed using a mortar and pestle and resuspended in LBB-100. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 40 min. DNA regions encoding the entire Sec31p protein, a fragment of Sec31p lacking the initial 490 amino acids, or a fragment of Sec31p lacking the final 98 amino acids were fused to the 3′ end of the GST coding sequence expressed from pGAL1 promoter in pPE127, a vector identical to pRD56 but in a different reading frame (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Clarified cytosolic extracts were prepared as described above, except that the concentration of NaCl used was 0.6 m; this buffer is referred to as LBB-600. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were incubated with the extracts for 30 min at 25 °C and then washed three times with LBB-600. Beads prepared in this fashion were decorated with 2–5 pmol of the fusion protein. For the binding reactions involving Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec13p, the decorated beads were washed twice with binding buffer (25 mm K-Hepes, pH 6.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The beads were then resuspended in 45 μl of salt-supplemented binding buffer, and 5 μl of the relevant recombinant protein was then added. Binding of Sec23p (2 pmol) and Sec24p (1 pmol) was carried out in 50 mm NaCl, whereas binding of Sec13p (3 pmol) was carried out in 150 mm NaCl. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the beads were washed two or three times with binding buffer (no additional salt) and then resuspended in extract sample buffer (12Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the reactions involving Sec16p, the beads were washed twice with LBB-100 and then incubated with a yeast cytosolic extract prepared as described. These binding reactions were carried out in a volume of 100 μl and utilized extract containing 126 μg of total protein; NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m. Following a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the beads were washed twice with LBB-100 and then resuspended in extract sample buffer. All proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Both the SEC31 deletion strain RSY1109 (MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 trp1-Δ1 s31::TRP1[pNS3111-SEC31-URA3-CEN]), kindly provided by R. Schekman, and the temperature-sensitive sec31-2 strain CKY555 (MATa sec31-2 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112), kindly provided by A. Frand, were transformed with pDS321, pDS327, pDS328, or pRS415 (Stratagene). sec31-2 was identified by A. Frand in a screen for new mutants temperature-sensitive for ER to Golgi transport; the mutation in sec31-2 was mapped by marker rescue of gapped plasmids to a region corresponding to amino acids 850–1175 (data not shown). pDS321 contains the full SEC31 genomic locus (6.2-kilobase BamHI-PstI fragment) inserted into the CEN, LEU2-marked pRS415 vector. pDS327 and pDS328 both contain a 5.0-kilobase SalI-SalI genomic SEC31 fragment, which represents a truncation that removes the coding sequence for the C-terminal 98 amino acids of the protein. pDS327 is a CEN-based plasmid derived from pRS415, and pDS328 is a 2μ-based plasmid derived from pRS425 (27Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Heiter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). For the pulse-chase analysis, strains were grown to exponential phase at permissive temperature (24 °C) and then shifted to nonpermissive temperature (36 °C) for 20 min. Pulse labeling of cells and immunoprecipitation of CPY were performed as described previously (23Shaywitz D.A. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Swaroop A. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 679-777Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Portions of the SEC16 coding sequence were surveyed for regions that would not by themselves act as transciptional activators when fused to a DNA-binding domain and would therefore be suitable for two-hybrid analysis. pDS99, representing the coding sequence for amino acids 447–1235 of SEC16 inserted into the pBTM116 LexA fusion vector (19Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), was one of the constructs that fulfilled this criterion. This fragment of Sec16p included the region known to bind Sec24p (Sec16p amino acids 565–1235) and was different from the region known to bind Sec23p (Sec16p amino acids 1638–2194) (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The L40 reporter strain (16Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) was transformed with both pDS99 and a S. cerevisiae cDNA library constructed in the activation domain fusion vector pGADGH (20Hannon G.J. Demetrik D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Library plasmids were recovered from strains positive for expression of both the HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. A screen of 8 × 105 S. cerevisiae cDNA clones yielded seven positives whose activation of lacZ reporter expression depended upon the presence of the LexA-Sec16p fusion protein. Six of the positive clones contained overlapping cDNA segments derived from the 3′ region of the SEC31 gene (10Salama N.R. Chuang J.S. Schekman R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The smallest of these clones, 2a8, encodes a peptide of 127 amino acids, representing the extreme C terminus of the 1273-amino acid Sec31p molecule. In an effort to define the functional domains of SEC31, a series of SEC31 deletions were constructed in pGADGH and evaluated by two-hybrid analysis against a series of potential interactors constitutively expressed as LexA fusion proteins in the pBTM116 vector (Fig. 1). From this study, the Sec13p-binding region mapped to the N-terminal third of the Sec31p protein, a region that contains six WD-40 repeats (28Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing at least the first 490 amino acids of Sec31p, such as pDS131 (Fig. 1), interacted strongly with Sec13p, whereas constructs lacking this region failed to interact. Because Sec13p itself consists almost entirely of WD-40 repeats (26Saxena K. Gaitatzes C. Walsh M.T. Eck M. Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15215-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the interaction of Sec13p with the N-terminal region of Sec31p indicates that these regions of WD-40 repeats associate in a homotypic fashion. We also examined the interactions of the human Sec13p homolog, Sec13Rp (22Swaroop A. Yang-Feng T.L. Liu W. Gieser L. Barrow L. Chen K.-C. Agarwal N. Meisler M.H. Smith D.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Shaywitz D.A. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Swaroop A. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 679-777Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human Sec13Rp exhibited a two-hybrid interaction profile identical to that of yeast Sec13p, interacting specifically with pDS131. These results emphasize the degree of conservation between yeast and mammalian COPII structures (23Shaywitz D.A. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Swaroop A. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 679-777Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.-H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Kuge O. Dascher C. Orci L. Rowe T. Amherdt M. Plutner H. Ravazzola M. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Paccaud J.-P. Reith W. Carpentier J.-L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Orci L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and strongly imply the existence of a mammalian Sec31 protein. We next asked whether Sec31p could interact with either Sec23p or Sec24p. Utilizing a domain of Sec24p that does not interact with Sec23p (12Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we determined that Sec24p interacts with the central region of Sec31p (pDS134), a region that does not interact with either Sec13p or Sec16p. The evaluation of Sec23p binding to Sec31p required the use of an inducible LexA-Sec23p fusion protein, because the constitutive overexpression of fusions to SEC23 fusion was lethal (data not shown). We constructed the vector pGilda, which allowed for the galactose-inducible expression of toxic LexA-Sec23p fusion proteins. Fusion proteins expressed from pGilda required different growth conditions and were present at higher levels than those expressed from pBTM116 but gave the internally consistent result that Sec23p interacted specifically with a central, 325-amino acid region of Sec31p (pDS135). To confirm the interactions detected by two-hybrid analysis, we asked whether Sec16p, Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec13p could bind to different GST-Sec31p fusion proteins isolated from yeast. This approach has been used previously to demonstrate the direct binding of Sec23 and Sec24p to different regions of Sec16p (12Gimeno R.E. Espenshade P. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We evaluated three different GST fusion proteins: full-length Sec31p, Sec31p lacking the N-terminal 490 amino acids (Sec31ΔNp), and Sec31p lacking the C-terminal 98 amino acids (Sec31ΔCp). For the binding experiments, purified recombinant Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec13p were used. The source of Sec16p for this experiment was clarified extracts of yeast overexpressing the putative Sec31p-interacting region of Sec16p (amino acids 447–1043) tagged with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. The results from these binding experiments were in complete agreement with the two-hybrid data (Fig.2). Full-length Sec31p was able to bind Sec13p, Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec16p. However, Sec31ΔNp was specifically defective for Sec13p binding, whereas Sec31ΔCp was specifically defective for Sec16p binding. Sec23p and Sec24p bound to both of the truncated proteins, but not to GST alone; these binding reactions were performed in buffer containing 50 mm NaCl because very little binding of Sec24p and only about half-maximal binding of Sec23p were observed under the higher salt concentrations (150–200 mm NaCl) used for the Sec16p and Sec13p binding experiments (data not shown). The identification of Sec31ΔCp, which is specifically defective for Sec16p binding, allowed us to investigate the in vivo significance of this interaction (Fig.3). First, we asked whether sec31-ΔC could functionally substitute for wild-type SEC31. A sec31-null strain bearing wild-type SEC31 on a URA3-marked plasmid was transformed with LEU2-marked plasmids carrying either SEC31 or sec31-ΔC. Transformants were grown with selection for the LEU2-marked plasmid and then plated on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Only yeast capable of growing in the absence of the URA3-marked plasmid would be expected to grow under these conditions. The strains carrying the plasmid with sec31-ΔC did not produce segregants that could grow on 5-FOA (Fig. 3 A), showing that the truncated protein lacks an essential function of Sec31p. As a control for protein expression levels, the wild-type yeast strain CKY8 (6Espenshade P. Gimeno R.E. Holzmacher E. Teung P. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was transformed with either a CEN plasmid carrying sec31-ΔC or with vector alone. Extracts from both strains were examined by immunoblotting using anti-Sec31p antibody (Fig.3 D) (5Salama N. Yeung R. Schekman R.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Sec31ΔCp was present in equivalent amounts to the endogenous Sec31p, indicating significant production of the truncated protein. To address more directly the role of the C-terminal region of Sec31p in secretion, we utilized a temperature-sensitive allele of SEC31, designated sec31-2, which was isolated in a screen for new mutants defective for ER to Golgi transport. By testing whether Sec31ΔCp could rescue the secretion defect of sec31-2 observed at nonpermissive temperatures, the ability of Sec31ΔCp to fulfill the function of Sec31p in ER to Golgi transport could be assessed. The sec31-2 mutant was transformed with plasmids encoding either Sec31p or Sec31ΔCp; growth of the transformants at the nonpermissive temperature of 36 °C was then evaluated. Although mutants transformed with the SEC31 plasmid grew at 36 °C, mutants transformed with the sec31-ΔC plasmid remained temperature-sensitive for growth (Fig. 3 B); these results were observed in mutants transformed with either a CEN-based or a 2μ-based sec31-ΔC plasmid. The kinetics of ER to Golgi transport of the marker cargo protein CPY was followed by pulse-chase analysis of the transformants at 36 °C. The sec31-ΔC plasmid did not rescue the CPY transport defect (Fig. 3 D). Because the binding studies showed that the only apparent defect of Sec31ΔCp is in binding to Sec16p, the transport defect exhibited by the truncated allele of SEC31 argues that the binding of Sec31p to Sec16p is required for ER to Golgi transport. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the C-terminal region of Sec31p performs an additional function that has not yet been defined that is necessary for secretion. Reconstitution studies in both yeast and mammalian cells demonstrate that vesicle coat formation can be stimulated by the addition of a defined set of cytosolic factors to washed donor membranes (4Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 5Salama N.

For transport between Golgi cisternae in mammalian cells, these factors are the small GTP-binding protein ARF and the coatomer complex, consisting of seven subunits that coassemble in the cytosol and bind en bloc to the donor membrane (34Hara-Kuge S. Kuge O. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Wieland R.T. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For transport between yeast ER and Golgi, two different cytosolic protein complexes in addition to the small GTP-binding protein Sar1p are needed to form the COPII vesicle coat (3Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 14Hicke L. Yoshihisa T. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 867-875Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The interaction that we detected between purified components of the Sec31p-Sec13p complex and the Sec23p-Sec24p complex suggested that these two complexes might preassemble in the cytosol. To examine this possibility, we expressed a GST-Sec31p fusion protein in yeast and asked whether Sec23p or Sec24p could be found associated with this fusion protein in a cytosolic extract prepared under conditions of the in vitro transport assay (4Barlowe C. Orci L. Yeung T. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Salama N. Rexach M.F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Schekman R. Cell. 1994; 77: 895-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 15Pryer N.K. Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 867-875Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect either of these proteins in the bound fraction. This observation was consistent with our measurements of the stability of the interactions between isolated proteins: binding of GST-Sec31p to recombinant Sec23p and Sec24p was demonstrated at 50 mm NaCl but (as noted above) was significantly weaker at 150 mm NaCl, a salt concentration equivalent to that used for the in vitro assay (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the physiological association between the two COPII complexes requires the context of the ER membrane. Given that SEC16 interacts genetically with all five COPII genes and encodes a peripheral ER membrane protein that is present on ER-derived transport vesicles, required for vesicle formation, and binds directly to Sec23p, Sec24p, and Sec31p, we propose that Sec16p functions as a foundation for the construction of the COPII coat from soluble protein complexes (Fig. 4). Moreover, the demonstration that Sec31p binds directly to both Sec23p and Sec24p suggests that the assembling COPII subunits are stabilized not only by interactions with Sec16p but also by interactions with each other.

A number of enzyme groups with a variety of substrates, biochemical optima, and mechanisms of action participate in matrix degradation. One group, the matrix metalloproteinases, consists of a group of structurally related zinc endopeptidases with a neutral pH optimum and the cumulative ability to digest most components of ECM (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), MMPs are secreted in zymogen form requiring proteolytic processing at the N terminus before they become catalytically active (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 2Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 3Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

In contrast to most secreted pro-MMPs, which are efficiently activated in the ECM, the activation of pro-MMP-2 is known to occur most efficiently at the cell surface (5Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent work from a number of laboratories has identified a subfamily of MMPs (the membrane-type or MT-MMPs, comprising MMP-14, MMP-15, MMP-16, and MMP-17) that are distinct from the secreted enzymes in being type I membrane proteins (the N terminus containing the catalytic domain is extracellular) with a single membrane-spanning region (6Sato H.

In addition, and in common with stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), the MT-MMPs have the potential to be activated intracellularly by furin or furin-like enzymes (6Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A.

The activation complex is trimolecular and in addition to MMP-14 and pro MMP-2, it contains tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) (12Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L.

Our understanding of the biochemistry and biological function of the MT-MMPs and of the genes encoding them is incomplete. The gene structure of an MT-MMP has not been previously described although the structures of the genes encoding a number of “secreted” MMPs is known (14Collier I.E. Smith J. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A.

Given the unique structural characteristics of the MMP-14 protein, we sought to examine how its gene structure may have evolved to include new structural features and to evaluate its relationship with the known MMP genes. We show here that the structure of Mmp14represents a significant departure from the structure of the previously described MMP genes and may be representative of a genetically distinct subfamily. Based on these observations and the previous descriptions of a number of MMP gene structures, we have proposed here a genetic classification of MMPs based on structural and evolutionary relationships that is independent of substrate preferences. The human MT-MMP genes are located on separate chromosomes (23Mattei M.G. Roeckel N. Olsen B.R. Apte S.S. Genomics. 1997; 40: 168-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Sato H. Tanaka M. Takino T. Inoue M. Seiki M. Genomics. 1997; 39: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and are not part of the MMP gene cluster on chromosome 11q22.3 (25Pendas A.M. Matilla T. Estivill X. Lopez-Otin C. Genomics. 1995; 26: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting an evolution distinct from this cluster of genes. In this paper we describe the mapping of the mouse MMP-14 gene (Mmp14) to mouse chromosome 14. We reasoned that the proposed molecular model for activation of pro-gelatinase A was likely to be most relevant in situ at locations where MMP-14 and TIMP-2 are produced by the same or adjacent cell populations. We demonstrate here that Mmp14 and Timp2 appear to be exquisitely co-regulated during development, suggesting a possible role in the activation of pro MMP-2 at the sites of expression. Like the recent results of Kinoh et al. (26Kinoh H. Sato H. Tsunezaka T.T. Kawashima A. Okada Y. Seiki M J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar) our data suggest an important role in musculoskeletal development. We find, however, that there are differences between the expression of these two genes in bone depending on the mechanism of ossification. We have also discovered a consistent relationship between perichondrial expression of these genes and chondrocyte differentiation, which may have implications for skeletal development. We present novel observations of significant co-expression of Mmp14 and Timp2 in other organ systems. We find coordinate expression in the media of large arteries and in specific regions of the urogenital tract. Finally, we have found very prominent expression in a number of dense connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments, fascial sheaths, and joint capsules. The MMP-14 gene is, therefore, not just distinct in its gene structure but appears to be the only MMP thus far that is stringently co-expressed with a TIMP. From our developmental studies we infer that a shared mechanism of regulation exists for Mmp14 and Timp2. MMP14 probes were amplified by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) using primers based on the published sequence of Sato et al. (6Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). A 420-base pair cDNA from the 5′-half of the cDNA (including the pro-domain encoding region, clone phMTM420) and a 450-base pair cDNA from the 3′-half (including the putative transmembrane domain encoding region, clone phMTM450) were amplified using primer pairs (forward primer 5′-AAGCCTGGCTACAGCAAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGCCTGCTTCTCATGG-3′ and forward primer 5′-CCGTTTCAACGAAGAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCAGACCTTGTCCAGCAG-3′, respectively). An Mmp14 cDNA was amplified with the sense primer 5′-AGGGTTCCTGGCTCATGC and antisense primer 5′-ACAGCGGCCGCACTCACA-3′ based on published sequences (27Okada A. Bellocq J.-P. Rouyer N. Chenard M.-P. Rio M.-C. Chambon P. Basset P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and cloned in both sense (clone p1011S) and antisense (clone p1011AS) orientations into pT7Blue (Invitrogen Corp.). The MMP14 clones were random primer labeled with [32P]dCTP and used to screen a mouse genomic library from the 129Sv strain in the λFIXII vector (Stratagene). 3 × 106 plaques were screened. Phage DNA was isolated for further analysis from two positive clones λTM6a and λTM6b. Restriction mapping and Southern analysis with the above probes was used to identify putative exon-containing fragments. Suitable fragments were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) for further characterization, including partial sequence analysis. Sequencing of both strands in selected regions was carried out using the chain termination method with internal or flanking primers. Sequence data were analyzed using the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Inc.). Exon-intron boundaries were assigned based on a comparison of the sequences of the Mmp14 cDNA and genomic sequences. While exon sizes were obtained directly from nucleotide sequences, introns were only partially sequenced, and in most cases intron size was determined by a combination of restriction mapping and PCR. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTCGGTCCTCAGCTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGACATTACAAGTGTGTC-3′ (reverse) were designed to amplify a dinucleotide microsatellite repeat sequence in Mmp14 to test for SSLPs between mouse strains. Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase and genomic DNAs from a series of mouse strains and were amplified using standard protocols (anneal at 55 °C for 1 min, extend at 72 °C for 2 min, and denature at 94 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles, with a final extension at 72 °C). 2 μl of the amplified reaction was added to 8.5 μl U. S. Biochemical Corp. stop solution, denatured at 94 °C for 5 min, and immediately placed on ice. Two μl of this mixture was loaded on a 6% denaturing acrylamide sequencing gel and electrophoresed. We identified a polymorphism between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mouse strains; DNA from the BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains was obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and genotyped. The strain distribution pattern was analyzed using the Map Manager program (28Manley K.F. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Google Scholar), and a map position was determined. Strain distribution data and human homologies were determined using the Mouse Genome Data base. 3The internet site ishttp://www.informatics.jax.org/mgd.html. Northern blots containing mRNA from embryos and a variety of adult mouse tissues (CLONTECH Inc.) were hybridized to the [32P]dCTP-labeled probes for Mmp14 (p1011AS),Timp2 (pmouseTIMP-2PCR, provided by Drs. Kevin Leco and Dylan Edwards, University of Calgary; Ref. 29Leco K.J. Hayden L.J. Sharma R.R. Rocheleau H. Greenberg A.H. Edwards D.R. Gene. 1992; 117: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and β-actin (CLONTECH). Riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP were generated with T7, T3, or SP6 RNA polymerases using reagents from Boehringer Mannheim. Templates used for transcription were p1011AS and p1011S (for Mmp14), pmouseTIMP-2PCR (for Timp2), and pNFcol2 (for col2a1, the mouse α1(II) collagen cDNA; this probe was used for quality control of tissue sections and to identify sites of cartilage formation). Cryostat sections of mouse embryos obtained by timed pregnancies were used for expression studies. The morning of observation of the vaginal plug was taken to be day 0.5 post-coitum (p.c.), and embryos were obtained at days 7.5, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 14.5, and 17.5 days p.c. Briefly, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight, then immersed in 20% sucrose overnight, and embedded in OCT compound. 8 μm thick sections (cut in the sagittal plane at all stages but also in the horizontal plane in 14.5 and 17.5 days p.c. embryos) were hydrolyzed with 0.2 nHCl, digested briefly with proteinase K (10 μg/ml), acetylated, and hybridized to riboprobes at 53 °C for 16 h. Stringency washes were carried out as follows at 56 °C. Sections were rinsed briefly in 5 × SSC, then in 2 × SSC + 50% formamide, followed by 2 × SSC and 0.2 × SSC. Unbound riboprobe was destroyed by treatment with RNase A (10 μg/ml). Hybridized probe was detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) and NBT-BCIP color substrate mix (Boehringer-Mannheim). Endogenous alkaline phosphatase was inhibited by inclusion of levamisole (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 μm in the substrate mix. Sections were counter stained with 0.1% (w/v) methyl green (Sigma). The structure and degree of overlap of two independent clones containing Mmp14 is illustrated in Fig.1 a. A 7.5-kbBamHI-SalI fragment (the SalI site is in the λFIXII vector and flanks the cloning site) from λTM6a was selected for more detailed analysis, because it appeared to contain most of Mmp14, as well as a 4.5-kb BamHI fragment that was found to contain the 5′-end of the gene (Fig. 1 a). The MMP-14 polypeptide was found to be encoded within 10 exons extending over 10 kb of DNA, the 7.5-kbBamHI-SalI fragment containing 9 of these (Fig.1, a and b). We determined the sequences of these exons and their boundaries with the flanking introns (TableI). We have tentatively numbered the first protein coding exon as exon 1 because the 5′-end of the Mmp14 transcript has not been identified. The derivation of peptide domains from each exon is shown in Fig. 1 c. On comparison with other MMP genes, Mmp14 was found to have a distinct structure (Fig. 1 d). The novel C-terminal peptide domains of MMP-14 are encoded by a single large exon that also encodes the 3′-untranslated region. The structure of the exons encoding the catalytic domain and pro-domain of MMP-14 is distinct from all previously described MMP genes. In particular, exon 4 is larger than the corresponding exon of other MMP genes and encodes most of the catalytic domain. The exons encoding the hemopexin-like domains comprise the most conserved part of this gene.Table IThe junctions of the Mmp14 exons and intronsEXONIntron-EXON-intron junctionsExon sizeIntron size1-aExcept for intron 9, the introns have not been completely sequenced.

Open table in a new tab Two simple sequence repeats were identified in Mmp14(Fig. 1 a). A (GAAA)24 repeat was identified within λTM6a in a region corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the Mmp14 mRNA (27Okada A. Bellocq J.-P. Rouyer N. Chenard M.-P. Rio M.-C. Chambon P. Basset P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). A (CA)24 repeat was found in intron 5. Primers corresponding to the latter microsatellite sequence identified an SSLP between inbred mouse strains. The BXD recombinant inbred series (30Taylor B.A. Origins of Inbred Mice. Academic Press, New York1978Google Scholar) was genotyped, and the strain distribution pattern was analyzed using the Map Manager program.Mmp14 mapped to chromosome 14 with a logarithm10of odds score of 7.8. No recombinants were found between Mmp14 and Nr1 (neural retina leucine zipper gene), Np (nucleoside phosphorylase), Tcra(T-cell receptor alpha chain), Ang (angiogenin), and Myhca (myosin heavy chain, cardiac muscle, adult) in the 25 BXD recombinant inbred strains. The position of Mmp14 with respect to flanking microsatellite markers in the BXD series is:D14Mit2—7.9 ± 4.9 cM—Mmp14—5.0 ± 3.7 cM—D14Mit5. The human homologs of these loci (D14S46E, NP, TCRA, and MYH6, respectively) all map within the interval 14q11.1–14q11.3. RNA from embryos showed Mmp14 and Timp2 transcripts at 7, 11, 15, and 17 days p.c. (Fig.2). While Mmp14 message increased over these time points, Timp2 transcript levels were constant except for a decrease at 11 days. The transcripts were also present in a variety of adult organs (not shown). Mmp14 and Timp2 generated transcripts of about 4.5 kb and 4.0 + 1.2 kb in size, respectively, both in adult and embryo tissues in agreement with previous reports (26Kinoh H. Sato H. Tsunezaka T.T. Kawashima A. Okada Y. Seiki M J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar, 29Leco K.J. Hayden L.J. Sharma R.R. Rocheleau H. Greenberg A.H. Edwards D.R.

Sections in which either probe was omitted did not show the presence of endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity.

However, there was distinct expression of both of these genes in the uterus, particularly in the endometrial glands and in myometrium at the periphery of the uterus (not shown). At 12.5 days p.c., Mmp14 and Timp2 were prominently expressed in large arteries, e.g.. the aorta, its branches, and the umbilical arteries (Figs. 3 and 7 A). Low level labeling was visible in the myocardium, but the cardiac outflow tract, particularly the root of the aorta (including the prospective semilunar valves), was prominently labeled (Fig. 3,A and B). The expression appeared in the smooth muscle cells of the prospective arterial tunica media. The vascular endothelium was negative for expression of both genes (Figs. 3,D and E, and 7A). At this age, diffuse expression of Mmp14 and Timp2 was visible throughout the craniofacial mesenchyme and was higher in mesenchymal cells surrounding the cartilage condensations for Meckel's cartilage and the clavicle. Expression of Mmp14 and Timp2 was seen in the nasal epithelium and the liver capsule (not shown) and in differentiating mesenchyme in the vicinity of the prospective kidneys (Fig. 3 D). At 14.5 and 17.5 days p.c., endochondral ossification is established so that chondrocyte hypertrophy as well as the formation of primary centers of ossification is apparent. At these developmental stages,Mmp14 and Timp2 were expressed strongly in the musculoskeletal system (Figs. 4, 5, 6), with continued expression in the arterial tunica media (Fig. 7 A) and additional expression in the urogenital tract (Fig. 7, A and B). There was prominent expression in the perichondrium-investing hypertrophic chondrocytes but lower levels in perichondrium around immature (small) chondrocytes. Bones that were sectioned longitudinally showed that perichondrial labeling achieved a peak at the point of transition of chondrocytes from small to hypertrophic cells. (Figs. 4 A and 5 A). We found negligible labeling in chondrocytes at these developmental stages. In contrast, col2a1 expression was seen in cartilage alone at 12.5, 14.5, and 17.5 days of gestation (not shown). In the ossifying craniofacial skeleton, much of which develops in membrane, expression of both Mmp14 and Timp2 was widespread throughout the ossification areas. In long bones such as the humerus, femur, tibia, and clavicle, expression of Mmp14 was prominent in the metaphyseal region immediately adjacent to hypertrophic cartilage (Fig. 4 A). The location and larger size of the Mmp14 expressing cells as well as staining of cells in this area for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (not shown) suggested that the gene may be expressed by chondroclasts or osteoclasts. In contrast, Timp2 expression was not seen at this metaphyseal location in long bones (Fig.5 A). Timp2, but not Mmp14, was highly expressed in the trigeminal (Fig.7 D), vestibulocochlear, and dorsal root ganglia (Fig.7 C). Both Mmp14 and Timp2 were expressed in developing muscle but in very discrete regions of a given muscle that did not correlate with definite anatomical features. Strong expression, approximating that seen in the perichondrium was found in developing tendons, ligaments, fascial sheaths between muscle compartments, and joint capsules throughout the 14.5 and 17.5 days p.c. embryo (Figs.4, 5, 6). Very prominent labeling was found in the cruciate ligaments of the knee (Fig. 6, A and B) and tendons around the shoulder joint. (Fig.4 A). Strong labeling was noted in joint capsule of the hip (not shown) and in the superficial zone of articular cartilage in the knee, shoulder, and hip joints (Figs. 4 and 6). At 14.5 and 17.5 days p.c., Mmp14 and Timp2 expression was noted in the wall of the developing urinary bladder, particularly in the mesenchyme (developing musculature) of its outer half. Mesenchymal cells around the bulbourethral gland and the urethra (Fig. 7 B) and cells in the bulbospongiosus and corpora cavernosa of the developing penis (not shown) also showed prominent expression of both genes in similar locations. In placenta, at 12.5 and 14.5 days, the Timp2 and Mmp14 transcripts co-localized to the junctional region between uterine deciduum and placental spongiotrophoblast with minimal labeling in the labyrinth (vascular) zone of the placenta (Fig.8). The discovery of the MT-MMPs revealed the existence of a distinct subfamily of proteins within the MMP family. These proteins have some distinct and novel features. First, like stromelysin-3, but unlike other MMPs, they have a sequence insertion between the pro and catalytic domains that may be cleaved by furin or furin-like enzymes and may lead to intracellular activation. Second, unlike any other MMPs previously described, they have a membrane-spanning domain near their C terminus followed by a short cytosolic domain. These novel domains are connected to the hemopexin domains by a linker region of variable length and sequence in each MT-MMP. The linker region of MT1-MMP is homologous to the calcium-binding region of troponin C. In view of"

Oxidants produce disulfide bonds between subunits of the Ca2+ release channel tetramer, and this is accompanied by an increase in channel activity. The sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide has three distinct effects on Ca2+ release channel activity: first, channel activity is decreased (phase 1); then with continued exposure the activity is dramatically increased (phase 2); and finally, the channel is again inhibited (phase 3) (Aghdasi, B., Zhang, J. Z., Wu, Y., Reid, M. B., and Hamilton, S. L., (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3739–3749). Both H2O2 and nitric oxide (NO) block the phase 1 inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide. NO donors, at concentrations that have no detectable effect on channel activity, block intersubunit cross-linking and prevent activation of the channel by the disulfide inducing agent, diamide. These findings support a model in which NO modulates the activity of the Ca2+ release channel by preventing oxidation of regulatory sulfhydryls. However, higher concentrations of NO donors activate the channel and produce intersubunit cross-links, supporting a bifunctional effect of NO on channel activity. Low NO concentrations prevent oxidation of the Ca2+ release channel whereas higher concentrations oxidize it.

Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). One model to explain these effects is that endogenous NO and ROI influence calcium homeostasis (5Reid M.B. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 114-119Google Scholar) by directly altering the activity of the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (RYR1). Favero et al. (6Favero T.G. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. J. Biol.

Activation of the channel with H2O2was reversible with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT). These workers proposed that the increase in channel activity is due to the formation of cross-links between the RYR1 and triadin (6Favero T.G. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) demonstrated that diamide produces disulfide bonds between subunits of the RYR1 tetramer and proposed that this cross-linking activates the channel. In these studies we also demonstrated that alkylation of RYR1 by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has triphasic effects on single channel activity and on [3H]ryanodine binding. Alkylation of hyperactive (phase 1) sulfhydryls and oxidative cross-linking of sulfhydryls are mutually exclusive processes; either can occur but not both. NO generating compounds have also been shown to alter the activity of RYR1. The exact nature of the effects of NO compounds on RYR1 is, however, controversial. Mèszáros et al. (8Mèszáros L.G. Minarovic I. Zahradnı́ková A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Mèszáros L.G. Minarovic I. Zahradnı́ková A. Biophys.

Both groups postulated that these effects are mediated by the reaction of NO with sulfhydryls on the Ca2+ release channel. The divergent effects of NO on Ca2+ release channel could arise from differences in 1) the reaction conditions, 2) the amount of NO generated, or 3) the reaction by-products. ROI enhance contractile function, whereas NO opposes this effect (3Reid M.B Khawli F.A. Moody M.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Kobzik L.

In this study we test the hypothesis that oxidants and NO interact directly with RYR1; oxidants activate the channel, and NO blocks the oxidative activation. Diamide cross-linking and NEM alkylation are used as tools to elucidate the mechanism of interaction of oxidants and NO with the functional sulfhydryls of RYR1. [3H]Ryanodine (68.30 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. Diamide, NEM, and DTT were obtained from Sigma.S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP), PAPA NONOate (NOC-15) and MAMA NONOate (NOC-9) were purchased from Alexis Corporation (San Diego, CA). Phosphatidylethanolamine (bovine heart) and phosphatidylcholine (bovine brain) were obtained from Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Ultima Gold scintillation was purchased from Packard (Meriden, CT). SR membranes were prepared from rabbit backstrap and hindleg skeletal muscle and purified by using sucrose gradient centrifugation as described elsewhere (12Hamilton S.L. Tate C.H. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 313-343Google Scholar, 13Rosenblatt M. Hidalgo C. Vergara C. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8140-8146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. [3H]Ryanodine was incubated overnight (15–17 h) at room temperature (23 °C) with 5–75 μg of SR membranes in 100–250 μl of buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 μm free CaCl2, 100 μm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmaminobenzamidine, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of either 10 or 100 μm ryanodine. Bound [3H]ryanodine was separated from free by rapid filtration of the sample through Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters followed by 5 × 3-ml washes with ice-cold wash buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl, 100 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4). The radioactivity bound to the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the filters in 5 ml of Ultima Gold scintillant. 0.5-mg SR membranes were treated with and without NO donors or H2O2at room temperature for 20 min. The membranes are then pelleted in a Beckman Airfuge and resuspended in binding buffer. After removing 20-μg samples for control measurements, 5 mm NEM was added to the remainder. Alkylation was stopped with 20 mmDTT at indicated time points as described previously (1Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). [3H]Ryanodine binding was performed on the samples as described in the previous section. Analysis of the activity of the Ca2+ release channel by reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers was performed as we have previously described (1Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L.

Biochem. 1989; 183: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Data were acquired using the FETCHEX program in pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). [3H]Ryanodine binding data were analyzed with nonlinear curve fitting using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). Nonspecific binding was subtracted prior to analysis. The paired student's t test and one-tailed t test were performed using Sigma-Stat (Jandel Scientific); for multiple groups, the Bonferroni correction was used. Single channel recordings were analyzed using FETCHAN and pSTAT software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Steady-state open probabilities (PO) were determined by measuring the amount of time that the channel remained open in at least 3 min of recording. Dwell-time histograms were fit with the following equation f(t)=a1(1/τ1)exp(−t/τ1)+a2(1/τ2)exp(−t/τ2)Equation 1 to determine open and closed time constants:a 1 = the relative area occupied by component 1;a 2 = the relative area occupied by component 2; τ1,2 = time constants at a given state (open or closed). We have previously demonstrated that diamide blocks phase 1 inhibition of the channel by NEM and produces disulfide bonds between neighboring subunits within the RYR1 tetramer. In the present study, we asked whether the physiological ROI, H2O2, could produce the same changes that were observed with diamide. SR membranes were treated with H2O2, washed, alkylated with NEM for different periods of time, reduced with DTT, and assayed for ability to bind [3H]ryanodine. Similar to diamide pretreatment, H2O2 pretreatment prevented NEM under phase 1 conditions from inhibiting [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 1 A). H2O2 had no significant effect on the phase 2 and 3 reactions. Again similar to diamide, H2O2produced intersubunit cross-links that are reversed with DTT (Fig.1 B). For comparison, this figure also shows the dimer formation by diamide. In the membranes used for these experiments, RYR1 (Fig. 1 B, band a) was partially proteolyzed by endogenous calpain to produce a 410-kDa fragment (band b), which is missing an N-terminal domain (16Rardon D.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimers of both the full-length RYR1 and the 410-kDa fragment are observed. As previously discussed (1Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we do not detect any cross-linking of the full-length 565-kDa band to the 410-kDa band, suggesting that when cleavage at the N-terminal site occurs, all subunits within a tetramer are cleaved. The dimers can be reduced to monomers by treatment with DTT. Diamide cross-linking of RYR1 is associated with an increase in the activity of the channel (1Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Slavik K.S. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A147Google Scholar). H2O2 also activates the channel reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer (Fig. 1 C). The steady-state open probability (P o) of the channel increased from 0.014 ± 0.003 to 0.312 ± 0.075 (p < 0.05) with the addition of 5 mmH2O2 (n = 3) and decreased to 0.077 ± 0.057 (p < 0.05) with the addition of 10 mm DTT (n = 3) after H2O2. To determine the time constants, the open- and closed-time histograms were fit with two exponential equation described under “Experimental Procedures.” The result of these fits are summarized in Table I. These findings are in agreement with those of Favero et al. (6Favero T.G. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab We next examined the effects of NO donors on the three phases of NEM reaction with RYR1. Figs. 2, A-C show the effects of SNAP, NOC-9, and NOC 15 on the three phases of alkylation. Membranes were preincubated with the NO donor, washed, and then reacted with NEM. Each NO donor blocked phase 1 inhibition by NEM and had little or no effect on phase 2 and 3. To demonstrate that the blockage of phase 1 alkylation was due to nitric oxide, each NO donor was incubated at room temperature for 50–500 times its half-life to deplete NO. The NO-depleted compounds were then added to SR membranes prior to alkylation with 5 mm NEM. As shown in Fig. 2 D the by-products of SNAP, NOC-15, and NOC-9 did not block phase 1 NEM inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding. To determine if NO donors produce intersubunit cross-links, we treated SR membranes with NOC-9, NOC-15, and SNAP. At concentrations that blocked the phase 1 alkylation, none of these reagents produced higher molecular weight complexes of RYR1. However, exposure of SR membranes to NO donors prevented cross-linking of the subunits during subsequent diamide treatment. Fig. 3 A shows that SNAP pretreatment greatly reduced the ability of diamide to produce intersubunit cross-links; NOC-9 and NOC-15 produced similar results (data not shown). Fig. 3 B summarizes the blockage of intersubunit cross-links induced by diamide when membranes were pretreated with SNAP, NOC-15, or NOC-9. SNAP has been reported to either activate (10Stoyanovsky T.D. Murphy P.A. Salama G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A257Google Scholar, 11Stoyanovsky D. Murphy T. Anno P.R. Kim Y.-M. Salama G.

To determine the effect of NO on single channel activity of RYR1, we tested the effect of 100 μm SNAP, a concentration which we have shown prevents dimer formation, on the activity of RYR1 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer (Fig.4). Under the conditions used in our experiments, SNAP had no significant effect on the activity of the channel over a 30-min incubation period. The P owas 0.012 ± 0.003 under control conditions, 0.013 ± 0.004 (n = 4) after 10 min, and 0.010 ± 0.005 (n = 3) after 30 min in the presence of SNAP. Subsequent diamide treatment did not activate the channel (P o = 0.011 ± 0.004, (n = 3)). Phase 2 NEM alkylation can, however, further activate diamide-treated channels (1Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After treatment with SNAP, NEM was still able to increase channel activity (P o = 0.1623 ± 0.0314 (n = 3, p < 0.05)), indicating that phase 2 sulfhydryls had not reacted with diamide or SNAP. Stoyanovsky et al. (10Stoyanovsky T.D. Murphy P.A. Salama G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A257Google Scholar, 11Stoyanovsky D. Murphy T. Anno P.R. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) reported an increase in single channel activity with 0.5–1 mm SNAP at pCa of 7. To determine if NO donors have a biphasic effect on RYR1 activity we used higher concentrations of NO donors on the reconstituted channel in planar lipid bilayer. Fig.5 A shows the effect of high and low concentrations of NOC-9 and NOC-15 on single channel activity. Low concentrations of NO donors, 500 μm NOC-15 and 5 μm NOC-9, had no effect on single channel activity whereas high concentrations, 5 mm NOC-15 and 0.5 mm NOC-9, increased activity. TableII summarizes the results obtained using NOC-9, NOC-15, and SNAP. We subsequently tested the effect of NO concentration on dimer formation. Fig. 5 B shows that NOC-15 concentrations higher than 2.5 mm induce cross-links between RYR1 subunits. However if NOC-15 treated membranes are subsequently treated with 200 μm diamide, a biphasic effect of NOC-15 is seen. At concentrations between 0.1–1 mm, NOC-15 prevents cross-linking by diamide as shown by an increase in the amount of monomer. At higher concentrations (>2.5 mm), monomer levels decrease indicating cross-linking by NOC-15.Table IIEffect of NO donors on single channel activitySNAP2-aHalf-life = 40–60 min; 100 μmproduces a peak value for free in the nanomolar range.

Open table in a new tab Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a physiological oxidant that has been shown to increase intracellular Ca2+ and enhance contractile function of skeletal muscle fibers in the resting state (3Reid M.B Khawli F.A. Moody M.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 20Reid M.B. Haack K.E. Franchek K.M. Valberg P.A. Kobzik L. West M.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 73: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Endogenous NO is produced at 1–3 pmol/mg by skeletal muscle fibers and has been shown to depress contractile function (4Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 5Reid M.B. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 114-119Google Scholar). In unfatigued muscle, therefore, NO acts to oppose the effects of ROI on contractile function, perhaps by preventing increases in intracellular calcium. Strenuous contractile activity accelerates the production of both ROI and NO, leading to the accumulation of oxidants and loss of contractile function during muscle fatigue. High concentrations of H2O2 and other ROI, however, cause oxidative damage and may contribute to eventual cell death. We have shown that diamide produces intersubunit cross-links within the RYR1 tetramer and enhances channel activity (1Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Slavik K.S. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A147Google Scholar). Present data demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide induces intersubunit cross-links and activates the RYR1 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer. Similar to diamide, phase 1 alkylation by NEM is blocked by H2O2. These observations suggest a common mechanism for the effect of oxidants on RYR1, i.e. oxidants produce disulfide bonds between neighboring subunits on RYR1 and, in doing so, increase channel activity. This ability of oxidants to increase the activity of RYR1 could explain the effects of oxidants on contractile force production by skeletal muscle. In contrast to oxidants, NO decreases contractile force generation in unfatigued skeletal muscle (4Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Mèszáros et al. (8Mèszáros L.G. Minarovic I. Zahradnı́ková A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Mèszáros L.G. Minarovic I. Zahradnı́ková A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A1453Google Scholar) reported an inhibitory effect of NO on RYR1 activity which would explain the decrease in contractile function. In our experiments, NO donors at lower concentrations did not change channel activity but did inhibit intersubunit cross-linking and prevent the activation of RYR1 by oxidants. Previous work in other laboratories show activation of RYR1 by NO donors (10Stoyanovsky T.D. Murphy P.A. Salama G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A257Google Scholar, 11Stoyanovsky D. Murphy T. Anno P.R. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with our work using higher donor concentrations (Table II). The higher concentration of NO donors required for activation in our studies may reflect the buffer conditions used. Neither ATP nor caffeine were in our assay. NOC-15 has a slow rate of NO release (25) and requires millimolar concentrations to activate the channel. NOC-9 has a shorter half-life and activates the channel at sub-millimolar concentrations. The activation of RYR in bilayer is consistent with intersubunit cross-linking at higher concentrations of NOC-15 and NOC-9. SNAP at 1 mm activated the channel only 3 out of 10 times and did not induce intersubunit cross-links. We attribute the ineffectiveness of SNAP to its low solubility in our buffer system or that it might be producing different NO species than NONOates. Regardless of the difference seen at higher donor concentrations, we find: 1) all NO donors blocked phase 1 of NEM alkylation, whereas their by-products after releasing NO did not; 2) all donors decreased cross-linking by diamide at subactivating concentrations of donors. Our findings suggest a possible mechanism for the opposing effects of oxidants and NO on force generation in skeletal muscle; oxidants activate the channel by forming intersubunit cross-links, and at lower concentrations NO prevents this activation and intersubunit cross-linking. However, higher NO concentrations contribute to oxidative pressure and promote activation of the RYR1. The two effects of NO probably result from interaction with distinct sulfhydryls. These interactions of NO with RYR1 may play an important role in modulating excitation-contraction coupling and muscle fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2139398847,"The most common disease-causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is a single amino acid deletion (ΔF508) in the N-terminal cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1). This mutation has previously been shown to be a temperature-sensitive folding mutation that alters the folding pathway but not the native state stability of the isolated domain (Qu, B.-H., and Thomas, P. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7261–7264). Here we provide evidence that the molecular chaperone Hsc70 productively interacts with NBD1 to increase the folding yield of the domain and inhibit off-pathway associations leading to the formation of high molecular weight aggregates. Furthermore, we have sublocalized a region within NBD1 where Hsc70 binds. Notably, inhibition of NBD1 aggregation is not dependent upon the presence of Hsc70 in the early stages of folding, indicating that the chaperone may act on a folding intermediate. In the presence of K+ and Mg2+-ATP, conditions where Hsp70 binds substrate rapidly and can release it, Hsc70 is less effective at inhibiting NBD1 aggregation. Thus, the rate of release of unfolded substrate is an important factor in preventing aggregation and promoting folding of the domain. These results demonstrate that Hsc70 promotes the otherwise inefficient folding of ΔF-NBD1 and provide insight into the mechanisms by which molecular chaperones assist proteins in folding.

These results demonstrate that Hsc70 promotes the otherwise inefficient folding of ΔF-NBD1 and provide insight into the mechanisms by which molecular chaperones assist proteins in folding. Correct protein folding is an essential biological process. When proteins do not obtain correct native structure, their normal function is either impaired or absent. Not surprisingly, mutations that result in misfolded proteins have been implicated in a growing number of diseases (1Thomas P.J. Qu B.-H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To assure their correct folding in the cellular milieu many proteins interact with molecular chaperones during the process of folding (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 381: 571-580Crossref Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 class of molecular chaperones is thought to bind early in the folding process to extended conformations of polypeptide chains (3Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) with a preference for hydrophobic sequences (4Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F.

The cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis on Hsp70 is coupled to substrate binding and release by conformational changes in the chaperone that represent interdomain communication between the substrate-binding and ATPase domains of Hsp70 (5Buchberger A.

The ADP-bound form of Hsp70 has a tight affinity for substrate and a slow rate of substrate release (8Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K+ and Mg2+-ATP are required for release of substrate from Hsc70 (9Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In effect, substrate turnover occurs in the presence of K+ and Mg2+-ATP with likely consequences for the mechanism by which Hsp70s promote protein folding. Upon release from the sequestration of the chaperone, polypeptides may either fold to the native conformation or enter the degradation machinery of the cell. Chaperones may play an active role in directing misfolded or mutant proteins to proteolysis. Hsp70, for example, has recently been shown to be required for ubiquitination of some proteins (11Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the first step toward degradation by the proteasome (12Ciechanover A.

Defective folding and maturation of the most common mutant form of CFTR, 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CF, cystic fibrosis; NBD1, N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; RCMLA, reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin; Tricine,N-[2hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508), underlie the pathogenesis of most cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) (13Qu B.H. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of phenylalanine 508 in the 22-kDa N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) alters the folding of the domain in vitro (14Thomas P.J. Shenbagamurthi P. Sondek J. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol.

Thus, altered folding is the basis of incorrect glycosylation of CFTR, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, lack of transit to the plasma membrane, and degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner observed in the cell (16Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 17Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The constitutively expressed Hsp70 isoform, Hsc70, has been shown to interact with immature wild type and ΔF508 CFTR in vivo; however, the mutant protein has an extended interaction with Hsc70 (19Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Understanding how Hsc70 influences the partitioning of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR proteins into folding and degradation pathways will provide insight into the mechanisms of intracellular quality control. In the present study we utilize an established in vitro NBD1 folding system that recapitulates the effects of several CF-associated mutants, including ΔF508 (15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Qu B.-H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Notably, the ΔF508 mutation produces a kinetic defect in CFTR-NBD1 folding. This in vitro system may be manipulated to influence the rate(s) of folding and the proportion of material destined for either off-pathway aggregation or folding to the native state. Here we use the in vitro folding of CFTR NBD1 to demonstrate that interactions with Hsc70 promote folding. Six-histidine-tagged wild type and ΔF508 mutant CFTR-NBD1 from residues Gly404to Ser589 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni+-resin affinity chromatography as described previously (15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The concentration of NBD1 solubilized in 6m GdnHCl was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,490 m−1cm−1 as determined in Ref. 15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. Once resuspended in 6m GdnHCl, protein was stored at 4 °C and used within a week. Hsc70 was purified from bovine brain as described in Ref. 21Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar with the following exceptions. After application to a DEAE column, Hsc70 was eluted with 150 mm KCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, rather than with NaCl. After precipitation by ammonium sulfate, the Hsc70 pellet was resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm imidizole, pH 7.0, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at −70 °C as aliquots. The concentration of Hsc70 was determined using the difference in absorbance at 320 and 280 nm (21Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A gel shift competition assay for peptide binding to Hsc70 was performed as described previously (22Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G17A peptide was chemically synthesized to mimic CFTR residues Gly545–Ala561 (UT Southwestern/HHMI core facility). Reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumin (RCMLA), which is unable to reach the native state due to carboxymethylation of cysteine residues, was obtained from Sigma. Purified Hsc70 (1.4 μm) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 0, 10, 50, 250, or 500 μm G17A peptide and 300 μg/ml RCMLA, which is an approximate 2-fold excess of RCMLA over Hsc70. Samples were subjected to 6% native gel electrophoresis as described in Ref. 22Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and stained with Coomassie Blue. Aggregation assays to monitor the formation of off-pathway species were initiated by rapid dilution of NBD1 in 6m GdnHCl to a final concentration of 2 μminto a pre-warmed folding mix (Buffer R). Final concentrations in Buffer R were 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.385 ml-arginine-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 25 mm GdnHCl. Aggregation was followed over time at 37 °C by turbidity measured at 400 nm in a UV spectrophotometer. In experiments that contained Hsc70, a final concentration of 1 μm Hsc70 in Buffer C was added either before initiating folding or 400 s after the initiation of folding. In experiments containing ATP, the following were present in Buffer R: 20 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, and 50 μm ATP (diluted from a stock adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Data are shown as dots representing single data points and a line fitted to the data from a logistic equation. The folding yield of 2 μmΔF-NBD1 in the absence and the presence of 1 μm Hsc70 was determined by diluting ΔF-NBD1 into Buffer R pre-equilibrated to 4, 10, 20, 25, 37, or 45 °C. After an overnight incubation at the designated temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min to pellet insoluble material, and the supernatant was subjected to Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16.5% gel) and stained with Coomassie Blue (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Denatured ΔF-NBD1 in 6m GdnHCl was diluted into either 6 m GdnHCl or Buffer R at a final protein concentration of 2 μm. Folding was monitored by the increase in fluorescence as the single tryptophan at position 496 in the domain enters a more hydrophobic environment during the folding process. Fluorescence measurements were made at excitation and emission wavelengths of 282 and 324 nm, respectively, on a fluorometer with band passes of 2 and 4 nm. Approximately 15 s passed between the time folding was initiated and the time data collection was begun. Although full-length CFTR has been shown to interact with Hsc70 in a tissue culture system by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (19Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the location of the binding site(s) for Hsc70 to CFTR have not been identified. Using a peptide representing a portion of CFTR we localized a binding site for Hsc70 within the NBD1 by a gel shift competition assay (Fig.1). Hsc70 was chosen as the representative Hsp70 family member for these experiments because it is located in the cytosol (where the NBD1 presumably folds and is topologically accessible), is constitutively expressed, and binds to nascent polypeptide chains (24Craig E.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1902-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Hsc70 purified from bovine brain was allowed to form a complex with a stable, unfolded substrate, RCMLA. Once the complex was formed, it was subjected to native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Hsc70 in complex with RCMLA (lane 3) has a shifted mobility compared with the mobility of free Hsc70 (lane 2). Notably, G17A, a peptide fragment from NBD1 corresponding to residues Gly545–Ala561, was able to compete with RCMLA for binding to Hsc70. Not all peptides compete for Hsc70 binding in this gel shift assay (22Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G17A is homologous to a region of p53 known to bind Hsc70 (26Lam K.T. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and includes several CF-associated mutations that affect maturation (27Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S.

Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and folding (20Qu B.-H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The peptide-Hsc70 complex runs at a size consistent with free Hsc70, and the free peptide does not resolve in the gel. The G17A peptide also stimulates the substrate-dependent ATPase activity of Hsc70 at 50 μm peptide (data not shown). It is important to note that additional Hsc70-binding sites may exist within NBD1. The localization of a binding region for Hsc70 within NBD1 is significant because the domain contains the temperature-sensitive folding mutation ΔF508 as well as other known folding mutations (27Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Under conditions of low folding yield, NBD1 does not fold and aggregates into high molecular weight species that scatter light (15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hsc70 inhibits ΔF-NBD1 aggregation at a substoichiometric ratio of 2:1 ΔF-NBD1:Hsc70 (Fig.2 A). Not surprisingly, considering that wild type CFTR interacts with Hsp70 in vivo, under conditions where folding is inefficient, Hsc70 also inhibits the aggregation of wild type NBD1 (data not shown). By inhibiting the aggregation of ΔF-NBD1, Hsc70 increases the amount of soluble protein formed during an overnight folding yield experiment performed at various temperatures as shown in Fig. 2 B. The fraction of NBD1 that is soluble under these conditions has previously been shown to be functional by binding nucleotide (15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Qu B.-H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). At increased temperatures the folding yield is lowered as the amount of aggregation increases. In the presence of Hsc70 the amount of ΔF-NBD1 in the soluble fraction increases. A large fraction of the total ΔF-NBD1 is soluble, implying that solubility of the domain is not merely a consequence of complex formation with Hsc70. The intrinsic fluorescence of a single tryptophan residue in NBD1 (Trp496) can be utilized to monitor folding (Fig. 3 A). As NBD1 folds, Trp496 enters a more hydrophobic environment and exhibits an increase in fluorescence (15Qu B.-H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7261-7264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The change in fluorescence over time after the initiation of folding exhibited at least two phases. First, there is a burst phase that occurs during mixing and may represent the initial hydrophobic collapse of the domain. Second, there is a slower phase of fluorescence increase that occurs within 150 s. Both of these phases are complete prior to the time that aggregation can be observed by turbidity (compare with Fig. 2 A). These kinetic data are consistent with the existence of at least one intermediate on a sequential pathway or multiple denatured states. An unresolved issue in our understanding of the action of molecular chaperones is the conformation of their polypeptide substrate. Although Hsp70s are known to inhibit the aggregation of many proteins, it is unclear whether they bind to fully denatured polypeptides, partially structured intermediates, or folded domains. Here we show that a substoichiometric amount of Hsc70 inhibits aggregation when present at the initiation of folding/aggregation. If, however, Hsc70 is added either 60 (data not shown) or 400 s after initiation of folding, well after the burst phase has concluded, aggregation continues to be inhibited (Fig. 3 B). Because Hsc70 is equally effective at inhibiting aggregation when added either before or after the burst phase, it most likely acts on a partially folded structure or on a conformer in equilibrium with the aggregation-prone species during folding. In addition, these results indicate that there may be a further slow phase in folding that is not reported by intrinsic fluorescence. All of the previous aggregation experiments were performed in the absence of Mg2+-ATP. In the presence of K+ and Mg2+-ATP, conditions that promote binding and rapid release of substrate (8Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), aggregation is no longer effectively inhibited by the chaperone (Fig. 4). ATP has been shown to have similar effects on the ability of Hsc70 to block the aggregation of citrate synthase (29Jacob U. Scheibel T. Bose S. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10035-10041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is important to note that although NBD1 also binds ATP, this binding has no effect on the folding yield or aggregation (20Qu B.-H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate of release of an intermediate prone to aggregation may be critical for effective inhibition of aggregation by Hsc70. Premature release of NBD1 may result in an accumulation of the partially structured folding intermediate(s) susceptible to intermolecular interactions and, ultimately, accelerated higher order processes of aggregation or proteolysis. Thus, the kinetics of chaperone binding and protein folding must be in balance. Alteration of that balance by a kinetic folding mutation would result in a reduction in folding efficiency and, perhaps, an increased rate of quality control processes such as ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. Whereas other chaperones and cofactors such as Hsp40 regulate the turnover of Hsc70 substrates, they may have an important role to play in this process. Correcting the folding defect of CFTR has promise as a treatment for the disease because ΔF-CFTR forms a functional channel in cell culture systems under conditions that promote folding, such as lower growth temperature(s) or growth in 10% glycerol (30Denning G.M.

In contrast to the high catalytic efficiency of parasite-derived cruzipain, the recombinant proteinases cleaved the bradykinin-flanking sites at markedly different rates.

The infection is propagated to deep tissues by bloodstream trypomastigotes, but the mechanisms that enable their traverse across capillary vessels are not known.

The mature form of these enzymes contains a papain-like catalytic domain in addition to a long and structurally unique carboxyl-terminal extension whose function remains unknown (10Eakin A.E.

Storer A.C. Ménard R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The finding that cruzipain expression is increased markedly in replicating forms of this intracellular parasite (12Bonaldo M.C. Scharfstein J. Murta A.C.M. Goldenberg S. Parasitol.

Biol. 1995; 247: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of structural and biochemical information on cruzipain(s), their biological role remains unclear. Recent studies revealed that some polymorphic genes are transcribed by the parasite, suggesting that the parasite may express several isoforms at different stages of development and/or stress conditions (21Lima A.P.C.A. Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Scharfstein J. Storer A.C. Vernet T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of some of these variant genes revealed that non-conservative amino acid substitutions tend to cluster in the catalytic domain, some of the changes being localized to positions that could conceivably influence the subsite specificity. In the course of studies aimed at characterizing the substrate specificity of parasite-derived cruzipain (22Serveau C. Lalmanach G. Juliano M. Scharfstein J. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Del Nery E. Juliano M.A. Meldal M. Svendsen I. Scharfstein J. Walmsley A. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) we noticed that this enzyme shared some interesting properties with the human tissue kallikrein (24Chagas J.R. Portaro F.C.V.

In the present work we demonstrate that cruzipain releases bioactive kinins from human kininogen as well as from human plasma, even though kininogen, a member of the cystatin superfamily of inhibitors of cysteinyl proteases (26Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Davies M.E. Machleidt W. Salvesen G. Turk V. Barret A.J. Salvesen G. in Proteinase Inhibitors: Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors of the Cystatin Superfamily.

The cruzipain kininogenase activity was depleted by affinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody to the characteristic COOH-terminal domain of the protease. In addition, the sites of cleavage were systematically confirmed, using a synthetic fragment of human kininogen labeled at the NH2terminus with o-aminobenzoic acid (Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2) and related internally quenched fluorogenic peptides. We then used synthetic substrates based on the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal flanking regions of bradykinin in human kininogen to compare the substrate specificity requirements of two recombinant isoforms, namely cruzain and cruzipain 2, with the parasite-derived cruzipain. Finally, we also demonstrated that cruzipain was able to act via contact phase activation cascade by converting plasma prekallikrein into active kallikrein. Cruzipain (GP57/51) was isolated from crude aqueous extracts of Dm28c strain epimastigotes as described previously (15Lima A.P.C.A. Scharfstein J. Storer A.C. Ménard R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A single band of 51 kDa was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under denaturing conditions. As already reported by Murta et al. (9Murta A.C.M. Persechini P.M. Padron T.S. Souza W. Guimarães J.A. Scharfstein J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the presence of the 57-kDa band can only be distinguished when the electrophoresis is carried out under native conditions. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry yielded a mass of 43 kDa at the center of a wide peak typical of glycosylation. Two wide peaks of low intensity (60 kDa, corresponding to GP57 and 15 kDa corresponding to a degradation product) were also noticed. We subjected the enzyme to immunoabsorption with a monoclonal antibody to cruzipain (JO1, IgG isotype), which binds to the epitope located in the COOH-terminal extension of cruzipain (29Morrot A. Strickland D.K. Higuchi M.D. Reis M. Pedrosa R. Scharfstein J. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The immunoabsorption was carried out by treating an agarose-protein G resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with 100 μl of either JO1 ascites or an unrelated ascites as control. The antibody-coated beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and thereafter incubated with 2 volumes of cruzipain solution at 120 μg/ml. The supernatants were collected and assayed for hydrolytic activity using the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-MCA as already described (17McKerrow J.H.M. McGrath M.E. Engel J.C. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 279-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cruzain, the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli without the COOH-terminal domain (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Drs. J. H. McKerrow and J. C. Engel, from the University of California, San Francisco. Recombinant cruzipain 2 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisae essentially as described by Vernet et al. (30Vernet T. Chatellier J. Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the final construct consisted of a chimera containing the preproregion of the S. cerevisaeα-factor gene and the procruzipain 2 gene where the carboxyl-terminal sequence region was deleted. Transformation and culture conditions were carried out as described in the aforementioned study. The transformed yeast cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline with glass beads in a Brown homogenizer. After removing the cellular debris by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was treated with 1% Triton X-100 to improve the solubilization of active recombinant protease. After precipitation with 1 volume of 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5, the supernatant was extracted with 1 volume of saturated butanol. Recovered in the aqueous phase, the active protease was fractionated further by affinity chromatography on a thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia). Partially purified cruzipain 2 migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a 29-kDa band. Human plasma prekallikrein and activated Hageman factor (factor XIIa) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratory Inc. The molar concentrations of the cysteinyl proteases were determined by active site thiol titration using trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) obtained from Sigma (31Barret A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirchke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides have EDDnp attached to COOH-terminal glutamine, a necessary result of the solid phase peptide synthesis strategy employed, the details of which were published elsewhere (32Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M. Juliano L. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). An automated benchtop simultaneous multiple solid phase peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8 system from Shimadzu) was used for the solid phase synthesis of all of the peptides by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) procedure. High and low molecular weight human kininogens (HMWK and LMWK, respectively) were purchased from Calbiochem. We also used heated human plasma as a source of kininogen, as described previously (33Webster M.E. Prado E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 681-697Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic activity of the parasite protease was initially measured using fluorogenic substrates containing the specific cleavage sites to the Lys-BK or bradykinin releasing. Hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrates at 37 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 400 mm NaCl, pH 6.3, containing 10 mmEDTA was followed by measuring the fluorescence at λem = 420 nm and λex = 320 nm in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer. Cruzipain and recombinant enzymes (0.4–4 nm) were preactivated with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of the above described buffer and were kept in ice before use. The 1-cm path length cuvette containing 1.8 ml of the substrate solution was placed in the thermostatted cell compartment for 10 min before the enzyme solution was added, and the increase in fluorescence with time was recorded continuously for 10 min. The slope was converted into mol of substrate hydrolyzed/min based on the fluorescence curves for standard peptide solutions before and after total enzymatic hydrolysis. A solution of Abz-Phe-Arg-OH was used as standard for the fluorescence measurements, which was prepared from tryptic hydrolysis of Abz-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Abz-Phe-Arg-pNA), and its concentration was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm, assuming ε405 = 8,900m−1·cm−1 for p-nitroanilide. The enzyme concentrations for initial rate determinations were chosen so as to hydrolyze less than 5% of the substrate. The nonlinear regression data analysis program GraFit (34Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit Version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, U. K.1992Google Scholar) fit all data. Some of the second-order rate constant k cat/Km was measured working under pseudo first-order conditions. The cleavage sites of the hydrolysis of the kininogen fragment Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2 by cruzipain or recombinant cruzain were identified by HPLC on a Novapak C-18 column (3.2 × 150 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% H3PO4 (solvent A). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.7 ml/min with 0–10% gradient of solvent B (90% ACN, 0.1% H3PO4,v/v) over 5 min followed by a 10–80% gradient of the same solvent over 15 min. The elution profile was determined at 220 nm and by fluorescence at 420 nm after excitation at 320 nm. Abz-[Leu373-Ile393]-hKng-NH2 (40 μm) was incubated with activated cruzipain or recombinant proteases (final concentration 4 nm) in the buffer described above for the fluorometric enzyme assays. After the addition of the enzymes, 200-μl aliquots were removed from these assay mixtures at 15-min intervals and mixed with 600 μl of 0.1% H3PO4 to stop the reaction. This reaction mixture was analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using Fisons-VG-Platform mass spectrometer as a courtesy of Dr. Jörg von Hendel from Fisons Instruments, Mainz-Kastel, Germany, as follows. A 5-μl sample of the enzymatic reaction mixture was applied in a C-4 column (1 × 250 mm) and two solvent systems: (A) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (1:2,000) and (B) trifluoroacetic acid/ACN (1:2,000). The column was eluted to a mass spectrometer and UV detector (214 nm) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min with a 5–60% gradient of system B over 90 min and then to 90% of B in 10 min. The ability of cruzipain to cleave the human kininogens was evaluated incubating 1 μl of HMWK and LMWK (100 μg/ml) with active cruzipain (1.8 nm) in reaction mixtures containing 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, pH 6.3, at 37 °C for 2 h. Ethanol (3:1, v/v) was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min. The kinin content in the supernatant was measured by radioimmunoassay, as described previously (35Shimamoto K. Ando T. Tanaka S. Sakuma M. Miyahara M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1978; 91: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation the kinin released by cruzipain from HMWK (molar ratio 1:40) was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, using a TofSpecE from Micromass, Manchester, U. K., after previous purification on the HPLC system. The biological activity of the released kinin was measured as isotonic contraction on isolated guinea pig terminal ileum. The isolated organ was suspended in a bath of 2-ml capacity in Tyrode's solution at 37 °C containing 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.36 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, 11.9 mmNaHCO3, 5.04 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The sensitivity of the response was calibrated with standard solutions of bradykinin and Lys-BK (1–10 nm). Heat-treated human plasma (100 μl) and human HMWK (100 μl, 1 mg/ml) were added to the ileum preparation bath. After the equilibration period of 3 min, the activated cruzipain or recombinant cruzain solutions (0.4–40 nm) were added and the isotonic contraction recorded. The amounts of enzyme and substrates were adjusted in a manner that the released kinin fit inside the dose-response curve for bradykinin. Similar experiments were performed in the presence of the bradykinin β2-receptor antagonist (Hoe-140,d-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-β-(2-thienyl)Ala-Ser-d-tetrahydroisoquiniline-3-carboxylic acid-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid-Arg) (10 nm) and with E-64-pretreated cruzipain. Plasma prekallikrein (2 μg) was incubated with active cruzipain (0.6 nm final concentration) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.3, for 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C. After the incubation period cruzipain was inactivated irreversibly with E-64 (10 μm), and the kallikrein activity was measured using 20 μmd-Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer containing 0.015 m NaCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. As experimental controls of the employed preparation of human plasma prekallikrein, it was also activated for 1 h with 0.6 nm human factor XIIa. Internally quenched fluorescent peptides with residues flanking amino and carboxyl sides of the Met-Lys (peptides 1and 2) and Arg-Ser bonds (peptide 3), as in the bradykinin region of human kininogen, were synthesized to study the behavior of the parasite-derived cruzipain as well the two recombinant isoforms, namely cruzain and cruzipain 2 (TableI). The HPLC analysis using authentic synthesized fragments demonstrated that all of the peptides were hydrolyzed only at Met-Lys or Arg-Ser bonds, except for the peptide1, which was at low peptide concentrations hydrolyzed at the Gly-Met and subsequently at the Met379-Lys380bond. A similar pattern was observed when these peptides were hydrolyzed by two recombinant isoforms. As demonstrated by the k cat/Km values, Met-Lys or Gly-Met bonds were not hydrolyzed as efficiently by cruzain as by parasite-derived cruzipain. In contrast to the behavior of this isoform, recombinant cruzipain 2 has hydrolyzed the Met-Lys bond quite efficiently, being similar to the parasite-derived enzyme in this respect. On the other hand, the Arg-Ser bond in peptide 3was hydrolyzed efficiently by cruzain, whereas cruzipain 2 displayed a very low k cat/Km value. These results revealed that these two recombinant isoforms have distinct requirements for the S1-P1 interaction, suggesting that their substrate specificities might not be identical.Table IKinetic data for the hydrolysis by cruzipain (GP57/51) and recombinant protease (cruzain and cruzipain 2) of fluorogenic peptides Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp flanking the scissile Met379-Lys380and Arg389-Ser390 bonds of human kininogen sequencePeptideSubstratesCruzipain (GP 57/51)CruzainCruzipain 21-aDetermined under pseudo first-order conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Kmkcatkcat/K mKmkcatkcat/Kmkcat/Kmμms−1(mm.s)−1μms−1(mm.s)−1(mm.s−1)1Abz-LGMISLMKRPQ-EDDnp0.3 ± 0.051.5 ± 0.075,0000.8 ± 0.090.4 ± 0.01500ND↑2Abz-MISLMKRPQ-EDDnp1.3 ± 0.40.6 ± 0.054623.5 ± 0.80.1 ± 0.0229353↑3Abz-GFSPFRSSRQ-EDDnp2.7 ± 0.25.9 ± 0.42,1852.7 ± 0.98.1 ± 1.43,0009↑1-a Determined under pseudo first-order conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab TableII shows all the fragments resulting from the hydrolysis of Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2 by cruzipain, following analysis by mass spectroscopy. The HPLC profiles (Fig. 1) show the time course of enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptide Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2. The fragment Abz-LGMISLMKRPPGFSPFR was observed to accumulate, indicating that the initial hydrolysis occurs at the Arg-Ser bond. The fragments Abz-LG and KRPPGFSPFR (Lys-bradykinin) were detected as the reaction proceeded, suggesting that Gly-Met and Met-Lys bonds have similar susceptibility to hydrolysis by cruzipain under these conditions. Only traces of bradykinin were detected after a 45-min incubation, indicating that the Lys-Arg bond is not cleaved readily by cruzipain. It is noteworthy that Lys-BK and bradykinin were resistant to hydrolysis by cruzipain (20 nm) for up to 6 h of incubation. The same fragments were detected upon hydrolysis of Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2 by recombinant cruzain; but in contrast to the activity of the parasite-derived protease the Met-Lys bond was only slowly hydrolyzed by the recombinant enzyme. This observation is consistent with the data presented in Table I, which also indicate the lower susceptibility of Met-Lys bond in the peptide Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2. This peptide was resistant to hydrolysis by cruzipain 2.Table IICleavage sites of Abz-(Leu373-Ile397)-human kininogen-amide by cruzipain determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy↓, cleavage site.Abz Leu Gly ↓ Met Ile Ser Leu Met ↓ Lys Arg Pro Pro Gly Phe Ser Pro Phe Arg ↓ Ser Ser Arg Ile-NH2FragmentsMolecular weight (calculated)Observed ion (m/z)Abz-L-G307.2MH+308.2M-I-S-L-M593.3MH+594.3K-R-P-P-G-F-S-P-F-R1,187.7(MHH)2+594.3Abz-L-G-M-I-S-L-M-K-R-P-P-G-F-S-P-F-R2,052MH+2,053.0S-S-R-I-NH2461.3MH+462.3 Open table in a new tab The releasing assay of kinin was carried out with heat-treated human plasma (to inactivate preferentially the aminopeptidases that readily inactivate kinins) and purified form of bovine LMWK. The kinin released was detected by guinea pig ileum contraction assay, as shown in Figs.2 and 3. At the concentrations used, human heat-treated plasma or cruzipain alone did not induce detectable smooth muscle contractile activity. The reaction was only observed at enzyme concentrations above 5 nm; no contraction was seen when the human plasma was incubated with E-64-treated cruzipain, confirming the reaction dependence on a thiol proteinase. Importantly, the addition of Hoe-140 has abrogated the ileum contractile response. Similar results were observed with human and bovine kininogen. The HPLC profile (Fig. 3) of the reaction mixture of purified bovine or human LMWK with cruzipain shows that Lys-BK was the major kinin released. Under the same assay conditions, recombinant cruzain and cruzipain 2 did not show any detectable kininogenase activity when incubated with human plasma or purified kininogens. Radioimmunoassay experiment confirmed that cruzipain releases kinin from human HMWK and LMWK as shown in TableIII. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses of the material collected from the HPLC of the reaction mixture of human HMWK in the same conditions of Fig. 3 has shown that the Lys-BK was the major kinin released. The agarose gel affinity column containing a monoclonal antibody to the COOH-terminal domain of cruzipain depleted completely the proteolytic activity of the enzyme solution compared with the agarose gel column devoid of the antibody (Table III).Figure 3Cruzipain-generated kinins detected by HPLC and guinea pig ileum contraction assay.

Open table in a new tab After being converted to α-kallikrein by factor XIIa, plasma prekallikrein possesses the ability to generate the chemical mediator bradykinin from HMWK. To test the possibility of cruzipain indirectly influencing kininogenase activity via contact phase activators, human plasma prekallikrein was incubated with active cruzipain, and samples were analyzed by fluorometric assay. The time course of cruzipain activity on prekallikrein using the fluorogenic substrate of plasma kallikrein,d-Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA, revealed significant amidolytic activity compared with the activation produced by the active human Hageman factor after 1 h of incubation. Fig.4 shows the activation produced by cruzipain at the first 30-min incubation period. In contrast, after 1 h of incubation with cruzipain, prekallikrein activation was not detectable any more because of the progressive digestion of kallikrein by the parasite enzyme. The recognition that proteolytic enzymes, other than kallikreins, were also capable of releasing kinins upon incubation with blood plasma was reported long ago by Rocha e Silva et al. (36Rocha e Silva M. Beraldo W.T. Rosenfeld G. Am. J. Physiol. 1949; 156: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), in their enzymatic studies with trypsin and Bothrops jararaca venom proteases. Subsequent work indicated that ficin, papain, and a cysteine-proteinase secreted by Clostridium histolyticumcould also generate bradykinin-like peptides from plasma (37Prado J.L. Eichler O. Farah A. Herker H. Welch A.D. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 25. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1970: 156-192Google Scholar). More recently it has been reported that cysteine proteinases from Streptococcus pyogenes (38Herwald H. Collin M. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and from Pophyromas gingivalis, the major causative agent in the development of periodontitis, could rapidly release bradykinin from human kininogen, the reaction being proposed as a correlate for clinical indices of inflammation (39Scott C.F. Whitaker E.J. Hammond B.F. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7935-7942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ciborowski P. Nishikata M. Allen R.D. Lantz M. J.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the major cysteine protease from the pathogenic parasite T. cruzi also displays kinin-releasing activity. The biochemical characterization of this reaction was initially carried out with the fluorescent labeled peptide, Abz-(Leu373-Ile393)-hKng-NH2, the data indicating that Arg-Ser, Gly-Met, and Met-Lys bonds were successively cleaved, thus releasing Lys-BK. The same pattern of cleavage was observed using a series of internally quenched fluorescent peptides. The results suggest that both Arg-Ser and Met-Lys bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis by parasite-derived protease. However, it is noteworthy that the Met-Lys bond is hydrolyzed poorly by cruzain, in contrast to cruzipain 2, which hardly cleaved Arg-Ser bond. In agreement with the results obtained with synthetic substrates, we characterized Lys-BK as the major kinin released from human HMWK and bovine LMWK. The kininogenasic activity of cruzipain was abolished by treating the enzyme with E-64, thus confirming that it was mediated by cysteine-proteinase rather than by traces of other classes of proteolytic enzymes. The enzyme preparation used in the present study has the same purity as described previously (9Murta A.C.M. Persechini P.M. Padron T.S. Souza W. Guimarães J.A. Scharfstein J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and its MALDI-TOF analysis was in agreement with molecular weight estimates based on electrophoretic behavior. Importantly, we showed that the kininogenase activity of the parasite is mediated by the native form of parasite-derived cruzipain, since the biological activity was specifically depleted by immunoaffinity columns prepared with a monoclonal antibody that reacts with their characteristic COOH-terminal domain. It is surprising that cruzipain is included in the restricted group of proteases that generates Lys-BK upon hydrolysis of native kininogen because kininogens are potent inhibitors of many thiol proteases (43Barret A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 193-196Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is unclear how cruzipain acts as kinin-releasing enzyme because the proteinase binds tightly to kininogens (27Scharfstein J. Abrahamson M. Palatnik de Souza C. Barral A. Silva I.V. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 182: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the inhibition constants being in the pm–nm range depending on the species of kininogen used (28Stoka V. Nycander M. Lenarcie B. Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Blork I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these effects, we have observed that human HMWK and LMWK are hydrolyzed completely by cruzipain in fragments after 2 h of incubation (data not shown). The substrate specificity requirements of recombinant cruzain, cruzipain 2, and parasite-derived cruzipain were compared using synthetic peptides. The data showed that all enzymes have hydrolyzed the same peptide bonds. The recombinant cruzain has a marked preference for Arg over Met at the P1 position of the synthetic substrates (Table I), in contrast to cruzipain 2, which hardly hydrolyzes Arg-Ser bond but cleaves Met-Lys bond with almost the same efficiency of the parasite-derived cruzipain. Accordingly, the relative endurance of Met-Lys or Arg-Ser bonds to the action of recombinant cruzain or cruzipain 2, respectively, might explain their failure to develop significant kininogenase activity in assays with human plasma. Notwithstanding the above arguments, it should be pointed out that the genetically engineered cruzain (10Eakin A.E. Mills A.A. Harth G. McKerrow J.H. Craik C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cruzipain 2 do not contain the highly glycosylated COOH-terminal domain (130 residues) present in the native form of cruzipain. The functional role of this long and unique extension remains unknown, but it is conceivable that its presence in the intact proteinase might sterically hinder the binding. As a consequence, it decreases the susceptibility to inhibition by the cystatin-like inhibitory domains of human/bovine kininogen slowing the rate of association to the inhibitory domain; however, the kinetics of the kinin-releasing reaction might be favored. It is worthwhile mentioning that reversible conformational changes are thought to affect the enzymatic properties of cruzipain, this phenomenon being tentatively attributed to the COOH-terminal extension (15Lima A.P.C.A. Scharfstein J. Storer A.C. Ménard R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Independently from the role, if any, of the COOH-terminal domain, the ability of cruzipain to cleave the flanking sequences of BK must be the primary requirement for the expression of a kininogenase activity. The identification of polymorphic variants of cruzain in the parasite genome (21Lima A.P.C.A. Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Scharfstein J. Storer A.C. Vernet T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) suggests that cruzipain isoforms displaying different substrate specificities and/or organelle compartmentalization may exist. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that cruzipain activates human plasma prekallikrein; therefore cruzipain can act directly on the physiological kininogenase system generating active plasma kallikrein to target the kallikrein-mediated processing cascade. The capability to generate vasoactive kinins in the bloodstream or interstitial fluids may qualify the structurally diverse T. cruzi cysteine proteinases as factors of virulence in Chagas' disease.

The genetic manipulation of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites has been proposed as a prospective target for crop improvement (1Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Masoud S. Sewalt V.J.H. Paiva N.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A fundamental understanding of the key enzymes of the various phenylpropanoid branching pathways is therefore of increasing interest. Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, compound 7, Fig.1) serves as a fundamental precursor for gallotannins and ellagitannins, abundant classes of plant secondary metabolites. Gallic acid is also formed in substantial amounts by some fungi. A considerable number of studies on the biosynthesis of tannins has been reported (for review, see Gross (2Gross G.C. Basic Life Sci. 1992; 59: 43-60Google Scholar) and Haslam (3Haslam E. Basic Life Sci. 1992; 59: 169-194Google Scholar)). Surprisingly, the biosynthesis of gallic acid, the phenolic unit of this important class of natural products, is still incompletely understood. Based mainly on radiolabeling studies, it has been proposed that gallic acid could be formed from phenylalanine (compound5) via caffeic acid (compound 8), 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid (compound 9), or protocatechuic acid (compound 6, Fig. 1) (4Kato N. Shiroya M. Yoshida S. Hasegawa M. Shokubutsugaku Zasshi. 1968; 81: 506-507Crossref Google Scholar, 5Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1964; 19b: 83-84Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6Neish A.C.

This would imply that the carboxylic group of gallic acid is derived from the β carbon atom of phenylalanine (compound 5), and ultimately from the enoylpyruvoyl group of chorismate (compound 3, Fig.1). On the other hand, it has been argued that the carboxylic group of gallic acid is biosynthetically equivalent to the carboxylic group of shikimate (10Dewick P.M. Haslam E. Chem. Commun. 1968; : 673-675Google Scholar, 11Dewick P.M. Haslam E. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Marigo G. Alibert G. Boudet A. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser.

Haworth R.D. Knowles P.F. J. Chem. Soc. 1961; : 1854-1859Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This would imply that gallic acid is formed from an early shikimate intermediate, e.g. directly from 5-dehydroshikimate (compound 4) by dehydrogenation or via protocatechuic acid (compound 6) as an intermediate (Fig. 1) (16Tateoka T.N. Bot. Mag. 1968; 81: 103-104Crossref Google Scholar). It was also proposed that the controversial results could indicate the existence of alternative biosynthetic routes in the same organism (17Ishikura N. Hayashida S. Tazaki K. Bot.

This report describes studies with shake flask cultures of the fungus,Phycomyces blakesleeanus, and with young leaves of the tree,Rhus typhina, which were supplied with exogenous13C-labeled glucose. Gallic acid and amino acids were obtained by hydrolysis of cell material, and the 13C distribution was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. A central aspect of this approach was a retrobiosynthetic comparison of labeling patterns of gallic acid with those of amino acids. The results show unequivocally that gallic acid is biosynthesized in both organisms from an early intermediate of the shikimate pathway, but not via phenylalanine. [U-13C6]Glucose (99%13C) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, FL), and [1-13C]glucose was purchased from Omicron (South Bend, IN). Spores of P. blakesleeanus(NRLL1555(−)) were obtained from P. Galland, Marburg, Germany. Young leaves of R. typhina were cut from a local tree between May and August. Spores of P. blakesleeanus were activated by heat treatment (48 °C) for 2 h. The culture medium contained, per liter, 2.0 g of asparagine in H2O, 5.0 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2 ml of 14% (w/w) CaCl2 solution, 2 mg of thiamine hydrochloride, 2 mg of citric acid in H2O, 1.5 mg of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 1 mg of ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.3 mg of MnSO4·H2O, 50 μg of CuSO4·5H2O, 50 μg of NaMoO4·2H2O, pH 4.7. A sterile solution of 6 g of [1-13C]glucose in 5 ml of water was added to the autoclaved medium (300 ml). Alternatively, a mixture of [U-13C6]glucose (320 mg) and unlabeled glucose (7.7 g) in 5 ml of water was added to the autoclaved medium (400 ml). Erlenmeyer flasks (1 liter) containing 400 ml of culture medium were seeded with one loopful of spores and were incubated with shaking at 25 °C for 6 days. The mycelium was harvested by filtration and was washed with a small amount of water. The stems of young leaves of R. typhina (with a length of 3–4 cm) were immersed into a sterile solution of 1% (w/w) of glucose consisting of 96% of unlabeled glucose and 4% of [U-13C6]glucose. They were incubated in a dark compartment (Heraeus Vötsch climate chamber) at 18 °C and 60% humidity for 33 days. Small sections of the stem were removed with a sharp razor at intervals of 1 or 2 days. The culture medium from experiments with P. blakesleeanus was adjusted to pH 1, treated at 96 °C for 6 h, and extracted with 150 ml of diethyl ether for 12 h using a liquid/liquid perforator. Fungal biomass was treated with 1 m sulfuric acid (100 ml) at 96 °C for 6 h. The solution was filtered and was then continuously extracted with 150 ml of diethyl ether for 12 h using a liquid/liquid perforator. The organic phases obtained by extraction of culture medium and of cell mass hydrolysate of P. blakesleeanus were combined. The aqueous solution obtained by acidic treatment of biomass and subsequent extraction with ether was set aside for isolation of tyrosine and phenylalanine. The organic phase was extracted twice with 75 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 1 by the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid and was again subjected to continuous extraction with 150 ml of diethyl ether. The organic phase was concentrated to a small volume (about 3 ml) under reduced pressure. The solution was applied to a column of silica gel (Merck, 1.5 × 35 cm). The column was developed with a mixture of diethyl ether/ethyl acetate/formic acid (50:40:10, v/v). Gallic acid was eluted with the colored solvent front. Fractions were combined and were brought to dryness under reduced pressure. Aliquots of fractions were applied to a TLC silica gel plate (Merck, Darmstadt), which was developed with a mixture of diethyl ether/ethyl acetate/formic acid (50:40:10, v/v). Gallic acid migrated at a R F of 0.82 and was detected by fluorescence quenching (254 nm). Acid treatment of biomass and isolation of gallic acid was performed as described for fungal cell mass. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography was performed with a column of Nucleosil RP18 (4.5 × 250 mm) which was developed with 23% aqueous methanol. The effluent was monitored photometrically (258 nm). Semipreparative separations were performed with a Nucleosil RP18 column (16 × 250 mm). The retention volume of gallic acid was 48 ml. Tryptophan was isolated from cell mass after alkaline hydrolysis as described earlier (21Eisenreich W. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23840-23849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine and phenylalanine were isolated from the aqueous phase obtained after extraction of the biomass hydrolysate with diethyl ether (see above). The aqueous phase was adjusted to 6 m HCl and boiled under reflux for 24 h. The separation of the amino acids from the hydrolysate was performed as described earlier (22Eisenreich W. Schwarzkopf B. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9622-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 500.13 and 125.76 MHz, respectively, with a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer. Gallic acid was dissolved in methanol-d 4, tyrosine, and tryptophan in 0.1m NaOD, and phenylalanine in 0.1 m DCl. The following experimental parameters were used for 1H NMR spectra: 50° pulse (4 μs); repetition time, 4 s; spectral width, 5.3 kHz; data set, 32 kilo-words; temperature, 27 °C; gaussian apodization prior to Fourier transformation. 13C NMR spectra were measured as follows: 30° pulse (2 μs); repetition time, 3.5 s; spectral width, 20.8 kHz (gallic acid, 10.4 kHz); data set, 64 kilo-words zero-filled to 128 kilo-words; temperature, 27 °C; 1H composite pulse decoupling; gaussian apodization prior to Fourier transformation. Relative enrichments for all carbon atoms of biosynthetic gallic acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan were obtained by comparison of13C integrals with natural abundance standards. This standardization considers different relaxation behavior of carbon atoms and prevents false quantification of 13C enrichments due to differences in relaxation times. Absolute 13C enrichments of selected carbon atoms were obtained from the 13C satellites in the 1H spectra. The relative enrichments were subsequently referenced to these respective carbon atoms (23Strauß G. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Signal assignments were based on two-dimensional HMQC, HMBC, and INADEQUATE experiments (data not shown). 13C-Coupling patterns were simulated with the program package NMRSIM (Bruker). The present study was designed to determine unequivocally whether the carboxylic group of gallic acid originates from the carboxylic group of an early shikimate precursor (e.g.5-dehydroshikimate) or from the β carbon atom of the phenylalanine side chain. This question can be addressed by a comparison between the labeling patterns of biosynthetic gallic acid and phenylalanine or tyrosine, which are easily obtained by hydrolysis of cell protein. This retrobiosynthetic approach requires a labeling strategy conducive to significantly different labeling of the carboxylic group of early shikimate derivatives and of the β carbon atom of phenylalanine or tyrosine. Since the carboxylic group of early shikimate derivatives and the β carbon of phenylalanine are derived from different atoms (i.e. the carboxyl group and the methyl group) of pyruvate, this condition can be fulfilled by a variety of precursors, and unequivocal results were obtained with [1-13C]glucose in P. blakesleeanus. In leaves of R. typhina, the incorporation rate of [1-13C]glucose was too low to afford unequivocal results. However, this problem could be addressed by incorporation experiments using a mixture of [U-13C6]glucose and unlabeled glucose. It will be shown that the sensitivity of this technique is substantially better as compared with the single-labeled precursor technique. A shake flask culture of P. blakesleeanus (300 ml) was supplied with 6 g of [1-13C]glucose (99.5% enrichment). The culture was incubated for 6 days. Gallic acid (5 mg) was isolated from the culture fluid and from the cell hydrolysate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phenylalanine (3 mg), tyrosine (4 mg), and tryptophan (2 mg) were obtained by hydrolysis of cell mass (8 g, wet weight). The absolute 13C abundance of all carbon atoms of gallic acid (compound 7), phenylalanine (compound 5), tyrosine (compound 10), and tryptophan (compound11, Fig. 2) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). Due to the symmetry of the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tyrosine and gallic acid, the respective ring carbon atoms 2/6 and 3/5 yield only an averaged 13C abundance value, although they have different biosynthetic origins (C-4 of erythrose 4-phosphate/C-3 of phosphoenolpyruvate and C-1/C-3 of erythrose 4-phosphate, respectively). Tryptophan reflects the original, i.e. nonsymmetrical, labeling patterns of the shikimate ring system, and the labeling pattern of erythrose 4-phosphate (compound 2) can thus be reconstructed by a retrobiosynthetic approach on basis of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 2). The labeling pattern of phosphoenolpyruvate (compound 1) can be deduced unequivocally from the labeling pattern of the side chains of phenylalanine and tyrosine (Fig. 2). The observed labeling patterns are explained on basis of carbohydrate metabolic pathway. Label from [1-13C]glucose is diverted to C-3 of triose phosphate type metabolites by the glycolytic pathway (compounds 14 and 15, Fig.3). This results in the high13C enrichment of the β position of phenylalanine and tyrosine reflecting C-3 of phosphoenolpyruvate (23.4% 13C abundance, Fig. 2). Decarboxylation of [1-13C]glucose 6-phosphate by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway yields 13CO2 and unlabeled ribulose 5-phosphate (compound 13, Fig. 3). Erythrose 4-phosphate (compound2) generated from the unlabeled ribulose 5-phosphate via the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway should be devoid of13C label. However, the observed 13C labeling in the 4-position of erythrose 4-phosphate (18.5% 13C abundance) can be explained by futile cycling via the glycolytic/glucogenetic pathways and/or via the mannitol pathway (Fig.3). Specifically, regeneration of glucose from triose phosphate isomerase could divert 13C label to the 6-position of glucose. Similarly, the reversible conversion of glucose to mannitol (compound 16) could also divert label to the 6-position of glucose. The resulting [6-13C]glucose 6-phosphate could then be converted to [4-13C]erythrose 4-phosphate via the pentose phosphate pathway with or without contribution of oxidative decarboxylation. The observed labeling in C-4 of erythrose 4-phosphate indicates that at least two-thirds of exogenous glucose is distributed to the cellular hexose phosphate pool by futile glycolytic and/or mannitol cycling. The labeling pattern of the benzenoid ring of gallic acid (compound7) agrees closely with the ring labeling of phenylalanine (compound 5) and tyrosine (compound10, Fig. 2). The carboxylic group of gallic acid has less13C abundance (2.9%) whereas the β carbon atoms of tyrosine or phenylalanine are highly labeled (23.4%). It follows that the carboxylic group is not derived from the β carbon of phenylalanine or tyrosine. As shown in Fig. 1, the carboxylic atom of early shikimate precursors (e.g. 5-dehydroshikimate, compound 4) stems from C-1 of phosphoenolpyruvate (compound 1) which is virtually not labeled from [1-13C]glucose (Fig. 2). Thus, a direct conversion of 5-dehydroshikimate to gallic acid would be in line with the experimental data. Attempts to use the same experimental approach for the study of gallic acid biosynthesis in leaves of the tree, R. typhina, were unsuccessful. The amount of 13C-label diverted to gallic acid and phenylalanine was so low (less than 2% 13C abundance in the most highly labeled carbon atoms) that it was impossible to draw firm conclusions. This is due to the fact that exogenous glucose supplied to the intact leaves via the leaf stem is poorly metabolized, and the NMR spectra are dominated by the natural13C abundance of metabolites, which were formed prior to glucose application. A much more sensitive technique was therefore required. As shown below, the sensitivity problem can be overcome by the use of a mixture of [U-13C6]glucose and unlabeled glucose. This experimental approach will be described first with the fungal culture and then with plant material. A shake flask culture of P. blakesleeanus was supplied with a mixture of [U-13C6]glucose and unlabeled glucose at a ratio of 1:25. The NMR signals of metabolites isolated from this culture are complex multiplets as a consequence of13C13C coupling (Figs.4 and 5). To resolve these multiplets, it was important to obtain a spectral resolution of at least 0.5 Hz. The central signals marked by asterisks represent molecules with a single 13C atom, which were formed from the natural abundance material in the proffered glucose mixture. The complex satellites indicate the presence of various isotopomers that reflect biosynthetic contributions of the totally labeled glucose. A detailed analysis of the spectra indicates that the biosynthetic products are complex mixtures of different isotopomers.Figure 51 H decoupled 13C NMR signals of gallic acid from P. blakesleeanus after incorporation of [U-13C6]glucose diluted with unlabeled glucose (1:25, w/w).

As shown in Fig. 4, the chemical shift positions as well as amplitude modulations due to higher order coupling show perfect agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra. It should be noted that the lack of symmetry of the coupling with respect to the signal of the single-labeled isotopomers is due to nonlinear coupling patterns and to chemical shift variations caused by heavy isotope shift effects. The heavy isotope shifts of individual nuclei in specific isotopomers as deduced from comparison of experimental signals with spectral simulations are summarized in Fig.6. The various isotopomers in the biolabeled mixture are symbolized by bold lines, indicating multiple contiguous carbon atoms. A single adjacent 13C atom typically results in a high field shift in the range of 2 Hz; two adjacent 13C atoms are conducive to a high field shift of the observed carbon in the range of 4 Hz. Single bond and multiple bond 13C13C coupling constants are also summarized in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the chemical shift degeneracy of the ring carbon atoms 3 and 5 is broken by the heavy isotope shift in isotopomer d (Fig. 6) where C-3 has a heavy isotope shift of −4.9 Hz and C-5 has a heavy isotope shift of −2.0 Hz. This results in higher order coupling between C-3 and C-5 which are no longer homotopic. Only the coupling patterns without the actual simulations are shown in Fig. 5. However, it should be noted that the intensity modulations due to higher order coupling contributions are again faithfully reflected by the simulated data. The fraction of each isotopomer in the mixture can be obtained by integration of the signal groups representing each individual isotopomer. Some isotopomers can be estimated from different spectral patterns. Thus, the abundance of isotopomer d can be diagnosed independently from the signatures of C-2, C-3, and C-4. The quantitative data obtained independently from different parts of the spectrum are in very good agreement. The isotopomer composition of the biosynthetic gallic acid (compound7) is summarized in Fig. 7. The quantitative contribution of each isotopomer is indicated by the width of the line connecting contiguous 13C atoms and also by numbers which indicate relative concentrations (mol %) of individual isotopomers. Isotopomer d indicates that approximately one-third of the erythrose 4-phosphate pool is formed via the pentose phosphate shunt or mannitol cycling (Fig. 3). Isotopomer e indicates that approximately two-thirds of the erythrose 4-phosphate pool is synthesized via futile cycling of the hexose phosphate pool. This is in line with the erythrose 4-phosphate labeling pattern from [1-13C]glucose (see above). The complex multiplets of biosynthetic tyrosine (compound10) obtained from the biomass grown on the mixtures of [U-13C6]glucose and unlabeled glucose was analyzed by the same approach. The isotopomer composition is again summarized in Fig. 7. It is immediately obvious that the isotopomer signatures of the benzene rings are closely similar in gallic acid and tyrosine. This is a conclusive proof for the origin of gallic acid from the shikimate pathway. Virtually no isotopomers with contiguous 13C atoms in ring atom C-1 and the β carbon of the side chain are present in the amino acid. The conspicuous absence of this isotopomer type reflects the assembly of the amino acid from the ring atoms of shikimate and the side chain contributed by a second molecule, i.e. phosphoenolpyruvate. On the other hand, the isotopomer composition of gallic acid is dominated by the [carboxyl-1,6-13C3]isotopomer b (Fig. 7). If gallic acid were derived from phenylalanine or tyrosine by subsequent cleavage of the side chain, the presence of this isotopomer could not be explained. It follows again that gallic acid is not formed via phenylalanine or tyrosine in the fungus. Initial experiments mentioned above had shown that the incorporation of [1-13C]glucose in leaves of R. thyphina is low. The poor utilization of exogenous nutrients had also hampered earlier studies in the literature and is probably the major reason for the conflicting reports on gallic acid biosynthesis. The preliminary experiments with fungal cultures indicated that the sensitivity problem could be addressed by the use of totally labeled glucose conducing to the formation of multiply labeled isotopomers. The signal contributions of the multiply labeled isotopomers are spread out in the frequency domain by 13C13C coupling and are thus separated from the signals of molecules representing the high background of preformed gallic acid with natural 13C abundance. A large number of preliminary experiments were required to find experimental conditions affording appropriate transfer of13C from exogenous glucose into the plant system. Variations in the experimental set-up concerned (i) the age of the plant tissue used as judged by the size of the leaves and the degree of unfolding, (ii) the conditions of incubation, (iii) the length of the feeding period, and (iv) the 13C abundance in the glucose used as supplement. These experiments will be described in some detail because similar considerations may be relevant in the context of other incorporation experiments with higher plants. (i) It was important to utilize very young leaves since the utilization of exogenous glucose decreased rapidly with increasing age and maturation of the tissue. (ii) Standardized conditions of temperature and humidity had to be maintained to extend the lifetime of the plant tissue as much as possible. We found 18 °C and 60% relatively humidity most appropriate for R. typhina leaves. Incubation in the dark resulted in higher 13C incorporation rates as compared with permanent or intermittent light. (iii) Both the utilization of glucose in R. typhina, and the biosynthetic capacity of the plant material after removal from the mother plant was relatively poor. It was therefore to extend the feeding period as much as possible. With appropriate care to minimize microbial growth, the leaves could be kept for more than 1 month. (iv) The most crucial feature is the labeling pattern of the precursor material. Using single 13C-labeled glucose the maximum 13C enrichment values observed in any metabolite studied was always less than 2% in these experiments. On the background of 1.1% natural 13C abundance, these small enrichment increments contributed by the 13C labeled precursor could not be evaluated with sufficient accuracy. Thus, the strategy with single-labeled glucose had to be abandoned. Subsequent experiments were performed with [U-13C6]-, [1,2-13C2]-, and [2,3-13C2]glucose with 99% enrichment. Whereas the overall enrichment of metabolites was again low (<2%13C), the incorporation of the precursors could be conclusively demonstrated by the presence of13C13C coupling satellites in the spectra of gallic acid and amino acids. Actually, in the experiment with [U-13C6]glucose,13C13C coupling was extensive throughout the molecules analyzed. In light of the low enrichment of the metabolites formed, this presented a paradox. In retrospect, it is now clear that the cut leaves retained little biosynthetic capacity, irrespective of the incubation conditions. The vast majority of the isolated metabolites had already been synthesized prior to the feeding experiments. On the other hand, the system had been flooded with the labeled precursor, and this had resulted in the assembly of three13C-labeled precursor molecules for formation of phenylalanine. Thus, less than 1% of the total gallic acid had been synthesized from the labeled precursor during the incubation period but the small amount of newly formed gallic acid was produced almost exclusively from exogenous glucose. On basis of these initial data, we performed an optimized experiment with 150 young leaves of R. typhina (60 g) which were supplied with a solution (300 ml) containing 250 mg of [U-13C6]glucose and 6 g of natural abundance glucose. Gallic acid (50 mg) and amino acids were isolated by the standard procedure, and high resolution NMR spectra of gallic acid and tyrosine were recorded. The complex 13C NMR signals of the carboxylic carbon and ring atom C-1 of gallic acid are shown in Fig. 8. In contrast to the experiments with the fungal cultures (Figs. 4 and 5), the relative intensity of the coupling patterns is low as compared with the contribution of isotopomers carrying a single 13C atom (marked by asterisks), which represent the contribution of natural abundance gallic acid. The large fraction of natural abundance material essentially represents gallic acid which had already been present at the beginning of glucose application, whereas a minor amount was contributed biosynthetically from unlabeled glucose in the feeding mixture. Fig. 8 also shows the carboxyl- and C-1 13C NMR signals of natural abundance gallic acid. The asterisks mark the signals of the [carboxyl-13C1]- and [1-13C1]gallic acid. The plots were arranged to give identical amplitudes for the (truncated) signals of the biosynthetic sample and the natural abundance sample. The stochastic 13C distribution in the natural abundance sample is conducive to a signal equivalent of 1.1% of the central signal for isotopomers with two adjacent 13C atoms (such as [1,2-13C2]-, and [carboxyl-1-13C2]gallic acid). These signals are readily observed in the natural abundance sample. The stochastic contribution of isotopomers with 3 and 4 adjacent carbon atoms in natural abundance material is approximately 10−4and 10−6 mol %, respectively. The relative abundances of these species are therefore far below the level of detection in the natural abundance gallic acid. On the other hand, signals pertaining to multiply labeled isotopomers are apparent in the biosynthetic sample and can be identified unequivocally on basis of the isotopomer deconvolution which has been described above (Fig. 8). A quantitative analysis of the biosynthetic gallic acid spectra yields the isotopomer composition shown in Fig.9. The abundance of isotopomers with 2 and more adjacent 13C isotopomers was referenced to the satellites for the various [13C2]isotopomers in the natural abundance sample. The natural abundance background was then subtracted from the labeled sample, thus affording exclusively the composition of the material which was biosynthesized de novo from the proffered [U-13C6]glucose. The isotopomer composition of biosynthetic tyrosine was determined by the same experimental approach and is also shown in Fig. 9. The isotopomer patterns of the aromatic rings of biosynthetic gallic acid and tyrosine are similar and leave no doubt that the aromatic rings of both compounds originate from the same (i.e. the shikimate) pathway. Gallic acid shows a significant amount of the triple-labeled [carboxyl-1,6-13C3]isotopomer in close analogy with the Phycomyces experiment. This isotopomer has no equivalent in tyrosine where the abundance of the [β,1,2-13C3] is low in accordance with the expectations based on the shikimate pathway. In analogy with the Phycomyces experiment, it can be concluded that phenylalanine and tyrosine do not serve as major intermediates in the gallic acid biosynthetic pathway. Feeding with totally 13C-labeled fundamental precursors such as [U-13C]carbohydrates or [U-13C]lipid in conjunction with unlabeled material is conducive to biosynthetic formation of complex isotopomer mixtures. In earlier studies, we used two-dimensional NMR techniques to characterize multiply 13C-labeled isotopomers (24Eisenreich W. Menhard B. Hylands P.J. Zenk M.H. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6431-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Eisenreich W. Kupfer E. Weber W. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 867-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, this approach would have been difficult for reasons of sensitivity because the incorporation of glucose by leaves of R. typhina was low. However, we have shown that an even more detailed analysis of isotopomer mixture is possible by an in depth analysis of coupling multiplets in one-dimensional 13C spectra. For this approach, it is important to obtain NMR spectra at high magnetic field strength to maximize the chemical shift dispersion. Moreover, it is important to work at the maximum obtainable resolution (better than 0.5 Hz) to maximize sensitivity and to minimize overlapping of lines. Integrals of each component of the complex signals can then be determined easily. Typically, the NMR signatures of an individual carbon atom will arise by the 13C coupling multiplets of several different isotopomers as shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 8. The intuitive deconvolution of the complex multiplet superpositions is possible only in the most simple cases. Complex patterns require a stringent analysis by numerical simulation of the spectra for each contributing isotopomer. As part of the deconvolution process, it is necessary to determine the heavy isotope shift effects and the coupling constants for each isotopomer from the complex spectra. It should be noted that molecular symmetries conducive to homotopy of nuclei can be broken by heavy isotope shift effects, and unexpected coupling patterns of higher order can result. Whereas this process is laborious, it has the advantage to yield quantitative data for each isotopomer in the mixture. This isotopomer pattern can then be used efficiently for biosynthetic retroanalysis via comparison of isotopomer distribution patterns in different metabolites. For example, the comparison of isotopomer patterns of the benzenoid ring of gallic acid with those of phenylalanine and tyrosine leave no doubt whatsoever that gallic acid is a derivative of the shikimate pathway. The experimental sensitivity of biosynthetic studies with single-labeled 13C precursors is limited by the inherent sensitivity of NMR instrumentation, and, more important, by the presence of natural abundance material in the numerous cases where the de novo formation of metabolites from the proffered, isotopocally labeled precursor is low. The use of multiply labeled precursors and the subsequent, quantitative NMR assessment of biosynthetic isotopomers with multiple labels affords a large gain in experimental sensitivity because the relevant signals are separated from the natural abundance component via spreading in the frequency domain by 13C13C coupling. As mentioned above, the stochastic abundance of multiply labeled isotopomers in natural abundance material is very low (approximately 10−4 mol % for triple-labeled and 10−6 mol % for quadruple-labeled species). As a consequence, any observed signals of triple- and quadruple-labeled isotopomers can be unequivocally addressed as the result of de novo biosynthesis from the multiply labeled precursor. In the biosynthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine, two molecules of phosphoenolpyruvate are consumed for the biosynthesis of part of the ring system (i.e. C-6 and C-1) via shikimate and of the side chain via the enoylpyruvate side chain of chorismate. It is therefore surprising that the isotope contribution of [U-13C6]glucose to the side chain of tyrosine in R. typhina exceeds the level of 13C-labeling in the ring (specifically, the [1,6-13C2]isotopomer) by a factor of about 2. Earlier studies had shown that plant tissues can contain substantial amounts of shikimate pathway intermediates such as shikimate and quinate (26Gilchrist D.G. Kosuge T. Miflin B.J. The Biochemistry of Plants. 5. Academic Press, New York1980: 507-531Google Scholar). We conclude from the labeling data that preformed early shikimate derivates were converted to chorismate and further to tyrosine during the [13C]glucose feeding period. This would result in the formation of the aromatic amino acid from a preformed ring system at natural 13C abundance by the addition of a enoylpyruvate side chain derived from the proffered13C-labeled glucose mixture. The data in this report show clearly that gallic acid is formed predominantly or entirely from an early intermediate (i.e. prior to prephenic or arogenic acid) of the shikimate pathway. Several authors have proposed that two different pathways, via an early shikimate intermediate and via one of the aromatic amino acid could be operative in the same organism (5Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1964; 19b: 83-84Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Ishikura N. Hayashida S. Tazaki K. Bot. Mag. 1984; 97: 355-367Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Saijo R. Agric. Biol.

Biokhimiya. 1968; 33: 383-386PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, it has been claimed that gallic acid is predominantly formed via dehydrogenation of shikimate in young leaves of Rhus succedanea, but via phenylalanine in older leaves of R. succedanea (17Ishikura N. Hayashida S. Tazaki K. Bot. Mag. 1984; 97: 355-367Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our data show that a biosynthetic pathway via phenylalanine could have contributed less than 2% of biosynthesized gallic acid in the experiments with P. blakesleeanus and less than 10% in the experiments with R. typhina leaves. The biosynthesis of gallic acid (compound 7, Fig.10) by dehydrogenation of 5-dehydroshikimic acid (compound 4) in both the fungus and the plant appears to be the major pathway. However, the data cannot exclude a pathway via protocatechuic acid (compound 6) by dehydration of 5-dehydroshikimic acid followed by a monooxygenase catalyzed reaction (Fig. 10) (4Kato N. Shiroya M. Yoshida S. Hasegawa M. Shokubutsugaku Zasshi. 1968; 81: 506-507Crossref Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, a conversion of 5-dehydroshikimic acid to protocatechuic acid has been observed with crude enzyme preparations from mung bean seedlings (16Tateoka T.N. Bot. Mag. 1968; 81: 103-104Crossref Google Scholar). Experiments to distinguish between the two possible routes are in progress. We gratefully acknowledge the expert help of A. Kohnle and F.

In this study, we directly compared the effect of ligand binding to exosites 1 and 2 on the structure and function of the active site of thrombin and investigated functional linkage between the two exosites. Binding studies were performed in solution with fluorescein-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (FPR)-thrombin. Hirudin-(54–65) and sF2, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 63–116 of prothrombin fragment 2, were used as ligands for exosites 1 and 2 of thrombin, respectively. The two ligands produce diametric changes in the fluorescence of fluorescein-FPR-thrombin and also have opposing effects on the rate of thrombin hydrolysis of a number of chromogenic substrates. These results indicate that sF2 and hirudin-(54–65) differentially affect the conformation of the active site. Experiments then were performed to investigate whether both ligands can bind to thrombin simultaneously. When thrombin-bound fluorescein-sF2 is titrated with hirudin-(54–65), complete displacement of fluorescein-sF2 is observed. Likewise, when thrombin-bound fluorescein-hirudin-(54–65) is titrated with sF2, complete displacement occurs. Additional support for reciprocal binding was obtained in fluorescence experiments where both probes were labeled and in experiments monitoring ligand binding to agarose-immobilized thrombin. This mutually exclusive binding of either ligand can be explained by reciprocal, allosteric modulation of ligand affinity between the two exosites. Thus, not only do the two exosites differentially influence the active site, they also affect the binding properties of the opposing exosite.

Thrombin is a trypsin-like enzyme that plays a major role in hemostasis by regulating the procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic pathways (1Mann K.G. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). These regions, termed anion binding exosites 1 and 2, contribute to the specificity of thrombin by serving as binding sites for substrates, cofactors, and other ligands that modulate thrombin activity (4Stubbs M.T.

The docking interaction at exosite 1, used by both substrates and inhibitors, precedes the reaction at the active site. The importance of exosite 1 is demonstrated by the reduced reactivity of γ-thrombin, a proteolytic derivative of thrombin lacking exosite 1, with fibrinogen, hirudin, and heparin cofactor II (9Church F.C.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second role of exosite 1, revealed by crystallographic and fluorescence studies with hirudin or thrombomodulin, is to confer structural changes in the active site environment that facilitate subsequent binding interactions (11Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15375-15383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of hirudin, this serves to optimize alignment of the amino-terminal inhibitory domain with the active site of thrombin (11Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,15Jackman M.P. Parry M.A.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. J. Biol.

With thrombomodulin, the allosteric changes serve to alter the substrate specificity of thrombin. This converts thrombin from a procoagulant to a potent anticoagulant enzyme by virtue of its ability to activate protein C (17Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, exosite 1 serves both as a substrate/inhibitor binding site and an allosteric regulatory site. Exosite 2, which has a stronger positive electrostatic field than exosite 1, is known mainly as a glycosaminoglycan binding site (3Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 16Karshikov A.J. Bode W. Tulinsky A. Stone S.R.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin also binds exosite 2, thereby increasing the affinity of the interaction (13Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ye J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2373-2379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Liu L.-W.

In addition to binding glycosaminoglycans, exosite 2, together with exosite 1, appears to be important in the interaction of thrombin with factors V and VIII, key cofactors in coagulation (21Esmon C.T.

Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.-P. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This interaction induces conformational changes at the active site, influences the regulation of thrombin activity by calcium, and reduces the rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin (20Liu L.-W.

Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like exosite 1, therefore, ligand binding to exosite 2 also can induce allosteric changes in the active site that modulate thrombin activity. The allosteric changes evoked by ligand binding to exosite 1 or 2 may affect different regions of the active site. Binding to exosite 1 is thought to influence the autolysis loop near the south rim of the active site, whereas residues within exosite 2 form part of the S2 subsite of the substrate binding cleft (3Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 4Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that ligand binding to one exosite may elicit different effects on the structure and function of the active site than ligand binding to the other exosite. In addition to their effects on the active site, ligand binding to one exosite may also alter the affinity of the opposing exosite for its ligands. To explore these possibilities we used a synthetic peptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal half of human F2 as a ligand for exosite 2 (sF2) and a synthetic peptide analogue of the carboxyl terminus of hirudin (hirudin-(54–65)) as a ligand for exosite 1. Herein we report that ligand binding to one exosite directly influences the binding properties of the other, revealing an allosteric linkage between the two regulatory sites on thrombin. We also demonstrate that the two ligands have very different effects on the structure and function of the active site. Tyr63-sulfated and non-acetylated hirudin-(54–65), non-sulfated and non-acetylated hirudin-(54–65), streptavidin-agarose, benzamidine-agarose, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg ρ-nitroaniline (tGPR-pNA) were from Sigma.

(Eugene, OR). Methoxycarbonyl-d-norleucyl-Gly-Arg ρ-nitroanilide (Chromozyme (Chz)-Xa) and N-methylsulfonyl-d-Phe-Gly-Arg ρ-nitroanilide (Chz-tPA) were from Boehringer Mannheim Canada (Laval, Quebec).

Sephadex G-10 and sulfopropyl C-50 were from Pharmacia Biotech (Baie D'Urfé, Quebec). Phosphatidylcholine (75%):phosphatidylserine (25%) vesicles, prepared as described (26Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), were a kind gift of Dr. M. Nesheim (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario). Na125I was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Non-sulfated, non-acetylated hirudin-(54–65), radiolabeled using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) as described (27Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), had a specific radioactivity of 25,400 cpm/μg. Thrombin (1–3 mg/ml) was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of FPRCK or fluorescein-FPRCK at 23 °C. After 15 min, the residual chromogenic activity of 200 nm FPR-thrombin with 0.2 mm tGPR-pNA was determined. Additional equimolar aliquots were added until no chromogenic activity was detected. The sample was dialyzed against 500 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) at 4 °C, with three changes of buffer over 18 h. After dialysis, the sample was recovered and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 2 min. The concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance using ε0.1%280 of 1.8 (28Church W.R. Ouellette L.A. Messier T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8384-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after correction for light scatter at 320 nm using the relationship A280corr =A 280 − 1.7 × A 320(26Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Residual chromogenic activity of 200 nm FPR-thrombin was monitored as above. In addition, the presence of residual FPRCK was determined by incubating 10 μl of 5–10 μm FPR-thrombin with 10 μl of 100 nm active thrombin for 10 min. The chromogenic activity with 0.2 mm tGPR-pNA was then compared with that of a control lacking FPR-thrombin. F2 was isolated as a product of a prothrombin activation reaction as described by Stevens and Nesheim (29Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Human prothrombin (20 mg) was activated in 20 ml of TBS containing 2 mmCaCl2, 23 μmphosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine, 4 nm factor Va, and 5 nm factor Xa. After 2 h the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 5 mm. The sample was diluted with an equal volume of H2O and applied to a sulfopropyl C-50 (5 ml) column to adsorb the thrombin. Unbound protein was applied to a benzamidine-agarose column (2 ml) to remove residual factor Xa and thrombin. The flow-through was made 1 μm in FPRCK and, after the addition of 0.025 volume of 20 × concentrated TBS, the sample was applied to a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column on an FPLC System (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After washing the sample with 20 ml of TBS, a 30-ml linear gradient from 150 to 500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and the A 280was determined. Typically, the elution profile demonstrated base-line separation of two peaks that were identified as prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 by comparison of their mobilities with molecular weight standards on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (20Liu L.-W. Rezaie A.R. Carson C.W. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11807-11812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two closely migrating bands were observed for F2. The concentration of F2 was determined using ε0.1%280 of 1.1 (28Church W.R. Ouellette L.A. Messier T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8384-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 54-amino acid peptide corresponding to residues 218–271 of human prothrombin (sF2) was synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes P/L (Victoria, Australia). Cys231 and Cys248 were replaced by Ser whereas Lys236 was changed to Gln, the residue present in bovine F2 (18Arni R.K. Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Wu T.-P. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A scrambled variant of sF2, retaining the original positions of the two Cys residues (Cys219 and Cys243), also was synthesized. Peptides were synthesized on polyethylene pins that had been radiation-grafted with hydroxyethylmethacrylic acid as described (31Bray A.M. Valerio R.M. DiPasquale A.J. Greig J. Maeji N.M. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The crude peptides were lyophilized after deprotection, cleaved from the solid support, and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. To cyclize the peptides, they were dissolved at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.05, 30% acetonitrile, covered in aluminum foil, mixed on an orbital shaker for 2 days at 23 °C, and then lyophilized. The cyclized peptides were purified by preparative reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptides displayed >90% purity by high pressure liquid chromatography and yielded the expected composition on quantitative amino acid analysis, and the identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Peptides were reconstituted in TBS to a concentration of about 10 mg/ml, and 1-μl aliquots of 1 n NaOH were added until a neutral pH was obtained. FITC labeling of sulfated hirudin-(54–65) was performed as described by Liu et al.(12Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). Rhodamine labeling of sulfated hirudin-(54–65) was performed similarly using tetramethylrhodamine-5-(and 6)-isothiocyanate. The labeled peptide was located by absorbance at 570 nm, and the concentration was determined using ε1 mm570 of 90 (Molecular Probes). The sF2 peptide, devoid of Lys residues, was labeled at the amino terminus with FITC. Five 4-μl aliquots of 10 mg/ml FITC in dry Me2SO were added to 0.5 mg of sF2 in 300 μl of 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.5. The sample was kept in the dark for 4 h at room temperature prior to quenching the reaction with 15 μl of 1.0 m NH4Cl, pH 7.0. After fractionation on Sephadex G-10 (1 × 18 cm) and collecting 1-ml fractions, the fluorescent peptide was detected using a hand-held fluorescent lamp (302 nm). The concentration of the peptide was determined as described (12Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). One mg of sF2 in 300 μl of 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was labeled with mansyl by the addition of 20 μl of 50 mg/ml mansyl chloride in 60% methanol, 40% acetone. The reaction was left overnight and then fractionated as described above. The labeled peptide was located by A 324 and the concentration was determined using ε1 mm324 of 24 (Molecular Probes). A 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvette containing 100 nm fluorescein-sF2 in 2 ml of TBS was excited at 492 nm (5 nm slit) and continuously monitored at 522 nm (5 nm slit) in time drive using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. The contents of the cuvette were stirred with a micro stir bar and maintained at 25 °C using a circulating water bath. The fluorescence intensity (I) of 280 nmFPR-thrombin was measured before and after the addition of 2–5-μl aliquots of 92 μm F2 (containing 100 nmfluorescein-sF2), allowing the signal to stabilize prior to each addition. Titration was continued until there was no change in the sample I with subsequent additions. After the experiment, intensity values were read from the time drive profile.I/I o values were calculated and plotted versus the F2 concentration. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression of the binding isotherm Equation 1 (32Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IIo=α2×1+Kd+LPo−1+Kd+LPo2−4×LPo+1Equation 1 using TableCurve (Jandel, San Rafael, CA) to solve for α, the maximum fluorescence change, and K d, the dissociation constant, given L, the ligand concentration, and Po, the concentration of the target protein, and assuming a stoichiometry of 1. To compare the affinities of sF2 and hirudin-(54–65) for α- and γ-thrombin, fluorescein-FPR derivatives of the enzymes were used. For sF2 binding studies, 2 ml of 150 nm fluorescein-FPR α- or γ-thrombin was added to a 1 × 1-cm cuvette, and fluorescence was monitored as described above. The samples were then titrated with aliquots of a solution of 5 mm sF2 (containing 150 nm appropriate fluorescein-FPR-thrombin to prevent probe dilution). After the titration, the time drive profile was analyzed, and the binding parameters were determined as above. For hirudin-(54–65) binding, the fluorescein-FPR-thrombin concentration was 250 nm and the stock hirudin-(54–65) was 100 μm. Reciprocal exosite binding was investigated by observing the influence of increasing ligand occupation at one site on the amount of ligand bound at the other exosite. In the first case, the fluorescence of 10 nmfluorescein-hirudin-(54–65) was monitored before and after the addition of FPR-thrombin to 25 nm, and the sample was then titrated with 3.8 mm sF2 (containing 10 nmfluorescein-hirudin-(54–65)) and changes in fluorescence were monitored in time drive. The intensity values and the K d were determined as described above. In the second case, the fluorescence of 100 nm fluorescein-sF2 was monitored before and after the addition of FPR-thrombin to 280 nm, and the sample was then titrated with 100 μm hirudin-(54–65) (containing 100 nm fluorescein-sF2). Rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) and fluorescein-sF2 were used to monitor simultaneous binding to both exosites. A 2-ml sample containing 150 nm FPR-thrombin and 100 nmfluorescein-sF2 was titrated with 18.3 μmrhodamine-hirudin-(54–65). The fluorescein and rhodamine fluorescence of the sample was monitored at λex of 492 nm and λem of 522 nm for fluorescein and λex of 550 nm and λem of 575 nm for rhodamine at each step in the titration. A blank titration lacking FPR-thrombin was used to correct the data for spectral overlap of the two probes. The displacement of fluorescein-sF2 was quantified by analysis of the I/I o values as described above. Binding of rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) to thrombin was determined by calculating the difference in intensity of rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) in the absence and presence of FPR-thrombin, which was taken to represent the thrombin-bound fraction of rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65). Binding of both sF2 and hirudin-(54–65) was analyzed by nonlinear regression as described above. To graphically display displacement of fluorescein-sF2 by rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) titration, the amount of fluorescein-sF2 bound was converted to a percent of that initially bound to thrombin, prior to rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) addition. To display rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) binding, the amount bound was calculated as the percent of maximal rhodamine-hirudin-(54–65) binding at saturation. Ligand binding to immobilized thrombin was used to supplement the fluorescence studies. FITC-labeled peptides could not be used in these experiments because high salt concentrations needed in the final wash step influenced the fluorescence intensity. Instead, the effect of hirudin-(54–65) on sF2 binding to thrombin-agarose was assessed by first binding mansyl-sF2 to immobilized thrombin and then monitoring mansyl-sF2 fluorescence in the suspension supernatant as the sample was titrated with hirudin-(54–65). To accomplish this, the fluorescence of 500 μl of mansyl-sF2 was first determined (λex of 324 nm and λem of 463 nm). The material was then mixed with 40 μl of thrombin-agarose (∼2 μm) for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged for 2 min, the supernatant removed, and the agarose washed two times with TBS to remove unbound mansyl-sF2. The agarose pellet was suspended in 500 μl of TBS, re-centrifuged, and the I of the supernatant determined. The supernatant was returned to the tube containing thrombin-agarose and was then titrated with aliquots of hirudin-(54–65). The fluorescence of the supernatant was determined after each addition of hirudin-(54–65). At the end of the titration, NaCl was added to 2 m to observe the total amount of mansyl-sF2 that was bound to the thrombin-agarose. In the complementary experiment, the effect of sF2 on125I-hirudin-(54–65) binding to thrombin-agarose was assessed. To a 250-μl suspension of thrombin-agarose,125I-hirudin-(54–65) was added to 200 nm and the tube was mixed for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged for 2 min and the agarose washed two times with TBS. The agarose was suspended in 250 μl of TBS, and 50 μl of supernatant was counted in a γ-counter. The sample was returned to the suspension, and an aliquot of 25 mm fluorescein-sF2 was added. The process was repeated throughout the sF2 titration. The percent of125I-hirudin-(54–65) bound was calculated relative to the input hirudin-(54–65), and the K d was determined by nonlinear regression analysis as described above with the exception that the fraction of labeled ligand displaced was used in place of I/I o. The chromogenic activity of 20 nm thrombin in TBS was determined with 0.5 mmvarious thrombin substrates in the presence of 80 μm sF2 or 10 μm hirudin-(54–65). The rates of substrate hydrolysis, in A 405/min, were determined and related to the activities of thrombin in the absence of hirudin-(54–65) or sF2. To monitor binding interactions at exosite 2, we prepared a synthetic peptide corresponding to a portion of F2. The 54-amino acid peptide (sF2) is derived from residues 218 to 271 of human prothrombin (residues 63–116 of F2) in which the Cys219-Cys243 disulfide bond is maintained, whereas Cys231 and Cys248 have been replaced by Ser. In addition, Lys236 is changed to Gln, the residue found in bovine F2, to facilitate specific FITC labeling at the amino terminus. This peptide corresponds to the inner kringle loop and the contiguous 23-residue acidic carboxyl-terminal connecting peptide of F2. To confirm its similarity to F2, binding studies were performed using a FITC derivative, fluorescein-sF2, and FPR-thrombin (Fig.1). Addition of FPR-thrombin to fluorescein-sF2 resulted in a 1.6 ± 0.2% increase (mean ± S.D. of six determinations) in fluorescence intensity (I). When the sample was then titrated with plasma-derived F2, the I returned to slightly beyond the base-line value corresponding to unbound fluorescein-sF2. This indicates that sF2 and plasma-derived F2 bind to the same site on thrombin. Analysis of fluorescein-sF2 displacement by F2 revealed a K d value of 6.8 μm, comparable to the value of 4 μm obtained in direct binding studies with F2 (not shown; see Ref. 24Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm the specificity of sF2 binding, FPR-thrombin was added to a FITC-labeled scrambled homologue of sF2, containing an intact disulfide bond. There was no change in fluorescence of fluorescein in the presence of FPR-thrombin suggesting that there was no binding of the scrambled homologue to thrombin. To assess interactions at exosite 1, FITC-hirudin-(54–65) was titrated with FPR-thrombin. The experiment yielded a K d value of 31 nm and I/I o value of 0.73 (not shown). When active thrombin was substituted for FPR-thrombin, indistinguishable results were obtained. These results are comparable to those obtained by Liu et al. (12Liu L.-W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar) for the binding of fluorescein-hirudin-(53–64) to active thrombin (K d of 96 nm,I/I o of 0.82). Therefore, the FITC derivative of hirudin-(54–65) is a suitable probe for monitoring binding to thrombin. Binding of unlabeled sF2 to fluorescein-FPR derivatives of α- or γ-thrombin was performed to identify the sF2 binding site on thrombin. SF2 binding to both α- and γ-fluorescein-FPR-thrombin was characterized by a saturable decrease in I (Fig.2 A), and K d values of 46 and 20 μm were calculated for sF2 i"
https://openalex.org/W1993999527,"A 1.7-kilobase pair segment from the conjugative transfer region of plasmid R388 DNA was cloned and sequenced. It contained trwD, a gene essential for plasmid R388 conjugation, for expression of the conjugative W-pilus and for sensitivity to phage PRD1. The deduced amino acid sequence of TrwD showed homology to the PulE/VirB11 superfamily of potential ATPases involved in various types of transport processes. A fusion of trwD with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) was constructed, and the resulting fusion protein was purified from overproducing bacteria. Factor Xa hydrolysis of GST-TrwD and further purification rendered TrwD protein with more than 95% purity. Antibodies raised against TrwD localized it both in the soluble fraction and in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. TrwD is probably a peripheral outer membrane protein because it could be solubilized by increasing salt concentration to 0.5 mNaCl in the lysis buffer. Both purified GST-TrwD and TrwD could hydrolize ATP. ATPase activity increased 2-fold in the presence of detergent-phospholipid mixed micelles. To study the importance of the nucleotide-binding site, Walker box A (GXXGXGK(T/S)), present in TrwD, the conserved lysine residue was replaced by glutamine. The mutant protein, expressed and purified under the same conditions as the wild type, did not exhibit ATPase activity. TrwD(K203Q) was not able to complement the mutation in trwD of the R388 mutant plasmid, suggesting the essentiality of the ATPase activity of the protein in the conjugative process.

Bacterial conjugation is a DNA transport process that takes place with outstanding efficiency via a multienzymatic mechanism. The initial step in conjugation is the specific cleavage at oriT and the formation of a multiprotein complex called relaxosome. This step is fairly well understood at the molecular level. However, the events that lead the processed DNA from the donor to the recipient cell remain poorly understood (1Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lanka E. Wilkins B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 141-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). More than ten proteins are required for this process. Several conjugation systems have been analyzed, and comparative studies of their respective gene sequences suggest a common molecular mechanism. Comparison among the individual proteins suggests that the PulE-like protein family is the one most widely spread among those implicated in the formation of the DNA transport complex (3Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This family consists of proteins containing potential nucleotide-binding sites, and its members play essential roles in various processes of macromolecular transport in Gram-negative bacteria (4Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this family include proteins implicated in the export of various enzymes, exemplified by PulE, required for pullulanase secretion in Klebsiella oxytoca (5Possot E. d'Enfert C. Reyss I. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and PilB, involved in pilus formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), as well as proteins implicated in DNA transport processes, like TrbB, essential in conjugative transfer of plasmid RP4 (6Motallebi-Veshareh M. Balzer D. Lanka E. Jagura-Burdzy G. Thomas C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), ComG1, an essential competence gene in Bacillus subtilis transformation (7Whitchurch C.B. Hobbs M. Livingston S.P. Krishnapillai V. Mattick J.S. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 101: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and VirB11, required for transport of T-DNA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens into plant cells (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The common feature of the PulE-like proteins is a well conserved, centrally located region of about 100 amino acids that contains a nucleotide-binding motif (5Possot E. d'Enfert C. Reyss I. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Its functional significance is not known, although it has been speculated that PulE, for example, might activate other proteins required for pullulanase secretion or else energize secretion via ATP hydrolysis (5Possot E. d'Enfert C. Reyss I. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PulE, PilB, XcpR, and VirB11 have all been mutated in the Walker box A. pilB Walker box mutants do not assemble pili and xcpR Walker box mutants are blocked in toxin A and lipase secretion (9Turner L. Lara J.C. Nunn D.N. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4962-4969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pulE Walker box mutants are blocked in pullulanase secretion in a reconstituted system in Escherichia coli (10Possot E. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and a mutant protein in Walker box for virB11 does not function in T-DNA transfer into plant cells (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Walker box A is essential to the biological activity of this protein family. Although these observations suggest that these are nucleotide-binding proteins, attempts to demonstrate ATP binding or ATPase activity in members of this protein family (such as VirB11, XcpR, or PulE) have failed in the past (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Turner L. Lara J.C. Nunn D.N. Lory S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4962-4969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Possot E. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that VirB11 did not exhibit autophosphorylation, ATPase, or ATP binding activity (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contrary to a previous report (11Christie P.J. Ward J.E. Gordon M.P. Nester E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 86: 9677-9681Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The gene trwD occurs in PILW (12.Bolland, S. (1991) Genes Implicados en la Producción del Pilus Conjugalivo del Plásmids R388. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cantabria, Spain.Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of TrwD indicates that it is a member of the PulE protein family, whereas various functional tests demonstrate that it is involved in the conjugative DNA transfer of plasmid R388 (12.Bolland, S. (1991) Genes Implicados en la Producción del Pilus Conjugalivo del Plásmids R388. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cantabria, Spain.Google Scholar). As for the other members of its family, the predicted primary structure of TrwD includes the potential nucleotide-binding site formed by the Walker A and B consensus motifs. In this paper, we describe the DNA sequence of trwD and the purification and biochemical characterization of the ATPase activity of the protein.DISCUSSIONBacterial conjugation involves the passage of a single-stranded DNA chain from a donor to a recipient bacterial cell. The molecular details of the mechanism of DNA transfer through membranes remain unknown despite active research (1Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid R388 constitutes a good model system for the analysis of DNA transport because it appears to be genetically simpler than other conjugative plasmids (15Bolland S. Llosa M. Avila P. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The R388 DNA sequence responsible for conjugative pilus synthesis and export has been completely sequenced and contains 10 open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of 10 essential proteins in R388 conjugation and pilus formation (12.Bolland, S. (1991) Genes Implicados en la Producción del Pilus Conjugalivo del Plásmids R388. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cantabria, Spain.Google Scholar). Of these, two proteins, TrwD and TrwK, contain potential NTP-binding motifs. As shown in Fig. 2, the range of proteins homologous to TrwD extend well outside the group of proteins involved in conjugation. Among the 10 proteins of plasmid R388 involved in pilus formation, TrwD is the one with the widest range of homologs, suggesting that it is playing a function that extends outside the conjugation ”world.“ Thus, it was considered of great interest to purify the protein and characterize its biochemical activities. Using a fusion vector system, we purified a GST-TrwD fusion protein from a soluble fraction of E. coli. In vivo GST-TrwD complemented a R388 trwD mutant to wild type transfer frequencies, indicating that it coded for a functional protein. The TrwD moiety was purified from the fusion protein.Although the PulE family, to which TrwD belongs, contains conserved NTP-binding motifs (10Possot E. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), no clear evidence of such binding or NTPase activity has been produced to date. In particular, previous publications on similar proteins failed to show ATPase or ATP binding activities (4Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and even disclaimed previous findings that attributed an ATPase activity to VirB11 (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, bacteria expressing mutant PulE-like proteins in Walker box A, jointly with their complete transport systems, were inactive for transfer, suggesting the essentiality of the NTP-binding domain. We carried out four unrelated types of experiments to show that an ATPase activity is catalyzed by protein TrwD. (i) TrwD possesses an essential ATP hydrolyzing activity. The corresponding fraction obtained from the vector-only control strain possessed no detectable ATPase activity (Fig. 5). (ii) An additional, high resolution ion exchange chomatographic step showed a quantitative correlation between the ATPase activity of individual fractions and their TrwD protein content. (iii) Anti-GST-TrwD purified antibodies specifically sequestered the protein and the ATPase activity into nonfilterable complexes. (iv) When the conserved lysine of Walker box A was changed to glutamine, the mutant TrwD was no longer able to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 5).The absence of activity was accompanied by loss of in vivo functionality. The properties of the TrwDK203Q protein confirmed that the ATPase activity was essential to the role of TrwD in plasmid R388 conjugation. The dominant character of the mutation (Table II) suggests that the mutant protein still interacts with one or more other components of the conjugation machinery in a way that hinders their activity. Alternatively, if TrwD was oligomeric, a mutant protein still capable of oligomerization would produce an inactive oligomer resulting in a dominant-negative phenotype.Why have previous workers failed to detect any ATPase activity in other members of the PulE-like family? The ATPase activity of TrwD is relatively weak when compared with the membrane-bound H+-ATPase or Na+,K+-ATPase of E. coli, and it may have been missed for this reason. The Km and V max values of TrwD were found to be similar to those previously reported for other well known ATPases in E. coli such as DnaK (37Zylicz M. LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6431-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and RecA (38Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity profile of TrwD in the range of pH from 5.5 to 10.0 was different from that obtained for DnaK (37Zylicz M. LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6431-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which appeared to be a recalcitrant contaminating ATPase in VirB11 purification (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility could be that some physiologically relevant inhibitor copurified with the TrwD-like proteins in earlier studies. Finally, it can be speculated that to activate their NTP-related activities, other members of the PulE family may need to interact with other protein(s) not present in overproducing bacteria that do not express complete systems. As shown in this work, such interactions, if existing, are not essential for TrwD to show a detectable ATPase activity.The observation of TrwD as localized in both the soluble fraction and outer membrane (Fig. 4) may be indicative of a peripheral association of the protein to that structure. The inner bacterial membrane is almost certainly impermeable to the peptide, and the latter must cross the bilayer through some specific, unidirectional mechanism. Our results differ from the proposed localization of VirB11 (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PulE (4Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were both located in the inner membrane. Because pSU4053 contains about 20 plasmid copies per cell, the observation of a significant amount of protein in the soluble fraction may be the result of overproduction and thus of little physiological significance. However, preliminary results in our laboratories showing different electrophoretic mobilities between the soluble and membrane-bound fractions suggest that this distribution could be caused by a molecular difference between both forms of TrwD. This possibility remains to be explored further. The yield of TrwD purification increases significantly in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. This is typical of peripheral or extrinsic membrane proteins and in our case indicates the release of the membrane-bound fraction. A related observation is the fact that ATPase activity is increased by pure detergent (at concentrations above critical micellar concentration values) or detergent-phospholipid micelles (Fig. 7) but not by phospholipids in bilayer form. This is suggestive of TrwD possessing hydrophobic patches on its surface, which would allow association to micelles or even a peripheral binding to bilayers (perhaps to intrinsic proteins in bilayers) but not insertion in the hydrophobic matrix of a membrane.As for the role of TrwD in DNA transfer, at present we may only speculate. However, some of the data presented in this paper may be significant in shedding light on the putative role of TrwD. The combined observations that the protein (i) is membrane-associated, (ii) possesses an ATPase activity that is essential for conjugation, and (iii) shows higher ATPase activity in amphiphilic environments are strongly suggestive of an involvement of TrwD in some form of energy-dependent export mechanism. In addition, the fact that the Walker box mutation K203Q has a dominant character is compatible with TrwD making part of a supramolecular complex. Further studies on TrwD and other R388 gene products will be helpful in testing the above hyphothesis.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility could be that some physiologically relevant inhibitor copurified with the TrwD-like proteins in earlier studies. Finally, it can be speculated that to activate their NTP-related activities, other members of the PulE family may need to interact with other protein(s) not present in overproducing bacteria that do not express complete systems. As shown in this work, such interactions, if existing, are not essential for TrwD to show a detectable ATPase activity.The observation of TrwD as localized in both the soluble fraction and outer membrane (Fig. 4) may be indicative of a peripheral association of the protein to that structure. The inner bacterial membrane is almost certainly impermeable to the peptide, and the latter must cross the bilayer through some specific, unidirectional mechanism. Our results differ from the proposed localization of VirB11 (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PulE (4Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were both located in the inner membrane. Because pSU4053 contains about 20 plasmid copies per cell, the observation of a significant amount of protein in the soluble fraction may be the result of overproduction and thus of little physiological significance. However, preliminary results in our laboratories showing different electrophoretic mobilities between the soluble and membrane-bound fractions suggest that this distribution could be caused by a molecular difference between both forms of TrwD. This possibility remains to be explored further. The yield of TrwD purification increases significantly in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. This is typical of peripheral or extrinsic membrane proteins and in our case indicates the release of the membrane-bound fraction. A related observation is the fact that ATPase activity is increased by pure detergent (at concentrations above critical micellar concentration values) or detergent-phospholipid micelles (Fig. 7) but not by phospholipids in bilayer form. This is suggestive of TrwD possessing hydrophobic patches on its surface, which would allow association to micelles or even a peripheral binding to bilayers (perhaps to intrinsic proteins in bilayers) but not insertion in the hydrophobic matrix of a membrane.As for the role of TrwD in DNA transfer, at present we may only speculate. However, some of the data presented in this paper may be significant in shedding light on the putative role of TrwD. The combined observations that the protein (i) is membrane-associated, (ii) possesses an ATPase activity that is essential for conjugation, and (iii) shows higher ATPase activity in amphiphilic environments are strongly suggestive of an involvement of TrwD in some form of energy-dependent export mechanism. In addition, the fact that the Walker box mutation K203Q has a dominant character is compatible with TrwD making part of a supramolecular complex. Further studies on TrwD and other R388 gene products will be helpful in testing the above hyphothesis. Bacterial conjugation involves the passage of a single-stranded DNA chain from a donor to a recipient bacterial cell. The molecular details of the mechanism of DNA transfer through membranes remain unknown despite active research (1Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 197-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid R388 constitutes a good model system for the analysis of DNA transport because it appears to be genetically simpler than other conjugative plasmids (15Bolland S. Llosa M. Avila P. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R388 DNA sequence responsible for conjugative pilus synthesis and export has been completely sequenced and contains 10 open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of 10 essential proteins in R388 conjugation and pilus formation (12.Bolland, S. (1991) Genes Implicados en la Producción del Pilus Conjugalivo del Plásmids R388. Ph.D. thesis, University of Cantabria, Spain.Google Scholar). Of these, two proteins, TrwD and TrwK, contain potential NTP-binding motifs. As shown in Fig. 2, the range of proteins homologous to TrwD extend well outside the group of proteins involved in conjugation. Among the 10 proteins of plasmid R388 involved in pilus formation, TrwD is the one with the widest range of homologs, suggesting that it is playing a function that extends outside the conjugation ”world.“ Thus, it was considered of great interest to purify the protein and characterize its biochemical activities. Using a fusion vector system, we purified a GST-TrwD fusion protein from a soluble fraction of E. coli. In vivo GST-TrwD complemented a R388 trwD mutant to wild type transfer frequencies, indicating that it coded for a functional protein. The TrwD moiety was purified from the fusion protein. Although the PulE family, to which TrwD belongs, contains conserved NTP-binding motifs (10Possot E. Pugsley A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), no clear evidence of such binding or NTPase activity has been produced to date. In particular, previous publications on similar proteins failed to show ATPase or ATP binding activities (4Pugsley A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and even disclaimed previous findings that attributed an ATPase activity to VirB11 (8Stephens K.M. Roush C. Nester E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, bacteria expressing mutant PulE-like proteins in Walker box A, jointly with their complete transport systems, were inactive for transfer, suggesting the essentiality of the NTP-binding domain. We carried out four unrelated types of experiments to show that an ATPase activity is catalyzed by protein TrwD. (i) TrwD possesses an essential ATP hydrolyzing activity. The corresponding fraction obtained from the vector-only control strain possessed no detectable ATPase activity (Fig. 5). (ii) An additional, high resolution ion exchange chomatographic step showed a quantitative correlation between the ATPase activity of individual fractions and their TrwD protein content. (iii) Anti-GST-TrwD purified antibodies specifically sequestered the protein and the ATPase activity into nonfilterable complexes. (iv) When the conserved lysine of Walker box A was changed to glutamine, the mutant TrwD was no longer able to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 5). The absence of activity was accompanied by loss of in vivo functionality. The properties of the TrwDK203Q protein confirmed that the ATPase activity was essential to the role of TrwD in plasmid R388 conjugation. The dominant character of the mutation (Table II) suggests that the mutant protein still interacts with one or more other components of the conjugation machinery in a way that hinders their activity. Alternatively, if TrwD was oligomeric, a mutant protein still capable of oligomerization would produce an inactive oligomer resulting in a dominant-negative phenotype. Why have previous workers failed to detect any ATPase activity in other members of the PulE-like family? The ATPase activity of TrwD is relatively weak when compared with the membrane-bound H+-ATPase or Na+,K+-ATPase of E. coli, and it may have been missed for this reason. The Km and V max values of TrwD were found to be similar to those previously reported for other well known ATPases in E. coli such as DnaK (37Zylicz M. LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6431-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and RecA (38Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol.

K., Fritz, T. A., Taylor, W. H., and Esko, J. D. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 3323–3327). We now report that another disaccharide, acetylated GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-naphthalenemethanol (GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM), has even greater potency and that both compounds will inhibit sialyl LewisX(sLex)-dependent cell adhesion. When fed to U937 cells, acetylated forms of Galβ1–4GlcNAc-NM and GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM primed oligosaccharides in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of compounds assembled on Galβ1–4GlcNAc-NM showed only one product, namely Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-NM. In contrast, GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM generated Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM, Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM, and NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM. Both compounds decreased the incorporation of [3H]fucose into cellular glycoconjugates, without affecting the incorporation of [3H]mannosamine, a precursor of sialic acid residues. Moreover, the overall extent of sialylation was not affected based on the reactivity of cells to fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Maackia amurensis lectin. Priming inhibited expression of sLex on cell surface glycoconjugates, which reduced E-selectin-dependent cell adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-α-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. GlcNAcβ1–3Gal-NM and Galβ1–4GlcNAc-NM represent starting points for making enzyme-specific, site-directed inhibitors of glycosyltransferases that could act in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030411275,"Contractile activity plays a critical role in the regulation of gene transcription in skeletal muscle, which in turn determines muscle functional capabilities. However, little is known about the molecular signaling mechanisms that convert contractile activity into gene regulatory responses in skeletal muscle. In the current study we determined the effects of contractile activity in vivo on the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, a signaling cascade that has been implicated in the regulation of transcription. Electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve to produce contractions in anaesthetized rats increased JNK activity by up to 7-fold above basal. Maximal enzyme activity occurred at 15 min of contraction and remained elevated at 60 min of contraction. The upstream activators of JNK, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 followed a similar time course of activation in response to contractile activity. In contrast, contraction induced a rapid and transient activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase pathway, indicating that the regulation of JNK signaling is distinct from that of extracellular-regulated kinase. The activation of the JNK signaling cascade was temporally associated with an increased expression of c-jun mRNA. These results demonstrate that contractile activity regulates JNK activity in skeletal muscle and suggest that activation of JNK may regulate contraction-induced gene expression in skeletal muscle.

The physiological consequences of these adaptations render the muscle resistant to fatigue during sustained contractile work. However, the molecular signaling mechanisms that convert skeletal muscle contractile activity into biochemical and gene regulatory responses are not known.

We recently reported that exercise activates the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) as well as other upstream and downstream components of the ERK signaling cascade, including the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, MEK1, and Raf-1 in human skeletal muscle (20Aronson D. Violan M. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present study we determined the effects of contractile activity on JNK signaling in vivo using a model of electrically stimulated rat skeletal muscle. We show that contractile activity stimulates JNK activity as well as the activity of its upstream regulators MEK4 and MEKK1 and that the activation of JNK signaling is temporally related to a rapid up-regulation of c-junmRNA expression. These results implicate the JNK pathway in the regulation of gene expression in response to contractile activity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 ± 10 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (75 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal). The sciatic nerves of both hind limbs were exposed, and electrodes were attached. Hind limb muscles were stimulated with one 500-ms train of impulses (each impulse was of 0.1 ms duration) at a frequency of 100 Hz applied every 1 s for 15 s or 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 min. When the stimulation period exceeded 5 min, each additional 5-min period was separated by 2 min of rest. Immediately after stimulation, the gastrocnemius muscle was rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. This muscle mainly represents fast-twitch red and white muscle fibers (21Ariano M.A. Armstrong R.B. Edgerton V.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 21: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). For the signaling studies, the muscles were powdered and then Polytron-homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble matter. Protein concentrations in the soluble extracts were estimated by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, total RNA was extracted from muscle using TRI reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. A PGEX vector designed to express a glutathione S-transferase (GST) c-Jun fusion protein (amino-terminal residues 1–135) was provided by Dr. John Kyriakis, Massachusetts General Hospital. GST-SEK1, GST-MEK1, GST-ERK1 were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-JNK1, anti-MEK4, and anti-MEKK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

(Beverly, MA); phospho-specific anti-ERK and anti-p55JNK were from Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc. (Hopkinton, MA); and protein A-agarose and protein G-agarose were from Pierce. Protein concentrations were determined using a dye reagent from Bio-Rad; and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Zeta-Probe blotting membranes were from Bio-Rad. A multiprime DNA labeling kit was from Amersham Life Science, Inc. Muscle proteins (300 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblotted with phospho-specific anti-ERK1/2, anti-p55JNK, or anti-MEK4. The filters were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500), and antibody binding was detected via the method of enhanced chemiluminescence. JNK immune-complex kinase assays were carried out as described by Kyriakis et al. (9Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.W.

Aliquots (250 μg) of precleared muscle extracts were immunoprecipitated with 1.0 μg of polyclonal anti-JNK1. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer, and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of GST-Jun-(1–135), 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated with Laemmli sample buffer. The reaction products were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was quantitated by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). MEK1 activity was assayed in an immune-complex kinase assay using GST-ERK as substrate, as described previously (20Aronson D. Violan M. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The MEK4 assay was essentially similar to the MEK1 assay, except that muscle extracts were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of anti-MEK4, and GST-JNK served as substrate. For the MEKK1 assay, 500 μg of muscle extracts were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-MEKK1. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and three times with MEKK1 buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μl of recombinant kinase-inactive GST-MEK4 as substrate. The reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Products were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated GST-MEK4 was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gels. Aliquots (10 μg) of total RNA per sample was denatured and size-separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose, 6.7% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane in 10 × standard sodium citrate (1 × SSC = 0.15m sodium chloride and 0.015 m sodium citrate). Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of the gels. RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane, and the blots were hybridized with a 1.8-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the rat c-jun cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to ∼109 dpm/mg using a multiprime DNA labeling kit. The membranes were washed stringently with the final wash in 0.5 SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. The blots were then quantitated by PhosphorImager. Activation of both JNK isoforms (46 and 55 kDa) requires dual phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 (23Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davies R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). To determine whether contraction increases JNK dual phosphorylation, we used a phospho-specific anti-p55JNK antibody that recognizes only the dual-phosphorylated form of the protein. Western blot analysis of muscle extracts showed that contractile activity increased the dual phosphorylation of the p55JNK (Fig.1 A). Densitometric analysis revealed that with 30 min of contraction, the dual phosphorylation of p55JNK increased by 2.2 ± 0.21-fold above basal (mean ± S.E.). JNKs are the only known protein kinases that efficiently phosphorylate Ser-63 and Ser-73 on the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun (9Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To directly determine whether contractile activity increases JNK activity toward its physiologic substrate c-Jun, immune complex kinase assays were performed using c-Jun-(1–135) as substrate. Contractile activity increased c-Jun phosphorylation in anti-JNK immune complexes from skeletal muscle by 5.2 ± 0.6-fold (mean ± S.E.) at the 30-min time point (Fig. 1 B). Taken together these results indicate that contractile activity increases the dual phosphorylation of JNK and that this event is associated with increased JNK activity. We next examined the time course of contraction-induced JNK activation. Contraction resulted in a time-dependent increase in JNK activity (Fig.2 A). JNK activation required 15 min to reach a maximum where the increase in JNK activity was 6.9 ± 2.0-fold above basal (Fig. 2 B). Thereafter, the activity of JNK decreased slightly but remained elevated with 30 and 60 min of contraction (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the time course of contraction-induced ERK activation, as determined by ERK1/2 dual phosphorylation, was transient (Fig.3 A). ERK1/2 phosphorylation reached maximal levels at 10 min and returned to near basal levels at 30 min (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Time dependent effect of contractile activity on ERK dual phosphorylation. A, muscle proteins (300 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The phosphorylation (P) of the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms was determined using phospho-specific antibodies that recognize only the dual-phosphorylated ERK1/2.

Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 10Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu T. Han I.-H. Ulevitch J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Although currently MEK4 is the only known upstream activator of JNK, studies in cells cultured from MEK4 knockout mice suggest that more than one pathway leading to JNK activation probably exists (25Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined if contractile activity stimulates MEK4 activity. Activation of MEK4 requires phosphorylation of Ser-220 and Thr-224 (7Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To determine the phosphorylation state of MEK4 in skeletal muscle, we used a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes MEK4 only when phosphorylated on Thr-224. As shown in Fig.4 A, this antibody recognizes a single 46-kDa band, which corresponds to the reported molecular mass of MEK4 (8Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The immunoblot in Fig. 4 A, shows that MEK4 phosphorylation increases with contractile activity in a similar temporal profile to that of its downstream substrate, JNK. We next determined if contraction increases MEK4 activity by an immune complex kinase assay using GST-JNK as substrate. Fig. 4, B and C depict the time course of contraction-induced MEK4 activation. Similar to JNK, MEK4 activity increased gradually and was sustained through the 60-min time course. MEK1 is a dual specificity kinase that parallels MEK4 in the ERK signaling pathway (26Wu J. Harrison J.K. Vincent L.A. Haystead C. Haystead T.A. Michel H. Hunt D.F. Lynch K.R. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 28Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed with ERK and JNK, the time course of MEK1 activation differed markedly from that of MEK4 (Fig. 4 versus Fig. 5). Maximal activation of MEK1 (3.9 ± 1.2-fold above basal) was observed at the earliest time point (15 s). This was followed by a rapid decline in MEK1 activity to basal levels (Fig. 4). These experiments demonstrate that the activation of the upstream elements of the ERK signaling pathway is extremely rapid once contractile activity commences. Although originally identified as an activator of the ERK pathway (29Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), MEKK1 appears to function upstream of MEK4 in the regulation of JNKs (7Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We measured MEKK1 activity in an immune complex assay using recombinant GST-MEK4 as substrate. MEKK1 activity was modestly stimulated in response to contractile activity (maximal stimulation of 1.9 ± 0.3-fold above basal) (Fig. 6). These results suggest that there may be an amplification of JNK signaling in skeletal muscle, consistent with observations in cells exposed to various cellular stresses (30Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The time course of MEKK1 stimulation with contractile activity was nearly superimposable with that of MEK4 and JNK (Fig. 6 B), indicating that MEKK1 is likely to be the activator of MEK4 in skeletal muscle during contractile activity. Furthermore, the discordant time courses of MEKK1 and MEK1 activities (Fig. 4 versus Fig. 5) suggest that MEKK1 is not the upstream activator of ERK signaling with contraction. JNKs phosphorylate two serine residues in the transactivation domain of c-Jun leading to an increase in its transcriptional activity (9Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 23Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davies R.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined if JNK activation by contractile activity is associated with an increase in c-jun mRNA levels. Northern blot analysis revealed that resting skeletal muscle has a low expression of c-junmRNA. However, as little as 15 min of contractile activity resulted in a 1.9 ± 0.1-fold increase in c-jun mRNA and remained at this level for the duration of the contraction protocol (Fig. 7). In addition, a 20-fold increase in c-fos mRNA occurred at the 15-min time point (data not shown). c-fos may be induced by either ERK (31Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) or JNK (15Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) phosphorylation of Elk-1, a known regulator of Fos transcription. These experiments demonstrate that contractile activity can induce a rapid increase in early response gene expression in skeletal muscle in a temporal pattern that corresponds to the activation of JNKs and ERKs. Skeletal muscles from adult mammalian species exhibit a remarkable capacity for long term adaptation to changing work demands (1Williams R.S. Neufer P.D. Dempsey J.A. Johnson J.M. Smith J.L. Terjung R. Wagner P.D. Handbook of Physiology Section 12; Exercise: Regulation and Integration of Multiple Systems. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 1124-1150Google Scholar, 2Booth F.W. Thomason R.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 75: 541-585Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The ability to respond to contractile activity through selective increases in gene expression and the synthesis of specific muscle proteins is critical for the functional adaptations of skeletal muscle cells. However, the mechanisms by which contractile activity is converted into gene regulatory events is not known. Several cell types have been shown to respond to various mechanical stimuli such as stretch (17Yamazaki T.I. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), shear stress (18Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and increased load (32Xu O. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Udelsman R. Holbrook N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) by activating protein kinase phosphorylation cascades. Our previous study has shown that a similar response occurs in human skeletal muscle, as physical exercise results in the activation of the ERK signaling cascade (20Aronson D. Violan M. Dufresne S.D. Zangen D. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that contractile activity in rat skeletal muscle potently stimulates JNK activity, as well as the upstream activators MEK4 and MEKK1. The stimulation of the JNK pathway by contractile activity was sustained throughout the time course studied. In contrast, contraction induced a rapid and transient activation of the ERK pathway, indicating that the regulation of JNK signaling is distinct from that of ERK. Studies in cultured cells have indicated that the duration of the activation of the ERK (33Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar) and JNK (34Chen Y.-R. Mayer C.F. Tse-Hua T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 35Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tse-Hua T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) pathways is critical for determining transcriptional and cellular responses. Whether the different time courses of contraction-induced ERK and JNK activation are important for the physiological response of skeletal muscle remains to be established. Interestingly, studies in other mechanically responsive cells have also shown differential time courses of ERK and JNK activation. For example, shear-induced ERK activation in endothelial cells is transient, reaching a maximum by 5 min and decreasing to basal levels by 30 min of shear exposure, whereas shear-stimulated JNK activation remained elevated for many hours (18Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These similarities imply that the fundamental cellular transduction mechanisms of mechanical stimuli may be conserved evolutionally and overlap between different cell types. The activation of JNK and ERK with contractile activity was associated with the rapid induction of c-jun and c-fos. This temporal relationship suggests a role for JNK and ERK as upstream regulators of early response genes in response to contractile activity. The induction of early response genes presumably represents transduction of early nuclear signals to long term changes in gene expression that constitute the cellular response to increased contractile activity. For example, c-jun and c-fos are involved in the induction of structural muscle proteins including skeletal α-actin (36Bishopric N.H. Jayasena V. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25535-25540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Paradis P. MacLellan W.R. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the JNK and ERK signaling pathway with contraction may represent an important mechanism for the conversion of mechanical stimuli into transcriptional responses in skeletal muscle. The JNK and ERK signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in the adaptation of cardiac myocytes to increased load (17Yamazaki T.I. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Komuro I. Kudo S. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Yazaki Y. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Emerging data indicate that a similar response occurs in arterial smooth muscle cells subjected to mechanical load (39Adam L.P. Franklin M.T. Raff G.J. Hathaway D.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 183-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or hypertension (32Xu O. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Udelsman R. Holbrook N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In both cell types, the stimulation of these pathways is associated with the induction of early response gene expression (19Komuro I. Kudo S. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Yazaki Y. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 32Xu O. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Udelsman R. Holbrook N.J. J. Clin.

Although the nature of the mechanical stimuli to which different muscle cell types are normally exposed differs considerably, these studies, together with our own data, suggest that the JNK and ERK cascades are a signaling mechanism shared by different muscle cell types to convert mechanical stimuli into early gene responses. In skeletal muscle, activation of these signaling pathways may be an initial signaling event that results in long term adaptations to increased muscle work."

We have previously shown that exposure of cells to H2O2 strongly activates Lck, a lymphocyte-specific Src family kinase, by inducing phosphorylation on Tyr-394, an absolutely conserved residue within the activation loop of the catalytic domain. Here we show that Lck that has been activated by H2O2 is simultaneously phosphorylated at both the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-505) and Tyr-394. Thus, dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 is not a prerequisite for either phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 or catalytic activation of the kinase. These results indicate that activation of Lck by phosphorylation of Tyr-394 is dominant over any inhibition induced by phosphorylation of Tyr-505. We propose that these results may be extended to all Src family members.

Tyr-505 (equivalent to Tyr-527 in c-Src) is located near the carboxyl terminus of Lck and, when phosphorylated, associates intramolecularly with the SH2 domain in the amino-terminal half of the protein. This helps stabilize Lck in a conformation that, biologically, is relatively inactive (16Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr-505, intramolecular binding of the carboxyl terminus to the SH2 domain does not occur, and Lck exhibits increased activity in vivo.

The increase in phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 that we observe in the presence of H2O2 may therefore result largely from reduced dephosphorylation of this site. Our previous work did not address the question of whether or not activation of Lck by H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-394 required dephosphorylation of Tyr-505. Thus, the extent to which the H2O2-activated population of Lck molecules was phosphorylated on Tyr-505 was unclear. Here we show that the population of Lck that is phosphorylated on Tyr-394 in response to H2O2 exposure is also phosphorylated at Tyr-505. Therefore, dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 and untethering of the SH2 domain is not a prerequisite for either phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394 or activation of the kinase by Tyr-394 phosphorylation. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr-394 positively regulates Lck activity and is dominant over any negative regulation induced by phosphorylation of Tyr-505.DISCUSSIONThe catalytic activity of Lck is greatly influenced by the phosphorylation state of Tyr-394 (22Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 38Shibuya H. Kohu K. Yamada K. Barsoumian E. Perlmutter R. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell.

Mutation of Tyr-394 to phenylalanine not only decreases Lck activity in unstimulated cells, but also prevents activation of Lck by oxidative stress. In addition, Lck that has been genetically activated by mutation of Tyr-505 to phenylalanine loses its transforming ability when Tyr-394 is also mutated to phenylalanine (21Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Caron L. Abraham N. Pawson T. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the extent of Tyr-505 phosphorylation in Lck from H2O2-stimulated cells was at least as great as that of Tyr-394. Thus, H2O2 activation appeared not to require Tyr-505 dephosphorylation. These observations suggested that Tyr-394 phosphorylation could override any negative regulation of Lck due to Tyr-505 phosphorylation. However, it was impossible to rule out the possibility that two differentially phosphorylated subpopulations of Lck existed in H2O2-stimulated cells, a relatively inactive population phosphorylated only on Tyr-505 and an activated population phosphorylated only on Tyr-394. Thus, it was formally possible that activation of Lck by Tyr-394 phosphorylation occurred only in the absence of phosphorylation of Tyr-505.Through the use of a phosphorylation state-specific antibody, we have now shown formally that Lck that is phosphorylated on Tyr-505 may be additionally phosphorylated on Tyr-394. If dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 were required for phosphorylation of Tyr-394, we would expect that Lck immunoprecipitated by α-Tyr(P)-416 sera would only be phosphorylated on Tyr-394. This was not seen. The observation that the Tyr(P)-505:Tyr(P)-394 ratio is approximately 1:1 suggests that the molecules phosphorylated on Tyr-394 are also phosphorylated on Tyr-505. Thus, the activating effects of Tyr-394 phosphorylation are dominant over the inhibitory effects of Tyr-505 phosphorylation. Apparently, even when Lck is in a “closed” conformation with Tyr(P)-505 bound to the SH2 domain and the SH3 domain bound to the polyproline type II helix in the linker region between the SH2 and catalytic domains (19Sicheri F.

Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-394 allows the formation of hydrogen bonds between Tyr(P)-394 and Arg-387 and Arg-363. These interactions appear to induce the repositioning of Glu-288, Leu-385, and Arg-387 (24Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and this in turn allows Lys-273, Glu-288, Asp-364, Asn-369, and Asp-382, residues critical to ATP binding and phosphate transfer, to assume positions characteristic of an active catalytic site (24Yamaguchi H.

Our data suggest that such repositioning of residues in the catalytic site of Lck can occur while the SH3 domain is still intramolecularly bound to the SH2-kinase linker region.Our results agree with data presented by others who showed that the Src tyrosine kinase retains activity when phosphorylated on Tyr-416 and Tyr-527 (41Boerner R.J.

Intermolecular phosphorylation of Tyr-394 may be carried out by Lck in vivo, but it is quite possible that other Src family members, or non-Src tyrosine kinases, may also act to phosphorylate Tyr-394 and activate Lck. Consistent with this second possibility is our finding that H2O2 stimulates the activity of an as yet unidentified tyrosine kinase in Lck-deficient JCaM1.6 cells that can phosphorylate Lck on Tyr-394.2Our results show that it is possible for the Src family member Lck to be phosphorylated at both the conserved tyrosine in the activation loop and the C-terminal tyrosine simultaneously. Because H2O2 activates Lck while inducing an increase of phosphorylation of both Tyr-394 and Tyr-505, these results suggest that Lck phosphorylated on Tyr-394 and Tyr-505 is catalytically activated. Thus, activation of Lck can occur in the absence of Tyr505 dephosphorylation or SH3 domain disassociation from the SH2-kinase linker. It is reasonable to predict that phosphorylation of the absolutely conserved tyrosine in the activation loop of other Src kinases will also activate them in the absence of dephosphorylation of the conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine. p56lck, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases (1Marth J.D.

Tyr-505 (equivalent to Tyr-527 in c-Src) is located near the carboxyl terminus of Lck and, when phosphorylated, associates intramolecularly with the SH2 domain in the amino-terminal half of the protein. This helps stabilize Lck in a conformation that, biologically, is relatively inactive (16Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr-505, intramolecular binding of the carboxyl terminus to the SH2 domain does not occur, and Lck exhibits increased activity in vivo.

A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 38Shibuya H. Kohu K. Yamada K. Barsoumian E. Perlmutter R. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5812-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Veillette A. Fournel M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1455-1462PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr-394 to phenylalanine not only decreases Lck activity in unstimulated cells, but also prevents activation of Lck by oxidative stress. In addition, Lck that has been genetically activated by mutation of Tyr-505 to phenylalanine loses its transforming ability when Tyr-394 is also mutated to phenylalanine (21Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Caron L. Abraham N. Pawson T. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2720-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the extent of Tyr-505 phosphorylation in Lck from H2O2-stimulated cells was at least as great as that of Tyr-394. Thus, H2O2 activation appeared not to require Tyr-505 dephosphorylation. These observations suggested that Tyr-394 phosphorylation could override any negative regulation of Lck due to Tyr-505 phosphorylation. However, it was impossible to rule out the possibility that two differentially phosphorylated subpopulations of Lck existed in H2O2-stimulated cells, a relatively inactive population phosphorylated only on Tyr-505 and an activated population phosphorylated only on Tyr-394. Thus, it was formally possible that activation of Lck by Tyr-394 phosphorylation occurred only in the absence of phosphorylation of Tyr-505. Through the use of a phosphorylation state-specific antibody, we have now shown formally that Lck that is phosphorylated on Tyr-505 may be additionally phosphorylated on Tyr-394. If dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 were required for phosphorylation of Tyr-394, we would expect that Lck immunoprecipitated by α-Tyr(P)-416 sera would only be phosphorylated on Tyr-394. This was not seen. The observation that the Tyr(P)-505:Tyr(P)-394 ratio is approximately 1:1 suggests that the molecules phosphorylated on Tyr-394 are also phosphorylated on Tyr-505. Thus, the activating effects of Tyr-394 phosphorylation are dominant over the inhibitory effects of Tyr-505 phosphorylation. Apparently, even when Lck is in a “closed” conformation with Tyr(P)-505 bound to the SH2 domain and the SH3 domain bound to the polyproline type II helix in the linker region between the SH2 and catalytic domains (19Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar,20Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), Tyr-394 is still accessible as a substrate for phosphorylation. Comparison of the crystal structure of Lck phosphorylated at Tyr-394 (24Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) with that of Src and Hck lacking phosphorylation at this site (19Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar,20Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-394 allows the formation of hydrogen bonds between Tyr(P)-394 and Arg-387 and Arg-363. These interactions appear to induce the repositioning of Glu-288, Leu-385, and Arg-387 (24Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and this in turn allows Lys-273, Glu-288, Asp-364, Asn-369, and Asp-382, residues critical to ATP binding and phosphate transfer, to assume positions characteristic of an active catalytic site (24Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 25Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that such repositioning of residues in the catalytic site of Lck can occur while the SH3 domain is still intramolecularly bound to the SH2-kinase linker region. Our results agree with data presented by others who showed that the Src tyrosine kinase retains activity when phosphorylated on Tyr-416 and Tyr-527 (41Boerner R.J. Kassel D.B. Barker S.C. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9519-9525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 3J. D. Bjorge and D. J. Fujita, personal communication. Previous work in our laboratory as well as kinetic data by other groups suggest that the activating phosphorylation of Tyr-394 in Src family members is an intermolecular event rather than intramolecular reaction (22Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,42Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). 4K. Pierno and B. M. Sefton, unpublished results. Intermolecular phosphorylation of Tyr-394 may be carried out by Lck in vivo, but it is quite possible that other Src family members, or non-Src tyrosine kinases, may also act to phosphorylate Tyr-394 and activate Lck. Consistent with this second possibility is our finding that H2O2 stimulates the activity of an as yet unidentified tyrosine kinase in Lck-deficient JCaM1.6 cells that can phosphorylate Lck on Tyr-394.2 Our results show that it is possible for the Src family member Lck to be phosphorylated at both the conserved tyrosine in the activation loop and the C-terminal tyrosine simultaneously. Because H2O2 activates Lck while inducing an increase of phosphorylation of both Tyr-394 and Tyr-505, these results suggest that Lck phosphorylated on Tyr-394 and Tyr-505 is catalytically activated. Thus, activation of Lck can occur in the absence of Tyr505 dephosphorylation or SH3 domain disassociation from the SH2-kinase linker. It is reasonable to predict that phosphorylation of the absolutely conserved tyrosine in the activation loop of other Src kinases will also activate them in the absence of dephosphorylation of the conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine. These experiments would not have been possible without the very generous gift of the α-Tyr(P)-416 serum from Dr. Michael Weber."
https://openalex.org/W2015025972,"Simultaneous binding of two sequential glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and aldolase, to a microtubular network was investigated. The binding of the phosphofructokinase to microtubules and its bundling activity has been previously characterized (Lehotzky, A., Telegdi, M., Liliom, K., and Ovádi, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10888–10894). Aldolase binding to microtubules at near physiological ionic strength is weak (K d = 20 μm) as compared with that of the kinase (K d = 1 μm). The interactions of both enzymes with microtubules are modulated by their common intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Pelleting and electron microscopic measurements have revealed that the aldolase binding interferes with that of phosphofructokinase, although they have distinct binding domains on microtubules. The underlying molecular mechanism responsible for this finding is that in the solution phase aldolase and phosphofructokinase form a bienzyme complex that does not bind to the microtubule. The bienzyme complex formation does not influence the catalytic activity of aldolase, however, it inhibits the dissociation-induced inactivation of the kinase by stabilizing a catalytically active molecular form. The present data suggest the first experimental evidence that two sequential glycolytic enzymes do not associate simultaneously to microtubules, but their complexation in solution provides kinetic advantage for glycolysis. Simultaneous binding of two sequential glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and aldolase, to a microtubular network was investigated. The binding of the phosphofructokinase to microtubules and its bundling activity has been previously characterized (Lehotzky, A., Telegdi, M., Liliom, K., and Ovádi, J. (1993) J. Biol.

The present data suggest the first experimental evidence that two sequential glycolytic enzymes do not associate simultaneously to microtubules, but their complexation in solution provides kinetic advantage for glycolysis. Microtubules (MT) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; PFK, 1-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.56); aldolase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13); Fru-1,6-P2, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. are crucial components of the cytoskeletal network that are involved in several essential functions of the eukaryotic cells (1Bershadsky A.D. Vasiliev J.M. Cytoskeleton. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988Crossref Google Scholar). The basic building block of microtubules is a tubulin dimer made of α and β subunits. The polymerization/depolymerization processes depend on an exchange of tubulin molecules between the MTs and a soluble cytoplasmic pool. The stability of the different microtubular structures varies considerably, e.g. the mitotic spindle being one of the most labile, whereas axonal MTs, which comprise a large fraction of the neuronal cells, are extremely stable. The stability is increased by taxol which causes much of the free tubulin to assemble into MTs. The binding of taxol to tubulin need not induce any qualitative changes in the mechanism of polymerization with the intermolecular contacts remaining the same as in the taxol-free MTs (2Howard W.D. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1342-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus taxol is routinely used for in vitro MT preparation. The assembly and functions of MTs are regulated by microtubule-associated proteins, most of which interact with the carboxyl termini of tubulin subunits (3Serrano L. De La Torre J. Maccioni R.B. Avila J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5989-5993Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal “tails” of the tubulin subunits are highly negatively charged and exposed on the surface of the tubules (4Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9070-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the glycolytic enzymes including fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase) have isoelectric points higher than 8.0, therefore, they are positively charged at physiological pH. The glycolytic enzymes aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase were suggested to interact with the negatively charged tails of tubulin subunits predominantly via electrostatic forces sensitive to ionic strength (5Knull H.R. Walsh J.L. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 33: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Volker K.W. Knull H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, 1-phosphofructokinase (PFK) with its comparatively low isoelectric point (pI = 5.0–5.3) (7Malamud D. Drysdale J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 620-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) does not associate to the carboxyl-terminal tubulin tails, but it associates to the MT “body” and periodically cross-bridges (bundles) single microtubules at physiological ionic strength (8Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Ovádi J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In fact, subcellular particle-associated activities of several glycolytic enzymes from brain homogenate or synaptosomes have been reported, however, only PFK showed considerable association even at physiological salt concentration. PFK has been found in vivo to be involved in axonal transport process with several other enzymes of intermediary metabolism including aldolase as a discrete macromolecular cellular entity (9Brady S.T. Trans. Am. Soc. Neurochem. 1982; 13: 226Google Scholar, 10Oblinger M.M. Foe L.G. Kwiatkowska D. Kemp R.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 21: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MTs are known to decrease the overall activities of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (11Durrieu C. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), aldolase (12Ovádi J. Orosz F. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 33: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Volker K.W. Knull H.R. J. Mol. Recognit. 1993; 6: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and PFK (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MT-bound dehydrogenase and PFK are inactive due to the preferential binding of the dissociated inactive forms of the enzymes to the MTs (11Durrieu C. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive evidence indicates that bienzyme complex formation of some glycolytic enzymes alters their catalytic and regulatory properties or produces channeling complexes (12Ovádi J. Orosz F. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 33: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In our previous studies the linked equilibria of the homologous and heterologous interactions in the tubulin/MT/PFK system were extensively characterized (8Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Ovádi J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study we extended our studies to a more complex system; aldolase, which interacts with both PFK and MT, was also included in the experimental setup. We ascertained that although aldolase and PFK had different binding domains on MT, they still mutually influenced each other in their binding to MTs by their heterologous association in solution. The major objective of these experiments was to establish whether sequential enzymes can simultaneously associate on the MT surface and produce a kinetic advantage for glycolysis. ATP, fructose-6-phosphate, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) were purchased from Boehringer, GTP from Aldrich, PFK, aldolase, and taxol from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade commercial preparations. The crystalline suspension of PFK and aldolase were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The pellets were suspended in standard buffer (50 mmMES, pH 6.8, containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmMgCl2), and then the enzymes were dialyzed against the same buffer. Enzyme and tubulin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using molar absorption coefficients of 1.03 × 105m−1 cm−1 at 276 nm for tubulin (16Na C.N. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6214-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), 1.66 × 105m−1 cm−1 for PFK (17Hesterberg L.K. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and 1.18 × 105m−1cm−1 for aldolase (18Biszku E. Boross L. Szabolcsi G. Acta Physiol. Sci. Hung. 1964; 25: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar) at 280 nm. Molar concentrations of tubulin dimer, PFK dimer, and aldolase tetramer were used in all calculations. MT concentration was determined by Bradford's assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar). Tubulin was prepared as described (16Na C.N. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6214-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified tubulin showed no microtubule-associated protein bands when run on overloaded SDS-PAGE. It was stored in 1 m sucrose, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm GTP, pH 7.0, at −80 °C and dialyzed against the standard buffer before use. The assembly of 10 μmtubulin was measured in standard buffer at 37 °C after the addition of taxol to the samples in a final concentration of 20 μm. In some cases enzymes were added to tubulin before starting the polymerization, or enzymes were added during polymerization (cf. specific experimental details given in the text or figure legends). Optical density was monitored at 350 nm by a Hewlett Packard 8451A spectrophotometer. Taxol-stabilized MT was washed in standard buffer by centrifugation (100,000 × g at 30 °C for 20 min) and resuspension. This MT at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (corresponding to 10 μm concentration of tubulin dimer as it will be given throughout the present study) was incubated with enzymes and in some cases with different concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 at 30 °C in standard buffer. After 30 min the samples were centrifuged as above and analyzed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels as described previously (8Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Ovádi J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The error of the determinations was ±16% (n = 2–3). 1 μmPFK and different concentrations of aldolase were incubated with or without 10 μm taxol-stabilized MT for 30 min at 30 °C in standard buffer. After incubation, aliquots were taken to measure enzyme activities in 70-fold dilution. PFK and aldolase activity were assayed as before (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Orosz F. Ovádi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in thermostatted cuvettes at 30 °C. The specific activities of PFK and aldolase were 105 and 8.8 units/mg, respectively. For the determination of K M and V max of aldolase-catalyzed Fru-1,6-P2 cleavage, 0.45 μm aldolase was preincubated in the presence or absence of MT for 20 min at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mmKCl and 5 mm MgCl2. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of Fru-1,6-P2. Kinetic parameters were calculated from best fits of the substrate saturation curves measured in the absence or presence of 10 μm MT. For routine transmission electron microscopy MT samples were prepared from embedded pellets as described previously (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We measured the binding of aldolase to MT at near physiological ionic strength at which PFK-MT interaction had been characterized (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various concentrations of aldolase were added to taxol-stabilized MT. After equilibration the samples were centrifuged with the appropriate speed to pellet the MT-bound enzyme (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The entrapped enzyme was quantified by densitometry after separation of the proteins in SDS-PAGE gel. As shown in Fig. 1 A, increasing the total concentration of aldolase resulted in an increase in the amount of bound enzyme. The solid line shows the best fit curve of computer simulation by an apparent dissociation constant (K d = 20 μm) assuming a simple hyperbolic saturation. The fitting suggested that not every tubulin dimer within MT can bind aldolase, but only each third or fourth tubulin is effective. A similar steric hindrance effect for enzyme binding to MT was also observed in PFK/MT system (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, aldolase has a significantly lower affinity to MT than PFK at physiological ionic strength. The initial rate of taxol-induced tubulin polymerization is not influenced by PFK (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or aldolase (Fig. 1 B, curves a-c), however, aldolase, in contrast to PFK, does not induce additional increases in the turbidity that is characteristic for MT bundling (Fig. 1 B, compare curves b and c) (21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic examination of MT samples assembled with or without addition of aldolase supports these conclusions. MTs polymerized without enzyme do not form bundles (Fig.2 A); they are smooth surfaced and show the general morphology described in detail previously (21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MTs assembled in the presence of aldolase are sparsely decorated by randomly arranged rod-like projections (Fig.2 B) some of which seem to attach to adjacent MTs. However, bundles held together by multiple periodic cross-links, as is characteristic for MTs assembled in the presence of PFK (Fig. 2,C and D) cannot be observed in the samples containing only aldolase. The increase in turbidity induced by PFK as shown in Fig. 1 B (curve c) is representative of the bundling process as it reflects the formation of a molecular species (bundled MTs) with considerably higher light scattering as compared with single MTs. Although some cross-links can be observed with aldolase (Fig. 2 B), these cross-links do not induce turbidity increase (Fig. 1 B, curve b). The possible reason for this finding is that the aldolase-induced random cross-links are sparsely distributed in the samples, and cross-linked MTs with higher light scattering are consequently rare in the whole MT population. It should also be pointed out that even this sparse cross-bridging requires an aldolase concentration of 10 μm, whereas 1 μm PFK was enough for the induction of periodically bundled MTs, which is in consonance with the approximately 20-fold higher affinity of the kinase for MTs at the ionic strength used in our experiments. MT inhibits the aldolase-catalyzed Fru-1,6-P2 cleavage at physiological ionic strength (12Ovádi J. Orosz F. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 33: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Michaelian constants for this reaction were determined to be 24 ± 4 and 36 ± 6.5 μm in the absence and presence of MT, respectively; whereas V max was not affected by the presence of MT. Taking into account the strength of aldolase-MT interaction (K d = 20 μm) at the protein concentrations used in these kinetic experiments, only 12% of aldolase could be complexed with MTs, as calculated from the equation given in the legend to Fig. 1 A. Therefore, the Kmvalue that is characteristic for the MT-complexed aldolase can be estimated as 120 μm. The apparent competitive binding of the substrate and MT to aldolase indicates the direct or indirect involvement of the substrate binding site in the heterologous association. This idea is justified by the binding (pelleting) experiment carried out in the presence of Fru-1,6-P2. We found that 20 μm Fru-1,6-P2 significantly decreased the amount of aldolase in the pellet, however, some enzymes were pelleted even at 1 mm Fru-1,6-P2concentration (data not shown). This observation suggests that the aldolase binding to MT is perturbed by its substrate, but the enzyme-substrate complex preserves its ability to interact with MT even if with lower affinity than the free enzyme. A plausible explanation for the effect of Fru-1,6-P2 on the aldolase-MT interaction is that the negatively charged substrate interacts with the corresponding positively charged residues of the substrate binding site, which otherwise might be involved, at least partly, in the electrostatic contact of aldolase-MT hetero-association. However, the role of indirect effect of the substrate cannot be excluded since substrate-induced conformational changes in the aldolase structure have been demonstrated (22Sygusch J. Beaudry D. Allaise M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7846-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Direct binding studies with intact and tail-free MT provided evidence that while aldolase binds to the negatively charged tails (23Carr D. Knull H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), PFK associates with MT body; the binding of the latter is not perturbed by the specific removal of the tails (8Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Ovádi J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One would expect that the two sequential glycolytic enzymes can bind simultaneously since they have distinct binding domains on MTs. We have previously demonstrated the association of PFK with aldolase in solution (24Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To assess whether the interactions of PFK and aldolase with MT interfere with each other, competition experiments were performed. In the design of experiments we took into account that PFK displays similar overall affinities to MT (K d = 1 μm (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and to aldolase (K d = 2 μm (24Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). However, the affinity of aldolase to MT is one order of magnitude higher (K d = 20 μm, cf. Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the presence of 10 μm aldolase does not cause an additional increase in turbidity such as that observed with PFK, therefore, aldolase does not display significant bundling activity. However, we observed that aldolase effectively inhibited the PFK-induced bundling process (cf. Table I,lines 5 and 6). In one set of experiments aldolase was added to the MT:PFK mixture 22 min after initiation of the taxol-induced tubulin polymerization. 2 μm aldolase was ineffective, whereas 25 μm aldolase significantly impeded further turbidity increase (cf. Fig. 1 B,curve d). This result indicates that aldolase counteracts the effect of PFK on MT bundling.Table IEffect of aldolase on PFK-MT interactionSamplesTurbidityPelletPFKAldolaseprotein %MT25 ± 5MT + 1 μmPFK100 ± 990 ± 8MT + 2 μmaldolase30 ± 515 ± 2MT + 10 μmaldolase35 ± 107 ± 4MT + 1 μmPFK + 2 μm aldolase30 ± 542 ± 69 ± 3MT + 1 μm PFK + 10 μmaldolase25 ± 510 ± 54 ± 2(MT + 1 μm PFK)1-aMT and PFK were preincubated before addition of aldolase. + 10 μmaldolase21 ± 53 ± 21-a MT and PFK were preincubated before addition of aldolase. Open table in a new tab To study the morphologic background lying behind turbidity changes, we prepared MT samples containing PFK (1 μm) without or with addition of aldolase (2 and 10 μm). Electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of groups of parallel aligned MTs connected by rows of periodic side-arms in samples containing PFK (Fig.2 D). MT bundles with similar morphology were also common in samples containing 1 μm PFK and a low (2 μm) concentration of aldolase (Fig. 2 C). The MTs in these bundles were cross-bridged by highly periodic lateral projections quite distinct from the decoration seen in samples containing aldolase only by their strict periodicity (center to center distance of arms of about 20 nm versus random distribution of aldolase decoration). MTs cross-linked with periodic side-arms of similar morphology formed in the presence of PFK were described by us in detail previously (21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Morphometric analysis and immunogold electron microscopy revealed that these side-arms consisted of PFK oligomers, probably tetramers (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cross-bridged MTs were not seen in samples containing 1 μm PFK and high (10 μm) concentrations of aldolase (not shown). These data show that in the presence of low (2 μm) aldolase concentration, MTs cross-bridged by PFK can still be visualized. However, at high concentration aldolase is able to completely inhibit this process. To determine whether or not the binding of PFK to MT or only its bundling activity was disturbed by aldolase, pelleting experiments were carried out with MT in the presence of both enzymes. The bound enzymes in the pellets were quantified by gel electrophoresis followed by densitometry. Table I summarizes the results. In the absence of aldolase, 90% of 1 μm PFK is pelleted with MT. The amount of the kinase in the pellet is significantly reduced (halved) in the presence of 2 μmaldolase, and only 10% of the kinase is entrapped by MT if the incubation mixture contained 10 μm aldolase. This effect seems to operate vice versa as well. The presence of PFK significantly reduces the amount of pelleted MT-bound aldolase (TableI). The amount of MT-bound enzymes did not depend on the order of addition of the different components: if the two enzymes were added simultaneously to MT (PFK + aldolase + MT), or aldolase was added first followed by the kinase ((aldolase + MT) + PFK), or the two enzymes were preincubated and then added to MT ((aldolase + PFK) + MT). However, if PFK was preincubated with MT allowing the bundling process to proceed before addition of aldolase ((PFK + MT) + aldolase) then aldolase was less effective in decreasing the amount of MT-bound PFK (Table I,line 7). Therefore, the effect of aldolase depends on the time of its addition during the bundling process. This finding is similar to that observed with MgATP in the PFK/MT system. MgATP was more effective in decreasing the amount of pelleted MT-bound PFK when it was added at an earlier stage of bundling (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following the previous interpretation, we suggest that aldolase is also able to prevent the PFK binding or able to release the kinase from the single but not the bundled MTs (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), at least on our experimental time scale (120 min). On the basis of the above data we conclude that PFK and aldolase inhibit their simultaneous binding to MT. A plausible mechanism that could be responsible for these effects is that the bienzyme complex formed in solution is not able to associate with the tubules. The multiple equilibria that we suggest to exist in the PFK/aldolase/MT system are shown in Scheme FS1. To assess the functional consequences of the hetero-associations in the PFK/aldolase/MT system, the simultaneous effects of aldolase and MT were tested on the PFK activity. 1 μm PFK was preincubated with different concentrations of aldolase in the absence and presence of 10 μm MT. Under these concentrations, also used in the binding experiments, PFK alone exists in partially dissociated form, therefore, the enzyme is partially inactive. The presence of MT produces more inactive enzyme due to the preferential binding of inactive dimeric forms to MTs (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PFK activity was assayed at conditions that virtually stabilize the tetramer-dimer equilibrium of PFK, i.e. the oligomeric distribution in the sample is faithfully reflected by the assay (26Mayr G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By increasing the total concentration of aldolase, the activity of PFK increases in both the absence and the presence of MT as shown in Fig.3. The increase is much more pronounced without MT. At 10 μm aldolase concentration, the activity of PFK reaches the control value characteristic for the tetrameric form. Since we have demonstrated that the dissociated forms of PFK are involved in the associations with both MT (14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and aldolase (24Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a possible interpretation of these findings is that although dimeric forms of PFK are involved in both MT and aldolase hetero-associations, in the PFK-MT complex the kinase is inactive, whereas in the PFK-aldolase complex it is active. Previously, we also suggested that aldolase interacts with the “nascently” formed dimeric PFK and inhibits the inactivation of the kinase (24Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The present experiment shows that if the aldolase concentration is high enough then PFK can retain its 100% activity corresponding to the activity of the tetrameric form. As shown in Fig. 3, PFK activity tends to reach similar limit values both in the absence and presence of MT, but in the presence of MT, higher aldolase concentration is required to obtain this limit. This observation is in agreement with the binding data; namely that high aldolase concentration significantly inhibits PFK binding to MT. The conclusions obtained from the kinetic measurements and earlier studies (cf. Refs. 14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, and 25Orosz F. Christova T.Y. Ovádi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) are also included in Scheme FS1. Compelling data now exist on the structural organization of glycolytic enzymes in in vivo, in situ and in vitro systems (27Masters C.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 11: 105-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Masters C. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Knull J.R. Fox C.F. UCLA Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology. 133. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 215-228Google Scholar, 30MacRae T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Roberts S.J. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These associations are relatively weak and frequently transient, and the association states depend on the experimental or cellular conditions and on the cell type. Some glycolytic enzymes appear to have “functional duality” in which they play a structural role in the bundling of filaments in addition to their catalytic role (32Clarke F.M. Morton D.J. Stephan P. Weidemann J. Ishikawa H. Hatano S. Sato H. Cell Motility: Mechanism and Regulation. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1985: 235-250Google Scholar). For example, PFK periodically cross-links MTs resulting in a bundled ultrastructure, which is suggested to become resistant against anti-mitotic drugs (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Orosz F. Kovács J. Löw P. Vértessy B.G. Urbányi Z. Ács T. Keve T. Ovádi J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, within this heterologous complex the kinase becomes insensitive against proteolytic digestion (15Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Molnár A. Orosz F. Ovádi J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but its overall activity is decreased due to the preferential binding of inactive forms (see Ref. 14Lehotzky A. Telegdi M. Liliom K. Ovádi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10888-10894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and the present work). Moreover, the ratio of the free and bound forms is modulated by the level of specific function-dependent metabolites (21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as by aldolase. Aldolase interacts with MT at the negatively charged tails of tubulins that also bind other glycolytic enzymes (5Knull H.R. Walsh J.L. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 33: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with the exception of PFK (8Vértessy B.G. Kovács J. Ovádi J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The binding of aldolase and PFK to MT is influenced by their common intermediate, Fru-1,6-P2, which counteracts with MT binding in the cases of both enzymes (see Ref. 21Lehotzky A. Pálfia Z. Kovács J. Molnár A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 204: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and the present work). This situation favors the complex formation between the two sequential enzymes in solution resulting in increased overall activities for both PFK and aldolase. Such a partition of PFK among various forms could be operative to regulate glycolysis in different cells. A number of scientists have hypothesized that the associations of sequential enzymes on solid supports, e.g. cytoskeletal network or membranes, can ensure direct transfer (i.e. channeling) of common metabolites, which could be favorable for metabolism (34Ovádi J. Cell Architecture and Metabolic Channeling. R. G. Landes Co., Springer-Verlag, Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). However, just on the basis of the binding data for several single enzymes, one cannot predict the existence of a channeling complex. Even if two sequential enzymes have separate binding domains on the surface of a meshwork, no one can guarantee simultaneous association with kinetic advantages that are characteristic for the channeling complex. Here we present the first example of the fact that two sequential glycolytic enzymes do interact with tubules, however, their simultaneous binding is not favored. In the particular case investigated herein, PFK and aldolase form a heterologous complex in solution resulting in enhanced overall activities and a possible kinetic advantage for fructose-6-phosphate conversion into triose phosphates as suggested in Scheme FS1.

G., and Lagarias, J. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem.265, 7029–7035). The present studies were undertaken to determine whether this blue shift is due to a chromophore other than phytochromobilin or reflects a different protein environment for the phytochromobilin prosthetic group. Using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, we show that soluble protein extracts prepared from algal chloroplasts contain the enzyme activities for ferredoxin-dependent conversions of biliverdin IXα to (3Z)-phytochromobilin and (3Z)-phytochromobilin to (3Z)-phycocyanobilin.In vitro assembly of recombinant algal apophytochrome was undertaken with (3E)-phytochromobilin and (3E)-phycocyanobilin. The difference spectrum of the (3E)-phycocyanobilin adduct was indistinguishable from that of phytochrome isolated from dark-adapted algal cells, while the (3E)-phytochromobilin adduct displayed red-shifted absorption maxima relative to purified algal phytochrome. These studies indicate that phycocyanobilin is the immediate precursor of the green algal phytochrome chromophore and that phytochromobilin is an intermediate in its biosynthesis in Mesotaenium.

Other than acting as an energy source for photosynthesis, light is an important signal for many growth and developmental processes in plants. Plants thus possess multiple photoreceptors, which enable them to perceive and adapt to light intensity, direction, and quality in their environment (1$$Google Scholar). Phytochrome, the most well characterized of these light receptors, mediates a diverse array of photomorphogenetic responses in various organisms from green algae to higher plants (2Quail P.H. Boylan M.T. Parks B.M. Short T.W. Xu Y. Wagner D. Science. 1995; 268: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 3Furuya M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Molecular analyses have established that most plants contain multiple phytochrome genes for which expression appears to be responsible for this diversity of phytochrome-mediated phenomena (3Furuya M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 617-645Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar,5Sharrock R.A. Quail P.H.

Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 10-21Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ability of phytochrome to sense the light environment is due to a covalently attached linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, which allows the photoreceptor to photointerconvert between red light-absorbing Pr 1The abbreviations used are: Pr, red light-absorbing form; Pfr, far red light-absorbing form; PΦB, phytochromobilin; PCB, phycocyanobilin; BV, biliverdin IXα; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TES,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. form and far red light-absorbing Pfr form. Light-grown plants deficient in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis exhibit aberrant growth and development (reviewed in Refs. 8Koorneef M. Kendrick R.E. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 601-628Crossref Google Scholar and 9Terry M.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 740-745Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is well established that (3E)-phytochromobilin (PΦB) is the immediate precursor of the chromophore of phytochrome A from higher plants, and it has implicitly been assumed that other phytochromes also contain a PΦB chromophore (reviewed in Ref. 10Terry M.J. Maines M.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26099-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of observations suggest that some phytochromes could contain an alternative bilin chromophore. First, the ability to reconstitute photoactive phytochromes with phycobilin pigments supports this hypothesis. One of these is the phycobiliprotein chromophore precursor, (3E)-phycocyanobilin (PCB), assembly of which with apophytochrome A yields a photoactive species with blue-shifted absorption maxima for both Pr and Pfr forms (11Elich T.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12902-12908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, phytochromes with blue-shifted absorption spectra have been reported for the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris (12Oyama H. Yamamoto K.T. Wada M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 1229-1238Google Scholar), the mosses Ceratodon purpureus (13Lamparter T. Podlowski S. Mittmann F. Schneiderpoetsch H. Hartmann E. Hughes J. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 147: 426-434Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Atrichum undulatum (14Lindemann P. Braslavsky S.E. Hartmann E. Schaffner K. Planta. 1989; 178: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), light-grown higher plants (15Cordonnier M.M. Greppin H. Pratt L.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7657-7666Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Tohuhisa J.G. Quail P.H. Planta. 1987; 172: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the green alga Mesotaenium caldariorum (17Taylor A.O. Bonner B.A. Plant Physiol. 1967; 42: 762-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kidd D.G. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7029-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the notable exception of green algal phytochrome, these blue shifts were restricted to the Pfr forms, a result that can readily be ascribed to limited proteolysis or denaturation of phytochrome during its purification (19Vierstra R.D. Quail P.H. Planta. 1982; 156: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The observations that full-length algal phytochrome displays blue-shifted Pr and Pfr absorption maxima (18Kidd D.G. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7029-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that the action spectra for chloroplast reorientation in Mesotaenium is similarly blue-shifted (20.Machemer, C. (1964) Reagents Affecting the Rotation of the Chloroplasts in Mesotaenium. M.Sc. thesis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.Google Scholar), suggest that this atypical phytochrome spectrum is an inherent property of the native algal photoreceptor. The present study was undertaken to establish the molecular basis for the blue-shifted absorption maxima of the green algal phytochrome. In one avenue of investigation, we examined algal plastid protein extracts for the presence of enzymatic activities capable of converting biliverdin IXα (BV), a known intermediate in the biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore in higher plants, to PΦB and other bilin products. These studies take advantage of an improved HPLC assay system for PΦB synthase (21Wu S.-H. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8989-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the plastid-localized enzyme responsible for the reductive conversion of BV to PΦB in higher plants (22Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J.

With this assay, which can readily distinguish between (3Z)- and (3E)-isomers of PΦB and PCB, the production of PCB by a non-phycobiliprotein containing green algal species has been documented for the first time. M. caldariorum strain 41 was obtained from the University of Texas at Austin Culture Collection of Algae. Liquid suspension cultures were grown at 16–18 °C in Sager and Granick medium II (24Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% yeast extract as recommended (17Taylor A.O. Bonner B.A. Plant Physiol. 1967; 42: 762-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under cool white fluorescent continuous light (50–100 μmol m−2 s−1). Cyanidium caldarium strain CPD was a generous gift from Dr. S. I. Beale (Brown University, Providence, RI) and was grown at 37 °C in pH 2.0 glucose-based heterotrophic medium (25Beale S.I. Chen N.C. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 263-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mesotaenium suspension cultures (300 ml/flask) were allowed to grow to late log phase in continuous light. For isolation of intact chloroplasts, algal cultures were placed in darkness for 7 days to consume the starch storage granules. Dark-adapted cells were harvested by centrifugation at 160 ×g for 1 min and washed with deionized H2O. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of protoplast buffer (0.3m potassium succinate, pH 5.6, 0.2 m sorbitol, 2 mm CaCl2) containing 0.5% Onozuka RS cellulase (Karlan) and incubated with shaking (60 rpm) under green safe light for 4–6 h at room temperature until >90% of the cells had become protoplasts. Protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation in a swinging-bucket rotor at 425 × g for 3 min, washed with 50 ml of protoplast buffer, and re-centrifuged. Protoplast pellets were resuspended in 11 ml of cold protoplast lysis buffer (25 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.3, 2.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) by pipetting and inverting for 2 min, whereupon 1 ml of 4 m sorbitol was immediately added for osmotic stabilization of chloroplasts. Intact chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation in a swinging-bucket rotor at 760 × gfor 3 min. Chloroplasts were then osmotically lysed by adding 25 ml of chloroplast lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mg/ml sodium ascorbate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10–20 min. The supernatant obtained, after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, represented the chloroplast soluble protein fraction. This solution was further concentrated by using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell with a YM 10 membrane. Phosphate buffer was chosen for chloroplast lysis because of its necessity for solubilizing bilin reductase activity in higher plant. 2M. T. McDowell and J. C. Lagarias, unpublished data. For a standard 1-ml assay, chloroplast soluble protein extracts (730 μl) containing roughly 1 mg of total protein as determined by Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) were used as enzyme source. Reaction mixtures consisted of a NADPH-regenerating system (6.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.82 mmNADP+, and 1.1 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), 10 μm bovine serum albumin, 4.6 μm spinach ferredoxin, and 0.025 units/ml ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (all final concentrations). Assays were initiated by addition of BV (or other bilin) in Me2SO to give a final bilin concentration of 5–10 μm and Me2SO concentration of 1% (v/v). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 28 °C under green safe light for the appropriate time indicated and stopped by placing on ice. Crude bilins were isolated with a C18 Sep-Pak Light cartridge (Waters-Millipore Corp., Milford, MA) as described (23Terry M.J. McDowell M.T. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11111-11118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crude bilins were analyzed by C18 reversed phase HPLC using a Varian 5000 liquid chromatograph equipped with a 4.6 mm × 250-mm Phenomenex Ultracarb 5μ ODS20 and a 4.6 mm × 30-mm guard column of the same material. The mobile phase consisted of a 50:50 mixture of acetone and 20 mm formic acid in water. Column eluates were monitored at 380 nm with Varian UV100 absorbance detector. Two different recombinant phytochrome apoproteins were used for in vitroassembly experiments. Oat apophytochrome A was prepared from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 29A (MATα leu2-3 leu2-112 his3-1 ade1-101 trp1-289) expressing pMphyA3 (27Wahleithner J.A. Li L. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10387-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For Mesotaenium apophytochrome, an XhoI-NotI fragment containing MCphy1b cDNA was subcloned into an engineered pMAC105 vector 3S. H. Wu and J. C. Lagarias, unpublished data. digested with SalI and NotI to generate pMMCphy1b. This plasmid was then used to transform S. cerevisiae strain 29A, and Mesotaenium apophytochrome was expressed as described (27Wahleithner J.A. Li L. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10387-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For in vitro spectrophotometric assays, ammonium sulfate was added to the yeast soluble protein fraction to produce a concentration of 0.23 g/ml. The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 1 h, and precipitates were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 17,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein pellets were dissolved in TEGE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25% ethylene glycol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Holophytochrome concentrations were determined with a HP8450A UV/visible spectrophotometer using the absorbance difference assay described previously (28Li L. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19204-19210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro assembly, (3E)-PCB, (3E)-PΦB, or bilin pigment as indicated was added to reaction mixture to produce a final concentration of 4 μm. Assay mixtures were incubated at room temperature under green safe light for 30 min prior to spectrophotometric measurements. BV was prepared from bilirubin and purified as described (29McDonagh A.F. Palma L.A. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Crude (3E)-PCB and (3E)-PΦB were obtained by methanolysis of Spirulina platensis (10Terry M.J. Maines M.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26099-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Porphyridium cruentum (30Cornejo J. Beale S.I. Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14790-14798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Crude pigments were further purified by C-18 reversed phase HPLC as described above, except that a 10 mm × 250-mm semipreparative column with a 10 mm × 50-mm guard column was used. (3Z)-PCB was obtained by co-incubation of BV with Cyanidium extracts (31Rhie G. Beale S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16088-16093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by HPLC as described above. (3Z)-PΦB was similarly biosynthesized from BV using a partially purified oat etioplast fraction containing PΦB synthase. 4M. T. McDowell and J. C. Lagarias, manuscript in preparation. HPLC-purified bilins were diluted with 2–3 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, applied to C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge, and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and bilins were eluted with 60:40 acetonitrile:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted pigments were concentrated in vacuo with a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant), wrapped with foil, and stored at −20 °C. For biosynthetic studies, bilins were dissolved in Me2SO to give a final concentration of 1 mm. Bilins were quantitated in 2% (v/v) HCl in methanol using molar absorption coefficients of 46,773m−1 cm−1 at 368 nm for (3Z)-PCB (32Weller J.P. Gossauer A. Chem.

Ber. 1980; 113: 1603-1611Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and 64,565 m−1cm−1 at 386 nm for (3E)-PΦB (32Weller J.P. Gossauer A. Chem. Ber. 1980; 113: 1603-1611Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the biosynthetic pathway for the chromophore of phytochrome resides in the plastid compartment of higher plants (22Terry M.J. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22215-22221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the green alga Mesotaenium is capable of synthesizing phytochrome chromophore precursor(s) other than PΦB, we prepared chloroplast soluble protein extracts to study the metabolism of BV. An NADPH-regenerating system, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin-NADP+reductase were included in our assay mixture, since reduced ferredoxin has been shown to be required for the synthesis of PCB in red algae (34Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22328-22332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (3Z)-PΦB in higher plants.4 After prolonged incubation of chloroplast extracts with BV, the total pigment mixture was partially purified and analyzed for its ability to assemble with recombinant oat apophytochrome A. Fig.1 A shows the difference spectrum of the oat phytochrome A-bilin adduct(s) produced. Comparisons with the spectra of PCB and PΦB adducts of recombinant oat apophytochrome A show that this spectrum is indistinguishable with that of the PCB adduct (Fig. 1 B). This result strongly suggests that the Mesotaenium chloroplast soluble fraction contains enzymatic activities that can metabolize BV either to PCB or a novel bilin, for which assembly with apophytochrome A yields a phytochrome species with a difference spectrum very similar to the PCB adduct. To identify the pigment(s) produced by incubation of the Mesotaenium chloroplast soluble protein extracts with BV, a more detailed time-course study was conducted (Fig.2). At time zero, the predominant pigment detected by HPLC was the reaction substrate BV. A new pigment, labeled A, emerged after 5 min of incubation and increased during the initial 15-min period. Pigment A was accompanied by another minor pigment, labeled C, with an earlier retention time. A third pigment, labeled B, appeared after most of the BV had been metabolized. Pigment B became the predominant species along with the production of a fourth pigment, labeled D. At later time points, pigments B and D appeared to be the end products of the BV conversion. The kinetics of BV turnover and the production of pigments A and B are illustrated in Fig.3. These data strongly suggest that the metabolism of BV proceeds via pigment A, which is subsequently converted to pigment B. That these conversions were enzyme-mediated was established by the inability of heat-denatured chloroplast soluble protein extracts to convert BV to pigments A–D (data not shown). Spectrophotometric analysis of the pigments eluting prior to 10 min (Fig. 2) revealed these to be rubinoid pigments, possibly thiol adducts, which were not further characterized.Figure 3Kinetic plot of BV metabolism by Mesotaenium plastid extracts. This plot was generated by plotting the percent area of three major pigments in the whole time-course studies shown in Fig. 2 versus the reaction time. Percent area was obtained by dividing integrated area of individual pigments peaks by the total integrated area of the whole HPLC profile. The three curves represent different bilin pigments with symbols as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several lines of research were undertaken to address the identities of the pigments derived from BV in this green alga. First, pigments A and B were HPLC-purified and tested for their ability to assemble with recombinant oat apophytochrome A. Fig. 4 A shows that oat apophytochrome A adducts of pigments A and B exhibited difference spectra typical for PΦB and PCB adducts, respectively (see Fig.1 A for comparison). Second, the absorption spectra of pigments A and B were determined and proved indistinguishable from those of (3Z)-PΦB and (3Z)-PCB (Fig.4 B and data not shown). Third, HPLC co-injection experiments with the products of BV metabolism by soluble chloroplast extracts were performed using authentic (3Z)- and (3E)-isomers of PCB and PΦB (Fig. 5). The retention times of pigments A and B were shown to be identical with those for (3Z)-PΦB and (3Z)-PCB (Fig. 5, c and d). These experiments also demonstrate that pigments C and D represent the (3E)-isomers PΦB and PCB, respectively (Fig.5, e and f). That (3Z)-PΦB is a bona fide precursor of (3Z)-PCB in Mesotaenium was established by the time-dependent conversion of purified (3Z)-PΦB to (3Z)-PCB (Fig.6). Taken together, it is clear that Mesotaenium chloroplasts possess the enzyme activities for conversion of BV to (3Z)-PΦB and subsequently to (3Z)-PCB.Figure 5HPLC co-injection of BV metabolites with authentic bilin standards. Mesotaenium chloroplast soluble protein extracts were incubated with BV for 30 min under standard bilin reductase conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the products were separated by HPLC (a). Co-injection experiments were performed by mixing the crude pigment products with 1 μmol of BV IXα (b), (3Z)-PΦB (c), (3Z)-PCB (d), (3E)-PΦB (e) or (3E)-PCB (f) prior to HPLC analysis. Peaks that increase are indicated with an asterisk. The increase in peak height at 14.7 min in c was due to chemical isomerization of (3Z)-PΦB to (3E)-PΦB during sample preparation for HPLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Kinetic plot of (3Z)-PΦB metabolism by plastid extracts.

B, relative integrated area was plotted against reaction time in minutes (min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although Mesotaenium chloroplasts synthesize PCB from BV, it was still unclear whether PCB is the chromophore precursor for algal phytochrome. To address this issue, recombinant algal apophytochrome was therefore expressed in yeast and used for in vitro assembly with either PΦB or PCB. Fig.7 A indicates that, when assembled with PΦB, the spectrum was quite similar to the native spectrum for the higher plant phytochrome A (compare with Fig.1 B). When assembled with PCB, the difference spectrum of recombinant Mesotaenium phytochrome was indistinguishable from that of native algal phytochrome (Fig. 7 B). Together with the metabolism of BV to PCB by algal plastid extracts, these results demonstrate that PCB is the immediate chromophore precursor for the algal photoreceptor phytochrome. This work was undertaken to determine the nature of the observed blue-shifted difference spectrum of phytochrome from the green alga Mesotaenium. We have demonstrated that this blue shift arises from the use of PCB as the precursor of the algal phytochrome chromophore rather than an altered chromophore environment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the existence of PCB in an organism lacking phycobiliproteins and the first phytochrome identified to use a chromophore other than PΦB. Our studies also establish that Mesotaenium possesses a novel biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of PCB. Instead of the major route employed by the red algae which synthesizes PCB via the intermediates of 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin and phycoerythrobilin (34Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22328-22332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22333-22340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22341-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Mesotaenium converts BV to (3Z)-PΦB, which is subsequently converted to (3Z)-PCB (Fig. 8). While similar to that proposed for phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis in higher plants, an additional step for the reductive conversion of (3Z)-PΦB to (3Z)-PCB catalyzed by a hypothetical PΦB reductase has been included in the green algae phytochrome chromophore biosynthetic pathway. In this scheme, we have also included 3Z to 3E bilin isomerization steps based on the observed production of 3E isomers of PΦB and PCB. Whether one or both isomerization steps are enzyme-mediated and/or required for assembly with Mesotaenium apophytochrome is unknown at present. The ability of Mesotaenium to synthesize both PΦB and PCB raises the possibility that PΦB could also be used as a precursor of the algal phytochrome chromophore. This might occur should PΦB escape from the chloroplast compartment or should further reduction of PΦB to PCB be inhibited and/or regulated under various physiological conditions. Since the observed blue-shifted difference spectrum was observed for Mesotaenium holophytochrome isolated from the dark-adapted cells, and the enzyme used for BV metabolism was also obtained from dark-adapted cells, it is conceivable that PΦB can be used as a natural phytochrome chromophore precursor for cells grown under different conditions. These possibilities remain to be addressed in future study. The identification of an enzyme activity responsible for the reduction of PΦB to PCB raises a number of interesting questions. Does this represent a second bilin reduction enzyme or reflect a dual substrate specificity for PΦB synthase in green algae? What is the ecological advantage for this green alga to possess an enzyme that yields a blue-shifted phytochrome species? Could introduction of the green algal PΦB synthase gene into higher plants lead to the synthesis of phytochrome molecules with PCB as chromophore? A 10–16-nm blue shift in both red- and far red-absorbing forms by using PCB as chromophore could provide a powerful tool for studying the impact of light quality in plant physiology and development. Whether higher plants possess phytochrome molecules with different chromophores other than PΦB remains to be addressed. The presence of PCB in the non-phycobiliprotein containing green alga Mesotaenium raises the interesting question of whether green algae can synthesize PCB via same pathway as that reported for the red alga Cyanidium. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory failed to detect either 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin or phycoerythrobilin as BV metabolites by plastid extracts from Mesotaenium (data not shown). These results suggest that phycobilin-containing organisms that do not produce phycoerythrobilin might synthesize PCB via the intermediacy of PΦB. Furthermore, a closer examination of the PCB biosynthetic pathway in Cyanidium has revealed the evidence for the production of (3Z)-PΦB as the biosynthetic intermediate.2 Although it is not known at present, cyanobacteria may be capable of synthesizing PΦB based on the hypothesis that the cyanobacterial family of eubacteria are the progenitors of the rhodophyte plastids. Together with the presence of PΦB synthase activity in yeast, Pichia pastoris (21Wu S.-H. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8989-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that PΦB synthase, the enzyme catalyzing BV reduction to PΦB, was present in the primitive ancestor for all extant organisms. We thank Dr. Matthew Terry for initial studies on the chromophore biosynthetic pathway in Mesotaenium."

The rate of hydrolysis depends on the substrate and can range from 6000 s−1 for paraoxon to 0.03 s−1 for the slower substrates such as diethylphenylphosphate. Increases in the reactivity of phosphotriesterase toward the slower substrates were attempted by the placement of a potential proton donor group at the active site.

This protein has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of the insecticides parathion, paraoxon, coumaphos, methylparathion, and diazonin, among others (1Dumas D.P. Caldwell S.R. Wild J.R. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme also detoxifies the potent acetylcholinesterase nerve agents sarin, soman, and diisopropylfluorophosphate (2Dumas D.P. Durst H.D. Landis W.G. Raushel F.M. Wild J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reaction mechanism has been shown to proceed via an SN2-like process whereby an activated water molecule attacks the phosphoryl center resulting in the displacement of the leaving group with an inversion of stereochemical configuration (3Lewis V.E. Donarski W.J. Wild J.R. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The active site of this enzyme is comprised primarily of a binuclear metal cluster that contains Zn2+ but can also accommodate Co2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, or Ni2+ with full retention of catalytic activity (1Dumas D.P. Caldwell S.R. Wild J.R. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High resolution x-ray crystallography of the Cd2+-substituted enzyme has established the identity of the metal binding ligands (5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7973-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Zn2+ enzyme, with a bound nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, has illustrated the probable orientation of the substrate relative to the binuclear metal center (6Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The more buried zinc interacts with His55, His57, Asp301 and two bridging ligands in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The more solvent exposed zinc interacts directly with His201, His230, and the two bridging ligands in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The two bridging ligands are a carbamylated lysine residue (Lys169) and a solvent water molecule. The bacterial phosphotriesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of paraoxon at the diffusion controlled limit. The Co2+-substituted enzyme has a reported k cat and k cat/Km for paraoxon hydrolysis of nearly 104 s−1 and 108m−1 s−1, respectively (4Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, an extensive structure reactivity analysis for the hydrolysis of paraoxon analogues has clearly demonstrated that the magnitude of these kinetic constants is very much dependent on the p K a of the leaving group phenol (7Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10904-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate-limiting step changes from diffusion of the enzyme-substrate or enzyme-product complex to hydrolytic cleavage of the P-O bond when the pK a of the phenol exceeds ∼7. The Brφnsted value (βlg) for this series of compounds with pK a values exceeding 7 is approximately −2. Therefore, the rate for the enzymatic hydrolysis of paraoxon with ap-nitrophenolate leaving group (pK a = ∼7) is nearly a million times faster than is diethylphenylphosphate with a phenolate leaving group (pK a ∼ 10). The very substantial Brφnsted value for this reaction indicates two important factors about the enzymatic machinery at the active site of this protein. First, the transition state for the hydrolysis of paraoxon analogues is very late, suggesting that the P-O bond is nearly fully broken. Second, the enzyme does not appear to be contributing to the activation of the leaving group through Lewis acid catalysis, via complexation with the binuclear metal center, or by general acid catalysis through protonation of the phenolic oxygen from a nearby acidic residue. In addition, it would appear that the environment of the leaving group binding site is quite hydrophobic. Indeed, the crystal structure of phosphotriesterase shows that the binding site for the putative leaving group is lined with a series of very hydrophobic residues (6Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These amino acids include Trp131, Phe132, Leu271, Phe306, and Tyr309. The side chains from Trp131, Phe132, and Phe306 are oriented toward the oxygen of the leaving group, but there are no acidic residues in the immediate vicinity that could potentially donate a proton to the leaving group during P-O bond cleavage. Therefore, mutants of phosphotriesterase were created with the goal of transforming this protein into an enzyme that would be capable of hydrolyzing the poorer substrates, containing leaving groups with high pK a values, at a faster rate. An additional objective was to enhance the rate of phosphofluoridate hydrolysis. It was anticipated that the introduction of potential hydrogen bond donors to the leaving group pocket would effectively lower the pK a of the leaving group and increase the hydrophilic character of this site. These changes would potentially increase the rate of the reaction with some substrates through alteration of the Brφnsted β value. The side chains of the closest amino acids (Trp131, Phe132, and Phe306) were mutated to residues capable of hydrogen bond formation and proton donation to the leaving group. The catalytic effects of these mutations were determined for the hydrolysis of paraoxon (I), diethylphenylphosphate (II), acephate (III), and diisopropylfluorophosphate (IV) (SchemeFS1).

Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar). After amplification, the mutagenic PCR fragments were purified from an agarose gel, cut with BamHI, concentrated with BamHI-digested pBS+, ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and transformed into XL1-Blue cells. The double mutants (F132H/F306H, F132H/F306Y, F132Y/F306H, and F132Y/F306Y) were prepared by taking advantage of the unique StyI and EcoRV restrictions sites on each side of the codon for the phenylalanine at position 132. The mutant plasmids containing either the single tyrosine or histidine mutation at position 132 was digested with StyI and EcoRV to obtain a fragment containing the mutation at this site. This oligonucleotide fragment was then ligated into an identically cut plasmid containing only the single mutation at position 306. The opd gene in each of the mutants generated from PCR were completely sequenced to ensure that only the desired base changes were present. Overnight cultures of the transformed BL21 cells grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (12Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) were used to inoculate Terrific broth (TB) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm CoCl2. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C and induced with IPTG in early log phase, and the cells harvested in stationary phase. Mutant enzymes were purified from BL21 cells according to previously reported procedures (4Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4265-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the isolated proteins were greater than 95% pure. Apo-enzyme was prepared by incubating each enzyme with 2 mm o-phenanthroline at 4 °C overnight or until there was less than 1% residual activity. The o-phenanthroline was removed by diafiltration with metal-free 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.5) buffer using an Amicon PM10 membrane or by passing the solution through a Pharmacia PD-10 desalting column. Apo-enzyme was reconstituted with the desired metal by adding 5 mol equivalents of either ZnSO4, CdSO4, or CoCl2 in the presence of 10 mm KHCO3 at 4 °C for at least 2 h. The rate of paraoxon hydrolysis by each of the mutants was measured by monitoring the appearance of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm (ε = 17,000m−1 cm−1) at pH 9.0 (10Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4265-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis of diethylphenylphosphate (DEPP) was measured by monitoring the appearance of phenol at 280 nm (ε = 1,130m−1 cm−1) as previously reported (7Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10904-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis of acephate (O,S-dimethyl N-acetylphosphoramidothioate) was measured by monitoring the appearance of product at 412 nm (ε = 13,600m−1 cm−1) in the presence of 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (13Ellman G.L. Courtney D. Andres Jr., V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21473) Google Scholar) as previously reported (14Chae M.Y. Postula J.F. Raushel F.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 1473-1478Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) was determined by monitoring the appearance of fluoride ion with an Orion perpHect 570 pH Meter equipped with an Orion combination fluoride ion electrode as described previously (15Dumas D.P. Wild J.R. Raushel F.M. Biotech. Appl. Biochem. 1989; 11: 235-243Google Scholar). The kinetic constants were obtained by a fit of the data to Equation 1 using the software supplied by Savanna Shell Software, where v = velocity,V = maximum velocity, A = substrate concentration, and K a is the Michaelis constant. v=VA/(Ka+A)Equation 1 The W131K, F132H, F132Y, F306E, F306H, F306K, and F306Y phosphotriesterase mutants were made using the method of overlap extension PCR. The F132H/F306H, F132H/F306Y, F132Y/F306H, and F132Y/F306Y double mutants were constructed directly from the single site mutants by taking advantage of the unique StyI and EcoRV restriction sites within the PTE gene. The isolated StyI/EcoRV restriction fragments from the F132H and F132Y mutants were substituted for the corresponding fragments within the already altered genes for the F306H and F306Y mutants. The genes for the mutant proteins were fully sequenced and shown to contain only the desired modifications. The mutant proteins were expressed in BL21 cells and purified to homogeneity. The kinetic parameters for paraoxon hydrolysis were determined for the mutant enzymes reconstituted with Co2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+. These kinetic constants are presented in Table I. In general, the single site mutants were more active than the mutants constructed at two sites simultaneously. With the cobalt-substituted enzymes, the single site mutations made at Phe132 and Phe306 with either tyrosine or histidine replacements had approximately the same V max as the wild type enzyme. However, the mutants made at Phe306 all had Michaelis constants that were elevated by an order of magnitude or more, whereas the two mutants made at Phe132 had essentially no changes in the Km values. With the double mutants, the Km values were further elevated, whereas the V max values were reduced relative to the single site mutations. The Km value for the F132H/F306Y double mutant was significantly greater than the solubility of paraoxon, and thus an accurate value could not be obtained for either Km or V max, but the V/Km value was determined to be 280m−1 s−1. The F306E mutant was the least active catalyst of any of the mutants made at this position, whereas the W131K mutant was reduced in activity by over 3 orders of magnitude.Table IHydrolysis of paraoxon by phosphotriesterasePTE enzymeCo2+-reconstituted enzymeCd2+-reconstituted enzymeZn2+-reconstituted enzymeKmVmaxKmVmaxKmVmaxmms−1mms−1mms−1Wild type0.351000.6725000.052780W131K0.580.850.952.1NDNDF132Y0.7119001.27400.301700F132H0.356600128000.162500F306Y8.670006.63601.9870F306H2.4230043701.8320F306K1715002.23114440F306E4380.341.22.35.1F132H/F306H16200056714230F132Y/F306Y9.55902.9273.2230F132Y/F306H4.48604.4853.4140F132H/F306YND1-aND, not detected.ND2.88667501-a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Similar trends were observed with these proteins for the hydrolysis of paraoxon when the mutants were substituted with either Cd2+or Zn2+. The single site mutants were more active than the double mutants, and the mutations made at Phe306 were less active than those made at Phe-132. In nearly every case, the zinc-substituted mutants were more active than the cadmium-substituted enzyme, even though the wild type enzyme is more active with cadmium than with zinc. The W131K and F306E mutants were the least active mutants with either Zn2+ or Cd2+ as the divalent cationic activator. The mutant enzymes were also tested for their ability to hydrolyze the alternate substrates diethylphenylphosphate, acephate, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The kinetic constants obtained with these substrates are presented in TableII for the cobalt-substituted enzyme. Except for the two mutants made at position Phe132, all of the mutants were less active than the wild type enzyme for the hydrolysis of the slow substrate, diethylphenylphosphate. In every case the Km values were elevated except for the F306E mutation. The W131K mutant possessed catalytic activity barely detectable above background (<0.0006 s−1) at a substrate concentration of 2.3 mm.Table IIHydrolysis of DEPP, acephate, and DFP with Co2+-phosphotriesterasePTE enzymeDEPPAcephateDFPKmVmaxKmVmaxKmVmaxmms−1mms−1mms−1Wild type0.330.029861.50.57290W131KND2-aND, not detected.<0.0006ND<0.0022.480.33F132Y1.40.0471201.32.42300F132H0.990.0384401.31.21400F306Y4.40.0221503.31.5990F306H2.50.011530.19161400F306K1.30.00431600.2351120F306E0.250.00241200.085NDNDF132H/F306H2.40.013690.13103100F132Y/F306Y2.10.00282101.494.81300F132Y/F306H1.30.0049770.14132400F132H/F306Y8.20.0184201.53.114002-a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab For the wild type enzyme, the hydrolysis of acephate is relatively slow, whereas the Michaelis constant is quite high. Similar parameters were observed with all of the mutants constructed for this investigation. The V max values for the F132Y, F132H, F132Y/F306Y, and F132H/F306Y mutants were essentially the same as the wild type enzyme, whereas the F306Y mutant doubled in activity. The rest of the mutants were reduced in activity about an order of magnitude with the exception of W131K, where no activity could be detected above background. The Km values for all mutants were elevated by factors ranging from 1 to 5. Substantial improvements in substrate turnover were observed for most of the mutants relative to the wild type enzyme when DFP was utilized as the test substrate. The V max values increased by over an order of magnitude for the double mutant F132H/F306H, whereas slightly smaller enhancement factors were observed for either of the phenylalanine or histidine substitutions at Phe132or Phe306. The glutamate substitution for Phe306 was approximately half as active as the wild type enzyme, whereas the W131K mutant was reduced in activity by 3 orders of magnitude. With all of the mutants, the Km values for DFP were elevated by factors ranging from 2 to 100. The k cat and k cat/Km values for the various mutants with DFP as a substrate are graphically presented in Fig. 1. Most of the reported biochemical studies employing site-directed mutagenesis as an investigative tool in enzyme chemistry have been directed toward the elucidation of the specific roles of individual amino acids in catalysis, substrate binding, and maintenance of the overall protein structure. However, successful perturbations to the native substrate specificity and associated enhancements in the magnitude of the residual catalytic activity have been achieved with a more limited but growing repertoire of enzymes. To be marginally successful, a rational redesign of an enzyme active site to one with modified properties requires a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism of the protein under study, coupled with the availability of high resolution structural data. For example, the catalytic properties of papain have been transformed from a cysteine protease to a nitrile hydratase with a single point mutation (16Dufour E. Storer A.C. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16382-16388Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity for subtilisin has been reconfigured to accommodate substrates with large hydrophobic side chains by making multiple mutations within the ligand binding pocket (17Rheinnecker M. Eder J. Pandey P.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The coenzyme specificity for isocitrate dehydrogenase has been changed from NADP to NAD by the introduction of mutations that removed favorable interactions for the binding of NADP (18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel hydratase activity has been introduced intod-alanyl-d-alanine ligase by mutation of three amino acids within the active site (19Park I.-S. Lin C.-H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10464-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other successful examples have also been described (20Hedstrom L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 608-611Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The catalytic and structural properties of the phosphotriesterase from P. diminuta have been extensively studied, making it an ideal target for programmed alterations in substrate specificity and catalytic activity. The chemical mechanism has been elucidated using structure-reactivity relationships, heavy atom isotope effects, and changes in solvent viscosity (7Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10904-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Donarski W.J. Dumas D.P. Heitmeyer D.P. Lewis V.E. Raushel F.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7438-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Several mutagenic studies have been successfully employed for the identification of active site ligands and their probable role in catalysis and binding (10Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4265-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Watkins L.M. Kuo J.M. Chen-Goodspeed M. Raushel F.M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

High resolution crystal structures have been solved for the apo-enzyme and the Cd2+-substituted protein in addition to the structure for Zn2+-PTE complexed with a nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue bound at the active site (5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7973-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 6Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15001-15007Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although the bacterial phosphotriesterase has a rather broad substrate specificity, the actual rate of hydrolysis varies over many orders of magnitude, depending on the particular alteration in the structure of the target compound. The successful redesign of the substrate specificity for the bacterial phosphotriesterase would have significant implications for the practical destruction of chemical warfare agents and bioremediation of pesticide contaminated soils. However, for phosphotriesterase to become a particularly effective tool for these endeavors, mutant enzymes must be constructed with enhanced catalytic activity for these slower substrates. A partial explanation for the broad substrate specificity of the bacterial phosphotriesterase can be found by examination of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme (6Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). There are relatively few direct interactions of the bound inhibitor with the side chains of the amino acids found in the active site. However, electrostatic interactions apparently occur between the phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate and the side chains for two amino acids in the active site of phosphotriesterase, Trp131 and His201. The environment of the binding site for the remainder of the substrate has been identified and consists primarily of hydrophobic residues. The pocket that holds the leaving group of the substrate is lined with Trp131, Phe132, Leu271, Phe306, and Tyr309. Three of the side chains from these amino acids are oriented in a way to potentially act as hydrogen bond donors upon mutation to other residues as illustrated in Fig. 2 A. A model for the structure of the F132Y/F306Y mutant is presented in Fig. 2 B. The overall effectiveness of adding hydrogen bond donors to the active site to facilitate leaving group cleavage was tested by creating several mutations at these sites. Trp131 was mutated to lysine, and Phe132 and Phe306 were mutated to histidine and/or tyrosine. The crystal structure of PTE shows that Trp131 resides between the leaving group pocket and the pocket modeled for the pro-R ethoxy group of paraoxon (6Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This residue also interacts with the phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate. The mutation of Trp131 to an alanine or phenylalanine has been characterized previously (24Kuo J.M. Chae M.Y. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). W131F displayed essentially wild type activity, whereas the W131A mutant exhibited a decreased affinity for paraoxon. The mutation of Trp131 to lysine has a much more dramatic consequence. Depending on the particular metal bound at the active site, paraoxon hydrolysis decreased by 3 or 4 orders of magnitude. The Km values for paraoxon did not increase substantially for the Co2+- or Cd2+-reconstituted enzyme, but the Kmfor the Zn2+-reconstituted enzyme increased over 100-fold. Catalytic activity of W131K with either DEPP or acephate was not detectable over background. The k cat for DFP hydrolysis decreased by 103 and the Kmfor DFP increased 4-fold. The DFPase activity of W131F and W131A were near wild type levels. The large decrease in k cat upon introduction of a positive charge at position 131 suggests that dramatic changes have occurred within the active site. The previously reported mutations of Trp131 to either alanine or phenylalanine were electrostatically more conservative and resulted in mutant enzymes with elevated Km values for paraoxon. Those studies supported the role of Trp131 in substrate and/or product interactions. Because the alanine substitution had a more significant effect than the phenylalanine mutation, it was proposed that a hydrophobic interaction with the aromatic ring of Trp131plays an important role in paraoxon binding. The W131K mutation may have caused significant alterations in the organization about the binuclear metal center. Mutational studies of the Zn2+ site in carbonic anhydrase indicate that second sphere residues around the metal center play a crucial role in the proper orientation of the active site ligands. These alterations were found to affect the reactivity of Zn2+-bound water, the stabilization of the transition state, and protein-metal affinity (26Lesburg C.A. Christianson D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6838-6844Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Huang C.-C. Lesburg C.A. Kiefer L.L. Fierke C.A. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3439-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar effects may also be modulating the active site of phosphotriesterase. When a known second sphere ligand of PTE, Asp253, was mutated to alanine, a substantial decrease in catalytic activity was observed that could be attributed to the loss of a hydrogen bond interaction with His230, a direct amino acid ligand to the binuclear metal center (24Kuo J.M. Chae M.Y. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PTE indicates that Phe132 resides in the hydrophobic pocket that engulfs the leaving group of the substrate during catalysis. Phe306 resides at the interface of the three pockets that contain the ethoxy and phenoxy substituents attached to phosphorus center of the paraoxon substrate but is oriented more toward the leaving group pocket. Mutation of Phe306 to either of the charged residues, lysine or glutamic acid, results in significant decreases in k cat and substrate affinity for paraoxon. This result indicates that the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chain is important in substrate binding and in the organization of the active site. Mutation of Phe132 to histidine or tyrosine resulted in enzymes with wild type levels of activity when tested with paraoxon, DEPP, or acephate. The Km values for these substrates ranged from near wild type to a modest 6-fold increase. Mutation of Phe306 to histidine or tyrosine resulted in a variety of different effects on k cat and Km, but the general trend was a slightly lower catalytic activity and significantly elevated Km values. These results support the role of Phe132 and Phe306 as previously speculated (6Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These hydrophobic residues facilitate the binding of substrates that contain hydrophobic leaving groups. Introduction of more polar and bulkier substituents decreases substrate affinity, especially for the Phe306 site. Smaller but usually detrimental effects are also observed on catalytic hydrolysis of these substrates. The kinetic parameters of the double mutants of Phe132 and Phe306 confirmed these roles. The placement of two polar groups in the leaving group pocket resulted in even higher Km values and slower rates of hydrolysis. The tyrosine and histidine mutants of Phe132 and Phe306 were able to hydrolyze DFP up to an order of magnitude faster than that of the wild type enzyme. The double mutants, F132H/F306H and F132H/F306Y, had higher catalytic activity than the individual mutations, whereas the catalytic activity of F132Y/F306Y and F132Y/F306H was intermediate in value. The turnover number for the F132H/F306H mutant of 3100 s−1 is nearly as high as the k cat for the wild type enzyme with paraoxon. These results clearly indicate that the likelihood of creating even more complex mutants of PTE that are fully optimized for the catalytic hydrolysis of sarin and soman is quite high. The Kmvalues remained high for all double mutants. The alterations in kinetic parameters can be attributed to a direct interaction of the fluoride leaving group with the leaving group pocket. However, the elevated Km values for some of the mutants may also indicate an unfavorable interaction between the modified sidechains and one of the isopropyl substituents of DFP. The fluoride substituent, in contrast with the paraoxon or DEPP leaving groups, is smaller and more hydrophilic. The active sites that are known to bind halogens have been characterized in several enzymes. In haloalkane dehalogenase, two tryptophan residues form hydrogen bonds to the cleaved halogen and apparently stabilize the transition state during carbon-halogen bond cleavage (28Verschueren K.H.G. Seljee F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 29Kennes C. Pries F. Krooshof G.H. Bokma E. Kingma J. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A threonine is involved in bromide binding in carbonic anhydrase II (30Jonsson B.M. Hakansson K. Liljas A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and a lysine and a histidine bind to a chloride ion in human color vision pigments (31Wang Z. Asenjo A.B. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The interaction of the fluoride with the more polar residues of the active site could facilitate phosphorus-fluoride bond cleavage. Also, the structural changes introduced into the active site pocket by the addition of the polar substituents could orient the substrate such that there is better alignment for attack by the active site water. Understanding the chemistry of the phosphorus-fluoride bond cleavage event will be essential in the development of rationally designed mutants of phosphotriesterase that are capable of efficient hydrolysis of phosphofluoridate compounds such as sarin and soman. The rational design of mutant enzymes with novel activities is dependent on a thorough understanding of the chemical mechanism and the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme under investigation. Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the specific mechanism of phosphorus-fluorine bond cleavage, the information known about phosphotriesterase was used to create a series of phosphotriesterase mutants with an enhanced ability to facilitate the cleavage of the phosphorus-fluorine bond. Mutants of PTE were created with DFPase activity that was increased up to an order of magnitude. However, the redesign effort failed in increasing the rate of hydrolysis of phosphotriesters with poorer leaving groups. The improved DFPase activity is a critical first step in the design of phosphotriesterase mutants with increased activity toward other phosphofluoridate compounds such as the neurotoxins sarin and soman. Although protein redesign studies of this sort are important in the understanding of protein structure-function relationships, this effort also shows the feasibility of an enzymatic solution for the destruction and protection against the lethal effects of chemical warfare agents. Furthermore, this study clearly affirms the role of the phosphotriesterase from P. diminuta as the leading candidate for the design of mutants to be used for the biological degradation of these compounds.

The >40,000-fold diminution in k cat for the Asp-204 mutants and the demonstration that they contain an otherwise intact active site support assignment of a crucial catalytic role to Asp-204. The assignment of Asp-204 as the catalytic base that facilitates deprotonation of the C-5 hydroxyl of mevalonic acid would be compatible with the experimental observations. Biosynthesis of isoprenoids and sterols requires the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of mevalonic acid. In humans, diminished activity of mevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.1.36), the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction (1Tchen T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1100-1103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), results in mevalonic aciduria (2Gibson K.M. Hoffman G. Nyhan W.L. Sweetman L. Berger R. le Coultre R. Smit G.P. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1988; 148: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The enzyme has long been considered to be a cytosolic protein, but recent work on mevalonate kinase has implicated it in peroxisomal metabolism (3Stamellos K.D. Shackelford J.E. Tanaka R.D. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5560-5568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, depressed mevalonate kinase activity has also been correlated with peroxisomal deficiency disorders (4Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wanders R.J.A. Romeijn G.J. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that detailed information on this enzyme would be useful, mevalonate kinase has not received as much attention as other enzymes in the isoprenoid/sterol biosynthetic pathway. Enzymological characterization of mammalian mevalonate kinase has included kinetic work (6Beytia E. Dorsey K.J. Marr J. Cleland W.W. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5450-5458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that the enzyme catalyzes an ordered sequential reaction with mevalonic acid assigned as the first substrate bound and phosphomevalonate as the first product released. Inhibition of the enzyme by geranyl pyrophosphate (7Dorsey J.K. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4667-4670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (8Tanaka R.D. Schafer B.L. Lee L.Y. Freudenberger J.S. Mosley S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2391-2398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), metabolites that are formed downstream in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, has been reported, and such inhibition has been suggested to have physiological relevance (9Bruenger E. Rilling H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Oulmouden A. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although an amino acid substitution that presumably accounts for human mevalonic aciduria has been documented (11Schafer B.L. Bishop R.W. Kratunis V.J. Kalinowski S.S. Mosley S.T. Gibson K.M. Tanaka R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13229-13238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the active site amino acids that are important to enzyme function. Group-specific reagents have been employed to demonstrate that mevalonate kinase contains reactive cysteine (6Beytia E. Dorsey K.J. Marr J. Cleland W.W. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5450-5458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lysine (12Soler M. Jabalquinto A.M. Beytia E. Int. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) residues. Recently, the first identification of an active site amino acid was accomplished when protein chemistry and mutagenesis work indicated that lysine-13 influences ATP binding (13Potter D. Wojnar J.M. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Availability of a recombinant form of human mevalonate kinase would facilitate studies on inherited mutations in this enzyme. Such an enzyme, available in a stable, highly purified form and in substantial amounts, could also be useful for investigation of the structure/function correlations that account for phosphomevalonate production or for feedback regulation by geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphates. Using cDNA that encodes the human enzyme (11Schafer B.L. Bishop R.W. Kratunis V.J. Kalinowski S.S. Mosley S.T. Gibson K.M. Tanaka R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13229-13238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have developed a useful system for overexpression and isolation of human mevalonate kinase. The utility of this recombinant protein is underscored by the results 1A summary of portions of this work has appeared (Potter, D., and Miziorko, H. M. (1997) FASEB J. 11,A887). 1A summary of portions of this work has appeared (Potter, D., and Miziorko, H. M. (1997) FASEB J. 11,A887). of mutagenesis and enzymological studies, which implicate amino acids important to catalysis of phosphomevalonate production. The pGEM-3Z plasmid harboring the full-length cDNA encoding human mevalonate kinase was a gift from the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs, Pfu polymerase from Stratagene, Inc., and deoxyoligonucleotides from Operon, Inc. Fluorescein-labeled deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Shared Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The pET-3d expression plasmid along with Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) were provided by Novagen. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was purchased from Research Products International. Kits for DNA purification were products of QIAGEN, Inc. Fast-Q anion exchange resin was a product of Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Toyopearl Ether 650-s hydrophobic interaction chromatography medium was from TosoHaas, Inc.dl-Mevalonic acid lactone, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and all other biochemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Insertion of cDNA into pET-3d utilized an NcoI site, which is positioned just downstream from a T7 promoter. Because the cDNA for HMK does not contain an NcoI site at its N terminus, it was necessary to create one. The pGEM-3Z/HMK construct was used as a template for a polymerase chain reaction in which the codon for leucine 2 (TTG) was changed to valine (GTG). This single base mutation created an NcoI site (CCATGG) that overlapped the start codon of mevalonate kinase. After ligation of the modified cDNA into the pET vector, the N-terminal coding sequence of the resulting HMK/pET-3d plasmid was confirmed by sequencing in both directions using an LKB-A.L.F. automated DNA sequencer and fluorescein-labeled primers. All mutations were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.O. Horton R.M. Pullman J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of the mutagenic primers follow: E19D, 5′-CCTTCATGGAGATCATGCCGTGG-3′; E193A, 5′-CAAGGGGCGAGAATGATTCACGGG-3′; E193Q, 5′-CAAGGGCAGAGAATGATTCACGGG-3′; D204A, 5′-GGAGTGGCCAATGCTGTCAGCACC-3′; D204N, 5′-GGAGTGAACAATGCTGTCAGCACC-3′; and E296Q, 5′-CCTCGTGCTGCAAGAGCTCATTGAC-3′. Each mutant was sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of polymerase chain reaction-generated mutations. Purification of protein from extracts of E. coli transformants was performed through the Fast Q chromatography step as described for rat mevalonate kinase (13Potter D. Wojnar J.M. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fractions containing mevalonate kinase were brought to an ammonium sulfate concentration of 1.5 m; mevalonate kinase does not precipitate under these conditions. The protein was centrifuged to remove insoluble contaminants, then loaded onto a Toyopearl Ether 650-s column (0.7 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4 in 50 mmHEPES, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Mevalonate kinase was eluted with a decreasing linear salt gradient (1.5 m to 0.5m (NH4)2SO4). Protein purity and subunit molecular weight were determined by SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Routine protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein concentration in pure samples can be calculated from absorbance at 280 nm (ε = 0.98 ml × mg−1). Enzyme activity was measured in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C, pH 7.0, in HEPES buffer (100 mm) using a spectrophotometric assay described elsewhere (6Beytia E. Dorsey K.J. Marr J. Cleland W.W. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5450-5458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial velocities at various substrate concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk equations using the program Enz-Fitter (17Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, version 3.0. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). The spin-labeled ATP analog, ATPγSAP, was synthesized as described previously (18Koteiche H.A. Narasimhan C. Runquist J.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15068-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a typical binding study, the concentration of ATPγSAP was kept constant at 30–40 μm and the concentration of protein (either wild type or mutant) was varied. Under the conditions used in this type of experiment, only unbound ATPγSAP produces a signal. Therefore, the fraction of ATPγSAP free in each sample was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the high field spectral line produced in the presence of various concentrations of protein by the amplitude of the signal produced in the absence of protein. A Scatchard plot of the data was used to determine the dissociation constants and binding stoichiometry of ATPγSAP for both wild type and mutant proteins. Using increased gain and modulation amplitude, the spectrum of bound ATPγSAP was also measured; rotational correlation times were calculated from bound spectra using the program of Freed and co-workers (19Schneider D.J. Freed J.H. Biol. Magn. Reson. 1989; 8: 1-76Crossref Google Scholar). Competitive displacement experiments were performed to measure ATP's equilibrium dissociation constants for both wild type and mutant proteins. Various amounts of MgATP were added to a mixture containing ATPγSAP (30–40 μm) and wild-type or mutant enzyme (25–75 μm). The signal produced by the displaced ATPγSAP indicates the concentration of the free analog. This estimate, together with the previously determined dissociation constant of the displaced ligand (K d (ATPγSAP)) was used in a calculation (20Mildvan A.S. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 238-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that provides a value for the dissociation constant for the competing ligand (K d (ATP)). The curve shown in Fig.4 B represents a smooth fit to the experimental data and would extrapolate to background levels of bound probe (<10%) at high ATP concentrations. Reported K d values (Table II) represent the average of individual K d estimates calculated from displacement experiments over the range of 20–80% ATPγSAPbound.Table IIEquilibrium binding parameters and apparent kinetic constants of wild-type and mutant mevalonate kinasesSampleVmKm (DL-MVA)Km (ATP)Kd (ATP)Kd (ATPγSAP)nμmol/min/mgμmWT37 ± 124 ± 374 ± 94 ± 0.52 ± 0.20.8E19D15 ± 152 ± 7113 ± 112 ± 0.63 ± 0.20.9E193Q0.69 ± 0.051020 ± 871560 ± 1481240 ± 2607 ± 0.71.0D204N2-aFor measurement of apparent Vm and Km values for Asp-204 mutants, instead of the standard spectrophotometric assay the more sensitive radioactive assay of Harwood and Rodwell (34) was employed.(7.2 ± 0.4) × 10−412 ± 266 ± 24 ± 0.86 ± 0.70.9D204A2-aFor measurement of apparent Vm and Km values for Asp-204 mutants, instead of the standard spectrophotometric assay the more sensitive radioactive assay of Harwood and Rodwell (34) was employed.(8.3 ± 0.2) × 10−420 ± 325 ± 24 ± 0.70.7 ± 0.070.9E296Q40 ± 311 ± 2131 ± 1912 ± 110 ± 10.82-a For measurement of apparent Vm and Km values for Asp-204 mutants, instead of the standard spectrophotometric assay the more sensitive radioactive assay of Harwood and Rodwell (34Harwood H.J.

Open table in a new tab The pET-3d/HMK construct allowed over expression of mevalonate kinase wild type and mutant proteins in E. coli at a level of approximately 10% of total cellular protein after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Soluble mevalonate kinase is visible as a 42-kDa band after SDS-PAGE of the bacterial lysate and fractions from subsequent purification steps (Fig.1). Fast-Q anion exchange chromatography of the bacterial supernatant produced an enzyme that accounts for >90% of the total protein at this stage of the preparation. Human mevalonate kinase, however, eluted from this anion exchange resin at a higher ionic strength than does the rat enzyme, reflecting the difference in isoelectric points for the human and rat wild type enzymes (4.8 versus 5.5, respectively; data not shown). An attempt to purify human mevalonate kinase using phenyl agarose chromatography failed because this protein proved to be so hydrophobic that it could not be recovered from the phenyl column. An alternative strategy was developed, which successfully exploited a less hydrophobic resin (Toyopearl Ether 650-s) to produce essentially homogeneous protein. The recombinant enzyme exhibited a molecular mass of 78 kDa upon analytical Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), indicating that the enzyme exists in solution as a homodimer of 42-kDa subunits. An identical strategy was used to purify the E19D, E193A, E193Q, D204A, D204N, and E296Q mutant proteins. The mutants E19A, E19Q, and H20A were expressed after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of E. coli transformants, but these proteins were completely insoluble and not further characterized. It is likely that the region in which Glu-19 and His-20 reside has structural importance, potentially stabilizing a folding intermediate. For soluble mutant proteins other than E19D, it was observed that the protein eluted from the anion exchange column at a phosphate concentration 5–10 mm lower than that required for wild-type enzyme elution. This result is not surprising, inasmuch as replacement of a carboxylate anion with a neutral residue decreases the overall anionic characteristics of the protein. No difference in hydrophobic interaction chromatography was observed for soluble mutants compared with wild type enzyme. The purification protocol allowed production of up to 40 mg of purified mevalonate kinase from 1 liter of bacterial culture (Table I), a result that facilitated the kinetic and physical characterization of wild type and mutant proteins outlined below.Table IPurification of human mevalonate kinasePurification stepProteinUnitsSpecific activityYieldmgμmol/minunits/mg%Supernatant2088334100Fast Q536931383Ether 650s165923771 Open table in a new tab Purified mevalonate kinase has a specific activity of 37 units/mg, which is higher than that obtained for mevalonate kinases isolated from pig (6Beytia E.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The apparent Michaelis constants for ATP anddl-mevalonic acid are 74 and 24 μm, respectively (TableII). With regard to regulation of mevalonate kinase, several reports indicate that the enzyme is subject to feedback inhibition by the downstream polyisoprenoid products, geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (7Dorsey J.K. Porter J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4667-4670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tanaka R.D. Schafer B.L. Lee L.Y. Freudenberger J.S. Mosley S.T. J. Biol.

As an additional test of the functionality of our recombinant human enzyme, we tested the efficacy of FPP as an inhibitor. Our results indicate that human mevalonate kinase is highly susceptible to FPP inhibition (K i = 10 ± 1 nm), and that this inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP (Fig.2). The results of this kinetic characterization indicate that the recombinant mevalonate kinase represents a valid model for the tissue-expressed enzyme. Furthermore, as discussed below, the protein's affinity for the inhibitor FPP underscores mevalonate kinase's potential regulatory function in the polyisoprenoid pathway. The catalytic function of carboxylate side chains in phosphotransferase reactions has been well documented for several enzymes, which, like mevalonate kinase, utilize alcohol groups as acceptors. This precedent is based on mutagenesis experiments on phosphofructokinase (23Hellinga H.W. Evans P.R. Nature. 1987; 327: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Berger S.A. Evans P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), human hexokinase (25Arora K.K. Filburn C.R. Pederson P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5359-5362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphoribulokinase (26Charlier H.A. Runquist J.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9343-9350Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as well as on analysis of the crystal structure of glycerol kinase (27Hurley J.H. Faber H.R. Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Pettigrew D.W. Remington S.J. Science. 1993; 259: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Carboxylates have also been implicated as ligands to the cation of the MgATP substrates of these and other phosphotransferases, such as 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (28Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and adenylate kinase (29Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The importance of carboxylates to the function of mevalonate kinase is suggested by the observed sensitivity of this enzyme to modification by the water-soluble carbodiimides,N-(dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide and N-cyclohexyl-N′-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide. 3D. Potter, unpublished data. However, relatively poor protection from inactivation is provided by the substrates, suggesting that these group-specific reagents may modify mevalonate kinase at multiple sites, thus precluding the assignment of a particular function to any one residue. In view of these results, we employed a more focused experimental approach that utilizes the ample sequence data available for mevalonate kinases from a variety of diverse species. Although human mevalonate kinase contains 41 carboxylate residues, comparison of this sequence to those of the protein from Rattus norvegicus (30Tanaka R.D. Lee L.Y. Schafer B.L. Kratunis V.J. Mohler W.A. Robinson G.W. Mosley S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2872-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis thaliana (31Riou C. Tourte Y. Lacroute F. Karst F. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (32Oulmouden A. Karst F. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar),Schizosaccharomyces pombe, 4B. G. Barrell, M. A. Rajandream, and S. V. Walsh, GenBank™ accession number Z54308. and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum 5S. Sharma and J. N. Reeve, GenBank™ accession number U47134. indicated only four invariant carboxylates (Fig.3), which include three glutamic acids (Glu-19, Glu-193, and Glu-296) and one aspartic acid (Asp-204). All of these residues are located in highly conserved regions of mevalonate kinase, an observation that would be expected for functionally important amino acids. Such a small number of conserved carboxylates makes site-directed mutagenesis an attractive approach to assess the function of these acidic amino acids. Replacement of Glu-296 with glutamine resulted in an enzyme that displayed kinetic properties very similar to those of wild type protein (Table II). The initial replacement of Glu-19 with an alanine residue resulted in expression of a protein that was completely insoluble. This was not entirely unexpected, inasmuch as alanine's small aliphatic side chain bears no negative charge and is not isosteric with that of glutamic acid. The isosteric substitution of glutamine for Glu-19 was therefore engineered and the mutant protein expressed, but it too proved to be completely insoluble. Only by replacement of Glu-19 with aspartic acid was a soluble mutant protein obtained. Kinetic analysis indicated that this protein behaves very similarly to wild type enzyme, with only a 2-fold decrease in specific activity and similarly modest changes in apparent Kmvalues for both substrates (Table II). Even such a conservative substitution changes the position of the carboxylate by ∼1.4 Å and has been correlated with a substantial decrease in activity when a catalytic residue is involved (24Berger S.A. Evans P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the catalytic efficiency of E19D approaches that of wild-type enzyme, Glu-19 appears to be an unlikely candidate for a crucial role in reaction chemistry. Replacement of Glu-193 with alanine resulted in a soluble but highly unstable enzyme that lost activity very quickly after purification. However, the isosteric mutant E193Q is a soluble and stable enzyme with decreased catalytic activity (Table II). Although the decrease in catalytic activity is significant (52-fold lower than wild type), it is not as low as would be expected for replacement of a catalytic base (>103-fold). Also significant are the considerably elevated apparent Km values for both substrates (20-fold increase for ATP; 40-fold increase for MVA). These changes in Michaelis constants are discussed below in the context of carboxylate interaction with the cation of the MgATP substrate. The most significant mutagenesis effects were observed when Asp-204 was replaced with either alanine or asparagine. In both cases, no catalytic activity could be detected with the spectrophotometric assay, but a sensitive radioactive assay indicated at least a 104-fold decrease in enzyme activity with little change in apparent Km values. To confirm the significance of these observations and support any consequent speculation concerning function, further characterization was necessary to demonstrate that the mutant proteins possessed substantially unperturbed tertiary structure and, most importantly, intact active sites. Biophysical characterization was therefore performed. The spin-labeled ATP analog, ATPγSAP, contains a paramagnetic PROXYL group tethered to the γ-phosphoryl of ATPγS (18Koteiche H.A. Narasimhan C. Runquist J.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15068-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In buffered solution, this analog exhibits the sharp three-line ESR signal typical of nitroxide spin labels tumbling freely in solution. Upon binding to human mevalonate kinase, the amplitude of the spectral lines attributable to free ATPγSAP diminishes and the broad spectral features assignable to an immobilized spin-label become apparent. The spectrum of the bound species exhibits a maximum hyperfine separation of 64.4 gauss. Spectral simulation of the bound component indicates a rotational correlation time, τc = 26 ns. This value corresponds to immobilization of the nitroxide group on a spherical particle with a Stokes radius of 29 Å. Assuming a partial specific volume of 0.75 ml/g, a protein with such a Stokes radius would have a molecular mass of 83 kDa, which is in agreement with a homodimer of 42-kDa mevalonate kinase subunits. Similar results were obtained for each of the mutant enzymes listed in Table II, confirming that no changes in subunit composition resulted from mutagenesis. Calculation of free and bound ATPγSAP is accomplished by monitoring the change in signal amplitude that results from binding of the spin-label. Performing such an analysis with samples that vary in the ATPγSAP/mevalonate kinase ratio allowed construction of a Scatchard plot (Fig. 4 A), which indicates that ATPγSAP binds to the wild-type human enzyme both stoichiometrically (n = 0.8) and with high affinity (K d = 2.2 μm). The bound analog was displaced by addition of ATP, indicating that the spin-probe binds at the substrate site. By titrating samples prepared using a fixed ratio of ATPγSAP/enzyme with variable amounts of ATP, the competitive displacement of the analog was measured (Fig. 4 B) and a K d (ATP) (4 μm; Table II) was calculated using a method described previously (20Mildvan A.S. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 238-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The value of this equilibrium binding constant for ATP indicates intrinsic affinity for the nucleotide that is considerably higher than might be inferred from apparent Km values, which are influenced by both catalytic and binding parameters. The E19D, E193Q, D204A/N, and E296Q mutant proteins were examined in similar spin labeling experiments. The results of the Scatchard analyses (Table II) indicate that all the mutant proteins tested exhibited dissociation constants for ATPγSAP that were similar to the wild type protein, and that all possessed a full complement of ATP binding sites. This is not a surprising result in the case of E19D, E193Q, and E296Q, which possess substantial catalytic activity when compared with wild type enzyme. These experiments, however, provide a rigor"
https://openalex.org/W2027854976,"To identify the role(s) of the third intracellular loop of the angiotensin II (AngII) type 1A (AT1A) receptor in G protein coupling specificity and receptor activation, several chimerae were constructed and characterized. The cDNA sequence encoding the C-terminal segment of the third intracellular loop of the AT1A receptor (residues 234–240) was replaced with the homologous regions of the α1B adrenergic (α1B-AR), the β2 adrenergic (β2-AR), and the AngII type 2 (AT2) receptors. These chimeric receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their pharmacological and functional properties were characterized, including AngII-induced inositol phosphate and cyclic AMP (cAMP) productions, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and internalization. The affinities of these chimeric receptors for [Sar1]AngII, [Sar1,Ile8]AngII, and losartan were essentially normal; however, the affinity of these mutants was increased by a factor of 10–40 for the AT2-specific ligand CGP42112A. The functional properties of the α1B-AR chimera were essentially identical to those of the wild type AT1A receptor. On the other hand, replacement with the β2-AR segment produced a partial reduction of the inositol phosphate production, a measurable AngII-induced cAMP accumulation, a reduced internalization, and a total impairment to transduce the mitogenic effect of AngII. The AT2 chimera presented a normal internalization, but was inactive in all the other functional tests. In conclusion, the distal segment of the third intracellular loop of the rat AT1A receptor plays a pivotal role in coupling selectivity and receptor signaling via G protein(s) as well as in the activation of the specific signaling pathways involved in the mitogenic actions of AngII. To identify the role(s) of the third intracellular loop of the angiotensin II (AngII) type 1A (AT1A) receptor in G protein coupling specificity and receptor activation, several chimerae were constructed and characterized. The cDNA sequence encoding the C-terminal segment of the third intracellular loop of the AT1A receptor (residues 234–240) was replaced with the homologous regions of the α1B adrenergic (α1B-AR), the β2 adrenergic (β2-AR), and the AngII type 2 (AT2) receptors. These chimeric receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their pharmacological and functional properties were characterized, including AngII-induced inositol phosphate and cyclic AMP (cAMP) productions, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and internalization. The affinities of these chimeric receptors for [Sar1]AngII, [Sar1,Ile8]AngII, and losartan were essentially normal; however, the affinity of these mutants was increased by a factor of 10–40 for the AT2-specific ligand CGP42112A. The functional properties of the α1B-AR chimera were essentially identical to those of the wild type AT1A receptor. On the other hand, replacement with the β2-AR segment produced a partial reduction of the inositol phosphate production, a measurable AngII-induced cAMP accumulation, a reduced internalization, and a total impairment to transduce the mitogenic effect of AngII. The AT2 chimera presented a normal internalization, but was inactive in all the other functional tests. In conclusion, the distal segment of the third intracellular loop of the rat AT1A receptor plays a pivotal role in coupling selectivity and receptor signaling via G protein(s) as well as in the activation of the specific signaling pathways involved in the mitogenic actions of AngII.

On the basis of pharmacological, functional, and structural features, these receptors have been divided into two classes: AT1 and AT2 (for review, see Refs. 1Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Murphy T.J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both types of AngII receptors comprise a heptahelical structure and bind AngII with a high affinity (nanomolar range). The AT1receptors are characterized by a high affinity for nonpeptidic imidazolic compounds (Dup753), by a coupling to several G proteins, but mainly to a G protein of the Gq/11 family that activates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) and, finally, by its ability to transduce most if not all of the physiological actions of AngII. In contrast, the AT2 receptors display a high affinity for derivatives of spinacine (PD123177) or pseudopeptidic AngII analogs (CGP42112A), and their coupling to a G protein or a functional pathway remains questionable (3Mukoyama M.

Mutagenesis of the rat and human AT1 cDNAs or synthetic peptides competing with intracellular loops of the AT1 receptors was used to study the involvement of various intracellular sequences or amino acid(s) in the receptor coupling to Gi and/or Gq/11 proteins. These reports all indicate the crucial role of the third intracellular (i3) loop in Gq coupling (9Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The role of the i3 loop in G protein coupling specificity has been investigated extensively for many heptahelical receptors, including adrenergic, muscarinic, and dopaminergic receptors (see,e.g., Refs. 13Hausdorff W.P.

All these reports have identified amino acids and sequences of the proximal (Ni3) and distal (Ci3) parts of this third intracellular loop involved in G protein interactions and specificities. Moreover, modifications in the Ci3 segment are responsible for constitutive activation of several adrenergic receptors (AR) (17Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 18Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; : 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This concept of constitutively activated receptor has been extended (i) to other classes of G protein-coupled receptors, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone or luteinizing hormone receptors, which contain activating mutations of the i3 loop (20Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21Parma J. Van Sande J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) to other regions of the G protein-coupled receptor (21Parma J. Van Sande J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Blüml K. Mutschler E. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18870-18876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and finally (iii) to the pathology, because several acquired or genetic diseases correspond to a constitutive activation of receptors, due to somatic or germinal mutations of the corresponding genes (23Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Paschke R. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, there are very few activating mutations reported for heptahelical receptors binding to peptidic ligands, such as the AT1 receptor (24Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, accumulating and converging data seem to indicate that the G protein coupling differences between AT1 and AT2 receptors are the consequence of sequence differences in the i3 loop. Initially, the absence of activation or inhibition of either PLC or adenylate cyclase and the absence of modification of AngII affinity in the presence of GTP analogs suggested that the AT2 receptor was not coupled to G proteins (3Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasamura H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, it has been demonstrated that the AT2 receptor could be coupled to G proteins at least in some tissues; Zhang and Pratt (4Zhang J. Pratt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15026-15033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that the AT2 receptor is coimmunoprecipitated with Gi antibodies in rat fetal tissues. Moreover, Buisson et al. (25Buisson B. Laflamme L. Bottari S.P. de Gasparo M. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1670-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AngII is able to inhibit T type calcium currents via a G protein coupled to AT2 in NG108-15 cells. Moreover, the production of chimerae between the AT1 and AT2 receptors seems to indicate that the functional differences between these two receptors lie in the proximal and distal parts of the i3 loop (11Wang C. Jayadev S. Escobedo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16677-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data point out the major role of the i3 loop and especially the distal part of this loop in the signal transduction process. To understand more clearly the role of this segment, we have constructed several chimeric mutants of the Ci3 region of the rat AT1A receptor. The functional comparison of these mutants and the wild type rat AT1A receptor was performed to answer several questions. (i) Is this sequence involved in the selective binding properties of AngII receptors? (ii) Are these mutations able to produce constitutively activated AT1 receptors? (iii) Is this segment responsible for the difference of G protein coupling and signaling between AT1 and AT2 AngII receptors? (iv) Is this segment involved in the mitogenic effect of AngII (DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation)? (v) Is this segment involved in internalization of the AT1receptor? Expression plasmids coding for the mutated receptors were obtained using the previously described synthetic rat AT1A cDNA containing multiple unique restriction sites (26Conchon S. Monnot C. Sirieix M.E. Bihoreau C. Corvol P. Clauser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pECE (27Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). For the three chimeric mutants, residues 234–240 of AT1A receptor were substituted for residues 288–294 of the hamster α1B-AR, residues 267–273 of the human β2-AR, or residues 250–256 of the rat AT2 receptor (Fig. 1). This was achieved by replacing the KspI-KpnI fragment that corresponds to nucleotides 706–768 of the synthetic AT1A cDNA with synthetic oligonucleotide adapters. The identity of each mutant was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase version 2 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). CHO K1 cells were obtained from ATCC (catalog no. CCL61) and were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Boehringer Mannheim). To establish pure cell lines expressing the different mutants, CHO cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of the plasmids and 2 μg of the selection marker pSV2neo, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected for their resistance to 750 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cloned by limiting dilution. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Boehringer Mannheim) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (3 × 106) were plated in 75-cm2 flasks and transfected by the DEAE-Dextran method using 15 μg of DNA/dish. They were immediately transferred to 24- or 12-well culture plates and harvested 48 h after transfection. [Sar1]AngII was labeled by the chloramine-T method. Monoiodinated [Sar1,125I-Tyr4]AngII (125I-[Sar1]AngII, 2000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq), was purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Saturation and competitive binding assays were performed as described (29Bihoreau C. Monnot C. Davies E. Teutsch B. Bernstein K.E. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5133-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured into 24-well culture trays and incubated for 45 min at 22 °C with various concentrations of125I-[Sar1]AngII or competitive ligands in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate. Binding data were analyzed with a nonlinear least-squares curve fitting procedure, using Ebda-Ligand software (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Stimulation by AngII of the inositol phosphate (IP) production was performed as described previously (30Torrens Y. Daguet De Montety M. El Etr M. Beaujouan J. Glowinski J. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured in 12-well culture dishes and labeled for 20–24 h with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham). After 30 min of stimulation with increasing concentrations of AngII in the presence of 10 mm LiCl, IP was extracted and separated on Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) columns. Total IP was eluted with 1 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid. Variations of intracellular calcium levels were measured by dual emission microfluorometry using the fluorescent dye Indo1-AM (Sigma) as described previously (31Marin P. Delumeau J.C. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Premont J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The variations of the fluorescent ratio (measured at 405 and 480 nm) reflect the variations of the intracellular calcium concentrations in response to 10−8m AngII. Experiments were carried out at room temperature in a solution containing 5.5 mm glucose, 145 mm NaCl, 5.5 mmKCl, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mmCaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were cultured in 24-well culture dishes until confluence. After two washes, cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in standard phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% bacitracin, 10−6m bestatin, 5 × 10−6m indomethacin, pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated with increasing concentrations of AngII in the same buffer, for 4 min at 37 °C. The incubation solution was removed, and 0.5 ml of 5% formic acid in ethanol was added in each well for 10 min. This fraction was kept and allowed to evaporate overnight. The cAMP content of each sample was determined by enzymo-immunoassay and the results expressed in picomoles/million cells/4 min. Each determination was performed in duplicate. CHO cells were grown to confluence in 6-well culture dishes and incubated overnight in serum free medium. AngII (0 and 100 nm) was added for 10 or 180 min at 37 °C and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and myelin basic protein phosphorylation were performed as described previously (32Leconte I. Carpentier J.-L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18062-18071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells, in 12-well culture dishes, were incubated for 48 h in starvation medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transferrin (Sigma). Increasing concentrations of AngII were added to this medium for 16 h. Cells were then labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 45 min at 37 °C. The DNA was then precipitated with 10% trichloracetic acid, and the radioactive material was dissolved in 1 m NaOH and counted. Each determination was performed in triplicate. Internalization of wild type and mutant AT1A was measured using the biochemical acid washing procedure. Transfected cells were incubated with 0.4 nm125I-[Sar1]AngII in binding buffer with or without 1 μm [Sar1]AngII for 180 min at 4 °C, washed twice, and placed in binding buffer alone at 37 °C for various times. Finally, cells were placed at 4 °C and processed as described previously (33Conchon S. Monnot C. Teutsch B. Corvol P. Clauser E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t-test. The third cytoplasmic loop of many G protein-coupled receptors has been shown to be implicated in the efficiency and the specificity of receptor coupling to G proteins. To assess whether or not this region was important for angiotensin II receptor transduction, different chimeric or insertion mutants were constructed (Fig.1). In the AT1A receptor, which is mainly coupled to phospholipase C via a Gqprotein, seven residues (234–240) of the Ci3 segment were substituted with the homologous regions of either the α1B-AR (residues 288–294, mutant C-α1), sharing the same major coupling to Gq protein, or the β2-AR (residues 267–273, mutant C-β2), which interacts with Gs protein, or the AT2 receptor (residues 250–256, mutant C-AT2). The mutants were stably expressed in CHO cells and binding characteristics of the different receptors were determined on pure clonal cell lines. As shown in Table I, binding characteristics of the different compounds for all the mutants, except the CGP42112A were in the range of affinities classically described for the AT1A receptor. The substitution of the residues 234–240 of AT1A by any homologous sequence allowed the receptor to bind the AT2-specific antagonist CGP42112A with a significant and at least a 10-fold higher affinity compared with the wild type AT1A receptor.Table IPharmacological characterization of mutant and wild-type AT1Areceptors expressed in CHO cellsa.AT1AC-α1C-β2C-AT2K d (nm)0.53 ± 0.020.94 ± 0.301.40 ± 0.150.54 ± 0.14B max (105 sites/cell)1.72 ± 0.101.14 ± 0.146.84** ± 0.320.54* ± 0.12b.KiAT1AC-α1C-β2C-AT2nmAngII0.49 ± 0.111.31 ± 0.210.87 ± 0.160.53 ± 0.04[Sar1]AngII0.62 ± 0.111.13 ± 0.381.32* ± 0.180.68 ± 0.17[Sar1,Ile8]AngII0.66 ± 0.101.86* ± 0.232.54* ± 0.410.96 ± 0.14Losartan6.51 ± 1.875.95 ± 0.8516.73* ± 1.642.94 ± 0.49CGP42112A4550 ± 380121** ± 13435** ± 87106** ± 29*, p < 0.05 versus wild-type; **,p < 0.01 versus wild-type.

Mutations in the Ci3 segment of bioamine and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors have been shown to cause their constitutive activation. Therefore, to look for a possible effect of the substitutions of this region of the AT1A receptor, the different constructions were transiently transfected in COS cells and the IP accumulation was measured with or without a 100 nmAngII stimulation (see Fig. 2). Relative AngII-induced IP production via the different mutants were comparable to that obtained with the pure CHO cell lines, as discussed in the next section. Basal levels of IP production (in absence of agonist) were compared with the IP content of cells transfected with the expression vector pECE alone. To verify the validity of the procedure, COS cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding either the wild type or a mutated α1B-AR containing a A293K substitution responsible for the constitutive activation of this receptor (18Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, this oncogenic α1B-AR induced a 327% stimulation of IP accumulation whereas all other receptors had no detectable effect. Therefore, under these conditions, none of the AT1A mutants have acquired the ability of coupling to this transduction pathway, in the absence of AngII. To assess the role of this intracellular region in the AngII receptor coupling specificity and efficiency, different functional tests were assayed on the stable CHO clones. The ability of these receptors to activate phospholipase C was investigated first. It has been reported that the amplitude of the IP production is linearly correlated with the number of binding sites (34Monnot C. Bihoreau C. Conchon S. Curnow K.M. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1507-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, for a quantitative analysis, the results were expressed as the ratio IP production/B max (Fig.3). The dose-response curve obtained for C-α1 was comparable to that of the wild type receptor, with 250% and 211% maximal stimulation over basal, respectively. The AngII concentrations required for half-maximal response (EC50) were 1.20 nm for the wild type receptor and 3.53 nm for C-α1. The C-β2chimera displayed an intermediary profile, inasmuch as, via this receptor, AngII induced a maximal stimulation of IP production of 103% over basal, with an EC50 of 0.65 nm. Finally, the substitution with the AT2 residues abolished this effect. To analyze another signaling pathway, the cAMP accumulation in response to increasing doses of AngII was measured in the different pure CHO cell lines (Fig. 4). Neither the wild type AT1A nor the C-α1 and C-AT2mutants could mediate an increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration. The substitution of residues 234–240 of AT1A by the homologous region of the β2-AR resulted in the mutant C-β2 to undergo an AngII dose-dependent accumulation of cAMP (E max = 7.82 pmol/million cells/4 min, EC50 = 5.64 nm). The effect of AngII on DNA synthesis in the CHO cell lines expressing the different mutant receptors was examined. Fig.5 shows the AngII-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA mediated by the mutants compared with the wild type receptor. The C-α1mutant was as potent as the wild type receptor in transducing the mitogenic effect of AngII, with a maximal stimulation of 177% over basal versus 214% for AT1A, and an EC50 of 0.83 nm versus 0.94 nm. The initiation of the DNA synthesis signal in the C-AT2 mutant was abolished completely. Surprisingly, the C-β2 mutant also displayed a total absence of stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. This result has been confirmed with another independent CHO C-β2 cell line, to exclude the possibility of a clonal effect (data not shown). This impairment is not likely to be due to the decreased ability of C-β2 to stimulate phospholipase C because, under the same conditions, other mutants, which do not stimulate IP production more than the C-β2 mutant, transduce the mitogenic action of AngII (data not shown). However, due to its reduced ability to stimulate IP production, the C-β2 mutant could have been unable to elicit a transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration, in response to AngII. Therefore, the AngII-induced intracellular calcium mobilization observed in cells expressing the mutant was compared with that measured in a CHO cell line expressing the wild type receptor with a similar density of sites, using the fluorescent probe Indo1. As shown in Fig.6 b, the C-β2mutant mediates a measurable increase of [Ca2+] i in response to a short (15 s) application of 10−8m AngII. The amplitude of this mobilization is, however, slightly reduced compared with that monitored for the wild type AT1A receptor (Fig. 6 a), in agreement with the AngII-induced IP production observed for these receptors. Therefore, the absence of mitogenic response to AngII in the cells expressing the C-β2 is not the result of an incapacity of this receptor to mobilize intracellular calcium. Because the C-β2mutant increases cAMP production, the effect of the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP at various doses (10−12 to 10−8m) was tested on the AngII-induced thymidine incorporation. The AngII-induced mitogenic response in CHO AT1A cells was comparable with or without the cAMP analog (data not shown). This demonstrates that the presence of low doses of cAMP in the cells does not seem to cause an inhibition of the AngII mitogenic effect. The absence of transduction of the mitogenic signal by the C-β2 mutant justifies the analysis of the MAP kinase activation by AngII in these cells.Figure 6Variations of intracellular calcium concentration in CHO AT1A and CHO C-β2.Variations of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i) in CHO AT1A (a) and CHO C-β2 (b) cells in response to AngII (10−8m) administered for 15 s (bar). Variations in [Ca2+]i are expressed as the variations of the ratio of Indo1 emissions at 405 and 480 nm due to excitation at 355 nm. The effects shown were obtained in a single cell and are representative of the response observed in at least eight separate cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In CHO AT1A cells, AngII induces a biphasic activation of the MAP kinases with a rapid early peak (5 min), followed by a sustained activation (3 h). This delayed MAP kinase activity was shown to be associated with the AngII-induced mitogenic response (35Wen Y.S. Nadler J.L. Gonzales N. Scott S. Clauser E. Natarajan R. Am. J.

As shown in Fig.7, the C-β2 mutant is at least as potent as the wild type receptor in mediating MAP kinase activation. After 180 min of stimulation by AngII, the activity was still 2.84-fold higher than in unstimulated cells. Therefore, the absence of mitogenic actions of AngII via the C-β2 mutant is not due to an impairment in coupling to this signaling pathway. In conclusion, the distal segment of the i3 loop is important for the signaling of the mitogenic effect of AngII. A signaling pathway independent of the MAP kinase activation is potentially involved in this effect, but its nature remains unknown. Finally, the time course of ligand-induced internalization of the different mutated receptors was studied. The patterns of AngII- and [Sar1]AngII-induced internalization of the AT1A receptor are similar (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8, [Sar1]AngII binding to AT1A, C-α1, and C-AT2 triggered a maximal internalization of the ligand-receptor complexes that reached 79%, 70%, and 73%, respectively, of total specific binding within 15 min (t max). The times for half-maximal internalization were also comparable (t½: 4.17, 3.21, and 5.18 min, respectively). Under the same conditions, the ligand-induced internalization of the last mutant, C-β2, was reduced to a maximum of 33.91% of total specific binding, but with normal kinetic characteristics (t max = 15 min,t½ = 5.30 min).

CFTR is composed of two membrane-spanning domains (MSD 1 and 2), which form the Cl− conducting pore, and three cytosolic domains, including the regulatory (R) domain and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD 1 and 2). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation. Phosphorylation of the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a prerequisite for channel activity. ATP binding and hydrolysis at each of the two nucleotide binding domains then mediate the opening and the closing of the Cl− conducting pore. Our current understanding of CFTR regulation comes primarily from studies of how function is affected by nucleotides and nucleotide analogs and by site-directed mutations. The effect of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs (e.g. AMP-PNP, pyrophosphate, orthovanadate, and BeF) on function has revealed the contribution of nucleotide hydrolysis to channel activity (3Anderson M.P.

To date, however, we still have a limited understanding of R domain and nucleotide binding domain structures. Chemical modification provides another means of probing protein structure. When modification of a protein has a functional consequence, identification of the site of modification can provide clues regarding structure-function relationships. Cysteine residues are useful targets for chemical modification. Their uniquely reactive sulfhydryl side chains can be selectively and covalently modified by a number of different sulfhydryl-reactive reagents. As an example, Akabas and co-workers used sulfhydryl-reactive reagents to identify residues in the pore of CFTR (17Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) is a sulfhydryl-reactive reagent that has been frequently used as a tool to disrupt protein structure and function through cysteine modification. For example, Kaback and co-workers used NEM extensively to probe the lactose permease structure (19Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Dunten R.L. Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12644-12650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CFTR contains 18 cysteines, 14 of which are located within intracellular domains (Fig. 1). With this in mind, our first goal was to determine if NEM added to the cytoplasmic surface alters CFTR function. Our second goal was to identify the cysteine(s) responsible for any effect by mutating them to alanines. CFTR mutants were constructed in the pTM1-CFTR4 plasmid by the method of Kunkel (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by restriction digest at silently introduced sites by sequencing around the site of mutation and by in vitro transcription and translation. Wild-type and mutant CFTRs were transiently expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 bacteriophage hybrid expression system as described previously (11Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were studied routinely 4–24 h after transfection depending on the level of expression desired. Methods used for excised, inside-out patch clamp recording were as described previously (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15148) Google Scholar, 23Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Voltages were referenced to the extracellular side of the membrane. Macropatch and single channel data were collected at −40 and −80 mV, respectively, and at 34–36 °C. In excised, inside-out patches of membrane, CFTR was activated by excising into a bath solution containing 1 mm ATP (disodium salt, Sigma) and the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) at a concentration of 75 nm. Prior to use, PKA was suspended in a phosphate-free buffer containing 10 mmpotassium aspartate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 52 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.7. For excised inside-out patch experiments, the pipette (extracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140N-methyl-d-glucamine, 100 aspartic acid, 35.5 HCl, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 TES, pH 7.3, with HCl. The bath (intracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 135.5 HCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 TES, 4 Cs(OH)2/1 EGTA, pH 7.3, with HCl ([Ca2+]free < 10−8m). Single channel current amplitudes were determined from all points histograms. Single channel conductances were derived from the slope of a line fit by a linear least squares regression to single channel I-V relationships at negative potentials where the I-V relationships were linear. Excised macropatch data were filtered at 1 kHz using a variable 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 2 kHz. For single channel analysis, replayed data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz, and digitally filtered at 500 Hz. Events lists for single channel analysis were created using a half-height transition protocol; transitions less than 1 ms in duration were excluded from analysis. All analyses were done using the pClamp 6.0 software package (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Open and closed time constants were derived from the fit of a one- or two-component exponential using the maximum likelihood method. Burst analysis was performed as described previously using a t cs (the time that delineates interburst from intraburst closures) of 20 ms derived from single channel closed time histograms (16Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with a value of 10 or 30 ms for both wild-type CFTR and CFTR-C832A (± PKA). Regions of data from multichannel patches where there were no superimposed openings were used for burst analysis for the CFTR-C832A mutant following PKA washout, as described previously (16Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Results are presented as the means ± S.E. for nobservations. Statistical significance was determined as indicated in the figure legends. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Maleimide reagents were dissolved in ethanol just prior to use. N-Propyl and N-butylmaleimide were obtained from Fluka Chemie (Switzerland). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. To learn whether NEM can modify CFTR and alter its function, we applied NEM to the cytoplasmic surface of CFTR Cl− channels that had been phosphorylated by PKA and ATP. Fig.2 A shows an example from an excised, inside-out macropatch. We found that NEM (100 μm) rapidly stimulated CFTR Cl− channel activity. The effect was irreversible. When ATP was removed following stimulation, current returned to base line, indicating that CFTR still required ATP for channel activity. Fig. 2 B shows the data quantitatively. Because NEM stimulated CFTR in the absence of PKA, its effects were unlikely due to inhibition of a membrane-associated phosphatase. Addition of the vehicle (ethanol) alone had no stimulatory effect on CFTR. As previously reported (3Anderson M.P. Berger H.A. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 775-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), we routinely observed a small amount of “run-down” in channel activity with solution changes (e.g. see Wash in Fig. 2 B) in both NEM-modified and unmodified patches; the cause of this is not known. When we added a 10-fold higher concentration of NEM (1 mm) to patches, there was a rapid and transient stimulation followed by a slow (∼10 min) and irreversible inhibition (n = 3; data not shown). This response is likely due to the initial covalent modification of an accessible site(s) that stimulates activity followed by modification of sites less accessible to NEM that inhibit activity. To understand better the structural requirements on the maleimide for Cl− channel stimulation, we examined the effect of several N-substituted maleimides. We found the following rank order for N-alkyl maleimide-mediated stimulation: N-ethyl ≥ N-propyl >N-butyl ≥ unsubstituted (Fig.3, N-H). The fact that all of these analogs stimulated CFTR suggests that N-substitution with a range of aliphatics can enhance activity and that the site(s) of modification is accessible to reagents as large as N-butylmaleimide. To identify the cysteine(s) through which NEM was mediating its stimulatory effect, we examined the NEM response of CFTR variants in which individual or groups of cysteines were mutated to alanine(s) or deleted (F1450X deletes Cys1458). None of these mutations entirely eliminated the stimulatory effect of NEM, suggesting that modification of more than one site was responsible for the stimulatory effect (Fig. 4). However one mutant, CFTR-C832A, showed a marked decrease in its response to NEM (Fig.4). Cys832 lies in the C-terminal region of the R domain, a domain important in phosphorylation-dependent regulation of CFTR. As an additional test of the site specificity of NEM stimulation, we studied the CFTRΔR variant, in which a portion of the R domain (residues 708–835) is deleted (24Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Anderson M.P. Manavalan P. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). CFTRΔR produces an ATP-regulated channel. Fig. 4 shows that the response to NEM was reduced in CFTR-ΔR as compared with the wild-type protein. These data are consistent with our observation that NEM stimulates channel activity primarily through modification of Cys832. Because NEM, like phosphorylation, covalently modifies the R domain, we did two types of experiments to investigate further the relationship between modification by phosphorylation and by NEM. First, we exposed CFTR-containing patches to NEM in the presence of PKA. Our initial studies (Fig. 2) were done following removal of PKA. Removal of PKA results in a rapid decrease in channel activity (see below) possibly due to the action of membrane-associated phosphatases on CFTR (25Hwang T.-C. Horie M. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 629-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thought that if NEM were mimicking the effect of phosphorylation, we might not observe any further stimulation in the presence of PKA when CFTR was presumably fully phosphorylated. Fig.5 (A and B) shows that NEM stimulated CFTR even in the presence of PKA. In this experiment, however, we may be observing two simultaneous effects: NEM stimulation of CFTR superimposed on NEM inhibition of PKA. As a test of this possibility, we added PKA to an unphosphorylated patch in the presence of 1 mm NEM and found that current was stimulated (data not shown), suggesting that PKA remains functional under the conditions used. Nevertheless, because subtle alterations in PKA activity may have occurred, caution is warranted in interpreting these data quantitatively. Second, we examined the ability of NEM to activate CFTR in the presence of ATP prior to phosphorylation by PKA. Unlike PKA, NEM modification did not elicit channel activity (Fig. 5 C), indicating that it could not entirely replace the effect of channel phosphorylation. Interestingly, a second application of NEM following phosphorylation failed to elicit any stimulation (Fig. 5 C). This result indicates that NEM modification had occurred prior to phosphorylation and that PKA could still activate CFTR despite the modification. Together, these data show that NEM stimulates CFTR through covalent modification of its R domain. NEM modification, however, is not identical to the effects of phosphorylation. In addition, the data suggest that the site of NEM modification is accessible both before and after the channel is phosphorylated. We undertook single channel studies to understand better how CFTR activity is modulated by NEM. Fig. 6 A shows representative single channel tracings of wild-type CFTR. Each tracing is from the same patch of membrane. The top trace was obtained in the presence of ATP and PKA; the middle trace shows current following PKA removal, in the presence of ATP alone; and the bottom trace shows current in the presence of ATP and NEM. Table I shows that when PKA was removed the open state probability (P o) decreased due to a decrease in the length of bursts of activity; none of the other time constants were changed significantly. The addition of 200 μm NEM increased P o because the duration of bursts of activity increased and the length of time the channel spent in the interburst closed state decreased (τcs; Table I). Fig. 7shows an example of the effect of NEM on the distribution of closed times. Because the distributions of bursts were not fit by simple exponential functions, mean values are reported (Table I). The open time (τo), fast-closed time (τcf), and single channel conductance were not affected by NEM.Table ISingle channel data for wild-type CFTR and CFTR-C832AnATP + PKAATPATP + NEMWild-type CFTR P o110.51 ± 0.020.38 ± 0.021-ap < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of PKA and ATP.0.57 ± 0.021-bp < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of ATP only. g (pS)8ND9.6 ± 0.410 ± 0.6 T¯B (ms)5184 ± 16149 ± 81-ap < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of PKA and ATP.237 ± 171-bp < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of ATP only. τo (ms)568 ± 758 ± 756 ± 7 τcf (ms)52.16 ± 0.092.37 ± 0.112.39 ± 0.15 τcs (ms)5141 ± 25152 ± 12118 ± 81-bp < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of ATP only.CFTR-C832A Po7–90.55 ± 0.030.39 ± 0.021-ap < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of PKA and ATP.0.42 ± 0.04 g (pS)6–8ND10.2 ± 0.310.3 ± 0.2 T¯B(ms)3–5194 ± 19130 ± 101-ap < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of PKA and ATP.133 ± 10 τo(ms)3–562 ± 351 ± 550 ± 4 τcf (ms)3–52.07 ± 0.132.63 ± 0.372.18 ± 0.28 τcs(ms)3164 ± 46206 ± 75185 ± 811-a p < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of PKA and ATP.1-b p < 0.05 relative to CFTR in the presence of ATP only.

We did this for two reasons. First, if the CFTR-C832A mutation produced a channel with a very high P o(e.g. nearing a value of 1.0), then it might appear to be resistant to NEM because P o was already near maximal. Second, we wished to learn whether the Cys to Ala mutation altered channel function. The behavior of CFTR-C832A was very similar to that of wild-type protein (Fig. 6 B). In the presence of PKA and ATP, its conductance, P o, burst duration, and gating time constants (τo, τcs, and τcf) were not statistically different from wild-type CFTR (Table I). Like wild-type CFTR, P o and burst duration decreased when PKA was removed from CFTR-C832A. However, in contrast to wild-type channels, burst duration, P o, and τcs were unchanged by 200 μm NEM (p values equal to 0.65, 0.62, and 0.30, respectively; TableI). These data indicate that CFTR-C832A is functionally and structurally similar to wild-type CFTR; however, the failure to respond to NEM identifies Cys832 as an important site of modification. Because NEM modification affected only CFTR channel gating, we speculated that it might be modifying the interaction with ATP. To address this possibility, we examined the effect of NEM on the P o response to increasing concentrations of ATP. NEM had two effects (Fig. 8): it decreased the EC50 from approximately 200 μmto approximately 70 μm, and it increased the maximal P o (νmax)) at 3 mm ATP from 0.41 to 0.62. The change in EC50 can be interpreted as either an effect on ATP binding, hydrolysis, and/or some post-hydrolytic event. The increased P o at high concentrations of ATP suggests that NEM may have altered the rate of ATP hydrolysis or some post-hydrolytic event. We found that the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent NEM rapidly and irreversibly stimulated CFTR channel activity through covalent modification of Cys832 in the C-terminal region of the R domain. These data provide new insights into the mechanism by which the R domain regulates CFTR Cl− channel activity. Previous work has shown that modification of the R domain by phosphorylation (10Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J. Gregory R.J. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E.

One interpretation of those findings was that the net negative charge or charge density of the R domain activated the channel, perhaps by an electrostatic mechanism. Our current data do not exclude an important role for charge in stimulation through the R domain. However, they show that a modification of the R domain with a neutral, bulky, hydrophobic cysteine adduct rather than a charged phosphoserine could also stimulate activity. This result suggests that an alteration in conformation of the R domain might be a key feature that regulates the channel. Consistent with this, Dulhanty and Riordan (28Dulhanty A.M. Riordan J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4072-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of a peptide encoding much of the R domain (residues 595–831) caused changes in conformation as evaluated by circular dichroism. Our results show that stimulation of CFTR through the R domain is not limited to modification of phosphorylation sites. The R domain contains nine consensus dibasic sites for phosphorylation ((R/K)(R/K)X(S/T)). Five of those sites (Ser660, Ser700, Ser737, Ser795, and Ser813) are phosphorylated in vivo, and a cryptic phosphorylation site (Ser753) has been identified (10Cheng S.H. Rich D.P. Marshall J.

Studies in which individual serines or groups of those serines were mutated to alanine have shown that no one site is required for activity, that mutation of some of the sites reduces channel activity, and that mutation of all the sites yielded a channel that was still functional after phosphorylation, albeit at a significantly reduced level (10Cheng S.H.

Our data indicate that modification of a site other than a consensus phosphorylation site and a site that is outside (at least in the primary structure) the region of the R domain that contains the phosphorylation sites (Ser660–Ser813) can also affect function. Moreover, channel stimulation was not limited to modification with a single molecular structure; several different N-substituted maleimides (N-ethyl ≥ N-propyl >N-butyl ≥ unsubstituted) stimulated activity. The phosphorylation studies and our NEM data indicate that covalent modification of many different sites in the R domain can affect function. The effect of NEM and phosphorylation have some similarities. Both treatments involve covalent modification of the R domain. Both modifications stimulate channel activity. Moreover, both interventions decrease the EC50 for ATP-dependent regulation. However, the two modifications differ in that phosphorylation can activate the channel on its own, whereas the effect of NEM could only be observed when channels were phosphorylated. Perhaps maleimide modification may have enhanced the effect of phosphorylation or perhaps modification of sites other than those in the C-terminal end of the R domain may be required to activate CFTR. Our data make some predictions about the environment in which Cys832 resides. The results indicate that Cys832 is both accessible to and reactive with N-ethylmaleimide. Furthermore, its accessibility and reactivity were not significantly altered by the phosphorylation state of the R domain. Stimulation by NEM was complete in less then 2 min, which includes delays due to the time that solutions were changing. When pipetted directly onto the patch, the effect was complete within seconds. In contrast, NEM modification of a cysteine introduced into a transmembrane sequence of the lactose permease required greater than 10 min for completion (29Wu J. Frillingos S. Voss J. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A sulfhydryl-NEM reaction will occur preferentially in an aqueous environment due to solvation of the reactive thiolate species (30Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31Crampton M.R. Patai S. The Chemistry of the Thiol Group. John Wiley & Sons, New York1974: 379-416Google Scholar). Though NEM is lipophilic, the rapidity of its effect suggests that Cys832 is located on the surface of the R domain possibly in an aqueous environment. Based on our data and previous results we speculate that in the R domain the structural requirements for stimulation of activity may not be rigorously defined. That is, precise modification by phosphorylation may not be critical for regulation. This interpretation agrees well with the observation that there is substantial sequence variability in the R domain of CFTR from different species (32Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 221-232PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dulhanty A.M. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); in residues 679–798 interspecies sequence identity is only 23%, despite the fact that this region contains the majority of phosphorylation sites. It is also consistent with the observation that cystic fibrosis-associated mutations are uncommon in the C-terminal two-thirds of the R domain. Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR cause cystic fibrosis (34Welsh M.J. Tsui L.-C. Boat T.F. Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 3799-3876Google Scholar). Our work may have some implications for cystic fibrosis, particularly in patients who bear mutations that produce a protein that is correctly processed to the cell membrane. Though the lack of protein specificity of maleimides prohibits their therapeutic use, their stimulatory effect begins to clarify the structural and functional role of the R domain. Increased understanding of these issues may lead to pharmacologic and/or other rationale approaches by which channel activity can be augmented through modification of R domain structure. We thank Pary Weber, Lisa deBerg, and Gina Hill for excellent technical assistance and our laboratory colleagues for helpful comments and discussions."

The genes were present in all H. pylori strains tested by polymerase chain reaction or slot blotting but not in Campylobacter jejuni. Genes for the putative A and B subunits of H. pylori CoA-transferase were introduced into the bacterial expression vector pKK223-3 and expressed in Escherichia coli JM105 cells. Amino acid sequence comparisons, combined with measurements of enzyme activities using different CoA donors and acceptors, identified the H. pylori CoA-transferase as a succinyl CoA:acetoacetate CoA-transferase. This activity was consistently observed in different H. pylori strains. Antibodies raised against either recombinant A or B subunits recognized two distinct subunits of M r ∼26,000 and 24,000 that are both necessary for H. pylori CoA-transferase function. The lack of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and of succinyl CoA synthetase activities indicates that the generation of succinyl CoA is not mediated by the tricarboxylic acid cycle in H. pylori. We postulate the existence of an alternative pathway where the CoA-transferase is essential for energy metabolism.

Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that establishes long term chronic infections in the human stomach. It has been shown to lead to gastritis, peptic ulcers, and cancer (1Marshall B.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 274: 1064-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2De Koster E. Buset M.

However, despite the importance of H. pylori as a pathogen, little is known about its metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. Information about the metabolism and substrate utilization by H. pylori is essential to understand bacterial colonization and survival and to design new drugs to treat the infection it causes.

Although the CoA-transferases appear to be mechanistically and functionally very similar (5Barker H.A. Jeng I.-M. Neff N. Robertson J.M. Tam F.K. Hosaka S. J. Biol.

The best characterized CoA-transferases are the β-ketoadipate CoA-transferase of Pseudomonas putida and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, and the succinyl CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase found in mammalian mitochondria (12Parales R.E.

The β-ketoadipate CoA-transferase (β-ketoadipate:succinyl CoA-transferase, EC 2.8.3.6) carries out the penultimate step in the conversion of benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in bacteria utilizing the β-ketoadipate pathway. The acetate (butyrate)-acetoacetate CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.9) found among Clostridia acts mainly to detoxify the medium by removing the acetate and butyrate excreted earlier in the fermentation. This enzyme therefore has a role fundamentally different from other CoA-transferases, usually involved in the uptake of substrates for energy and structural use (6Wiesenborn D.P. Rudolph F.B. Papoutsakis E.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 323-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The succinyl CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT, EC 2.8.3.5) is responsible for the formation of acetoacetyl CoA by transfer of a CoA moiety from succinyl CoA to a 3-oxoacid, usually acetoacetate (23White H. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1708-1711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been found to have the highest activity in heart and kidney of various mammals (18Kassovska-Bratinova S. Fukao T. Song X.-Q. Duncan A.M.V. Chen H.S. Robert M.-F. Perez-Cerda C.

Life Sci. 1974; 15: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrion of these tissues, acetoacetate is converted to acetoacetyl CoA, which is further broken down to two acetyl CoA molecules capable of entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Therefore, this enzyme plays a crucial role in ketone body metabolism (18Kassovska-Bratinova S. Fukao T. Song X.-Q. Duncan A.M.V. Chen H.S. Robert M.-F. Perez-Cerda C. Ugarte M. Chartrand C. Vobecky S. Kondo N. Mitchell G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar) as exemplified by the inborn error in humans (25Saudubray J.M. Specola N. Middleton B. Lombes A. Bonnefont J.P. Jakobs C. Vassault A. Charpentier C. Day R. Enzyme. 1987; 38: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of the two subunits of a CoA-transferase from H. pylori. A high degree of homology was found by comparing the deduced amino acid sequences from the two H. pylori genes with the pig and human CoA-transferases as well as with different bacterial CoA-transferases. These comparisons combined with measurements of enzyme activities identify H. pylori CoA-transferase as a succinyl CoA:acetoacetate CoA-transferase. Our data show that the bacterial enzyme is a dimeric protein in contrast to the monomeric eukaryotic homologues and indicate that it is rather a unique feature of H. pylori to harbor such an enzymatic activity, which is not present in Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni. The H. pylori strains are strain 69A (Department of Medical Microbiology, Amsterdam University, The Netherlands) isolated from a patient with nonulcer dyspepsia, strain 888–0 (Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Hamburg University, Germany) isolated from a patient with a duodenal ulcer, strain NCTC 11637, and strains Ly2, Ly3, and Ly13 (Division of Gastroenterology, CHUV Lausanne) isolated from patients with a family history of gastric cancer. The E. coli strains are XL-1 blue and SORL (Stratagene), JM 105 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), M15 (Qiagen), and K12 (Institute of Microbiology, CHUV, Lausanne). Other strains include C. jejuni (Institute of Microbiology, CHUV, Lausanne) and H. felis strain ATCC 49179. H. pylori strains were grown in solid medium containing 3.6% GC agar base (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% Isovitale X (Baltimore Biological Laboratories) and 10% donor horse serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beth Haemek, Israel) and maintained in a microaerophilic atmosphere (85% N2/10% CO2/5% O2) at 37 °C for 2 days. C. jejuni and H. felis were cultivated in blood-agar plates and maintained in the same conditions. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 30 or 37 °C. Solid medium was prepared by addition of 1.5% bacto-agar (Difco). The antibiotics used were: 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 μg/ml tetracyclin, and 40 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). Bacterial DNA was prepared according to the method described by Hua et al. (26Hua J. Birac C. Mégraud F. Lee A. Mégraud F. Helicobacter pylori: Techniques for Clinical Diagnosis & Basic Research. W. B. Saunders Company LTD, London1996: 121-127Google Scholar). Southern blotting and screening of H. pyloriDNA library (see below) were performed with oligonucleotides ICT 14 (5′-GATAAAACCGGCACC-3′) and ICT 20 (5′-GCGGGCGCGTCGTT-3′). Optimal PCR conditions were established using the PCR optimization kit (Boehringer Mannheim) to yield a 1000-bp DNA fragment. PCR was carried out in 50 μl containing 500 ng of H. pylori genomic DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP (Boehringer Mannheim), and a 28:1 mixture of TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH) + Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) (final concentrations, 56 and 2 pm, respectively), in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The cycling program was one cycle consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; hybridation at 50 °C for 2 min; extension at 72 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s; 50 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 1 min and one cycle of 94 °C for 20 s; 50 °C for 20 s; 72 °C for 5 min in the microprocessor controlled incubation system Crocodile III from Appligene. For subcloning in the XbaI and ClaI sites of pBluescript KS− (Stratagene), the oligonucleotides used were ICT 21 (5′-GCTCTAGAGCGATAAAACCGGCACC-3′) and ICT 22 (5′-CCATCGATGGGCGGGCGCGTCGTT-3′). To reconfirm the sequences, the putative open reading frames (ORFs) of the H. pylori CoA-transferase subunits were subcloned in the XbaI and ClaI sites of pBluescript KS− using as primers the oligonucleotides: ICT 22 (see above) and ICT 32 (5′-GCTCTAGAGCCTCTCATTTCGCGCTCCTTGTCG) for the subunit A and ICT 31 (5′-CCATCGATATCACGACAAGGAGCGCGAAATGA-3′) and ICT 33 (5′-GCTCTAGAGCGCTATAGGTGCACTTCAAATTCGG-3′) for the subunit B. The PCR amplification of H. pylori CoA-transferase gene with the primers ICT 22 and ICT 33 were used as a probe for slot blotting. To perform the CoA-transferase activity assays (see below), the putative ORF1 (705 bp), ORF2 (624 bp), or ORF1 and ORF2 (1322 bp) were obtained by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and PstI sites of pKK223-3 (Pharmacia) using as primers ICT 42 (5′-GGAATTCATGAACAAGGTTATAACCG-3′) and ICT 93 (GGAATTCTGCAGCTCTCATTTCGCGCTCCTTGTCG-3′) for the A subunit, ICT 94 (5′-GGAATTCATGAGAGAGGCTATCATTAAAAG-3′) and ICT 43 (5′-GGAATTCTGCAGCTATAGGTGCACTTCAAATTCG-3′) for the B subunit, and ICT 42 and ICT 43 for the A and B subunits. The reaction was carried out under the same conditions except that 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase alone was used and that the pH was set at 8.3. All PCR products were purified using the Geneclean kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The lambda ZAP® II custom H. pylori genomic library (Stratagene) was titered and screened according to the supplier's protocols except that probes were labeled with fluorescein-dUTP (see below). Fourteen positive clones were isolated from the screening of 106phages, and the corresponding pBluescript SK− plasmids were excised from the lambda ZAP II using the ExAssist/SORL system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). One of the positive clones, pGB1, was deleted using the Exo III/Mung Bean nuclease deletion kit (Stratagene) (27Zhu K.Y. Clark J.M. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 222-224PubMed Google Scholar). Two different combinations of restriction enzymes (SacI-XbaI and ApaI-ClaI) were used to create 3′- and 5′-overhanging ends for nested deletions from the T3 or T7 promoter elements of pBluescript SK−. The sequential deletions were generated at intervals of 30 s at 34 °C. After blunt ligation and transformation, sizes of different species obtained were determined by digestion with XhoI or BamHI, respectively. All plasmid DNAs for sequencing were purified using Qiagen tips according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of each plasmid were sequenced on an automatic ALF sequencer using fluoresceinated universal and reverse primers combined with dideoxynucleotides as recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). The presence of the operon including the A and B subunits of H. pylori CoA-transferase was detected by PCR on isolated bacterial genomic DNA using a combination of primers ICT 45 (5′-CGGGATCCCGATGAACAAGGTTATAACCG-3′) and ICT 48 (5′-GGAATTCGTCGACGCTATAGGTGCACTTCAAATTCG-3′). Prior to application to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), 2 μg of genomic DNA samples were denatured in 0.4 m NaOH, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, then heated at 100 °C for 10 min, and neutralized by addition of an equal volume of cold 2 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. Treatment of the membranes and vacuum filtration of denatured DNA samples were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Dot® SF Microfiltration, Bio-Rad). After filtration, DNA was cross-linked to the membranes (UV Crosslinker; Hoefer Scientific Instruments). HaeIII digestions of 10 μg of bacterial genomic DNA were run in 0.7% agarose gels in 0.5 × 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA buffer and transferred to nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim) using a semi-dry electrophoresis transfer cell (Trans-Blot® SD, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). After denaturation, DNA was cross-linked to the membranes as above. The different PCR fragments used as probes were labeled with fluorescein-dUTP using the random prime labeling system from Amersham Corp. Membranes were prehybridized for at least 30 min in DIG Easy Hyb solution (Boehringer Mannheim). After addition of the labeled probe and overnight hybridization at room temperature or at 37 °C, membranes were washed at different stringency conditions (twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 21 °C and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at the indicated temperature) with constant agitation. Blocking of the membrane background and ECL detection were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL detection system, version II; Amersham Corp.). Exposure times of all membranes to x-ray films (X-Omat™AR, Kodak) were chosen to visually optimize the chemoluminescent signals. The two H. pylori putative ORFs were subcloned separately into pQE11 (Qiagen) with primers ICT 45 (see above) and ICT 46 (5′-GGAATTCGTCGACTCTCATTTCGCGCTCCTTGTCG-3′) for the A subunit and ICT 47 (5′-CGGGATCCCGATGAGAGAGGCTATCATTAAAAG-3′) and ICT 48 (see above) for the B subunit. The histidine tagged-fusion proteins were isolated from inclusion bodies and purified under denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described in the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen). The purified products (H. pylori subA-His tag or H. pylori subB-His tag) were used to produce high titer rabbit antisera, recognizing the protein products of H. pylori ORF1 (A subunit) or ORF2 (B subunit), respectively. For detection of H. pylori gene products in Helicobacter or transformed E. coli, cellular lysates (see below) prepared in the presence or the absence of 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μm EDTA were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. After blocking overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.4, filters were incubated 60 min with rabbit serum directed against H. pylori subA-His tag or H. pylori subB-His tag and washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and twice in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Filters were then incubated for 60 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.), washed as above, and developed using the chemoluminescence detection kit (ECL) from Amersham Corp. E. coli JM105 cells (Pharmacia) were transformed with the plasmid pKK223-3 containing the 1322-bp fragment encoding the complete putative H. pylori CoA-transferase (pCoAT), the 705 bp and the 624 bp corresponding to the H. pylori CoA-transferase ORF1 (pCoATA) and ORF2 (pCoATB), respectively, or the H. pylori Urease A gene (pUreA) (28Labigne A.

Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 25 ml of LB/50 μg/ml ampicillin, transferred to 200 ml of fresh medium, and grown up to A 600≈ 0.25. Cells were stimulated with 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Stratagene) for 1 h and harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. For β-ketoadipate CoA and succinyl CoA:acetoacetate CoA-transferase assays, bacteria were washed once with M9 salts minimal medium and harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and pellets were stored at −20 °C until just prior to disruption. Thawed bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Merck). Bacterial suspensions were disrupted by sonication, and debris was removed by centrifugation. For acetate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase assay, the buffer used for bacterial wash and pellets resuspension was 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA. For measuring the generation of succinyl CoA, bacterial pellets were resupended in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. For the determination of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity, bacterial pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and disrupted by mild sonication. Protein concentration in cellular lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with γ globulin as standard according to the supplier's instructions. The β-ketoadipate CoA-transferase assay was performed as described previously (9Yeh W.-K. Ornston L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1565-1569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mix contained 10 mmβ-ketoadipate (Sigma), 400 μm succinyl CoA (Fluka), and 40 mm MgCl2 in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After addition of cell lysate, the increase in A 305, corresponding to the formation of the β-ketoadipyl CoA-Mg2+ complex, was measured. Activity was measured by monitoring the decrease in A 310 due to the disappearance of acetoacetyl CoA as described previously (6Wiesenborn D.P. Rudolph F.B. Papoutsakis E.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 323-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cary J.W. Petersen D.J. Papoutsakis E.T. Bennett G.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol, 40 mm MgCl2, 50 μl of cellular lysate, 100 μm acetoacetyl CoA, and 150 mm potassium acetate as carboxylic acid source. Activity was measured by monitoring the increase in A 310 corresponding to the formation of acetoacetyl CoA as described previously (29Howard J.B. Zieske L. Clarkson J. Rathe L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained 67 mm lithium-acetoacetate, 300 μm succinyl CoA, and 15 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.1. All enzymatic activities were monitored every minute for 4 min. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min under the assay conditions used. The ΔOD of the first minute was used to estimate specific activities, which were expressed as milliunits/mg of total protein in the cellular lysates. The activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was assayed by determining the formation of the reduced form of NADH as described (30Gibson G.E. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Baker A. Carlson K.C. Harding B. Perrino P. Arch. Neurol. 1988; 45: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) except that the reaction was performed in the presence of 1 mm ADP and 10 mm α-ketoglutarate. Measure of succinyl CoA synthesis was performed in the presence of excess hydroxylamine by complexing the succinohydroxamic acid formed to ferric salts (31Reeves H.C. Rabin R. Wegener W.S. Ajl S.J. Norris J.R. Ribbons D.W. Methods in Microbiology. 6A. Academic Press, London1971: 446-448Google Scholar) or by measuring the activity of succinyl CoA synthetase in presence of succinate, CoA, and ATP according to Bridger et al. (32Bridger W.A. Ramaley R.F. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 70-71Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). H. pylori69A chromosomal DNA was amplified by PCR using primers ICT 14 and ICT 20 initially designed to select P-ATPase genes; the resultant PCR product of 1000 bp was partially sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed a striking homology with part of the genes encoding the CoA-transferase family (EC 2.8.3). To verify the specificity of the PCR fragment as a probe, chromosomal DNA from H. pylori strains 69A and NCTC 11637 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme HaeIII and hybridized with the fluorescein-dUTP-labeled PCR product. Strong positive signals were observed with both strain DNAs (Fig.1). The probe was then used for the screening of an H. pyloriZap II library. Phages were amplified in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with the labeled PCR product. Fourteen positive clones were isolated after the third screening. Following in vivo excision, one plasmid named pGB1 was selected for further analysis. Sequencing of pGB1 led to the identification of a 1395-bp fragment of H. pylori genomic DNA. Computer analysis of DNA sequence revealed two adjacent open reading frames designated ORF1 and ORF2 (Fig. 2). The largest open reading frame, ORF1, begins at nucleotide 73, terminates at nucleotide 771, and potentially encodes 233 amino acids. The second one, ORF2, located downstream, extends from nucleotide 771 to nucleotide 1391 and potentially encodes 207 amino acids. Both ORFs are oriented in the same direction. The position of the putative ribosome binding sites (Shine Dalgarno sequences) and the first methionine codons are underlined and written in bold type, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequences were used to search through data bases by using the Blast programs from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package. Significant homologies were found with five amino acid sequences, corresponding to CoA-transferases from very diverse organisms. The sequences of the different CoA-transferases were subsequently compared with each other using the Bestfit program. The protein most closely related to H. pylori ORFs is a B. subtilis protein. This protein of unknown function, listed as a probable β-ketoadipate CoA-transferase, exhibits 75 and 87% similarity with ORF1 and ORF2, respectively. The next most closely related to H. pylori ORFs is the succinyl CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase from pig heart mitochondria (22Lin T.W. Bridger W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 975-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 69 and 74% similarity. The human counterpart was recently cloned, and the amino acid sequence was published (18Kassovska-Bratinova S. Fukao T. Song X.-Q. Duncan A.M.V. Chen H.S. Robert M.-F. Perez-Cerda C. Ugarte M. Chartrand C. Vobecky S. Kondo N. Mitchell G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar); the homology between the human and the H. pylori enzyme is 69% for ORF1 and 74% for ORF2. A significant sequence similarity was also displayed between H. pylori ORFs (60–65% for ORF1 and 69–73% for ORF2) and the β-ketoadipate:succinyl CoA-transferase of P. putida (12Parales R.E. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4657-4666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and A. calcoaceticus (33Kowalchuk G.A. Hartnett G.B. Benson A. Houghton J.E. Ngai K.L. Ornston L.N. Gene (amst.). 1994; 146: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the acetate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase from C. acetobutylicum (21Cary J.W. Petersen D.J. Papoutsakis E.T. Bennett G.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments prepared by using the Pileup program (University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group) confirmed the phylogeny of the different CoA-transferases and showed that H. pylori ORF1 and ORF2 align with the N and C termini, respectively, of the putative Bacillus subtilis, the pig and the human proteins (Fig. 3). Although the three latter enzymes are monomeric, all the other cloned CoA-transferases are made of two different subunits, named A and B. The ubiquity of the putative CoA-transferase gene(s) was monitored on chromosomal DNA by PCR amplification of the whole operon from nucleotides 73 to 1394 (Fig. 4 A). All H. pylori strains tested (lanes 7–11) presented a strong positive signal. In contrast, no specific band was observed when using genomic DNA of E. coli JM 105, C. jejuni, or H. felis. To confirm the presence or the absence of similar sequences to that of H. pylori CoA-transferase in other bacteria, the bacterial DNAs were analyzed by slot blot and hybridized to the CoA-transferase AB probe using different stringency conditions (Fig. 4 B). At the highest stringency conditions used (68 °C), only the CoAtransferase genes of H. pylori strains were detected; however, signals observed at 42 °C indicated that genes homologous to H. pylori CoA-transferases were present in H. felis and E. coli JM 105 genomes. To confirm that the H. pylori enzyme was made of two subunits as suggested by the analysis of the nucleotide sequences, the H. pylori genes encoding the two ORFs were separately cloned into pQE11, overexpressed in E. coli M15 with six extra histidine residues at the amino end and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The purified recombinant proteins were injected into rabbits to yield specific antibodies against each ORF product. The anti-ORF1 and the anti-ORF2 antisera were then used to detect the endogenous H. pyloriCoA-transferase. The antisera recognized two separate proteins of M r ∼26,000 (A subunit) and 24,000 (B subunit) (Fig. 5, lanes 1, A and B), respectively, confirming the dimeric structure of the putative CoA-transferase. The same results were obtained when cellular lysates were prepared in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fig. 5, lanes 2, A and B), thus ruling out a serine protease type digestion of a monomeric precursor as reported for the eukaryotic homologue (22Lin T.W.

Replacement of His-56 by Arg and His-66 by Tyr results in the loss of the high-potential heme and of the low-potential heme, respectively. These data support the assignment of the axial ligands to the low-potential heme (His-66 and His-187) and to the high-potential heme (His-56 and His-205). This pairing is consistent with the model proposed for NarI of the nitrate reductase of Thiosphaera pantotropha (Berks, B. C., Page, M. D., Richardson, D.

EPR and optical studies suggest that the low-potential heme (E m ,7 = +17 mV) and the high-potential heme (E m ,7 = +122 mV) are located near the periplasmic side and the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, respectively.

Nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) 1The abbreviations used are: NarGHI, nitrate reductase A holoenzyme; BV⨥, reduced benzyl viologen; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane sulfonic acid; NarGH, soluble catalytic dimer of nitrate reductase A; NarI, cytochrome subunit of NarGHI (cytochrome b nr). is the predominant respiratory complex in the membrane of Escherichia coli when the cells are grown under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate. This complex catalyzes electron transfer from quinol to nitrate coupled to proton release into the periplasm and the generation of a concomitant transmembrane proton electrochemical potential (1Jones R.W. Lamont A. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NarGHI is a complex of three non-identical subunits, NarG (150 kDa), NarH (60 kDa), and NarI (25 kDa), in the ratio of 1:1:1 as predicted by the operon organization. This complex is arranged in two catalytic domains: the NarGH subunits constitute the cytoplasmic domain and NarI the membrane anchor domain (2Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Ballard A.L. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NarGH domain contains four [Fe-S] centers (4Blasco F. Iobbi C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Guigliarelli B.

The NarI subunit (cytochrome b nr) is a diheme b-type cytochrome required for attachment of the cytoplasmic domain to the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane (3Ballard A.L. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and it mediates electron transfer from the membrane quinol pool (menaquinol or ubiquinol) to the molybdenum cofactor (2Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Craske A. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Optical redox titrations demonstrate the presence of two hemes in NarGHI with midpoint potentials (E m ,7 values) of +17 and +122 mV (8Hackett N.R. Bragg P.D. FEBS Microbiol.

Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) leads to a topological model in which five transmembrane α-helical segments (helices I-V) are arranged with a periplasmic N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus (13Berks B.C.

Five His residues are present in predicted transmembrane segments, at positions 56, 66, 74, 187, and 205. Sequence alignment of all known sequences of NarI from various bacterial membrane-bound nitrate reductases (4Blasco F. Iobbi C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. Mol. Gen.

Genet. 1990; 222: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) reveals only four totally conserved histidines (His-56,His-66 in helix II and His-187,His-205 in helix V) as potential heme ligands, thereby excluding His-74 within helix II in heme ligation (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overall, this strongly suggests ligation of each heme by two histidine residues (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because of the different spacing of the conserved histidines on helix II (9 residues) and V (17 residues), the hemes probably lie in two planes with different angles relative to the plane of the membrane. Recently, an alternative model for heme ligation in NarI has been proposed by van der Oost et al. (15van der Oost J. Nederkoorn P.H.J. Stouthamer A.H. Westerhoff H.V. van der Spanning R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) on the basis of subunit stoichiometry and sequence analysis of various b-type cytochromes. This model predicts that the hemes are sandwiched in a NarI dimer and ligated only by His-187 and His-205 of helix V of each NarI subunit. Genetic procedures are, therefore, required for identifying the heme ligands and to distinguish the different models. In the present work, we have used site-directed mutagenesis, as well as optical and EPR spectroscopies, to test whether the two conserved histidine residues within helix II (His-56 and His-66) are heme ligands and, if so, to assign each histidine to either the low or the high-potential hemes. This work provides the first experimental evidence of the coordination of the hemes by His-56 and His-66 of the NarI subunit of E. coli NarGHI, and it is suggested that the two conserved histidine residues located in helix V (His-187 and His-205) are the other two heme ligands. It is also demonstrated by EPR studies that the low-potential heme is located close to the periplasmic side of the membrane and that the high-potential heme is near the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. We have also studied the biogenesis of NarI by overexpressing this subunit in the absence of the membrane-extrinsic NarGH dimer. The E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. Plasmids pVA700 and pCD7 carry the narGHJI operon and the narI gene, respectively, under the control of the tac promoter (ptac).

The polymerase chain reaction products were double-digested by SstII and SalI, and the restriction fragments were ligated with similarly cleaved expression plasmid pVA700. All mutated constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The resulting constructs were used to transform E. coli strains LCB2048 and LCB79. This permitted isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced overexpression of NarGHI [H56R] and NarGHI[H66Y]. Cultures were grown microaerobically at 37 °C with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induction in rich medium as described previously (19Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 100 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm). Cells were subjected to French pressure lysis and differential centrifugation to prepare crude membrane fractions as already described (19Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Membranes were frozen in liquid N2and stored at −70 °C. The activity of nitrate reductase with benzyl viologen as substrate was assayed by a method modified from Jones and Garland (20Jones R.W. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Augier V. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Activities with menaquinol and ubiquinol were measured as described previously by Guigliarelli et al. (19Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4828-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded using a DW2A Chance AMINCO spectrophotometer. Samples of LCB2048 membranes enriched in wild-type or mutant NarGHI or NarI were diluted with 100 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) to identical protein concentration (10 mg ml−1). No further oxidant was used and reduced minus oxidized difference spectra were collected after subsequent addition of a few grains of dithionite to the sample cuvette. Low-temperature spectra were recorded in the range of 500 to 650 nm at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). For studies of wild-type or mutant NarGHI holoenzyme membranes were prepared from E. coli LCB79 transformed with the appropriate plasmids. For studies of NarI overexpressed from the plasmid pCD7, this plasmid was transformed into E. coli LCB2048. Redox titrations were performed as described previously (22Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-900 flowing helium cryostat. Instrument conditions and temperatures were as described in the individual figure legends. Each NarI mutant strain was assessed for its ability to support cell growth under conditions that require nitrate reductase activity. Only the strain carrying the wild-type plasmid pVA700 can grow under anaerobic conditions on a glycerol-nitrate minimal medium indicating that the NarI mutant holoenzymes encoded by plasmid pVA700-H56R and pVA700-H66Y fail to catalyze electron transfer from the quinol pool to the molybdenum cofactor of NarG (data not shown). E. coli SHSP18, a hemA mutant, is unable to grow under conditions requiring functional NarGHI (data not shown), indicating that the presence of heme is necessary for electron transfer within NarGHI. To determine if the inability of the NarI mutants to grow anaerobically is due to an alteration of the assembly of the nitrate reductase complex to the membrane, the amount of enzyme present in each subcellular fraction was determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. The amount of overexpressed mutant enzymes is nearly 10 times that of the parental strain MC4100, and 60–70% of both mutant enzymes (as measured by NarGH content) are associated with the membrane (TableII), compared with 97% for the wild-type. In membranes from SHSP18/pVA700, only 40% of the enzyme is associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (Table II). Overall, these results indicate that the assembly or the stability of the NarGHI holoenzyme has been modified as a consequence of the NarI-H56R and NarI-H66Y mutations and that both hemes are required for full assembly of the enzyme to the membrane.Table IILevels of nitrate reductase in membrane and cytoplasmic fractionsStrainsImmunoprecipitated nitrate reductaseBV · +-nitrate reductase activitymg of NarGH%Total activity2-aExpressed in micromole of nitrate reduced min−1.%2-bExpressed as percentage of the sum of the activities present in the soluble and membrane fractions.Specific activity2-cExpressed in μmol of nitrate reduced min−1 (mg of NarGH)−1.MC4100M 692M 59894100S 0.58S 37674LCB2048/pVA700M 6397M 630398100S 23S 128264LCB2048/pVA700-H56RM 4265M 19746247S 2335S 12103853LCB2048/pVA700-H66YM 4163M 36086588S 2437S 19433581SHSP18/pVA700M 2040M 8602943S 3060S 210071702-a Expressed in micromole of nitrate reduced min−1.2-b Expressed as percentage of the sum of the activities present in the soluble and membrane fractions.2-c Expressed in μmol of nitrate reduced min−1 (mg of NarGH)−1. Open table in a new tab In vivo, quinones are obligatory redox carriers for the nitrate reductase system of E. coli and both menaquinone and ubiquinone can act as electron donors in cells growing under anaerobic conditions (23Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activities of wild-type and mutant NarGHI-enriched membranes were determined using the quinol analogs menadiol and duroquinol as electron donors. In both mutants, there is no activity (data not shown). The NarI mutant membranes were also assayed for the NO3−-dependent reoxidation of reduced benzyl viologen (BV⨥) for which NarI is not required (2Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Buc J. Santini C.L. Blasco F. Giordani R. Cardenas M.L. Chippaux M. Cornish-Bowden A. Giordano G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wild-type NarGHI has a specific activity of 100 μmol of nitrate reduced min−1 (mg of NarGH)−1 (TableII). The specific activities are lowered in the H56R mutant (47 μmol of nitrate reduced min−1 (mg of NarGH)−1) and the SHSP18 mutant (43 μmol of nitrate reduced min−1 (mg of NarGH)−1) and to a lesser extent in the H66Y mutant (88 μmol of nitrate reduced min−1 (mg of NarGH)−1). Thus, each mutant NarGHI is catalytically active with BV⨥ as electron donor, but inactive with quinol as electron donor. It appears that the absence of both b-type hemes in the SHSP18 mutant strain leads to a modification of the cytoplasmic domain (NarGH) of NarGHI which results in a lower catalytic activity with BV⨥ as electron donor. Under the growth conditions used herein, the cytochrome bd complex (25Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9159-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the major cytochrome component in the background strain LCB2048 (Fig.1 e). The amount of optically detectable NarI-associated heme present in the LCB2048/pVA700 membranes is substantially greater than the amount of cytochrome found in the background strain LCB2048 (cf. Fig. 1, a and e). This facilitates spectroscopic analysis of the hemes of NarGHI-enriched membranes without further purification of NarGHI or the NarI cytochrome subunit. To characterize the hemes of wild-type NarI, we used the LCB2048/pVA700 and LCB2048/pCD7 strains which allow overexpression of NarGHI and NarI alone, respectively. The low-temperature spectrum of membranes from LCB2048/pVA700 is characteristic of b-type hemes and exhibits a single α-band absorption peak with a maximum at 556 nm (Fig. 1 a). Higher derivative analysis of the α-band absorption peak in the NarGHI spectrum does not lead to the resolution of additional components (data not shown), suggesting that both hemes contribute equally to the spectrum. Instead of the single α-band absorption peak at 556 nm observed for the NarGHI holoenzyme, the dithionite-reduced NarI spectrum of the LCB2048/pCD7 strain shows two α-band absorption peaks at 553 and 558 nm (Fig. 1 d). Possible explanations for the presence of two α-bands in the NarI spectrum include: (i) the absence of the cytoplasmic dimer leads to a large modification of the optical properties of one heme, probably the heme located closest to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (see below), leading to a blue shift of its α-band or (ii) one heme is missing and the remaining one exhibits a spectrum with a split α-band. Partial reduction of membranes enriched in NarI alone with ascorbate results in no detectable change in the line shape, suggesting that both absorption peaks arise from a single species. The EPR spectrum of oxidized membrane-bound NarGHI has peaks at gz = 3.36 and gz = 3.76 corresponding to two low-spin heme iron atoms (Fig.2 A, ii and iii). This type of EPR signal (highly anisotropic low spin, HALS) with a gz > 3.3 is found for several membrane-intrinsic cytochromes b for which His residues are proposed to serve as ligands (26Salerno J.C. Leigh J.S. J. Am. Soc. Trans. 1984; 106: 2156-2159Google Scholar, 27Palmer G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 548-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Walker F.A. Huynh B.H. Scheidt W.R. Osvarth S.R. J. Am. Soc. Trans. 1986; 108: 5288-5297Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of the negative control sample (LCB79) (Fig. 2 A, i) does not exhibit the gz = 3.76 and 3.36 peaks, confirming that these can be assigned to the hemes of NarI. The line shapes of these two peaks and spectra recorded of site-directed mutants of the NarI subunit (see below) strongly suggest that they each arise from one of the hemes. The EPR spectrum of NarI in the absence of the membrane-extrinsic NarGH dimer does not have a gz peak at 3.76 (Fig. 2 B,ii), instead there are peaks at gz = 3.15 and gz = 2.92. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments (see below) suggest that the gz = 3.15 peak arises from a slight modification of the environment of the heme responsible for the gz = 3.36 peak of the NarGHI holoenzyme (Fig. 2 A,ii and iii). The gz = 2.92 peak may be due to a dramatic modification of the environment of the heme responsible for the gz = 3.76 peak of the NarGHI holoenzyme, or it may be due to an altered conformation of the heme responsible for the gz = 3.15 signal. EPR signals with a low-field component (gz) at g = 2.92 have been observed for conformationally modified (or “relaxed”) membrane-bound b-type cytochromes (29Crouse B.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Salerno J.C. McGill J.W. Gerstle G.C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 257-261Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overall, the EPR spectra of membranes enriched in NarI demonstrate that the correct insertion of both b-type hemes requires the presence of the NarGH dimer. To assign a redox potential to each heme of the NarI subunit, redox titrations were performed on NarGHI-enriched membranes at pH 7. Redox titrations corroborated the presence of a high-potential and a low-potential heme component in the NarI subunit (Fig.3). At a redox potential (E h) of −81 mV, the two hemes of NarI are reduced (diamagnetic), and no gz signals can be detected. At +8 mV, the heme with the gz = 3.36 value is oxidized (paramagnetic), while the heme with the gz = 3.76 is reduced. At 253 mV both hemes are oxidized and paramagnetic. The intensity of the gz = 3.76 peak plotted versus the redox potential can be fitted to a single n = 1 component with an E m ,7 of +110 mV (inset, Fig. 3). Due to the broadness of the gz = 3.36 peak and baseline constraints, it was not possible to accurately plot the intensity of this peak versus E h, but it is clear from the spectra of Fig. 3 that its E m ,7 lies somewhere between −28 and +34 mV. Thus, the broad symmetrical gz peak at 3.36 can be attributed to the low-potential heme of E m ,7 = +17 mV, and the gz peak at 3.76 can be attributed to the high-potential heme of E m ,7 = +122 mV at pH 7 (E m ,7 values from Hackett and Bragg (8Hackett N.R. Bragg P.D. FEBS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 13: 213-217Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). To determine the location of the high- and low-potential hemes within the proposed transmembrane topology of NarI (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and to assign His ligands to these hemes, we studied the effects of two mutations of conserved His residues, NarI-H56R and NarI-H66Y, on the optical and EPR properties of NarGHI. The NarI-H66Y mutant enzyme in membranes exhibits a symmetrical α-band at 556.5 nm in reduced minus oxidized spectra (Fig. 1 b), which has a lowered intensity compared with that exhibited by the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1 a). The optical spectrum of the NarI-H56R mutant exhibits a spectrum with a split α-band (Fig. 1 c), similar to that observed in LCB2048/pCD7 membranes (Fig. 1 d), suggesting that a similar modification of the conformation is induced by the presence of the H56R mutation at the cytoplasmic end of helix II of NarI. Fig. 4 shows EPR spectra of membranes containing overexpressed NarGHI[H56R] and NarGHI[H66Y] mutant holoenzymes. The NarI-H56R mutation results in the loss of the gz = 3.76 peak (Fig. 4 c) that has been assigned by redox potentiometry to the high potential (E m ,7 = +122 mV) heme. The remaining feature arising from NarI in the spectrum is a peak at gz = 3.15, similar to that observed in the spectrum of NarI expressed from pCD7 (Fig. 2 B). This also correlates with optical spectra of membranes containing NarI and NarGHI[H56R] (Fig. 1, c and d), suggesting that the loss of the high-potential heme or the absence of the membrane-extrinsic NarGH dimer results in a modification of the environment of the low potential (E m ,7 = +17 mV) heme. Fig. 4 d shows the effect of the NarI-H66Y mutation. In this case the gz = 3.76 peak is present, but the gz = 3.36 peak is absent. These data are consistent with an assignment of the low potential heme to His-66 and the high potential heme to His-56, and with a proposed location of the high potential heme toward the cytoplasmic face of NarI in the model of Berks et al. (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The specific BV⨥:NO3− oxidoreductase activity of the NarGHI[H56R] and NarGHI[H66Y] holoenzymes are 47 and 88% of that of the wild-type, respectively (Table II). We have previously shown that the BV⨥:NO3−oxidoreductase activity appears to be independent of the presence of NarI (2Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Buc J. Santini C.L. Blasco F. Giordani R. Cardenas M.L. Chippaux M. Cornish-Bowden A. Giordano G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether the NarI-H56R mutation has any effect on the assembly or conformation of the NarH [Fe-S] clusters. Fig. 5 shows EPR spectra of these [Fe-S] clusters. Fig. 5, a–c, shows dithionite-reduced spectra of the wild-type, NarI-H56R, and NarI-H66Y mutants, respectively. These spectra are essentially identical to that reported for dithionite-reduced wild-type NarGHI in membranes (31Magalon A. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are minor differences in their line shape and intensities, the reduced spectra correlate with the concentrations of NarGHI estimated by rocket immunoelectrophoresis (Table II). In the ferricyanide oxidized spectra (Fig. 5,d–f), it is clear that the NarI-H56R mutation results in a significant modification of the line shape of the [3Fe-4S] cluster, indicating that its oxidation is incomplete at the concentration of ferricyanide used here. This suggests that the loss of the high potential heme in the NarI-H56R mutant modifies the environment of the [3Fe-4S] cluster, which is consistent with a location of this heme close to the NarI-NarGH interface region in the NarGHI holoenzyme. Two different models for the ligation of the hemes of NarI have been generated on the basis of sequence analyses and theoretical rules on the ligation of b-type hemes (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15van der Oost J. Nederkoorn P.H.J. Stouthamer A.H. Westerhoff H.V. van der Spanning R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In such models, the functional role of the well conserved His residues of helix II (His-56 and His-66) is contentious. In the model of van der Oost et al. (15van der Oost J. Nederkoorn P.H.J. Stouthamer A.H. Westerhoff H.V. van der Spanning R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 193-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), these residues are not involved in heme ligation. In the model of Berks et al. (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), they act as ligands in conjunction with the His-187 and His-205 of helix V. The data presented herein favor the latter model. The functional importance of the His residues of helix II in heme ligation was established here by replacing His-56 and His-66 with Arg or Tyr, respectively. As shown by low-temperature optical and EPR spectroscopy, the NarI-H56R mutant is devoid of the high-potential heme, whereas the NarI-H66Y mutant is devoid of the low-potential heme. These results are the first experimental evidence of ligation of both b-hemes by His residues of helix II in NarI. Given the similarity between the heme EPR spectra (Fig. 2) and those presented for other membrane-intrinsic cytochromes b for which bis-histidine ligation has been demonstrated, it is very likely that the hemes of NarI also have such a ligation. Berks et al.(13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have proposed that the two additional heme ligands are His-187 and His-205, both of which are in helix V. Preliminary optical spectroscopy of His-187 and His-205 mutants supports this model for heme ligation by NarI. 3A. Magalon, R. A. Rothery, D. Lemesle-Meunier, and F. Blasco, unpublished results. Comparison of the potentiometric titration data from the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3) with the effect of the H56R mutation on the heme EPR line shape (Fig. 4) indicates that the high-potential heme is located toward to the cytoplasmic side of NarI in close juxtaposition with the [3Fe-4S] cluster of NarH (Fig. 5). That the heme optical and EPR spectra in the pCD7-overexpressed NarI are similar to those of the NarGHI[H56R] holoenzyme also suggests that the conformation of the NarI subunit is dependent on the presence of the NarGH dimer. These results support a model for the NarI-NarGH interface region in which electron transfer occurs between the high-potential heme and the [3Fe-4S] cluster of NarH. EPR analyses of both hemes of NarGHI show gz values >3.0. Attempts to rationalize such large g values within a number of membrane-bound b-type cytochromes have relied upon the assumption of distortion at the heme center controlled by the orientation of the imidazole rings (29Crouse B.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Hägerhäll C. Aasa R. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7411-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Palmer (27Palmer G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 548-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) has proposed that if the two imidazole-ring planes of the ligating histidines are gradually rotated from a parallel orientation, which gives a gz of about 3.0, toward a perpendicular orientation, the gz increases, and the g y and g x components of the EPR signal become progressively smaller. Hence, the highly anisotropic heme of NarGHI with a g value of 3.76 reflects an asymmetrical ligand field at the heme due to a near perpendicular orientation of the two axial ligands. This is in disagreement with the model of Berks et al. (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) in which both hemes are ligated with the two imidazole rings approximately coplanar. Recently, Banci and co-workers (33Banci L. Rosato A. Turano P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 364-367Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have proposed a correlation between ligand-field parameters and the reduction potential of the iron atom. It seems that in our case the EPR gz values of both hemes follow the same trend as predicted by Banci et al., as the heme with the highest gz (gz = 3.76) has the higher E m ,7value (+120 mV). The absence of the cytoplasmic dimer in samples containing NarI overexpressed from pCD7 results in the appearance of new EPR features at gz = 3.15 and gz = 2.92 and in the absence of the gz = 3.76 signal corresponding to the high-potential heme located closest to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Two possible interpretations of these results can be proposed. (i) First, both hemes are present in the pCD7-overexpressed NarI, but the gz = 3.76 heme is in a relaxed conformation (gz = 2.92), and the gz = 3.36 peak moves to gz = 3.15. This could be explained by a perturbation (or “relaxation”) of the orientation of the imidazole rings of the heme bis-histidine ligands located at the NarI-NarGH interface, yielding a gz = 2.92 peak in the EPR spectrum. This correlates with the NarI-H56R mutant in which the gz = 3.76 peak is absent, but gz = 3.15 peak corresponding to the other heme is present. However, this interpretation is not in accordance with the optical data obtained with membranes containing NarGHI[H56R] and NarI alone under the same conditions. (ii) Alternatively, the absence of the NarGH dimer leads to the high-potential heme not being inserted as suggested by the absence of the gz = 3.76 signal. The resulting modified structure of NarI leads to a modification of the g values of the remaining heme (i.e. gz = 3.36 toward gz = 3.15), and the partial formation of conformationally modified (or relaxed) heme as evidenced by the gz = 2.92 peak. Thus, both EPR features in the NarI spectrum (from LCB2048/pCD7 membranes) may arise from the same heme species, resulting in essentially identical optical spectra observed for NarI alone and the NarGHI[H56R] holoenzyme. Unfortunately, due to the broadness of the heme EPR spectra, interfering baseline signals, and baseline constraints, it was not possible to further test this hypothesis by carrying out spin quantitations on the various membrane samples used here. However, we favor the second hypothesis as it is in accordance with both EPR and optical data. Anchoring of NarGH to NarI probably leads to conformational changes within the heme binding pocket, facilitating heme insertion and stabilization of the whole structure of the NarGHI holoenzyme. When the NarI-H56R and NarI-H66Y mutants are overexpressed from a plasmid construct encoding only the mutated narI gene (pCD7), both hemes are absent (data not shown). It seems that the structure of the mutant NarI is not competent for stabilization or insertion of the hemes in absence of the cytoplasmic dimer. Therefore, heme insertion must depend on some aspects of the quaternary interaction within NarGHI. Such a phenomenon has already been described for the assembly of the Bacillus subtilis and E. coli succinate:quinone oxidoreductases (34Hederstedt L. Andersson K.K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 735-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Nakayama S. Viba C.R.T. Gennis R.B. Nakayashiki T. Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol.

Acta. 1991; 1089: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the latter case, heme insertion in the different membrane-bound subunits can only occur after the complete formation of the cytochrome bd oxidase complex. In the case of the cytochrome b 560 in bovine heart succinate-ubiquinone reductase, the pronounced changes in EPR properties that accompany isolation of the cytochrome b 560 are attributed to perturbation of the orientation of the imidazole rings of the heme bis-histidine ligands (29Crouse B.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the case of the B. subtilis cytochrome b 558, the hemes in the whole complex II and in the isolated cytochrome subunit are not in the same environment as judged by differences in the optical absorption and EPR spectra (32Hägerhäll C. Aasa R. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7411-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The location of the low-potential heme toward the periplasmic side and the high-potential heme toward the cytoplasmic side of NarI suggests that the flow of electrons through this subunit is from the periplasmic side inwards, as proposed by Berks et al. (13Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicates the importance of both hemes of NarI in mediating electron transfer from quinol to nitrate within NarGHI. The effect of the NarI-H56R mutation on the [3Fe-4S] cluster of NarH strongly implies that this center accepts electrons from the high potential heme of NarI. The ultimate goal of our structural studies on this protein is to model the electron transfer within NarGHI and locate the reaction sites on the protein of external ligands such as quinones and inhibitors. These studies are currently underway in our laboratories. The SHSP18 strain was generously provided by Prof. B. J. Bachmann. We thank Drs. Wolfgang Nitschke and Marcel Asso for helpful discussions."

Replication across such lesions may occur by a mutagenic bypass process in which a wrong base is inserted opposite the lesion or may involve processes that are relatively error-free. Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have indicated the requirement of REV3-encoded DNA polymerase in mutagenic bypass. The DNA polymerase responsible for error-free bypass, however, has not been identified, but genetic studies implicating proliferating cell nuclear antigen in this process have suggested that either DNA polymerase δ or DNA polymerase ε may be involved. Here, we use temperature-sensitive (ts) conditional lethal mutations of the S. cerevisiae POL2 and POL3 genes, which encode DNA polymerase ε and δ, respectively, and show that post-replicational bypass of UV-damaged DNA is severely inhibited in the pol3-3 mutant at the restrictive temperature. By contrast, the pol-2-18 mutation has no adverse effect on this process at the restrictive temperature.

Lesions in DNA formed by UV light and many other DNA damaging agents are removed by nucleotide excision repair. However, if UV damage is not removed and replication is initiated from templates containing such lesions, because of the inability of the replicative machinery to bypass damage, a gap is formed in the newly synthesized strand across from the damage site. In Escherichia coli, this gap is filled in by error-free recombinational or mutagenic bypass processes (for a review see Ref. 1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Recently, it has been shown that Rev3, together with Rev7, has a DNA polymerase activity (Polζ) that can bypass a thymine-thymine cis-syn cyclobutane dimer (10Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Rev3 is the catalytic subunit of Polζ (11Morrison A. Christensen R.B. Alley H. Beck A.K. Bernstine E.D. Lemontt J.F. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because, by comparison with mutations of the RAD6 and RAD18 genes, mutations of REV3 affect UV sensitivity marginally (12Johnson R.E. Henderson S.T. Petes T.D. Prakash S. Bankmann M. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3807-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and have little effect on the efficiency of post-replicative gap filling (3Prakash L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it has been surmised that error-free REV3-independent processes play a major role in post-replicative bypass of UV-damaged DNA. Recently, we reported genetic studies implicating a role of PCNA in error-free bypass of UV-damaged DNA (13Torres-Ramos C.A. Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9676-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PCNA is an essential processivity factor for DNA polymerase δ, and it stimulates the activity of DNA polymerase ε (14Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), suggesting that either or both of these DNA polymerases may function with PCNA in post-replicative bypass. Even though Polδ and Polε are both essential for viability of yeast cells (15Boulet A. Simon M. Faye G. Gauer G.A. Burgers P.M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1849-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), only Polδ performs efficient elongation of both leading and lagging strands in the reconstituted SV40 system (17Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and recent cross-linking experiments have provided further support for the requirement of Polδ in SV40 replication, as well as in nuclear chromosomal replication (18Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y.W.T. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of evidence for a direct involvement of Polε in DNA replication, it has been suggested that Polε functions in replication-linked repair processes that are essential for cell viability (19Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Here, we examine whether temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations in yeast DNA polymerase δ and DNA polymerase ε inactivate post-replicative bypass of UV-damaged DNA. Studies such as those reported here are essential for assessing the biological role of a gene under normal physiological conditions. Interestingly, our results indicate the involvement of Polδ, but not of Polε, in post-replicative bypass.DISCUSSIONBecause no definitive role has been assigned to Polε in DNA replication, it has been thought that the primary function of this DNA polymerase is in replication-linked repair processes that are essential for cell viability (19Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, our studies provide no evidence for a role of Polε in post-replicational repair of UV-damaged DNA. Rather, we find that Polδ, the major replicative polymerase, is required for post-replicational repair. Recent studies have also indicated the requirement of Polδ in DNA mismatch repair, and Polε is apparently dispensable in this process as well (22Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its essential role in the elongation of both the leading and lagging DNA strands, Polδ function is utilized in different post-replicative repair processes as well.Our previous studies with the pol30-46 mutation have indicated an involvement of PCNA in error-free post-replicational repair (13Torres-Ramos C.A. Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9676-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By contrast to the rev3Δ mutation, which drastically reduces the formation of UV-induced mutations,pol30-46 has no effect on UV mutagenesis, and the rev3Δ pol30-46 double mutant exhibits a synergistic increase in UV sensitivity over either of the single mutants (13Torres-Ramos C.A. Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9676-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based upon these and other results, we have suggested that PCNA and Rev3 function, respectively, in the error-free and mutagenic modes of damage bypass (13Torres-Ramos C.A. Yoder B.L. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9676-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because PCNA is an essential processivity factor for Polδ and because by contrast to rev3, which has little effect on post-replication repair (3Prakash L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the pol30-46 and pol3-3 mutations greatly reduce the efficiency of post-replication repair, we suggest that Polδ and PCNA function together in the error-free mode of damage bypass, and this mechanism is responsible for the majority of damage bypass.How might Polδ and PCNA effect damage bypass? One possibility is that these proteins carry out error-free translesion synthesis, whereas the Rev3 pathway functions in mutagenic bypass of those lesions that cannot be handled by Polδ. Interestingly, by contrast to E. coli, DNA lesions are bypassed with much greater accuracy in S. cerevisiae (23Gibbs P.E.M. Kilbey B.J. Banerjee S.K. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Gibbs P.E.M. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1919-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, studies with single stranded shuttle vectors that carry a defined and uniquely placed mutagenic lesion have indicated that in SOS-induced E. coli, the cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is bypassed in ∼16% of the DNA molecules, and about 8% of the bypass products have targeted mutations. By contrast, in S. cerevisiae, bypass occurs in 80% of CPD containing DNA molecules, and bypass is ∼20-fold more accurate than in E. coli. Moreover, in yeast, (6-4) photoproducts can be bypassed in an error-free way in a large proportion of single stranded DNA molecules (∼70%) compared with E. coli, where accurate replication of (6-4) photoproducts occurs only in ∼9% of DNA molecules (23Gibbs P.E.M. Kilbey B.J. Banerjee S.K. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Gibbs P.E.M. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1919-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Translesion synthesis by Polδ may account for the efficient and accurate bypass of DNA lesions in S. cerevisiae. Studies with purified calf thymus Polδ and PCNA indicating that in the presence of PCNA Polδ can bypass cis-syn and trans-syn-I cyclobutane dimers are consistent with this idea (25O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M.J. Taylor J.-S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5403-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Alternatively, or in addition, Polδ and PCNA could effect damage bypass by mechanisms other than translesion synthesis. One such mechanism could be a “copy choice” type of DNA synthesis, in which upon encountering the lesion, the DNA polymerase switches from the template strand to the undamaged sister chromatid and switches back after the undamaged template has been copied past the point of DNA damage. Such a model has been proposed to explain replication across damage sites in mammalian cells (26Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and such a mechanism has been reconstituted in bacteriophage T4 using purified proteins (27Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recombinational mechanisms may also be utilized in Polδ/PCNA-mediated damage bypass. Lesions in DNA formed by UV light and many other DNA damaging agents are removed by nucleotide excision repair. However, if UV damage is not removed and replication is initiated from templates containing such lesions, because of the inability of the replicative machinery to bypass damage, a gap is formed in the newly synthesized strand across from the damage site. In Escherichia coli, this gap is filled in by error-free recombinational or mutagenic bypass processes (for a review see Ref. 1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Mutagenic bypass has been reconstituted in E. coli with purified RecA, UmuC, UmuD′, and PolIII 1The abbreviations used are: Pol, polymerase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. 1The abbreviations used are: Pol, polymerase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have indicated the requirement of RAD6 and RAD18 genes in post-replicative bypass. Mutations in both genes cause extreme sensitivity to UV light and confer a defect in post-replicative bypass of UV-damaged DNA (3Prakash L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). UV-induced mutagenesis is also abolished in the rad6 and rad18 mutants (4Lawrence C.W. Adv. Genetics. 1982; 21: 173-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Cassier-Chauvat C. Fabre F. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Armstrong J.D. Chadee D.N. Kunz B.A. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rad6, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, exists in vivo in a tight complex with Rad18, a DNA binding protein (7Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The manner by which the Rad6-Rad18 complex functions in post-replicative bypass is not known. In S. cerevisiae, the REV1, REV3, and REV7 genes function in mutagenic bypass. Mutations in these REV genes confer only a modest increase in UV sensitivity, but they cause a drastic reduction in UV mutagenesis (4Lawrence C.W. Adv. Genetics. 1982; 21: 173-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Lemontt J.F. Genetics. 1970; 68: 21-33Crossref Google Scholar, 9Lawrence C.W. Nisson P.E. Christensen R.B. Mol. Gen.

https://openalex.org/W2027558875,"The second domain of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) contains a strictly conserved N-capping box motif (Ser/Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Asp) at the beginning of α6-helix in the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Considering the specific function attributed to capping box residues in the helix nucleation, we decided to investigate, by site-directed mutagenesis, the role that this motif could have in the folding and stability of human GSTP1–1. Both capping box mutants, S150A and D153A, were significantly more thermolabile than wild-type GSTP1–1, indicating that the local destabilization of the α6-helix determined by a single capping residue mutation affects the overall stability of the protein. The results also show that, in addition to capping interactions, an important role in the stability of the final structure of the protein is played by a buried and conserved hydrogen bond formed between the side chain of Asp-153 and the amide NH of Ile-144 located in the long loop preceding α6-helix. Reactivation experiments in vitro indicate that the N-capping box is essential for refolding of the denatured protein at a physiological temperature. The results suggest that during folding this buried and conserved motif, making a definite set of native-like contacts, determines the formation of a specific folding nucleus that probably represents a transition state of the folding process. The second domain of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) contains a strictly conserved N-capping box motif (Ser/Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Asp) at the beginning of α6-helix in the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Considering the specific function attributed to capping box residues in the helix nucleation, we decided to investigate, by site-directed mutagenesis, the role that this motif could have in the folding and stability of human GSTP1–1. Both capping box mutants, S150A and D153A, were significantly more thermolabile than wild-type GSTP1–1, indicating that the local destabilization of the α6-helix determined by a single capping residue mutation affects the overall stability of the protein. The results also show that, in addition to capping interactions, an important role in the stability of the final structure of the protein is played by a buried and conserved hydrogen bond formed between the side chain of Asp-153 and the amide NH of Ile-144 located in the long loop preceding α6-helix. Reactivation experiments in vitro indicate that the N-capping box is essential for refolding of the denatured protein at a physiological temperature. The results suggest that during folding this buried and conserved motif, making a definite set of native-like contacts, determines the formation of a specific folding nucleus that probably represents a transition state of the folding process. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, glutathione; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ncap, first residue of the N-capping box motif located at the beginning of an α-helix. ; EC.2.5.1.18) are a family of detoxication enzymes that catalyze the nucleophilic attack of glutathione (GSH) on the electrophilic groups of a wide range of hydrophobic compounds (1Hayes J.D.

The cytosolic GSTs have been grouped into five evolutionary classes, Alpha, Pi, Mu, Theta, and Sigma on the basis of N-terminal sequences, substrate specificitys, and immunological properties (8Mannervik B.

CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). The GSTs are dimeric proteins (molecular mass about 50 kDa) assembled from identical or non identical subunits from the same gene class. Although the alignment of all known GST sequences shows that only 6–7 amino acid residues are strictly conserved, the representative crystal structure of each cytosolic class shows that the overall polypeptide fold is very similar (10Reinemer P.

Each subunit is characterized by two distinct domains and possesses an active site that acts independently of the other subunit. The smaller N-terminal domain (domain I) adopts an α/β topology and contributes most of the contacts to GSH. The C-terminal domain (domain II) is an all helical structure and provides some of the contacts to the hydrophobic binding site that lies adjacent to the GSH binding site. A recent study (14Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) has also shown that all GSTs and GST-related proteins, including several uncharacterized proteins with significant sequence similarity to GSTs, are characterized by the presence of two conserved sequence motifs. Motif I is found in the first domain and consists of a sequence encompassing β-sheets β4,β5 and the α3-helix. Motif II is in the C-terminal domain and includes a long, conserved loop and the subsequent α6-helix. Gly-146 and Asp-153, belonging to this latter motif, represent the only two residues that are strictly conserved in GST domain II. The role of Gly-146 is still unknown. Some authors have previously attempted to determine the role of Asp-153 through site-directed mutagenesis, but the results are somewhat contradictory (15Wang R.W. Newton D.J. Huskey S.E. McKever B.M.

J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that Asp-153 has a structural role not by itself but as being part of the motif (Ser/Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Asp) named “capping box” (18Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 19Dasgupta S. Bell J.A. Int. J. Pept.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which is present at the beginning of the α6-helix in all the known GSTs and GST-related proteins. The results also indicated that this local motif has a crucial role in the helix formation of the isolated α6-peptide in a hydrophobic environment, a surrounding also recognized for the corresponding α6-helix in the protein. The observation that this helix capping motif is strictly conserved in the hydrophobic core of all GSTs may prove to be useful for a better understanding of the relationships between secondary structure formation and protein folding. Thus, the results obtained by the peptide approach prompted us to investigate the structural role that this motif could have in the protein. We have examined, by site-directed mutagenesis, the significance of the capping box residues for the stability and folding of GST. The results obtained indicate that this local motif, strictly maintained in GSTs, is essential for protein folding at physiological temperatures. Moreover, the N3 capping box residue (Asp-153) makes an additional hydrogen bond with the Ile-144 residue that is located in a long loop preceding the α6-helix. The results indicate that this buried and conserved hydrogen bond has an important function in the folding and the stability of GSTs. In particular it is essential in maintaining the proper conformation of the conserved GST motif II, which plays a key role during refolding as well as in the final structure of the protein. Wild-type human GSTP1–1 was obtained by expression of a cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli XL-1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (21Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) were purchased from Sigma. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: for the S150A mutation, 5′-CAG ATC GCT TTC GCT GAC TAC AAC CT-3′; for the D153A mutation, 5′-CAG ATC TCC TTC GCTGCT TAC AAC CT-3′; and for the S150A/D153A mutation, 5′-CAG ATC GCT TTC GCT GCT TAC AAC CT-3′ and reverse 5′-GTC TCC CAC AAT GAA GGT CTT GCC TC-3′. Altered nucleotides are given in italics. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with inverted polymerase chain reaction. The primers were phosphorylated before use and were then used in pairs with one mutant primer and the reverse primer in each mutagenesis reaction. The expression construct pKHP1 (21Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) encoding human GSTP1–1 was used as template DNA. The reaction mixture contained 0.8 μm of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, varying amounts of template DNA, 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the buffer supplied with the DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. After a hot start at 94 °C for 10 min, Pfu DNA polymerase was added, and 25 cycles of mutagenesis/amplification followed: 94 °C for 1 min, 68–70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 7 min. The program was ended at 30 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was recovered from agarose gel after electrophoresis and was ligated before transformation of E. coli XL-1 blue. Small scale expression tests were performed and high level-expressing clones, based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Phastsystem (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), were chosen for DNA sequence analysis (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Mutant clones were then used for large scale expression of protein. Cultures of E. coli XL-1 blue containing plasmids were grown in 500 ml of expression medium in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask at 37 °C. At an A 555 of 0.35, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. From that time, the culture was grown for about 20 h at different temperatures of incubation,i.e. 25, 32, 37, and 40 °C. The subsequent purification of wild-type and capping mutants, expressed at different growth temperatures, were performed as described before (21Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the only modification that the enzymes were purified with a GSH-Sepharose affinity column (23Aceto A. Caccuri A.M. Sacchetta P. Bucciarelli T. Dragani B. Rosato N. Federici G. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GST purified after the affinity step and expressed as percentage of total cytosolic protein versus incubation temperature represented the intracellular protein yields in vivo. The GST activity in the cytosol as a function of temperature and protein expression has also been determined. Almost all mutants were virtually inactive when expressed at 37 °C, and the clones were characterized by a very low protein yield. Thus kinetic and structural characterizations, including thermal stability and refolding, were performed at the more permissive temperature of 25 °C. The kinetic parameters, k cat and Km, were determined at 25 °C as described previously (24Aceto A. Di Ilio C. Lo Bello M. Bucciarelli T. Angelucci S. Federici G. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 2267-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The saturating concentrations for GSH and CDNB were 2 and 1 mm, respectively. Spectroscopic properties of the capping box mutants and the wild-type enzyme have also been studied. A Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter was used for CD measurements in the far ultraviolet region from 200–250 nm. Spectra were recordered at 0.3 mg/ml protein concentration with cuvettes of 0.1 cm pathlength in a thermostated cell holder. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a Spex (Fluoromax model) spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the λmax and the fluorescence intensity of emission spectra were analyzed at the same 0.1 mg/ml protein concentration. The enzyme was incubated at each temperature for 10 min at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 5 mmDTT and 1 mm EDTA to prevent oxidative inactivation. The remaining activity was assayed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with 2 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB at 25 °C. The inactivation time courses were performed by adding to the assay solution suitable aliquots withdrawn at different times from the denaturation mixture. In all cases, the thermal inactivation could not be reversed by lowering the temperature of incubation. The enzyme was inactivated in sealed Eppendorf tubes, and the temperature was monitored with a Cryson telethermometer. When the refolding of human GSTP1–1 and its mutants was to be monitored, 10 μm enzyme was first denatured in 4 m GdnHCl (0.2 m phospate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, (pH 7)) at 25, 32, and 40 °C for 30 min and then diluted (defining time 0) 1:40 into renaturation buffer (0.2 m phosphate, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT (pH 7)) at the same temperature. The final GdnHCl concentration was 0.1 m during refolding. All refolding dilutions were carried out by rapid addition of the renaturation buffer to denatured enzyme. Activity recovery was monitored by withdrawal at time t of appropriate aliquots of the renaturation mixture immediately diluted into 2.0 ml of assay buffer. Coordinates of GST x-ray structures were derived from the Brookhaven National Laboratory Protein Data Bank via anonymous file transfer protocol. The crystal structures were rearranged (Hyperchem program; Autodesk, Sausalito, CA) by energy-gradient minimization with an Amber3-based Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient minimization algorithm (25Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta J.S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). Rearrangements were stopped when a gradient of less than 0.2 kcal/mol per Å was reached. To investigate the role of the conserved capping box residues, Asp-153 and Ser-150 in human GSTP1–1 were individually replaced with alanine producing D153A, S150A, and S150A/D153A mutants by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Mutant and wild-type enzymes were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized GSH. The purified proteins gave a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). In each case, the unbound activity fraction was very low (2–3% of the total activity, not shown), suggesting that the affinity of mutant enzymes for GSH-Sepharose column was essentially the same as that of the wild-type. Considering that the above substitutions could represent temperature-sensitive mutations, protein expression was performed at different temperature of host cell growth. The intracellular yields of the S150A mutant and wild-type GSTP1–1 were similar and essentially independent of the temperature of culture medium in the range of 25–40 °C (not shown). On the contrary, the yields of D153A and S150A/D153A mutants were lower and clearly decreased with increasing temperature. This probably reflects the fact that D150A and S150A/D153A molecules fail to reach the native state at a physiological temperature. In fact, the cytosolic-specific activities as well as the specific activities of the purified D150A and S147A/D150A mutants sharply decreased with increasing temperature of cell growth (not shown). TableI summarizes the kinetic parameters of the CDNB conjugation catalyzed by the wild-type GSTP1–1 and capping mutants. The replacement of Ser-150 with alanine does not significantly affect the kinetic parameters as compared with the parent enzyme. On the contrary, the D153A mutant as well as S150A/D153A double mutant showed limited but significant kinetic differences when compared with wild-type. In particular, while the Km values were substantially unaffected by the mutations, the k cat and then the k cat/Km for the D153A and S150A/D153A mutants were about 1.5-fold higher than those of parent GSTP1–1.Table IComparison of kinetic parameters of wild-type and capping mutants of GSTPI-1 expressed at 25 °C in E. colikcatKmGSHKmCDNBkcat/KmCDNBs −1mmmms −1 mm −1Wild-type34 ± 20.15 ± 0.020.94 ± 0.1536S150A35 ± 30.14 ± 0.021.23 ± 0.1428D153A48 ± 40.21 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.1852S150A/D153A50 ± 60.18 ± 0.021.16 ± 0.1743 Open table in a new tab When wild-type GSTP1–1 and its mutants were expressed at permissive temperature (25 °C), their structural properties were very similar. The far-UV CD spectra (Fig.1) as well as their gel filtration retention times (not shown) were the same, suggesting that the capping mutants and wild-type enzyme, in terms of secondary structure and dimeric arrangement of the molecule, were essentially identical. TableII shows the intrinsic fluorescence properties of these proteins. The λmax was the same, indicating that a similar polarity characterizes the tryptophanyl environments of all enzyme variants. The fact that the normalized intensities of fluorescence were significantly different suggests that only limited conformational changes affect mutants when compared with the wild-type enzyme. These minor differences involve tertiary contacts of tryptophanyl residues located in the GST domain I, far from the mutation sites.Table IIIntrinsic fluorescence properties of GSTP1–1 wild-type and its capping mutantsλmaxIntensity (cps)Wild-type339 ± 31.80 e+6S150A339 ± 34.89 e+6D153A338 ± 35.54 e+6S150A/D153A338 ± 33.61 e+6 Open table in a new tab Heat inactivation of wild-type and capping mutants, expressed at permissive temperature, was investigated. The enzymes were incubated in 0.01m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at various temperatures for 10 min, and the remaining activities were assayed in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 6.5) at 25 °C (Fig.2). The results indicate that single capping residue substitutions cause very large effects on the catalytic competence even though the active site is situated far from the location of the mutations. In particular, the S150A mutant was more unstable than the wild-type enzyme, being almost completely inactivated at 50 °C. In contrast, the wild-type, under the same conditions, was inactivated to less than 10%. It should be noted, however, that the S150A mutant, at physiological temperature (37–40 °C), was stable for several hours (not shown). On the other hand, the D153A and S150A/D153A mutants were much more unstable than the wild-type GSTP1–1 and the S150A mutant, being completely inactivated by incubation at 40 °C for 10 min. For these last two mutants, some inactivation was observed even at a temperature as low as 32 °C. Time courses of thermal denaturation (not shown) demonstrated that after 30 min of incubation at 32 °C both the D153A and S150A/D153A mutants were inactivated by about 30%. The slightly higher extent of inactivation shown by the D153A enzyme, at each temperature, compared with the S150A/D153A double mutant is explained by the occurrence of new interfering interactions due to the presence, in a nonpolar environment, of a serine residue without a complementary counterpart that could participate in hydrogen bond formation. Considering the proposed role of the capping box motif in helical nucleation, single substitutions of N-capping residues could represent temperature-sensitive mutation affecting GST folding. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the reactivation yields of GSTP1–1 and its mutants at different temperatures of refolding. 10 μm enzyme, expressed at 25 °C, was denatured in 4m GdnHCl for 30 min. This denaturant concentration was sufficient to completely unfold the proteins as indicated by the loss of their CD signal at 222 nm (not shown). Successively, each unfolded enzyme was diluted 40-fold in the same denaturing tube with phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 to a final GdnHCl concentration of 0.1 m. Appropriate aliquots from this incubation mixture were immediately assayed for activity at 25 °C. A single exponential fitted all kinetic reactivation curves (not shown). In each case, 5–6 min of incubation in the refolding medium was sufficient to reach the maximum of reactivation, indicating that the refolding rates were very similar (Fig. 3). On the contrary, the reactivation yields of the capping mutants were very different from that of the wild-type protein with increasing temperatures of refolding. Fig. 3 shows in fact that, while the reactivation yield of wild-type enzyme was essentially unaffected by temperatures in the 25–37 °C range, the yields of mutants, even if at a different extent, sharply fell with increasing temperature toward physiological values. At 25 °C, all enzyme variants showed the same recovery of specific activity. On the contrary, at 37 °C all mutants displayed very poor or complete lack of refolding activity even at the very beginning of the incubation. It should be noted that the S150A mutant, in distinguishing from the other two mutants, is stable at 37 °C. Thus the results indicate that the single Ncap S150A mutation destabilizes an essential intermediate of folding at 37 °C. The D153A and the S150A/D153A mutants showed much lower refolding yields even at 32 °C. It should be noted that most of the activity was regained in a few minutes, in which time period the inactivation of both mutants is substantially negligible. Thus, the results also suggest that the D153A mutation not only slightly affects the stability of the folded protein, but, to a higher extent, also destabilizes a productive intermediate of folding. The analysis of the three-dimensional structures of different GST indicates that the conserved sequence S/TXXD possess the typical properties of the capping box motif. Table III shows the reciprocal side chain-main chain capping distances in the Pi, Mu, Alpha, Sigma, and Schistosoma japonicum GST structures. The side chain oxygen atom of the N3 Asp residue forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain NH of Ncap Ser/Thr (Table III,a), just as the side chain oxygen atom of Ncap Ser/Thr is within hydrogen bonding distance from the backbone NH of N3 Asp residue (Table III, b). Table III, c also shows that, in addition to capping interactions, Asp-153 in GSTP1–1 forms a very favorable hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of an hydrophobic residue (Ile 144 in GSTP1–1) located in the long loop preceding α6-helix (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that this buried hydrogen bond, probably important in GST nucleus folding, is strictly conserved in the GST superfamily (Table III, c).Table IIIBuried hydrogen bonds conserved at beginning of the α6-helix of the GSTsAlpha classMu classPi classSigma classS. japonicumÅDeg3-aHydrogen bond degree.ÅDeg3-aHydrogen bond degree.ÅDeg3-aHydrogen bond degree.ÅDeg3-aHydrogen bond degree.ÅDeg3-aHydrogen bond degree.(Asp) (X)a)OH-C=O ......

Open table in a new tab Understanding the pathway by which the native state of a protein is reached requires the identification of residues critical in the formation of kinetic intermediates and transition states of folding. In the present work, we have identified amino acid residues that influence stability and folding of GSTs and which are strictly conserved in this superfamily of proteins. We have recently reported (17Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that at the beginning of the GST α6-helix, in the hydrophobic core of the molecule, an N-capping box motif (Ser/Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Asp) that plays an important role in the helical propensity of the isolated α6-peptide is present. These results prompted us to investigate, by site-directed mutagenesis, the role that this conserved motif could have in the folding of protein. To study folding and stability in vitro, GSTP1–1 and its corresponding capping mutants were expressed at 25 °C. At this permissive temperature, in fact, the kinetic parameters of all mutants were very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. This similarity is in accordance with the data obtained by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that secondary structures, dimeric arrangement, and the λmax of the intrinsic fluorescence were the same, indicating that the global folding of mutants and wild-type GST were similar. The fact that the normalized intensity of fluorescence was significantly different suggests only limited differences in tertiary contacts surrounding one or both tryptophanyl residues of protein. However, all mutants showed a remarkable thermal inactivation when compared with the wild-type GSTP1–1 (Fig. 2). The loss of catalytic activity is explained by considering that the α6-helix, although located in the core of the protein, makes hydrophobic contacts with an important structural element of the active site (α1-helix of GST). Thus, single capping residue mutations that locally destabilize the conformation of the α6-helix also affect in a direct fashion the stability of the active site. Moreover, the N3mutation (D153A) was much more destabilizing than the Ncap mutation (S150A). A simple explanation for this difference is given from the analysis of the three-dimensional structure of GST. As shown in Fig. 4, the conserved Asp-153 residue, in addition to capping-box interactions, forms a very favorable hydrogen bond with the amide NH of Ile-144. Moreover, this specific interaction, which is important for stabilization of the long loop preceding the α6-helix (GST motif II), is strictly conserved in GST classes (Table III). Thus the results indicate that, in addition to capping-box interactions, an important role in the stability of the final structure of GST is played by this buried and conserved hydrogen bond. This also means that the appropriate conformation of GST motif II (14Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) is crucial in the free energy minimization of the final state and well compensates the energetic penalty imposed by the desolvation of a carboxylic group located in the interior of the protein with a low dielectric constant. Refolding in vitro suggests that thermal lability of the final structure of mutants reflects differences in the conformational properties of a productive intermediate of folding. Reactivation in vitro of all mutants, in fact, was very thermosensitive. In particular, although the final structure of S150A mutant is stable at 37 °C, the yield of the refolded protein at this temperature is low. This indicates that S150A represents a temperature-sensitive mutation that identifies a residue critical for folding. Since Ser-150 in GSTP1–1 corresponds to an Ncap residue (18Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 19Dasgupta S. Bell J.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Harper E.T. Rose G.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), this means that the N-capping box, highly conserved in the hydrophobic core of GSTs, is essential for refolding at physiological temperature. In addition to the specific role of governing helix propensity previously attributed (17Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to this motif by studies of the isolated α6-peptide, the present results also indicate that the helical conformation of this polypeptide segment is an important feature of a productive intermediate of folding. The results obtained by the peptide approach, as well as the fact that the S150A mutant is able to refold at a more permissive temperature (25 °C), further support this finding. We have previously observed (17Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the helical propensity of the isolated α6-peptide sharply decreased by increasing the temperature. While at lower temperature, other determinants also contribute to helix formation; at 37 °C, the isolated α6-peptide showed a significant helical content only in the presence of the capping box motif. Much lower refolding yields were observed for the D153A and S150A/D153A double mutants than for the S150A mutant. It is conceivable that, in addition to capping-box interactions, an important role in the refolding could be played by the specific Ile-144—Asp-153 hydrogen bond identified in the crystal structure of the native enzyme described above. The results seem to indicate that, in addition to the α6-helix structure, the appropriate package of this polypeptide segment to the preceding long loop is required for the formation of a productive folding intermediate. The conserved Ile-144—Asp-153 interaction could favor just one of several closely related conformations occurring during this hydrophobic packing and then it could help to establish GST conformational specificity. At the beginning of the α6-helix, the presence of a conserved hydrophobic-staple motif (17Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), flanking the N-capping box, further supports this behavior. It has recently been observed (26Seale J.W. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Protein Science. 1994; 3: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Munoz V. Blanco F.J. Serrano L. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 380-385Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that such local sequences, when simultaneously present at the N terminus of a helix, have an important role in protein folding by determining the direction of the forming helix with respect to the preceding structural element. In addition, it should be noted that this partially folded conformation, stabilized by such specific contacts, also serves to create the necessary hydrophobic environment that, in addition to the capping motif, permits α6-helix formation. In the final folded state of the protein, this substructure corresponds to the conserved GST motif II (14Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fact that capping mutations affect the thermal stability of mutants to a smaller extent with respect to their ability to refold suggests that the conformation of this intermediate during refolding is more labile than when present in the fully folded state. Considering that the GST motif II is a widespread conserved module also present in other protein structures (14Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altschul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), its involvement in folding and stability appears to be of a more general interest. The S150A mutation does not affect the expression of the protein in E. coli at 37 °C. Thus, our in vitro folding system is much less efficient than protein folding in vivo. We may speculate about the presence in the host cell of a protein synthesis machinery, such as an ATP-dependent chaperone system, that facilitates the attainment of a more favorable equilibrium between folded and misfolded molecules. Once folded in the cell, the S150A mutant, but not the D153A and S150A/D153A mutants, is also stable at 37 °C as in vitro. The helix capping hypothesis has already been proposed to explain how the primary structure influences the formation of an α-helix and thus affects protein stability and kinetics of folding (18Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 19Dasgupta S. Bell J.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Harper E.T. Rose G.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 28Presta L.G. Rose G.D. Science. 1988; 240: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that an N-capping box is essential for GST folding and stability. Its strict conservation in the hydrophobic core of the molecule as well as the results reported here represent novel observations for helix capping and permits more specific assumptions on the role played by this motif in protein folding. It has recently been hypothesized (29Ptitsyn O.B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Shakhnovich E. Abkevich V. Ptitsyn O. Nature. 1996; 379: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) that, for monomeric single-domain proteins, the two-state kinetics of folding follows a molecular growth mechanism. Buried and highly conserved residues, making a definite set of native-like contacts, determine the formation of a specific folding nucleus that represents a transition state of the folding process. The present results indicate that also in a more complex multidomain protein such specific nucleus interactions exist and that, in the GSTs, they are at least in part determined by a conserved capping box motif."
https://openalex.org/W2046606780,"A cDNA encoding a new ubiquitin-specific protease, UBP41, in chick skeletal muscle was cloned using an Escherichia coli-based in vivo screening method. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA containing an open reading frame of 1,071 base pairs revealed that the protease consists of 357 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 40,847 Da, and is related to members of the UBP family containing highly conserved Cys and His domains. Chick UBP41 was expressed in E. coli and purified from the cells to apparent homogeneity, using125I-labeled ubiquitin-αNH-MHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC as a substrate. The purified enzyme behaved as an approximately 43-kDa protein under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that it consists of a single polypeptide chain. Like other deubiquitinating enzymes, it was sensitive to inhibition by ubiquitin-aldehyde and sulfhydryl blocking agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide. The UBP41 protease cleaved at the C terminus of the ubiquitin moiety in natural and engineered fusions irrespective of their sizes; thus, it is active against ubiquitin-β-galactosidase as well as ubiquitin C-terminal extension protein of 80 amino acids. UBP41 also released free ubiquitin from poly-His-tagged di-ubiquitin. Moreover, it converted poly-ubiquitinated lysozyme conjugates to mono-ubiquitinated forms of about 24 kDa, although the latter molecules were not further degraded to free ubiquitin and lysozyme. These results suggest that UBP41 may play an important role in the recycling of ubiquitin by hydrolysis of branched poly-ubiquitin chains generated by the action of 26 S proteasome on poly-ubiquitinated protein substrates, as well as in the production of free ubiquitin from linear poly-ubiquitin chains and of certain ribosomal proteins from ubiquitin fusion proteins.

This small protein is covalently ligated to target proteins by a family of Ub-conjugating enzymes, called E2s (7Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 8Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar), through an isopeptide linkage between the C-terminal Gly residue of Ub and the ε-amino group of Lys residue(s) of the proteins. Ubs by themselves or in conjugation to proteins may also be ligated to additional Ub molecules to form branched poly-Ub by the linkage between the ε-amino group of Lys-48 of one Ub and the C terminus of the other. Proteins ligated to multiple units of Ub are degraded by the ATP-dependent 26 S proteasome (1Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A.

Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Ubs are encoded by two distinct classes of genes, neither of which encodes a monomeric form of Ub (10Ozkaynak E. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1984; 312: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 11Lund P.K. Moats-Staats B.M. Simmons J.G. Hoyt E. D'Ercole A.J. Martin F. Van Wyk J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7609-7613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One is a poly-Ub gene, which encodes a linear polymer of Ubs that are linked through peptide bonds between the C-terminal Gly and N-terminal Met of contiguous Ub molecules. The other encodes a fusion protein in which a single Ub is linked to a ribosomal protein consisting of 52 or 76–80 amino acids (12Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 401-414Crossref Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Thus, generation of free Ub from the linear poly-Ub and Ub fusion proteins and recycling of Ub from the branched poly-Ub ligated to proteins should be essential for Ub-requiring processes, such as intracellular ATP-dependent proteolysis. A number of Ub C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) that release Ub molecules that are conjugated to proteins by αNH-peptide bonds or εNH-isopeptide linkages have been identified from different organisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains at least five different UCHs, including yeast Ub hydrolase 1 (YUH1) and Ub-specific proteases (UBPs) 1–4 (13Miller H.I. Henzel W.J. Ridgway J.B. Kuang W.-J.

Of these, UBP3 has recently been shown to regulate silencing by interaction with SIR4, which is required for silencing of transcription at the silent mating type loci and at telomeres in yeast (17Moazed D. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A family of UCHs, including L1, L2, L3, and H2, has been identified from bovine calf thymus (18Mayer A.N. Wilkinson K.D.

Isopeptidase T in human red blood cells has been purified, and its cDNA has been isolated (21Falquet L. Paquet N. Fruitger S. Hughes G.J. Hoang-Van K. Jaton J.-C.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown recently that the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome has intrinsic isopeptidase activity (23Kam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In addition, the fat facets gene in Drosophila, which is required in eye development, and the DUB-1 gene in murine pro-B cell line, which is specifically induced by interleukin-3 and involved in growth suppression, have been shown to encode UCHs (24Huang Y. Baker R. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,25Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We also have identified at least 10 different UCHs in chick skeletal muscle using Ub-αNH-MHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC (referred to as Ub-PESTc) (26Yoo Y. Rote K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17078-17083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol.

Because the Tyr residue next to the C-terminal Cys can be exclusively radioiodinated, we could assay the UCH activity by a simple measurement of the radioactivity of the peptide portion that is released into acid-soluble products. Of these, UCH-1 (29Woo S.K. Baek S.H. Lee J.I. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.-S. Chung C.H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), UCH-6 (27Woo S.K. Lee J.I.

In eukaryotes, Ub fusion proteins, such as Ub-β-galactosidase (Ub-β-gal), are hydrolyzed by UBPs irrespective of the identity of the residue at the Ub-β-gal junction (with an exception of Pro), making it possible to expose in vivo different residues at the N termini of β-gal (31Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 32Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This technique, required for detection and analysis of the N-end rule in eukaryotes, has been made applicable in bacteria, such as for isolation of the yeast UBP2 and UBP3 genes (15Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar approach (i.e. Escherichia coli-based in vivo screening method), we isolated a cDNA for a new UBP from the cDNA library of chick skeletal muscle in the present study. We also expressed the enzyme in E. coli, purified it from the cells, and analyzed its biochemical properties. Butyl-Toyopearl was obtained from Tosoh Corp. (Tokyo, Japan), and anti-β-gal antiserum was from Cappel. Ub-αNH-MHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC (Ub-PESTc), Ub-αNH-carboxyl extension protein of 80 amino acids (Ub-CEP80), Ub-αNH-dihydrofolate reductase (Ub-DHFR), and poly-His-tagged di-Ub (His-di-Ub) were purified as described previously (27Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purified Ub-PESTc was radiolabeled with Na125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) (33Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Ub-aldehyde was prepared by borohydride reduction of Ub in the presence of YUH1 as described elsewhere (34Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Reticulocytes were obtained by subcutaneous injections of phenylhydrazine to albino rabbits (35Etlinger J.D. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). From the cells, fraction II containing an Ub-conjugating system was prepared as described previously (36Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The chick cDNAs in pBluescript II (pBS) were excised from the chick skeletal muscle λ ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) by following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNA plasmids were propagated in E. coli JM101 cells (supE thi Δ(lac-proAB)/F 39 traΔ36 proA + proB + lacI q lacZΔM15) (37$$Google Scholar) that had been transformed with pACUb-R-β-gal or pACUb-M-β-gal (14Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The E. coli JM101 cells carrying both the chick cDNA plasmids and pACUb-R-β-gal were plated onto Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. They were then incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. Of 105transformants, three appeared as white colonies and the others were stained as blue. All the control cells (i.e. transformed with pBluescript II vector only) developed a blue color. From the three white colonies, plasmids were isolated and again transformed into the E. coli JM101 expressing either Ub-Arg-β-gal or Ub-Met-β-gal. Only one of the three colonies turned into white when transformed with Ub-Arg-β-gal but not with Ub-Met-β-gal (i.e. became blue), confirming that the white colony contains the plasmid carrying the chick cDNA specifying the UBP activity against the Ub-β-gal proteins. The plasmids were isolated and referred to as pBS/Ubp41. Standard procedures involving recombinant DNA were carried out as described by Ausubel et al. (37$$Google Scholar). DNA fragments produced by restriction endonucleases were subcloned into pBS vector and sequenced using Sanger dideoxy techniques (TaqTrack sequencing system, Promega) and an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A). All sequences were determined on both DNA strands, and all restriction sites used for subcloning were verified as well. The parental E. coli JM101 cells were transformed with pBS/Ubp41 and grown to a late exponential phase in Luria broth containing ampicillin at 37 °C. The cultures were then treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 2 mm, and incubated for another 3 h. After incubation, the cells were collected, resuspended in buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), and disrupted by French press at 14,000 p.s.i. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and the resulting supernatants were referred to as crude extracts. For the in vitro assays, 125I-labeled Ub-PESTc was used as a substrate (27Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained the proper amount of the enzyme preparations and 10–30 μg of 125I-labeled Ub-PESTc in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. After incubating the mixtures for appropriate periods, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 40% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of 1.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The samples were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were counted for their radioactivities using a γ-counter. The enzyme activity was expressed as a percentage of125I-labeled Ub-PESTc hydrolyzed to acid-soluble products. When assaying the hydrolysis of Ub-αNH-carboxyl extension proteins and His-di-Ub, incubations were performed as above but in the presence of 5 μg of the substrate. After incubation for appropriate periods, the samples were subjected to discontinuous gel electrophoresis (see below). Proteins in the gels were then visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 or by exposing to x-ray films (Fuji) at −70 °C. To prepare 125I-labeled poly-Ub-εNH-lysozyme conjugates, 2 μg of the 125I-labeled lysozyme (5 × 105 cpm) was incubated with 10 μg of Ub, 120 μg of fraction II, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 6.5 mm phosphocreatine, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm KCl in a final volume of 0.05 ml (36Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm hemin to prevent proteolysis of the ubiquitinated protein conjugates by the 26 S proteasome. After incubation, the samples were heated for 10 min at 55 °C for inactivation of endogenous UBPs. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2-mercaptoethanol was performed as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) or using Tris-Tricine buffer as described by Schägger and von Jagow (39Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The discontinuous slab gels contained 4, 10, and 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide to improve resolution of small proteins. The sample buffer contained 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1.5% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 7% glycerol. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or autoradiographed. To isolate the cDNAs encoding chick muscle UBPs, we took advantage of the facts that E. coli lacks both Ub and UBPs, and that the N-end rule operates in E. coli as well (14Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that Arg-β-gal, but not Ub-Arg-β-gal, is short-lived in E. coli, whereas both Met-β-gal and Ub-Met-β-gal are long-lived (14Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), also made possible the E. coli-based in vivo screening for UBPs. Specifically, E. coli cells expressing the long-lived Ub-Arg-β-gal or Ub-Met-β-gal would form blue colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside plates. If a deubiquitinating activity is also present in the cells, Ub-Arg-β-gal should be converted into the short-lived Arg-β-gal (14Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12021-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), keeping the colonies a white color on the plates. In contrast, the long-lived Met-β-gal generated by the enzyme activity should remain active against 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside and turn the cells a blue color. Using this double-screening method, we isolated a positive colony that carried a chick muscle cDNA expressing the deubiquitinating activity. The open reading frame specifying the deubiquitinating activity was identified by subcloning and nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA, and named Ubp41, because it encodes a 41-kDa UBP (see below). The flanking nucleotide sequence around the initiation codon, GTTATGG, exhibits a G at −3 and +4 (Kozak consensus sequence), without which ATG is bypassed (40Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the start (ATG) codon was inferred to yield the 1,071-base pair open reading frame, which encodes a protein consisting of 357 residues (40,847 Da) (Fig. 1). From the deduced amino acid sequence, the isoelectric point of UBP41 was estimated to be 9.01. In addition, sequence alignment demonstrated the similarity of UBP41 with several deubiquitinating enzymes, including human tre-2 (41Nakamura T. Hillova J. Mariage-Samson R. Onno M. Huebner K.

The activity of UBP41 in chromatographic fractions obtained during purification was monitored by determining its ability to hydrolyze 125I-labeled Ub-PESTc. The extracts were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 19 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (pH 7.8). The DEAE flow-through fractions were pooled and loaded onto a S-Sepharose column (2.5 × 19 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column, proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.4 m NaCl (Fig.3 A). Fractions with high activity were pooled, added with the same volume of buffer A containing 2.4 m ammonium sulfate, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 4 cm). After washing with buffer A containing 1.2m ammonium sulfate, proteins bound to column were eluted with a reverse gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1.2 m to 0m. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.8), and loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (1 × 4 cm). After washing with the same buffer, proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient of 20–300 mm phosphate. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, and loaded onto a butyl-Toyopearl column (1 × 2.5 cm). After washing with the same buffer, proteins bound were eluted with a reverse gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1.2m to 0 m. Fractions under the symmetric peak of the Ub-PESTc-degrading activity (Fig. 3 B) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and kept frozen at −70 °C until use. A summary of the purification of UBP41 is shown in Table I.Table ISummary of purification of UBP41StepsProteinTotal activitySpecific activitymgunits1-aOne unit was defined as 1 mg of Ub-PESTc hydrolyzed to acid-soluble products/h.units/mgCrude extract14,0005,6100.4DEAE-Sepharose1,6804,6922.8S-Sepharose25.51,11244Phenyl-Sepharose2.09246Phosphocellulose0.323197Butyl-Toyopearl0.077.71101-a One unit was defined as 1 mg of Ub-PESTc hydrolyzed to acid-soluble products/h. Open table in a new tab The size of the enzyme was estimated to be about 43 kDa upon chromatography on Superose-12 column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl (Fig.4 A). In addition, it ran as a single protein of 43 kDa upon analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig.4 B). Because the enzyme was expressed as a fusion protein, it ran slightly larger than 41 kDa as expected under both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions. These results indicate that UBP41 comprises a single polypeptide. To determine the time-dependent hydrolysis of 125I-labeled Ub-PESTc by the purified UBP41, assays were performed by incubation of the enzyme for various periods at 37 °C. Fig.5 A shows that the enzyme activity increases linearly with time for at least 30 min. We then examined the effects of increasing concentrations of the substrate on the enzyme activity (Fig. 5 B). Upon a double-reciprocal plot of the data, the Km of Ub-PESTc for its cleavage was estimated to be about 12 μm. We also examined the effects of sulfhydryl blocking agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide and Ub-aldehyde, both of which are known to inhibit the activities of all UCHs and UBPs so far identified (42Stein R.L. Chen Z. Melandri F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12616-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 43Wilkinson K.D. Tashayer V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-1454636Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).N-Ethylmaleimide at 1 mm almost completely blocked the activity of UBP41 against Ub-PESTc (Fig. 5 A). Ub-aldehyde also strongly inhibited the enzyme activity with a K i of about 0.7 μm (Fig.5 B). However, the metal-chelating agents, including o-phenanthroline (1 mm), or the inhibitors of serine proteases, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), showed little or no effect (data not shown). Nor was the enzyme activity influenced by poly-l-Lys (data not shown), which is known to stimulate dramatically the Ub-PESTc-degrading activity of YUH1 as well as of most UCHs identified in chick skeletal muscle (27Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine the substrate specificity of UBP41, the purified enzyme was incubated with various Ub-αNH-protein extensions, such as Ub-DHFR, Ub-CEP80, and His-di-Ub. After incubation, the samples were subjected to discontinuous gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Assays were also performed with Ub-PESTc as a control. As shown in Fig. 6 A, UBP41 was capable of generating free Ub from all of the substrates tested. To confirm whether Ub-Met-β-gal can also be hydrolyzed in vitro by the purified UBP41, the enzyme was incubated with the extracts of E. coli JM101 cells transformed with pACUb-M-β-gal and then with anti-β-gal antibody for immunoblot analysis. Fig. 6 B shows that the purified enzyme can release β-gal from Ub-Met-β-gal expressed in the E. coli extracts. To determine whether the purified UBP41 can also act on branched poly-Ub chains, poly-Ub-εNH-lysozyme conjugates were prepared by incubation of 125I-labeled lysozyme and reticulocyte lysate fraction II. The radiolabeled poly-Ub-lysozyme conjugates were then incubated with the purified UBP41. Upon incubation, the amount of high molecular weight conjugates significantly decreased with a concomitant increase in that of a 24-kDa band, which corresponds approximately to the size of mono-ubiquitinated lysozyme, in addition to a 42-kDa conjugate (Fig. 7). Treatment of N-ethylmaleimide strongly inhibited the generation of both 24-kDa and 42-kDa conjugates. In addition, prolonged incubation with higher amounts of UBP41 resulted in an additional increase in the level of the 24-kDa band (data not shown). Thus, it appears that UBP41 can release Ubs that are conjugated to proteins or adjacent Ub molecules by εNH-isopeptide linkages as well as by αNH-peptide bonds, except from the singly ubiquitinated lysozyme molecule. In the present study, we have cloned a cDNA that encodes a 41-kDa UBP in chick skeletal muscle. The 357-residue protein has no significant sequence similarity to previously isolated yeast or mammalian UBPs, except for two short regions containing Cys and His domains. Wilkinson et al. (43Wilkinson K.D. Tashayer V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-1454636Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the UBP family contains a minimal catalytic core, which spans the sequence between the active site Cys and the His box, and ranges in the number of amino acids from about 300 to 840 residues. The minimal catalytic domain of UBP41, which is composed of 330 residues, is also within this range. In addition, the UBP family has N- or C-terminal extensions, which seem to control substrate specificity, protein-protein interactions, and localization. For instance, human isopeptidase T has a N-terminal extension of 300 amino acids, whereas mouse DUB-1 has a C-terminal extension of 181 amino acids. Interestingly, UBP41 has neither the N- or the C-terminal extension, making it the smallest functional UBP identified to date. We also have demonstrated that the purified UBP41 hydrolyzes not only Ub-αNH-extension proteins, such as Ub-CEP80, but also His-di-Ub. These results suggest that UBP41 may play an important role in the generation of free Ubs from the linear polymer of Ubs and in the production of free Ubs and certain ribosomal proteins from their conjugates. UBP41 is also capable of releasing free Ubs from branched poly-Ub chains, suggesting that the enzyme may also function in the recycling of Ubs in muscle cells, perhaps after degradation of poly-Ub-protein conjugates by the 26 S proteasomes. Of interest is the finding that UBP41 can rapidly deubiquitinate from branched poly-Ub chains and accumulate the 24-kDa mono-Ub-εNH-lysozyme conjugates (see Fig. 7). Incubation of poly-Ub-lysozyme conjugates for a prolonged period in the presence of increasing amounts of the enzyme further accumulated the mono-Ub-lysozyme (data not shown). This finding was rather surprising, because a lysozyme molecule contains six Lys residues, all of which can be ubiquitinated by forming isopeptide bonds, although perhaps to different extents. Moreover, it has been demonstrated previously that lysozyme is ubiquitinated at multiple sites (44Hough R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2391-2399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we did not expect that UBP41 accumulates a single species of mono-Ub-lysozyme conjugate, in which only one of the six Lys residues in lysozyme is ligated to an Ub molecule. One possible explanation may be that UBP41 may also be capable of removing Ub from the lysozyme molecules that are mono-ubiquitinated at multiple Lys sites, but not from the molecules that are mono-ubiquitinated at a certain, specific Lys site. In the mono-Ub-lysozyme molecule, the Gly-Lys bond may be sterically shielded from the attack by UBP41. Previously, we have identified at least 10 different UCH activities from the extracts of chick skeletal muscle, and we have tentatively named these UCH-1 to UCH-10 (27Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K.

Of these, UCH-1, UCH-6, and UCH-8 have been purified and their biochemical properties have been characterized (27Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.-S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H.

J. 1997; 325: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a number of criteria, however, UBP41 appears distinct from the previously isolated UCHs. First, the activity of UBP41 is not at all influenced by the treatment of poly-l-Lys, unlike the chick UCHs, except UCH-1, whose activities are dramatically stimulated the polycationic agent. Second, UBP41, but not UCH-1, is capable of converting in vitro the Ub-β-gal proteins into Ub and β-gal, although both are active against Ub-extension proteins with relatively low molecular masses, such as Ub-CEP80 and Ub-DHFR. Third, the molecular mass of UBP41 is different from that of UCH-1, which is 34 kDa. Fourth, the specific activity of UBP41 is much higher than that of UCH-1. Finally, the chromatographic behavior of UBP41 during purification differs from that of other chick UCHs. Thus, UBP41 must be a novel protease."

(1992) Science 257, 967–969) to identify a novel transcript whose expression levels increased in Xenopus embryo explants during mesoderm induction by fibroblast growth factor. The PCR product was used to clone a 2.3-kilobase pair cDNA representing this transcript, which we have named er1 (early response1). The er1 cDNA contained a single open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 493 amino acid residues. A data base homology search revealed that the predicted ER1 amino acid sequence contains three regions of similarity to the rat and human proteins encoded by the metastasis-associated gene, mta1, and two regions of similarity to the Caenorhabditis elegans sequence that is similar to mta1. The fibroblast growth factor-induced increase in er1 steady-state levels was not dependent on de novo protein synthesis, demonstrating that er1 is an immediate-early gene. Northern blot analysis revealed a single 2.8-kilobase pair mRNA that was observed predominantly during the initial cleavage and blastula stages of Xenopus development, with little or no detectable mRNA during subsequent development. Quantitative PCR analysis of early developmental stages showed that er1 peaked during late blastula. Computer-assisted analysis of the predicted ER1 amino acid sequence revealed two putative nuclear localization signals, four highly acidic regions clustered at the N terminus and a proline-rich region located near the C terminus. Subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry revealed that the ER1 protein was targeted exclusively to the nucleus. Transactivation assays using various regions of ER1 fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 demonstrated that the N-terminal acidic region is a potent transactivator.

Gallagher J.T. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 353-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). FGFs are involved in a number of cellular activities, including mitogenesis, cell differentiation, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 2Baird A. Klagsburn M. The Fibroblast Growth Factor Family. The New York Academy of Sciences, New York1991Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of FGF in various cell lines leads to phenotypic transformation (3Delli-Bovi P. Basilico C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5660-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Sasada R. Kurokawa T. Iwane M. Igarashi K. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To define the mechanisms by which a ligand can have such pleiotropic effects, a better understanding of molecular aspects of the various cellular responses is required. FGF can induce mesoderm differentiation in Xenopus embryonic tissue (6Slack J.M.W. Darlington B.G. Heath J.K. Godsave S.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), and many of the initial events in the cellular response during induction are similar to those previously characterized for the FGF-mediated mitogenic response. During mesoderm induction, FGF binds to high affinity cell surface receptors (7Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Slack J.M.W. Development. 1989; 106: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn become phosphorylated on tyrosine (8Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mahadevan L.C. Slack J.M.W. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated FGF receptor forms a signaling complex by binding a number of intracellular substrates (9Ryan P.J. Gillespie L.L. Develop. Biol. 1994; 166: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which results in activation of several well characterized signaling pathways. For instance, protein kinase C becomes activated during FGF-induced mesoderm differentiation (8Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mahadevan L.C. Slack J.M.W. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as does mitogen-activated protein kinase (10Hartley R.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ultimate targets of these signal transduction pathways are the immediate-early genes. To date, very few FGF immediate-early genes have been identified (11Smith J.C. Price B.M.J. Green J.B.A. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 12von Dassow G. Scmidt J.E. Kimelman D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have utilized the differential display methodology (13Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar) to isolate cDNAs representing such genes. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a cDNA representing a novel immediate-early gene,er1, whose steady-state levels increased in response to FGF. We show that the ER1 protein is targeted to the nucleus and that the N-terminal acidic region of ER1 can function as a transcriptional activator. Xenopus laevis were purchased from Nasco.

Specific primers incorporating 5′ and 3′ BglII sites (ER 1–493 and ER 176–493) or a 5′EcoRI and a 3′ BamHI site (ER 1–175 and ER 1–25) were used to amplify PCR fragments encoding the appropriate amino acids. The digested PCR fragments were inserted into the complementary sites of the pM plasmid, and all plasmids were sequenced to verify the junctions and the er1 sequence and to ensure the proper reading frame. ER 1–98 and ER1–57 were generated by digesting the ER 1–175 construct with PstI or PvuII, respectively, and religating the cut vector. 0.5 μg of a CAT reporter plasmid (pG5CAT,CLONTECH) was cotransfected into 3 × 105 cells with 1.0 μg of either the pM vector alone or one of the pM-er1 fusion constructs. After 48 h, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT enzyme using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's directions. In our efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of FGF-induced mesoderm differentiation in Xenopus, we employed the PCR-based differential display method (13Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar) to identify and characterize genes that are expressed early during the cellular response to FGF. RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed from five individual sets of 30-min FGF-treated or control animal pole explants (animal caps) from Xenopus blastulae. PCR products from the five sets were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. Only those bands that were differentially expressed in all five sets were chosen for further analysis. A total of eleven differentially expressed bands were identified, and one of these was eluted from the gel, cloned, and sequenced. A search of the data base for similarity to known sequences revealed that this cDNA represented a novel Xenopus gene, which we have named er1 (earlyresponse 1). The sequence of the er1 PCR product was used to obtain a 2.3-kb cDNA from a Xenopus blastula library (14Gillespie L.L. Chen G. Paterno G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22758-22763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This cDNA consisted of a single 1497-base pair open reading frame, bracketed by a 214-base pair 5′-untranslated region that contained several stop codons in all three frames and a 626-base pair 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The ATG initiation codon is predicted to be at nucleotides 233–235, because this site is positioned within a Kozak consensus sequence for the start of translation (21Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3574) Google Scholar), with a purine in the −3 position and a guanine in the +4 position. The open reading frame is predicted to encode a protein of 493 amino acids, beginning at nucleotide 233 and ending with an in-frame TAA stop codon at position 1712 (Fig. 1). Computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence using MOTIFS and PSORT software programs predicts that ER1 does not contain an N-terminal signal sequence for transfer into the endoplasmic reticulum or a hydrophobic domain characteristic of transmembrane proteins. However, ER1 does contain two potential nuclear localization signals (NLS): RRPR and KKSERYDFFAQQTRFGKKK (Fig. 1); the latter conforms to the consensus sequence for a bipartite NLS (22Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). ER1 also contains a proline-rich sequence near the C terminus that corresponds to the PXXP motif found in all high affinity SH3-domain binding ligands (23Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The N terminus of ER1 includes several highly acidic stretches (Fig. 1), characteristic of the acidic activation domains of many transcription factors (24Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). A data base homology search using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST Network Service revealed that ER1 contains three regions of similarity to the product of the rat metastasis-associated gene, mta1 (25Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), a gene that was isolated by differential cDNA library screening and whose expression was associated with a metastatic phenotype.mta1 encodes a 703-amino acid, 79-kDa polypeptide of unknown function that contains a putative SH3 binding domain near the C terminus. ER1 also displays similarity to the human MTA1 (accession number U35113) and to the Caenorhabditis elegans MTA1-like sequence (accession number U41264) (Fig. 2). Within the regions of similarity, the percentage of amino acid similarity ranged from 46 to 64%; however, the overall percentage of similarity was only 13.0, 14.0, and 15.6% to the rat, human, and C. elegans sequences, respectively. To investigate whether er1 represents the Xenopus homolog of mta1 or simply a related protein, we screened by RT-PCR a human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-468 (26Pathak S. Siciliano M.J. Caileau R. Wiseman C.L. Hsu T.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1979; 62: 263-271PubMed Google Scholar), for er1-related sequences. We obtained a partial human cDNA clone spanning sequence inside and outside the regions of similarity shown in Fig. 2; this sequence displays 91% overall similarity to er1 at the amino acid level (data not shown). The existence of a human gene product that is distinct from human mta1 and that shows a high degree of similarity to er1 suggests that er1 and mta1 are not homologs but possibly related members of a family of proteins or simply proteins containing some of the same functional domains. Verification that the steady-state levels of er1 were increased in response to FGF during mesoderm induction in vitro was performed by quantitative PCR after a 30-min treatment with FGF, using histone H4 as an internal standard (Fig.3 A). In several independent experiments, densitometric analysis revealed that er1 levels ranged from 3- to 4-fold higher in FGF-treated samples, after normalization to histone H4. These data confirm that er1 levels were increased by treatment with FGF and demonstrate that the increase in er1 occurs early during the cellular response to FGF. The possibility that er1 is an immediate-early gene was investigated further. By definition, transcription of immediate-early genes is a rapid response and is not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. The FGF-induced increase in er1 levels was measured in the presence or the absence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cycloheximide inhibited 90% of [35S]methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material (data not shown) but did not prevent the FGF-induced increase in er1 levels (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating that er1 is an immediate-early gene. Northern analysis of the temporal pattern of er1 expression during embryonic development revealed a single er1 mRNA (Fig. 4 A). The estimated 2.8-kb size of the message was slightly larger than that of the cDNA clone, but this is probably due to the presence of a poly(A) tail. er1 was detectable during initial cleavage stages prior to the start of zygotic transcription that occurs at mid-blastula transition (27Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), indicating that er1 is a maternally derived mRNA. Densitometric analysis revealed that steady-state levels of er1 were relatively constant during early cleavage stages (stages 2, 6, and 7; Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3), increased slightly at blastula stage (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), and then decreased 6-fold during gastrula, neurula, and tailbud stages (stages 12, 17, and 22; Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–7) and remained below detectable levels during subsequent development (stages 30 and 41; Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and 9). Mesoderm induction, a process in which FGF is known to play a pivotal role, takes place during blastula stages. Therefore, we examined er1 levels at 1-h time intervals during blastula and gastrula stages using a quantitative PCR assay (18Niehrs C. Steinbeisser H. De Robertis E.M. Science. 1994; 263: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). er1 expression levels were shown to increase 2-fold from early blastula (stages 7 and 8; Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2) to late blastula stages (stages 8 and 9; Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 4), followed by a 5-fold decrease at gastrulation (stage 10; Fig. 4 B,lane 5). Our sequence analysis revealed two putative nuclear localization signals, suggesting that ER1 is targeted to the nucleus. We investigated the subcellular localization of the ER1 protein using a polyclonal anti-ER1 antibody to stain transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing ER1. This antibody, directed against a synthetic C-terminal peptide, recognizes full-length ER1 protein synthesized in vitro (Fig. 5 A,lane 3) and specifically stains the nuclei of cells expressing ER1 (Fig. 5 B). Cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone (Fig. 5 B) as well as pcDNA3-er1 transfected cells stained with preimmune serum (not shown) gave similar patterns and showed no specific nuclear staining. The facts that ER1 is targeted to the nucleus and that its N terminus contains stretches of acidic residues characteristic of acidic activation domains (25Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that ER1 may function as a transcription factor. We investigated this possibility by testing the transactivation potential of various regions of the ER1 protein. Constructs containing different portions of er1 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain were used along with a CAT reporter plasmid in transient transfections. Assays of CAT enzyme levels revealed that although full-length ER1 did not activate transcription, the N-terminal region (ER 1–175) containing all four acidic stretches (Fig. 1) stimulated transcription 10-fold (Fig.6). The complementary C-terminal portion, ER 176–493, on the other hand, had no transactivational activity. It is unclear why full-length ER1 was unable to stimulate transcription, but one possible explanation is that fusion of ER1 to GAL4 may alter the tertiary structure of the ER1 protein, affecting its activity. A similar observation was made with the ETS transcription factor ER81, which when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain lost its ability to activate transcription (28Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal region to produce a construct containing only the first three acidic stretches (ER 1–98), resulted in a much more potent transactivator that stimulated transcription 80-fold (Fig. 6). This suggests that a negatively acting domain is located between amino acids 99–176. Further truncation of the N terminus to generate ER 1–57 and ER 1–25 completely abolished transactivation. These results demonstrate that the ER1 protein contains regions with transcription transactivating activity and that ER1 has the potential to function as a transcription factor."

MRP-8 expression is also down-regulated in vivo in psoriatic lesions after topical application of an anti-psoriatic RARβ/γ-selective synthetic retinoid, tazarotene.

Drugs. 1995; 4: 593-612Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of retinoids are mediated through two families of nuclear retinoid receptors, retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ) and retinoid X receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ). RARs and RXRs are modular proteins containing domains responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding (C-region), ligand independent transactivation (AF-1, A/B region), and ligand-dependent transactivation (AF-2, E-region) (1Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Design. 1996; 2: 295-316Google Scholar, 3Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Retinoid receptors transactivate the expression of genes in a ligand-dependent manner by sequence-specific binding to the retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) present in the promoter regions of responsive genes. In contrast to the steroid receptors, which function as homodimers, retinoid receptors function inside the cells as RAR-RXR heterodimers (4Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although the retinoid-dependent transactivation of genes can thus be explained by the binding of RAR-RXR to the RAREs, recruitment of co-activators, and subsequent activation of the transcriptional machinery, this paradigm does not hold true for the genes whose expression is repressed by retinoids. While RARs have been shown to inhibit the expression of certain genes by antagonizing the enhancer actions of the transcription factor AP1 (5Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the mechanism of retinoid-mediated inhibition of other non-AP1-dependent genes remains unclear. Since various inflammatory and hyperproliferative conditions appear to be maintained or perpetuated by the products of genes which are under the control of an AP1 motif, the antagonism of AP1-dependent gene expression appears to be an important underlying mechanism of the therapeutic action of RA.Tazarotene is an RARβ/γ-selective synthetic retinoid which is therapeutically effective in the treatment of psoriasis (6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol.

Duvic M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 14S-18SCrossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of tazarotene action in psoriasis, we have identified several tazarotene-responsive genes in an in vitro skin system by subtractive hybridization (8Nagpal S. Patel S.

Malhotra M. Shafer J. Krasinski G. Asano A.T. Teng M. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of one of the genes, migration inhibitory factor-related protein-8 (MRP-8), was inhibited in an RAR-dependent manner in vitro in cultured keratinocytes and in skin raft organ cultures, as well as in vivo in psoriatic lesions (9Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Patel S. Friant S. Malhotra M. Shafer J. Krasinski G. Asano A.T. Teng M. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar). MRP-8 is highly expressed in psoriatic epidermis, while its expression is absent in normal epidermis (10Wilkinson M.M. Busuttil A. Hayward C. Brock D.J. Dorin J.R. Van Heyningen V. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MRP-8 is also expressed in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic polyarthritis and cystic fibrosis and displays a 73% amino acid homology to a murine cytokine CP-10 (11Odink K.

We also show that the MRP-8 promoter is activated by NF-IL6 and retinoids inhibit MRP-8 expression by antagonizing the enhancer action of NF-IL6. We further demonstrate that the integrity of the core of the DNA binding domain (DBD) and the hydrophobic zipper region of RAR is mandatory for the inhibition of the MRP-8 promoter, thus indicating that the NF-IL6 antagonism domain of RAR is a complex of the DBD and the hydrophobic zipper region.DISCUSSIONWe have recently demonstrated that MRP-8 expression is inhibited by retinoids in vitro in skin systems such as cultured keratinocytes and skin rafts. Further, we have demonstrated that the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques with the anti-psoriatic retinoid tazarotene inhibits the expression of MRP-8 in psoriatic lesions during the course of clinical improvement of the disease (9Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Patel S. Friant S. Malhotra M. Shafer J. Krasinski G. Asano A.T. Teng M. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar). To delineate the mechanism of negative regulation of MRP-8 by retinoids, the promoter region of MRP-8 was cloned into a reporter plasmid and analyzed by transient transfection. The expression of MRP8CAT was induced in primary keratinocytes, a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), and HeLa cells, thus indicating that the elements involved in the serum and IFN-γ induction of the endogenous MRP-8 gene are present in the cloned upstream sequences. Further, both serum- and IFN-γ-induced expression of MRP8CAT was inhibited by retinoids in keratinocytes and in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the 1.5 kb of cloned MRP-8 promoter also harbors the retinoid regulatory sequences responsible for the repression of the gene. A motif search of the MRP-8 promoter did not turn up any obvious RAREs. An AP1-like motif (5′-TGACTAA-3′) present at −465 bp from the TATA box, however, was inactive since the MRP8CAT construct was non-responsive to TPA induction in both cultured keratinocytes and HeLa cells (Fig.2 c and data not shown). A search of the MRP-8 promoter revealed the presence of three putative NF-IL6 binding motifs. Co-transfection experiments with MRP8CAT and an NF-IL6 expression vector showed that NF-IL6 induced the MRP8CAT reporter (Fig.3 a). NF-IL6, like c-Jun/c-Fos, is a bZip transcription factor and belongs to the family of C/EBPs (20Brasier A.R. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10341-10351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAR inhibited the NF-IL6-induced expression of MRP8CAT in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 3 b). NF-IL6 is the second transcription factor identified so far whose enhancer action, like that of AP1, is antagonized by retinoids. Using various mutants of RARs, we demonstrate that the integrity of the DBD as well as the hydrophobic zipper region is obligatory for inhibition of MRP-8 gene expression (Fig. 4). The dispensability of the A/B regions, together with the requirement of the core of the DBD and the intact hydrophobic zipper suggested that the NF-IL6 antagonism function of RAR is a complex of two distinct domains (Fig. 4). Note that tazarotene, which is an RARβ/γ-selective retinoid in transactivation assays, inhibited the expression of the MRP-8 promoter through RARα (Fig. 2). Therefore, like the anti-AP1 property of RARα (6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the anti-NF-IL6 activity of RARα appears to be separable from its transactivation function.Retinoids are widely accepted as therapeutic modalities for the treatment of dermatological diseases including psoriasis and have been shown to be effective in the treatment of various cancers (e.g. acute promyelocytic leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, etc.). Further, retinoids inhibit the proliferation of a number of other cancer cell lines (e.g. breast, ovarian, colon etc.) in vitro (1Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Design. 1996; 2: 295-316Google Scholar). Although activation of genes has been thought to be the major mode of action of RARs, so far only one retinoid-induced gene has been identified which can transduce the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory signals of retinoids. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 is induced by retinoids in transformed cervical cells and inhibits the growth-promoting activities of insulin-like growth factor 1 (22Andreatta-Van Leyen S. Hembree J.R. Eckert R.L. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 160: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, a number of retinoid-repressed genes are associated with therapeutic effects of retinoids (6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The antagonism of AP1-dependent gene expression can explain some of the therapeutic effects of retinoids in various proliferative and inflammatory diseases. Since NF-IL6 is another pro-inflammatory and proliferative transcription factor, the inhibition of its activity delineates another pathway for the therapeutic effects of retinoids. NF-IL6 regulates the expression of IL-6 (23Ray A. LaForge K.S. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and as shown here, MRP-8, both of which are highly expressed in psoriasis (10Wilkinson M.M. Busuttil A. Hayward C. Brock D.J. Dorin J.R. Van Heyningen V. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Grossman R.M. Krueger J. Yourish D. Granelli-Piperno A. Murphy D.P. May L.T. Kupper T.S. Sehgal P.B. Gottlieb A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6367-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore, by antagonizing NF-IL6 action, retinoids would inhibit both IL-6 and MRP-8 in psoriatic lesions, resulting in disease amelioration. Retinoids, in fact, inhibit the expression of IL-6 in cultured keratinocytes and skin rafts. 3S. Thacher and R. A. S. Chandraratna, unpublished observations. Further, RAR-NF-IL6 antagonism can also account for the normalization of abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, since MRP-8 is associated with the abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes. In summary, we describe a novel pathway for the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of retinoids. This novel mode of retinoid action involves the interdiction of NF-IL6 signal transduction pathway by RARs in a ligand-dependent manner. This pathway can be therapeutically exploited by the systematic chemical synthesis of more potent anti-NF-IL6 retinoids. Such retinoids may exhibit increased therapeutic:toxic ratios for the treatment of certain retinoid-responsive diseases involving NF-IL6 as one of the pathophysiological signals.

Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Design. 1996; 2: 295-316Google Scholar, 3Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Retinoid receptors transactivate the expression of genes in a ligand-dependent manner by sequence-specific binding to the retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) present in the promoter regions of responsive genes. In contrast to the steroid receptors, which function as homodimers, retinoid receptors function inside the cells as RAR-RXR heterodimers (4Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although the retinoid-dependent transactivation of genes can thus be explained by the binding of RAR-RXR to the RAREs, recruitment of co-activators, and subsequent activation of the transcriptional machinery, this paradigm does not hold true for the genes whose expression is repressed by retinoids. While RARs have been shown to inhibit the expression of certain genes by antagonizing the enhancer actions of the transcription factor AP1 (5Fanjul A. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Jong L. Cameron J.F. Harlev E. Graupner G. Lu X.P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1994; 372: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the mechanism of retinoid-mediated inhibition of other non-AP1-dependent genes remains unclear. Since various inflammatory and hyperproliferative conditions appear to be maintained or perpetuated by the products of genes which are under the control of an AP1 motif, the antagonism of AP1-dependent gene expression appears to be an important underlying mechanism of the therapeutic action of RA. Tazarotene is an RARβ/γ-selective synthetic retinoid which is therapeutically effective in the treatment of psoriasis (6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a highly prevalent skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation and inflammation (7Krueger G.G. Duvic M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 14S-18SCrossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of tazarotene action in psoriasis, we have identified several tazarotene-responsive genes in an in vitro skin system by subtractive hybridization (8Nagpal S. Patel S. Asano A.T. Johnson A.T. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 269-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Patel S. Friant S. Malhotra M. Shafer J. Krasinski G. Asano A.T. Teng M. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of one of the genes, migration inhibitory factor-related protein-8 (MRP-8), was inhibited in an RAR-dependent manner in vitro in cultured keratinocytes and in skin raft organ cultures, as well as in vivo in psoriatic lesions (9Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Patel S. Friant S. Malhotra M. Shafer J. Krasinski G. Asano A.T. Teng M. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar). MRP-8 is highly expressed in psoriatic epidermis, while its expression is absent in normal epidermis (10Wilkinson M.M. Busuttil A. Hayward C. Brock D.J. Dorin J.R. Van Heyningen V. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MRP-8 is also expressed in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic polyarthritis and cystic fibrosis and displays a 73% amino acid homology to a murine cytokine CP-10 (11Odink K. Cerletti N. Bruggen J. Clerc R.G. Tarcsay L. Zwadlo G. Gerhards G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Nature. 1987; 330: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 12Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 2981-2991PubMed Google Scholar). In this manuscript we demonstrate that retinoids inhibit the expression of MRP-8 by directly acting at the promoter level. We also show that the MRP-8 promoter is activated by NF-IL6 and retinoids inhibit MRP-8 expression by antagonizing the enhancer action of NF-IL6. We further demonstrate that the integrity of the core of the DNA binding domain (DBD) and the hydrophobic zipper region of RAR is mandatory for the inhibition of the MRP-8 promoter, thus indicating that the NF-IL6 antagonism domain of RAR is a complex of the DBD and the hydrophobic zipper region. DISCUSSIONWe have recently demonstrated that MRP-8 expression is inhibited by retinoids in vitro in skin systems such as cultured keratinocytes and skin rafts. Further, we have demonstrated that the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques with the anti-psoriatic retinoid tazarotene inhibits the expression of MRP-8 in psoriatic lesions during the course of clinical improvement of the disease (9Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Patel S. Friant S. Malhotra M. Shafer J. Krasinski G. Asano A.T. Teng M. Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar). To delineate the mechanism of negative regulation of MRP-8 by retinoids, the promoter region of MRP-8 was cloned into a reporter plasmid and analyzed by transient transfection. The expression of MRP8CAT was induced in primary keratinocytes, a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), and HeLa cells, thus indicating that the elements involved in the serum and IFN-γ induction of the endogenous MRP-8 gene are present in the cloned upstream sequences. Further, both serum- and IFN-γ-induced expression of MRP8CAT was inhibited by retinoids in keratinocytes and in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the 1.5 kb of cloned MRP-8 promoter also harbors the retinoid regulatory sequences responsible for the repression of the gene. A motif search of the MRP-8 promoter did not turn up any obvious RAREs. An AP1-like motif (5′-TGACTAA-3′) present at −465 bp from the TATA box, however, was inactive since the MRP8CAT construct was non-responsive to TPA induction in both cultured keratinocytes and HeLa cells (Fig.2 c and data not shown). A search of the MRP-8 promoter revealed the presence of three putative NF-IL6 binding motifs. Co-transfection experiments with MRP8CAT and an NF-IL6 expression vector showed that NF-IL6 induced the MRP8CAT reporter (Fig.3 a). NF-IL6, like c-Jun/c-Fos, is a bZip transcription factor and belongs to the family of C/EBPs (20Brasier A.R. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10341-10351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAR inhibited the NF-IL6-induced expression of MRP8CAT in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 3 b). NF-IL6 is the second transcription factor identified so far whose enhancer action, like that of AP1, is antagonized by retinoids. Using various mutants of RARs, we demonstrate that the integrity of the DBD as well as the hydrophobic zipper region is obligatory for inhibition of MRP-8 gene expression (Fig. 4). The dispensability of the A/B regions, together with the requirement of the core of the DBD and the intact hydrophobic zipper suggested that the NF-IL6 antagonism function of RAR is a complex of two distinct domains (Fig. 4). Note that tazarotene, which is an RARβ/γ-selective retinoid in transactivation assays, inhibited the expression of the MRP-8 promoter through RARα (Fig. 2). Therefore, like the anti-AP1 property of RARα (6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the anti-NF-IL6 activity of RARα appears to be separable from its transactivation function.Retinoids are widely accepted as therapeutic modalities for the treatment of dermatological diseases including psoriasis and have been shown to be effective in the treatment of various cancers (e.g. acute promyelocytic leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, etc.). Further, retinoids inhibit the proliferation of a number of other cancer cell lines (e.g. breast, ovarian, colon etc.) in vitro (1Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A.S. Curr. Pharm. Design. 1996; 2: 295-316Google Scholar). Although activation of genes has been thought to be the major mode of action of RARs, so far only one retinoid-induced gene has been identified which can transduce the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory signals of retinoids. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 is induced by retinoids in transformed cervical cells and inhibits the growth-promoting activities of insulin-like growth factor 1 (22Andreatta-Van Leyen S. Hembree J.R. Eckert R.L. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 160: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, a number of retinoid-repressed genes are associated with therapeutic effects of retinoids (6Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The antagonism of AP1-dependent gene expression can explain some of the therapeutic effects of retinoids in various proliferative and inflammatory diseases. Since NF-IL6 is another pro-inflammatory and proliferative transcription factor, the inhibition of its activity delineates another pathway for the therapeutic effects of retinoids. NF-IL6 regulates the expression of IL-6 (23Ray A. LaForge K.S. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and as shown here, MRP-8, both of which are highly expressed in psoriasis (10Wilkinson M.M. Busuttil A. Hayward C. Brock D.J.

Gottlieb A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6367-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore, by antagonizing NF-IL6 action, retinoids would inhibit both IL-6 and MRP-8 in psoriatic lesions, resulting in disease amelioration. Retinoids, in fact, inhibit the expression of IL-6 in cultured keratinocytes and skin rafts. 3S. Thacher and R. A. S. Chandraratna, unpublished observations. Further, RAR-NF-IL6 antagonism can also account for the normalization of abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, since MRP-8 is associated with the abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes. In summary, we describe a novel pathway for the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of retinoids. This novel mode of retinoid action involves the interdiction of NF-IL6 signal transduction pathway by RARs in a ligand-dependent manner. This pathway can be therapeutically exploited by the systematic chemical synthesis of more potent anti-NF-IL6 retinoids. Such retinoids may exhibit increased therapeutic:toxic ratios for the treatment of certain retinoid-responsive diseases involving NF-IL6 as one of the pathophysiological signals. We have recently demonstrated that MRP-8 expression is inhibited by retinoids in vitro in skin systems such as cultured keratinocytes and skin rafts.

Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). This binding is dependent upon a high affinity interaction between the LDL receptor and its protein ligands, apolipoprotein (apo) E and apoB-100, which are present on the surface of plasma lipoprotein particles. Mutations in the LDL receptor gene that decrease or eliminate ligand binding have been linked to a genetic disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia, which results in a significant elevation of plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations, severe atherosclerosis, and premature death (2Goldstein J.L.

The cardinal structural feature of this superfamily is the presence of various numbers of cysteine-rich repeats approximately 40 amino acids in length. Each repeat contains 6 cysteines whose positions within the repeats are stringently conserved. The LDL receptor contains 7 such repeats, clustered at the amino terminus, which together constitute the ligand-binding domain of the receptor (9Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J.

Each repeat also features a conserved cluster of negatively charged residues (Ser-Asp-Glu) located between the 5th and 6th cysteines in each repeat, which are required for binding of apoE and apoB-100 although the contributions of individual repeats appear to be quite variable (11Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These clusters are thought to interact with corresponding clusters of positively charged residues in the receptor binding regions of apoE and apoB-100 (12Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). In the case of apoE, the receptor binding region lies in the vicinity of residues 136–150, a region enriched in positively charged residues (12Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar, 13Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of a fragment of apoE containing the receptor binding region is an anti-parallel four-helix bundle (14Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The receptor binding region lies on the face of the fourth helix in the bundle. The binding region in apoB-100 has been suggested to be located in the vicinity of residues 3359–3369, a sequence similar to the receptor binding region of apoE (15Knott T.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Innerarity T.L. Jacobson S.F. Urdea M.S. Levy-Wilson B. Powell L.M. Pease R.J. Eddy R. Nakai H. Byers M. Priestley L.M. Robertson E. Rall L.B. Betsholtz C. Shows T.B. Mahley R.W. Scott J. Science. 1985; 230: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To understand the interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor at the molecular level, it will be necessary to determine the structure of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor and, ultimately, the structure of a complex of the receptor and apoE. Although the individual structures of the first 2 of the 7 ligand-binding repeats have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (16Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this information provides little insight into either the overall structure of the ligand-binding domain of the receptor or the details of its interaction with apoE. As a first step in delineating this interaction, we have expressed and purified from Escherichia coli the entire 292-amino acid ligand-binding domain of the human LDL receptor, including all 7 cysteine-rich repeats, with 42 cysteine residues that likely form 21 intra-repeat disulfide bonds. This fragment has been successfully refolded and reoxidized to yield a homogeneous and active preparation that displays all the properties and specificities of the native intact receptor. The plasmid pTZ1, containing the complete human LDL receptor sequence, was the kind gift of Dr. David Russell, University of Texas Southwest Medical Center. A fragment coding for residues 1–292 was amplified by reaction and ligated into pET32a (Novagen), a thioredoxin fusion expression vector. The resulting plasmid, pET32–292, was further modified by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis to generate a thrombin-cleavage consensus sequence immediately upstream of residue 1 of the receptor. This plasmid, pET32NT-292, was used in all subsequent expression studies. Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all polymerase chain reactions. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar). For expression of the receptor fusion, pET32NT-292 was transformed into the T7 expression strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Fresh transformants or frozen glycerol stocks were used to inoculate a 500-ml overnight culture in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma). The overnight culture was pelleted (15 min at 4000 rpm in a Beckman J6B centrifuge) and resuspended in 500 ml of fresh medium. 50 ml of this suspension was used to inoculate each of six 1-liter cultures in 2800-ml Fernbach flasks. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until midlog phase (A 550 of approximately 0.6) when expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cultures were induced for 2 h at 37 °C and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1% of the original volume of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA), lysed by sonication with a Branson 450 sonicator, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris. The cleared lysate was transferred to a 400-ml glass beaker and incubated in an 80 °C water bath for 7 min with constant agitation to precipitate heat-labile proteins. The precipitate was then removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 18,000 × g. The receptor fusion was then cleaved by incubation with thrombin (Hemotologic Technologies) overnight at room temperature at a weight ratio of 1:100. Guanidine hydrochloride (ICN) and β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) were added to the cleaved mixture in final concentrations of 7 mand 1%, respectively. The mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (4.8 × 120 cm, Kontes), and eluted with 4 mguanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing the receptor fragment were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (19Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pooled. Western blot analysis and isoelectric focusing were performed as described previously (19Wetterau J.R.

Chem. 1981; 256: 9077-9083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of free –SH groups was determined by SDS-PAGE after the addition of 0.5 μl of 20 mm fluorescein-5-maleimide in dimethylformamide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to protein samples in sample buffer, containing 2% SDS (22McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and electrophoresed, and modifications were detected by UV irradiation on a transilluminator. The purified receptor fragment was dialyzed against 4 mguanidine at 4 °C under argon to remove the β-mercaptoethanol. The receptor was refolded and oxidized by dilution to ∼60 μg/ml in refolding buffer (20 mm glycylglycine, pH 9.0, 20 mm CaCl2, 10 mm cysteamine (Sigma), 1 mm cystamine (Fluka)), incubated overnight at room temperature, and dialysed against 20 mm glycylglycine, pH 9.0, and 20 mm CaCl2. The active 292 receptor fragment was isolated by affinity chromatography using LDL-Sepharose. Freshly prepared human LDL was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (30 mg of LDL/g of Sepharose) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After dialysis, refolded LDL receptor preparations were incubated with the LDL-Sepharose, previously equilibrated with 20 mm glycylglycine, pH 9.0, and 20 mm CaCl2 for 4 h at 4 °C. After the LDL-Sepharose was washed with equilibration buffer, the active receptor fragment was eluted with 2 m NaCl and 20 mmCaCl2. Plasma LDL and apoE isoforms were isolated as described previously (23Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 145-168Google Scholar, 24Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W.

Chem. 1982; 257: 2664-2673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive control for receptor binding activity, a preparation of bovine LDL receptor isolated from adrenal glands was used (26Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For LDL binding assays, LDL (500 ng/well) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline) was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 96-well microtiter dishes (Dynatech Immunlon, Chantilly, VA). After each subsequent step, the plates were washed with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Various LDL receptor preparations were diluted to approximately 100 ng/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 20 mmCaCl2 and incubated in the LDL-coated wells for 2 h at room temperature. In some assays to test for calcium-dependent binding, CaCl2 was not included in the buffer, or the sample was treated with 20 mm EGTA before dilution into calcium-free buffer. Bound receptor was detected with the anti-LDL receptor monoclonal antibody C7 (Amersham), followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Amersham) and color development with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For apoE binding assays, apoE4, apoE3, and apoE2 (100 ng/well) were incubated as described above for LDL. The refolded and purified receptor (1 mg/ml) was diluted (1:10,000), added to the wells, and detected as described above. Determinations were performed in triplicate. In parallel wells without added receptor, an anti-apoE antibody was used for detection to ensure that the microtiter wells were coated with comparable amounts of each apoE isoform. Antiserum to the affinity-purified receptor was prepared in pathogen-free rabbits. The IgG fraction was prepared on a protein A cartridge (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human fibroblast binding assays were performed with 125I-LDL as described previously (27Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Bersot T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6289-6295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the ability of receptor fragment antibodies to compete with LDL for LDL receptors on fibroblasts, increasing concentrations of receptor fragment IgG were incubated with the fibroblasts for 1 h at 4 °C before addition of125I-LDL. The multidomain structure of the human LDL receptor, including the ligand-binding domain with its 7 cysteine-rich repeats is shown in Fig. 1. Since our long-term goal is to determine the interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor, our strategy was to express and purify a soluble fragment of the receptor that includes this domain for structural studies: residues 1–292. Following very limited success with expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris, we focused on expression in E. coli encouraged by reports of the successful expression and refolding of the individual repeats 1 and 2 (16Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although a variety of expression vectors failed to express detectable amounts of the receptor fragment, we were successful using a thioredoxin fusion system (28LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). This T7-driven expression cassette produced a soluble 52-kDa fusion protein in modest amounts (Fig.2).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of 292 receptor fragment purification.

Therefore, a thrombin cleavage consensus sequence (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) was introduced immediately upstream of residue 1 of the receptor fragment by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. With this construct, complete cleavage of the fusion protein was obtained at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2). However, in addition to the thrombin site that we inserted, the fusion contains an additional site 34 amino acids upstream, generating a product only slightly (∼3.6 kDa) larger than the receptor fragment itself. Because the latter site was preferentially cleaved, it was critical to monitor the progress of the reaction by SDS-PAGE to ensure complete cleavage of both sites. Thioredoxin-containing fusion proteins often retain one or both of its unique properties, heat stability and preferential release during osmotic shock, both of which are useful for purification (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). Although the receptor fragment fusion protein was not preferentially released by osmotic shock (data not shown), it turned out to be strikingly stable to heat denaturation. The fusion protein remained soluble at 80 °C for as long as 15 min (Fig. 2), whereas the majority of contaminating bacterial proteins precipitated, allowing us to use heat treatment as a major purification step. Using this method, we typically obtain approximately 10 mg of partially purified fusion protein per liter of cells in culture. The partially purified fusion protein was then cleaved with thrombin, and the released receptor fragment was separated from thioredoxin by gel filtration under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2). Even after extended incubation with thrombin, there were no apparent cleavages within the receptor fragment. The accuracy of cleavage was confirmed by amino-terminal protein sequencing (data not shown), which showed the expected two amino acid amino-terminal extension (Gly-Ser) generated by thrombin cleavage within its recognition sequence. Although there was little LDL receptor binding activity associated with the purified fragment at this point (Fig. 3), comparison of reduced and non-reduced lanes showed some disulfide bond formation (Fig. 2). At this step, we routinely obtain 5–6 mg of the semipurified receptor fragment per liter. Initially, we concentrated the pooled fractions containing the receptor fragment from the gel filtration column to approximately 5–10 mg/ml before refolding to ensure low guanidine concentrations in the diluted refolding mixture. However, it was discovered that concentration promoted the formation of high molecular weight, cross-linked aggregates (data not shown). After later experiments demonstrated that guanidine concentrations of ∼1m could be tolerated in the diluted refolding mixtures, pooled fractions were diluted directly to approximately 60 μg/ml. The final refolding conditions were arrived at by screening an extensive set of conditions for their ability to generate LDL receptor binding activity as assessed using an LDL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A variety of factors, including pH, temperature, buffers and their concentrations, additives, and time, were explored. Although the majority of the conditions that were assayed resulted in some degree of binding activity, several factors proved critical in generating high levels of the correct receptor species. The presence of Ca2+ at a high concentration (20 mm) was absolutely essential, as were a relatively high pH (>8.0) and the addition of a thiol exchange system. The importance of Ca2+in the folding of the LDL receptor and repeat 5 was recently pointed out (30Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and may result from its ability to stabilize folding intermediates (31Creighton T.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cysteamine/cystamine thiol exchange system was more efficient than the more widely utilized reduced/oxidized glutathione system. This may be due to the smaller relative size of cysteamine and cystamine, which might allow better access to the interior of the relatively compact repeat structure. It is also possible that the positively charged amino group on cysteamine is more effective in the highly negatively charged environment that characterizes the receptor repeats. Another key step was the removal of both the thiol exchange system and residual guanidine by dialysis. This step proved to be absolutely essential in generating a fully folded receptor fragment. It is possible that removal of the thiol exchange system and guanidine facilitates a final oxidative refolding step in which a critical disulfide link (or links) is formed, leading directly to the fully folded state. As shown in Fig. 2, this dialysis step produces a narrow compact band above the broad heterogeneous mixture of bands, which likely contain a number of misfolded intermediates. This compact band turns out to be the fully folded and an active receptor fragment. The final step in the isolation was affinity chromatography. The refolded mixture was applied to an LDL-Sepharose column, and as shown in Fig. 2, only the thin compact band was bound. This refolded receptor fragment could be eluted with either a salt or a pH gradient. At this point, the receptor fragment is approximately 99% pure. We estimate that approximately 10% of the starting material is successfully refolded. Our overall yield is approximately 0.5 mg of purified and refolded receptor fragment per liter of cells. At various stages of purification, the receptor binding activity of the receptor fragment was monitored with an LDL plate assay. Little, if any, activity is present in the 80 °C supernatant or the thrombin-digested mixture (Fig. 3). A low level of activity is present following the gel filtration step, indicating that some refolding and reoxidation occurs in 4 m guanidine and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol or occurs after dialysis. It is possible that this activity represents the presence of a significant fraction of partially folded and hence weakly active species, rather than a small amount of fully active receptor fragment. Western blot experiments with monoclonal antibody C7 (32Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Südhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which recognizes only correctly folded repeat 1, demonstrated that the majority of the receptor was partially folded even at this early stage, whereas no species migrating in the position of the fully folded receptor fragment could be detected on SDS gels (data not shown). Refolding led to a 10-fold increase in total binding activity, followed by another 10-fold increase in activity after the affinity step (Fig. 3). Taking the differences in molecular mass into account, the 292 receptor fragment has approximately the same level of activity as the full-length bovine receptor, as assessed in the LDL plate assay, suggesting the fragment has full binding activity. However, this comparison must be viewed as a qualitative rather than a quantitative argument given the potential for differences in both intrinsic activity and antibody recognition between the two species. To assure that a homogeneous, correctly folded, and fully active fragment was produced, the fragment was subjected to a variety of analyses based on the known properties of the intact native receptor, the results of which are presented below. Although the refolded receptor fragment appeared to be homogeneous on non-reducing SDS gels, it was important to establish that it does, in fact, represent a single molecular species. As shown in Fig.4, the refolded fragment migrated as a single species on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, as well as on an isoelectric focusing gel, providing strong evidence that it comprises a structurally homogeneous population. As expected from the amino acid composition, the pI of the receptor fragment is acidic (pI ∼4.0). The disulfide connectivities of the 6 cysteine residues in the independently folded repeats 1, 2, and 5 are the same in each repeat: Cys-1–Cys-3, Cys-2–Cys-5, and Cys-4–Cys-6 (16Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the same disulfide connectivity would occur in all 7 repeats in the intact native receptor and that all 42 cysteine residues would be disulfide bonded with each repeat containing 3 intra-repeat disulfide bonds. Therefore, if the receptor fragment is properly folded, it should contain no free cysteine residues. To determine if this was the case, we used fluorescein-5-maleimide, a fluorescent cysteine-specific reagent that reacts with free –SH groups. As shown in Fig. 5, the refolded receptor fragment when modified under denaturing conditions did not fluoresce, indicating that it contains no detectable free –SH groups. For comparison, apoE3, which contains a single cysteine residue, was easily detected when loaded in a equimolar amount, whereas apoE4, which contains no cysteines, did not fluoresce, as expected. This experiment provides strong evidence that all of the cysteines in the refolded receptor fragment are disulfide bonded. Another characteristic of the native LDL receptor is that it exhibits a Ca2+ requirement for high affinity binding to LDL (33van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Südhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the receptor fragment also exhibited Ca2+-dependent binding, the binding activity of the receptor fragment in the presence and absence of Ca2+was examined. The standard binding buffer for the plate assay contains 2 mm CaCl2, and the LDL binding of the fragment in this buffer was defined as 100%. As shown in Fig.6, binding was significantly reduced if Ca2+ was not included in the binding buffer. Although no Ca2+ was added, some is likely to be receptor-bound because Ca2+ is present at a relatively high concentration in the refolding and affinity isolation procedures. This residual binding was virtually eliminated by adding EGTA to the incubation mixture. Hence, like the native receptor, the receptor fragment shows highly Ca2+-dependent binding activity. In addition to apoB-100 on LDL, apoE-containing lipoproteins are the other major ligand for the LDL receptor (34Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1440-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To bind with high affinity to the LDL receptor, apoE must be complexed with lipid (35Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is typically done by reconstituting apoE into vesicles with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) to mimic its natural environment (35Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using apoE·DMPC complexes in the plate assay, we demonstrated the same Ca2+-dependent binding as was observed for LDL (data not shown). Interestingly, lipid-free apoE bound to the microtiter wells also bound with high affinity to the LDL receptor fragment. Thus, it appears that apoE binding to a plastic surface mimics binding to lipid with respect to the high affinity receptor interaction. Another key characteristic of the native LDL receptor is its differential binding to the three common human apoE isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. These isoforms are distinguished by cysteine and arginine differences at positions 112 and 158; apoE3 contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both positions (36Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4171-4178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas apoE3 and apoE4 bind to the LDL receptor with essentially the same affinity, apoE2 displays defective binding (<1% of that of apoE3 or apoE4) (38Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2518-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defective binding of apoE2 is an underlying cause of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a lipoprotein disorder associated with elevated plasma lipid levels and premature heart disease (39Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. de Gennes J.L. Polonovski J. Paoletti R. Latent Dyslipoproteinemias and Atherosclerosis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1984: 157-163Google Scholar). If the receptor fragment is correctly folded and fully active, it should exhibit differential binding to the apoE isoforms. This expectation was tested with either apoE·DMPC complexes or lipid-free apoE in a plate assay. The results with both forms of apoE were essentially identical; the data for the lipid-free apoE isoforms are presented in Fig. 7. As shown, the amounts of receptor fragment bound to apoE3 and apoE4 were identical, whereas binding to apoE2 was less than 5% of that of apoE3 and apoE4 (comparable amounts of each isoform were bound to the wells). These results clearly demonstrate that the isoform specificities of the intact LDL receptor are mirrored by the receptor fragment. As a further test of the authenticity of the receptor fragment, we reasoned that an antibody raised to the refolded receptor fragment should recognize the native receptor. As determined by Western blot analysis, an anti-receptor fragment antibody bound to LDL receptors from rat liver and bovine adrenal membranes, whereas it did not bind to misfolded or non-folded receptor fragments, i.e. fusion protein or S-300 fraction (data not shown). In addition, the antibodies completely inhibited the binding of human LDL to LDL receptors on human fibroblasts (Fig. 8), demonstrating that the antibodies recognized the native human receptor. In summary, the evidence presented above strongly supports the conclusion that the binding activity of the LDL receptor fragment is biologically relevant and that the receptor fragment has been successfully refolded to its native conformation. With this correctly folded receptor fragment available, we can now begin to address structural questions, such as the overall topology of the 7 cysteine-rich repeats, the role of calcium in ligand interaction, the number of repeats involved in apoE interaction, and how the Arg-150 conformational change in apoE2 reduces receptor binding activity. In addition, with the methods developed here, production and refolding of the ligand-binding domains of other members of the LDL receptor superfamily are potentially feasible. The authors thank K.

Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). This class includes both cation channels (acetylcholine and serotonin type 3 receptors) and anion channels (glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid type A, and an invertebrate glutamate receptor). Available data for some of these receptors suggest that each is a pentamer of homologous or identical subunits. Each subunit contains an NH2-terminal extracellular domain (∼200 residues) followed by four putative membrane-spanning domains. The regions between the second and third transmembrane domains (∼15 residues) and after the fourth transmembrane domain (∼9 residues) are also thought to be extracellular but do not appear to be critical for the folding of the large NH2-terminal domain (see below). The high degree of sequence similarity among these subunits, especially in their extracellular domains, suggests that if the structure of any one was known, molecular modeling could be used to approximate the structures of the others.Although there has recently been progress in obtaining structures of membrane proteins (particularly of bacterial membrane proteins) (2$$Google Scholar), many years of effort with Torpedo AChR have failed to yield crystals that diffract to high resolution. The highest resolution structural information on these receptors thus far is that obtained by Unwin (3Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 4Unwin N.

Two-dimensional close-packed arrays of AChR in tubular membranes were prepared from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata, a particularly rich source of muscle-type AChR, and examined using electron microscopy. From these studies a three-dimensional structure to 9 Å resolution (3Unwin N. J. Mol.

Although these data provide evidence for the presence of certain elements of secondary structure, obtaining atomic resolution structural information remains an important goal.One approach that has been used successfully to obtain atomic resolution structures of membrane-bound receptors is to express these proteins heterologously in truncated, soluble forms. Because these fragments no longer contain long stretches of hydrophobic amino acids requiring detergent for solubilization, they crystallize more readily. The structures of the ligand binding domains of the human growth hormone receptor (5Devos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar), the neonatal Fc receptor (6Burmeister W.P. Gastinel N.E. Simister N.E. Blum M.L. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the T-cell receptor (7Garcia K.C. Degano M. Stanfield R.L. Brunmark A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A.

Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) among others, have been determined in this way.Although only about half the mass of AChR is extracellular, several recent studies suggest that the NH2-terminal domain of a single subunit might be suited to this approach because the α subunit and various truncated forms of this subunit can fold independently of the other subunits. The assembly of the mouse muscle AChR has been studied extensively (9Green W.N. Millar N.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Blount P. Merlie J.P. Curr. Top. Membr. 1991; 39: 277-294Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Each subunit is synthesized as a preprotein with an NH2-terminal signal peptide directing translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Here the signal peptides are cleaved, and the subunits fold, become glycosylated, and are assembled into the final pentameric receptor. The α subunit acquires two conformation-dependent binding sites during the folding process but before assembly with the other subunits (11Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these sites is the main immunogenic region, which is the epitope recognized by most experimentally derived antibodies and by a large fraction of the anti-AChR antibodies from patients with myasthenia gravis (12Conti-Tronconi B.M. McLane K.E. Raftery M.A. Grando S.A. Protti M.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 69-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The other binding site, which overlaps with the ligand binding site, is for the snake venom protein α-bungarotoxin (α-Btx). These binding sites are acquired simultaneously about 20 min after the α subunit is translated. After folding (or at least partial folding), subunit assembly occurs. Folded α subunits associate with either δ or γ subunits to form heterodimers. In studies of cells transfected with various combinations of subunits, it has been found that the αδ and αγ heterodimers have high affinity cholinergic ligand binding sites and that the distinct agonist/antagonist profiles of these two heterodimers match those of the whole receptor (13Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).Several studies have examined the effects of coexpression of truncated subunits with full-length subunits. Generally, subunits truncated after the first transmembrane domain (M1) have a dominant negative effect on the appearance of receptor on the plasma membrane, measured either electrophysiologically or by α-Btx binding (14Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Sumikawa K. Nishizaki T. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The origin of this effect is the formation of a specific complex between full-length subunits and the truncated forms. These complexes neither form complete receptors nor undergo transport to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal domains of AChR subunits contain regions that specifically recognize other subunits. Together with the observation that the α subunit is able to fold independently of the other subunits, these data suggest that the α subunit NH2-terminal domain may be a viable target for structural investigation.In the present experiments, we sought to produce the extracellular domains of AChR subunits in their native states in quantities sufficient for biochemical and structural studies. First with Xenopus oocytes and then with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we expressed the truncated NH2-terminal fragment of the α subunit fused with a sequence directing membrane anchorage via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage (16Lin A.Y. Devaux B. Green A. Sagerstrom C. Elliott J.F. Davis M.M. Science. 1990; 249: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). By cleaving this protein from the membrane, we were able to obtain this portion of the AChR as a soluble protein. Toxin and antibody binding studies indicate that this fragment adopts a fold comparable to the corresponding region of the intact receptor. Circular dichroism (CD) studies reveal that this fragment of the receptor contains a large proportion of β-sheet secondary structure.DISCUSSIONThe α210GPI protein expresses well in oocytes and leads to the accumulation of surface α-Btx binding sites. Encouraged by this, we expressed and purified this protein on a larger scale using CHO cells. We are confident that the molecule we have purified, α210GPI, is folded correctly for the following reasons: (i) the material was affinity purified using a conformation-specific antibody; (ii) both the main immunogenic region epitope and the α-Btx binding site were present in the purified material; (iii) gel filtration results demonstrate that α210GPI behaves as a monomer and that it forms a complex with α-Btx with a slightly greater apparent molecular weight; and (iv) the α-Btx/mAb 35 binding activity of α210GPI is eliminated by thermal denaturation.If about 15% of α210GPI is in an α-helical conformation, this represents approximately 33 amino acids. The sum of the lengths of these helices would be roughly 50 Å. In the 9 Å resolution electron microscopy structure, the extracellular portion of AChR contained three resolvable rods per subunit, approximately in the middle of that portion of the receptor (3Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These rods in the electron density map appear to extend over at least 12 Å each. We thus consider our data to be compatible with the three α-helices identified in the extracellular domain of AChR. Our data also suggest that there is little or no α-helical structure elsewhere in the NH2-terminal domain of AChR, implying that the remainder of the structure may be composed largely of β-sheet. This is in agreement with an early amphipathic analysis of AChR sequences which predicted the extracellular domain of AChR to contain extensive β-sheet structure (34Finer-Moore J. Stroud R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar).When one considers the constraints that our data may place on the structure of AChR, an important issue is whether the secondary structures of the extracellular domains of the other subunits are largely the same as that for the α subunit. The high degree of sequence similarly (35–40% identity) and the results from electron microscopy studies suggest that such an assumption is reasonable, although there is little direct experimental evidence to address this question. With this caveat, our data suggest that the nonextracellular portion of AChR must have a relatively large proportion of α-helical structure if one is to reconcile these results with the previous CD spectrum of the entire receptor. Unfortunately, without knowledge of the secondary structure of the intracellular domain, no conclusions with respect to the structure of the transmembrane domains can be made.The most prominent change in the CD spectrum which occurs upon heating is the appearance of negative ellipticity around 230 nm. The relatively flat spectrum from 230–240 nm, a region that should have negative ellipticity because of the β-sheet signal, suggests that there is an element of structure giving a positive ellipticity in this region. A positive component in this region is a feature of aromatic and/or disulfide chromophores, which can acquire rotational strength around 230 nm when they are in specific chiral environments in proteins (35Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Notably, α210GPI is unusually rich in aromatic amino acids; it has 10 tyrosines and 8 tryptophans, about twice the expected number based on the average amino acid content of soluble proteins.The apparent robustness of the α210GPI secondary structure to thermal denaturation is not unprecedented. For example, when bovine β-lactoglobulin A, a β-sheet-rich protein, is thermally denatured, the effect on the secondary structure (as measured by CD) is very small (36Griffin W.G. Griffin M.C.A. Martin S.R. Price J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 3395-3406Crossref Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the aggregation/misfolding of many proteins is associated with the formation of intermolecular β-sheet structures (36Griffin W.G. Griffin M.C.A. Martin S.R. Price J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 3395-3406Crossref Google Scholar, 37Speed M.A. Wang D.I.C. King J. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The relatively low temperature required to cause loss of binding activity of α210GPI and the inefficient folding of the α subunit in vivo (with most of the newly synthesized α subunit appearing as non-α-Btx-binding aggregates) suggests that the α subunit is susceptible to this form of misfolding.We contend that the lower than expected specific binding of α-Btx by the purified α210GPI is not likely to change substantially our estimates of the secondary structure. We consider the possible causes for the low specific binding. (i) If the α210GPI is contaminated with some denatured protein, then the recorded CD is a mixture of the folded and unfolded material. However, the spectrum of the heat-denatured protein is not markedly dissimilar from that of the correctly folded material. Therefore, admixture of some fraction of unfolded material will have little effect on the secondary structure estimates. (ii) If the protein concentration measurement is too high, this could increase the mean residue ellipticity substantially. Nevertheless, the shape of the spectrum, which is not very characteristic of α-helix, would be unchanged. The measurement of protein concentration by UV is reported to be accurate within about 10% (25Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). (iii) The measured specific binding may be slightly low because of occlusion of the α-Btx binding site by the antibody resin or by loss during washing steps.The absence of a ligand binding site on oocytes expressing only α210GPI agrees with previous studies (11Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that although the (complete) α subunit binds α-Btx with high affinity, it lacks the conventional ligand binding site of AChR. This site forms only when the muscle α subunit is coexpressed with either the δ or γ subunit (13Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). There is no obvious explanation for the failure of α210GPI and δ226GPI to form the ligand binding site when coexpressed. Coexpression of δ226GPI with α210GPI led to a much lower level of surface expression compared with α210GPI alone, even taking into account the reduced amount of α210GPI mRNA injected. Thus expression of δ226GPI may interfere with surface expression of α210GPI by an unknown mechanism. These findings are very similar to results reported by Hall and colleagues (38Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of α-Btx to α7-208GPI was inhibited by d-tubocurarine, indicating the formation of a ligand binding site and thus suggesting oligomerization of this protein (extrapolating from studies on the muscle receptor). Also, it has been reported (39Anand R. Peng X. Lindstrom J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that oligomerization of α7 subunits is required for formation of the α-Btx binding site. It will thus be interesting to express and characterize α7-208GPI in future experiments. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; α-Btx, α-bungarotoxin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol. 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; α-Btx, α-bungarotoxin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol. is the best studied member of a large class of structurally related neurotransmitter-gated ion channels (1Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). This class includes both cation channels (acetylcholine and serotonin type 3 receptors) and anion channels (glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid type A, and an invertebrate glutamate receptor). Available data for some of these receptors suggest that each is a pentamer of homologous or identical subunits. Each subunit contains an NH2-terminal extracellular domain (∼200 residues) followed by four putative membrane-spanning domains. The regions between the second and third transmembrane domains (∼15 residues) and after the fourth transmembrane domain (∼9 residues) are also thought to be extracellular but do not appear to be critical for the folding of the large NH2-terminal domain (see below). The high degree of sequence similarity among these subunits, especially in their extracellular domains, suggests that if the structure of any one was known, molecular modeling could be used to approximate the structures of the others. Although there has recently been progress in obtaining structures of membrane proteins (particularly of bacterial membrane proteins) (2$$Google Scholar), many years of effort with Torpedo AChR have failed to yield crystals that diffract to high resolution. The highest resolution structural information on these receptors thus far is that obtained by Unwin (3Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 4Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional close-packed arrays of AChR in tubular membranes were prepared from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata, a particularly rich source of muscle-type AChR, and examined using electron microscopy. From these studies a three-dimensional structure to 9 Å resolution (3Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) and a projection structure to 7.5 Å (4Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were obtained.

When one considers the constraints that our data may place on the structure of AChR, an important issue is whether the secondary structures of the extracellular domains of the other subunits are largely the same as that for the α subunit. The high degree of sequence similarly (35–40% identity) and the results from electron microscopy studies suggest that such an assumption is reasonable, although there is little direct experimental evidence to address this question. With this caveat, our data suggest that the nonextracellular portion of AChR must have a relatively large proportion of α-helical structure if one is to reconcile these results with the previous CD spectrum of the entire receptor. Unfortunately, without knowledge of the secondary structure of the intracellular domain, no conclusions with respect to the structure of the transmembrane domains can be made. The most prominent change in the CD spectrum which occurs upon heating is the appearance of negative ellipticity around 230 nm. The relatively flat spectrum from 230–240 nm, a region that should have negative ellipticity because of the β-sheet signal, suggests that there is an element of structure giving a positive ellipticity in this region. A positive component in this region is a feature of aromatic and/or disulfide chromophores, which can acquire rotational strength around 230 nm when they are in specific chiral environments in proteins (35Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Notably, α210GPI is unusually rich in aromatic amino acids; it has 10 tyrosines and 8 tryptophans, about twice the expected number based on the average amino acid content of soluble proteins. The apparent robustness of the α210GPI secondary structure to thermal denaturation is not unprecedented. For example, when bovine β-lactoglobulin A, a β-sheet-rich protein, is thermally denatured, the effect on the secondary structure (as measured by CD) is very small (36Griffin W.G. Griffin M.C.A. Martin S.R. Price J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 3395-3406Crossref Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the aggregation/misfolding of many proteins is associated with the formation of intermolecular β-sheet structures (36Griffin W.G. Griffin M.C.A. Martin S.R. Price J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 3395-3406Crossref Google Scholar, 37Speed M.A. Wang D.I.C. King J. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The relatively low temperature required to cause loss of binding activity of α210GPI and the inefficient folding of the α subunit in vivo (with most of the newly synthesized α subunit appearing as non-α-Btx-binding aggregates) suggests that the α subunit is susceptible to this form of misfolding. We contend that the lower than expected specific binding of α-Btx by the purified α210GPI is not likely to change substantially our estimates of the secondary structure. We consider the possible causes for the low specific binding. (i) If the α210GPI is contaminated with some denatured protein, then the recorded CD is a mixture of the folded and unfolded material. However, the spectrum of the heat-denatured protein is not markedly dissimilar from that of the correctly folded material. Therefore, admixture of some fraction of unfolded material will have little effect on the secondary structure estimates. (ii) If the protein concentration measurement is too high, this could increase the mean residue ellipticity substantially. Nevertheless, the shape of the spectrum, which is not very characteristic of α-helix, would be unchanged. The measurement of protein concentration by UV is reported to be accurate within about 10% (25Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). (iii) The measured specific binding may be slightly low because of occlusion of the α-Btx binding site by the antibody resin or by loss during washing steps. The absence of a ligand binding site on oocytes expressing only α210GPI agrees with previous studies (11Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that although the (complete) α subunit binds α-Btx with high affinity, it lacks the conventional ligand binding site of AChR. This site forms only when the muscle α subunit is coexpressed with either the δ or γ subunit (13Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). There is no obvious explanation for the failure of α210GPI and δ226GPI to form the ligand binding site when coexpressed. Coexpression of δ226GPI with α210GPI led to a much lower level of surface expression compared with α210GPI alone, even taking into account the reduced amount of α210GPI mRNA injected. Thus expression of δ226GPI may interfere with surface expression of α210GPI by an unknown mechanism. These findings are very similar to results reported by Hall and colleagues (38Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding of α-Btx to α7-208GPI was inhibited by d-tubocurarine, indicating the formation of a ligand binding site and thus suggesting oligomerization of this protein (extrapolating from studies on the muscle receptor). Also, it has been reported (39Anand R. Peng X. Lindstrom J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that oligomerization of α7 subunits is required for formation of the α-Btx binding site. It will thus be interesting to express and characterize α7-208GPI in future experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2165996961,"Golgi soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) GS28 and syntaxin 5 can be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated from Golgi extracts, suggesting that they exist in a protein complex. When Golgi extract is preincubated with soluble NSF attachment proteins (alpha-SNAP) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) under conditions that allow ATP hydrolysis by NSF, GS28 and syntaxin 5 become dissociated. GS28 and syntaxin 5 remain in a protein complex when Golgi extract is preincubated with similar amounts of alpha-SNAP and NSF under conditions that prevent ATP hydrolysis by NSF, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis by NSF is necessary for dissociating the GS28-syntaxin 5 complex. Since preincubation of Golgi extract with either alpha-SNAP or NSF alone has no effect on the GS28-syntaxin 5 complex, a concerted action of alpha-SNAP and NSF therefore mediates the dissociation of the GS28-syntaxin 5 complex. Furthermore, GS28 but not syntaxin 5 is capable of binding to immobilized alpha-SNAP when the GS28-syntaxin 5 complex is dissociated."

However, for both enzymes, as well as with the H652A and H652Q active center variants of oligopeptidase B, there are two resonances observed in this region that could be assigned to two protonated histidines with a noncatalytic function. The results indicate that these two histidines participate in strong hydrogen bonds. The absence of resonances pertinent to the active center histidine resonances suggests the absence of a low barrier hydrogen bond between the Asp and His in these two enzymes in their ground states. Addition of the peptide boronic acid t-butoxycarbonyl-(d)Val-Leu-(l)boroArg to oligopeptidase B resulted in potent, slow binding inhibition of the enzyme and the appearance of a new resonance at 15.8 ppm, whose chemical shift is appropriate for a tetrahedral boronate complex and a low barrier hydrogen bond.

The hydrogen bond between the Asp and His residues in the catalytic triad of serine proteases has been presented as an example of the potential contribution of low barrier hydrogen bonds (LBHB) 1The abbreviations used are: LBHB, low barrier hydrogen bond; PO, prolyl oligopeptidase; OpB, oligopeptidase B; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; Boc,t-butoxycarbonyl; DSS, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction antipain, [(S)-1-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]-carbamoyl-Arg-Val-l-argininal. to catalysis of enzymatic reactions (1Frey P.A.

Cassidy C.S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6919-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized by some that such an LBHB could lead to transition-state stabilization for enzymatic reactions by as much as 20 kcal/mol in favorable cases (4Kreevoy M.M. Cleland W.W. Science. 1994; 264: 1887-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 5Cleland W.W. Kreevoy M.M. Science. 1995; 269: 104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Others have argued that one need not invoke the existence of an LBHB to understand enzymatic catalysis; in fact, such a strong hydrogen bond may be “anticatalytic” (6Warshel A. Papazyan A. Kollman P.A. Science. 1995; 269: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In enzymes it has been difficult to obtain direct evidence pro or con of this LBHB hypothesis. Although there are many x-ray structures of serine peptidases in the literature, the level of precision of the analysis does not permit one to conclude either that there is such an LBHB at the active center or that such bonds are formed in transition-state-like structures. In solution, NMR and Fourier transform-IR offer possible methods for detection of such unusually strong hydrogen bonds (2Frey P.A. Science. 1995; 269: 104-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hibbert F. Emsley J. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 1990; 26: 255-379Google Scholar). One of the experimental observations used to support the existence of such an LBHB (1Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) is the presence of a high frequency proton magnetic resonance (13–20 ppm) for several serine proteases (8Robillard G.

In the uncomplexed enzymes, the chemical shift of this broad resonance is pH-dependent and unusual (14–15 ppm at pH values above the His57 pK a, and 17.5–18.3 ppm at pH values below the pK a (see Refs.13Jordan F. Polgár L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6366-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Zhong S. Haghjoo K. Kettner C. Jordan F. J. Am. Chem.

These chemical shifts are significantly larger (more deshielded) than those of the corresponding resonance in model systems, indeed suggesting the presence of unusual hydrogen bonds (7Hibbert F. Emsley J. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 1990; 26: 255-379Google Scholar) in both ionization states of the triad even in the ground states of these enzymes. Herein are reported proton magnetic resonance experiments in the high frequency chemical shift range carried out on aqueous solutions of two members of the recently identified prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases (19Rawlings N.D. Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Tsuru D. Yoshimoto T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar): prolyl oligopeptidase (PO, formerly known as prolyl endopeptidase or post-proline cleaving enzyme) and oligopeptidase B (OpB, formerly known as protease II). PO and OpB are large proteins (80 kDa) with homologous amino acid sequences displaying the peptidase domain at the carboxyl terminus. The order of the catalytic serine and histidine in the sequence is reversed with respect to that of trypsin and subtilisin, indicating an unrelated three-dimensional structure (19Rawlings N.D. Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Polgár L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PO is a ubiquitous enzyme that cleaves the peptide bond at the carboxyl end of proline residues (20Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). OpB is found in Escherichia coli and is specific for Arg and Lys residues (21Tsuru D. Yoshimoto T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as also found with trypsin. In contrast to the chymotrypsin/trypsin and subtilisin classes of serine proteases, PO and OpB do not give evidence for a strong hydrogen bond between the Asp and His residues at the active center in the absence of transition-state analogs, but such a resonance is evident in the complex of OpB with a peptide boronic acid. Most importantly, the spectra reveal the presence of strongly hydrogen-bonded non-catalytic histidines in both enzymes. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were carried out in Wilmad 535-PP 5-mm tubes at 400 and 500 MHz on VARIAN VXR 400–89 or VARIAN Inova 500 spectrometers operated at the temperatures indicated in the figure legends. Concentration of PO was 0.2–0.4 mm, and DSS was used as internal chemical shift reference. PO was stored with 3% sucrose in the lyophilized state. Prior to the NMR experiments, the lyophilized enzyme containing 20–30 mg of PO was dissolved at 4 °C in 1–2 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3 and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) column equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluate was concentrated to 0.3–0.7 ml in an Amicon Centricon 30 concentrator at 4 °C. The lyophilized OpB (20–50 mg) was dissolved in 1–2 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column (50 ml bed volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluate was concentrated as described for PO. PO was isolated from pig muscle as described (20Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The activity of PO was determined fluorimetrically with benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-2-naphthylamide as substrate (20Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by using a Jasco FP777 spectrofluorimeter. The excitation and emission wavelengths were, respectively, 340 and 410 nm. OpB was expressed in E. coliJM83 and purified with slight modification as described by Kanatani et al. (23Kanatani A. Masuda T. Shimoda T. Misoka F. Lin X.S. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically with N-benzoyl-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide-HCl (Sigma) as substrate at 410 nm (ε = 8900 m−1cm−1, see Ref. 24Strongin A.Y. Izotova L.S. Abramov Z.T. Gorodetsky D.I. Ermakova L.M. Baratova L.A. Belyanova L.P. Stepanov V.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1401-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate and the enzyme were both dissolved in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. The pSKOpB vector contained the wild-type oligopeptidase gene. To change the active site His652 to Gln or Ala, the primers H652Q (GGACTCACCGCCAAGGCCGGGCAAATCTGG) containing the BglI restriction enzyme site and H652A (GGAACTTCAAGGCGCCGGCGGCAAATCTGG) containing the EheI site were synthesized. The original NcoI site was eliminated in both primers. The desired mutations were introduced with one of the sense primers His652Gln or His652Ala and the antisense PROT3′ primer (CGGTCGACGAACCGCGATCCGGGC), with a SalI restriction enzyme site underlined. The PCR-I product was synthesized in a mixture containing the pSKOpB vector as template, 100 nmol each of the two primers, 400 μm dNTP, 0.02 units/ml of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in 1 × Pfu reaction buffer (Stratagene) with 30 cycles at 94, 55, and 72 °C for 1, 2, and 3 min, respectively. The PCR product (200 base pairs) was identified on an agarose gel (1.7%), extracted, and purified on Sephaglas (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The second round of PCR used the same program as in the previous paragraph, using the pSKOpB vector as template with the 200-base pair megaprimer and the PROT5′ primer (CGAATTCATCCCCGGTGAGTTTTGCCACC) containing the underlined EcoRI site (providing the second PCR product). Subcloning was carried out by double digestion of this second PCR product with EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes and then ligation into the EcoRI/SalI sites of a pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene). The resulting pSKOpBH652Q and pSKOpBH652A were digested with NcoI and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′. The mutation in plasmids pSKOpBH652Q and pSKOpBH652A was verified by digestion with BglI and EheI restriction enzymes, respectively. The mutations were also confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the mutated plasmids prepared in E. coli DH5α cells, using a sequencing oligo primer 5′-GGATCCGCAATATTAACGAGTACATGAAA-3′ and the PRISMTM Ready Reaction dideoxy terminator kit from Perkin-Elmer and an Applied Biosystems model 373 DNA sequencer. The sequences obtained showed that the only alterations in the mutated genes were those desired. The mutated oligopeptidase B was expressed and purified as the wild-type enzyme in E. coli XL1-Blue, except that the enzymes were produced at 30 °C rather than at 37 °C. The Boc-(d)Val-Leu-(l)boroArg-pinanediol-benzenesufonate 2Boc-(d)Val-Leu-(l)boroArg-pinanediol-benzenesufonate is a tripeptide with a −B(OH)2 group in place of the α-COOH at its carboxyl terminus. was synthesized according to published methods (25Kettner C.A. Shenvi A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15106-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All kinetic assays were carried out at 25 °C. First, the Km was determined for N-benzoyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide-HCl as 0.24 ± 0.06 mm, compared with 0.25 mmreported by Kanatani et al. (23Kanatani A. Masuda T. Shimoda T. Misoka F. Lin X.S. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), along with a k cat of 24.5 ± 0.07 s−1 (the number quoted in Ref. 23Kanatani A. Masuda T. Shimoda T. Misoka F. Lin X.S. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar is low by a factor of 1000, perhaps the result of an incorrect dilution factor). The Boc-(d)Val-Leu-(l)boroArg-pinanediol-benzenesufonate (at 0.75 mg/ml) was incubated in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, to hydrolyze the pinanediol ester of the boronic acid. A solution of OpB (4.4 nm) was then incubated with the inhibitor solution for 1–2 h at 25 °C, and then the activity was assayed for 3 min. Preincubation of the inhibitor with OpB produced a lag phase for p-nitroaniline release before the steady-state kinetic phase was reached. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data collected during the steady-state phase indicated the presence of competitive inhibition and a K i of 3.1 nm (Fig. 1 A). Care must be exercised in the kinetic studies since OpB is subject to inhibition at substrate concentrations in excess of 0.5 mm. 3L. Polgar, unpublished observations. When the inhibitor and substrate were premixed and the reaction was initiated by the addition of OpB, the progress curves for p-nitroaniline release showed that the magnitude of the absorbance plateau varied inversely with inhibitor concentration (Fig. 1 B). These experiments strongly imply that the inhibitor is of the “slow-binding” type (25Kettner C.A. Shenvi A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15106-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows spectra of PO between pH 5.14 and 8.22 in the absence and presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Prolinal, a potent inhibitor (26Wilk S. Orlowski M. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that forms a tetrahedral hemiacetal with a serine at the active center (27Kahyaoglu A. Haghjoo K. Kraicsovits F. Jordan F. Polgár L. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two resonances are observed under all conditions at 15.8 and 17.0 ppm; they both appear to be pH-independent to pH 8.88 (not shown). Fig. 3 shows spectra at 10 °C for OpB with pH-independent resonances at 16.5 and 17.8 ppm between pH 6.50 and 9.46 that are no longer detectable at pH 9.75. There are additional resonances observed at 13.5 and 14.3 ppm, the latter weaker than the former but quite evident in several spectra, especially at 2 °C (not shown). Fig. 4 shows spectra of OpB (middle), with excess antipain (top, an aldehyde-type inhibitor as is benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Prolinal for PO), and for the H652A active center variant of OpB (bottom), all at pH 8.1–8.2. The much sharper resonances observed at 14.2 and 13.3 ppm in the presence of the peptide aldehyde inhibitor are not surprising since the inhibitor would tend to make the structure more rigid, perhaps also protecting the histidines in question from exchange with solvent, the principal mechanism responsible for the line width of such resonances. The chemical shifts of the resonances are superimposable within experimental error, as are those observed for the H652Q variant (not shown). One-dimensional difference nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments (Fig. 5) were carried out on OpB at pH 7.94, showing that the resonance at 17.9 ppm (bottom) correlates with resonances at 13.6, 11 (broad), and 7.8 ppm while the 16.5 ppm resonance (top) correlates with resonances at 11 (broad), 9.6, and 8.4 ppm. It should be noted that the resonances are already broad due to the size of the enzyme, and the high frequency ones are further broadened by exchange (NHs attached to an aromatic imidazolium ring are being reported). Therefore, integration, especially in a difference spectrum, is of virtually no value, and the number of protons represented by each resonance is difficult to ascertain. Fig. 6 shows that addition of Boc-(d)Val-Leu-(l)boroArg-pinanediol-benzenesulfonic acid to OpB produces an additional resonance at 15.8 ppm, whereas the resonances at 17.9 and 16.6 ppm experience shielding to 17.2 and 16.4 ppm, respectively. In no other figures of OpB (Figs. 3, 4, or 5) is the 15.8-ppm resonance visible, hence it can be assigned to the OpB-boronate complex with confidence.Figure 3Proton NMR spectra of oligopeptidase B.OpB at 0.4–0.5 mm was dissolved in 20 mmpotassium phosphate in 90/10 (v/v) H2O/D2O.

(a) The resonance pertinent to the active center His Nδ1H is not visible in the spectra of wild-type OpB and PO between pH 5.1 and 9.5. Such resonances have been detected by several groups both for uncomplexed and complexed chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin (8Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol.

(b) There are two new resonances found in PO and OpB, as well as in the active center H652A variant of OpB, whose chemical shifts are virtually pH-independent up to a pH of 8.8 in PO and to 9.5 in OpB. The resonances are in very slow exchange with any other in their environments. The two resonances therefore do not pertain to the active center His. The chemical shifts of the two resonances (between 15.8 and 18 ppm), however, are appropriate to His in its protonated state (see Scheme I and Refs. 8Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 74: 519-540Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7751-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and further imply that the protons represented by the resonances are strongly hydrogen bonded to some hydrogen bond acceptor. (c) The two resonances observed in PO and OpB persist in the presence of aldehyde-based transition-state analogs, and there are no additional resonances observed in the presence of these inhibitors (antipain for OpB and benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Prolinal for PO). (d) The difference in chemical shift between the two resonances observed in both wild-type and variant enzymes remains the same under all conditions examined (pH, added inhibitor) and is virtually the same for PO and OpB. (e) The observation of the same resonances in the H652A (and H652Q) variant of OpB strongly suggests that this variant is correctly refolded as the presence of these resonances is clear evidence for the formation of the proper tertiary structure. At the same time, the variant enzyme is completely inactive (activity <0.01%), which confirms that the active site His has indeed been altered. (f) Nuclear Overhauser enhancement experiments provide strong evidence that the two resonances observed in OpB pertain to different histidines. We suggest that the 17.9- and 16.6-ppm resonances represent the Nδ1H of two different histidines, whereas the NOEs imply that the resonance at 13.5 may correspond to the Nε2H of the histidine with Nδ1H at 17.9 ppm. This resonance at 13.5 ppm is visible in several spectra, as is a different one at 14.2 ppm (see Figs. 3 and 4, and especially Fig. 4,top spectrum, in the presence of antipain that apparently slows down the exchange rate of these two protons). The resonance at 14.2 ppm likely corresponds to an Nε2H residing on the histidine with an Nδ1H at 16.6 ppm. The resonances at lower frequency between 9.6 and 7.8 ppm could pertain to the C2 and C4 hydrogens of the imidazole rings and probably to some backbone NHs. These assignments are in accord with a recent study by Markley and Westler (12Markley J.L. Westler W.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11092-11097Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) on chymotrypsinogen and affirm that the two histidines are in their histidinium ionization state. (g) pH titration of the solution of OpB shows the pK a of the two histidines to be greater than 9.5, and those of PO to be greater than 8.9. For comparison, the pK a for His57in uncomplexed chymotrypsin is 7, and the chemical shift of the active center His57 varies with pH (8Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 74: 519-540Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J.

(h) The peptide boronic acid Boc-(d)Val-Leu-(l)boroArg turned out to be a very potent competitive slow binding inhibitor (K i = 3 nm) of OpB, in whose presence the spectrum of OpB exhibits a single new resonance at 15.8 ppm. In the chymotrypsin/trypsin and subtilisin class, the serine-bound boronates exhibit two resonances pertinent to Nδ1H and Nε2H (14Zhong S. Haghjoo K. Kettner C. Jordan F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7047-7055Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation of only a single resonance with a chemical shift of 15.8 ppm pertinent to the complex is not only appropriate for a nitrogen-bound proton at histidine in complexes of serine proteases with peptide boronic acids but the behavior is also consistent with the boron being bound to a His at Nε2 (in this case His652), or to Ser and His concurrently, rather than to a serine at the active center (14Zhong S. Haghjoo K. Kettner C. Jordan F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7047-7055Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Bachovchin W.W. Wong W.Y.L. Farr-Jones S. Shenvi A.B. Kettner C.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7689-7697Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the resonance being pertinent to Nδ1H. Steady-state kinetic measurements of k cat/Km on both wild-type PO and OpB provide evidence for a pH optimum near 8.0, i.e. the pK a of the active site His is below this value, whereas that of the observed histidines in both PO and OpB is higher than 8.8. These results, in addition to the evidence showing the same resonances in the wild-type and H652A variants of OpB, lead to the conclusion that we are observing noncatalytic histidines rather than the one at the active center. While both hydrogens on the histidine ring nitrogens are found in strong hydrogen bonds, such bonds to Nδ1H are evidently much stronger than those to Nε2H. The elevated basicity of the observed histidines compared with that in chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin is also consistent with such strong hydrogen bonds and/or additional nearby negative charges. The chemical shifts of protons at Nδ1 and Nε2 vary considerably among various complexes. The Nδ1H is at 18 ppm for protonated His57 and is at 15 ppm for neutral His57 in uncomplexed chymotrypsin (8Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 74: 519-540Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Robillard G. Schulman R.G. J.

It is between 16 and 17.2 ppm in the peptide boronic acid complexes of α-lytic protease (28Bachovchin W.W. Wong W.Y.L. Farr-Jones S. Shenvi A.B. Kettner C.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7689-7697Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), chymotrypsin (14Zhong S. Haghjoo K. Kettner C. Jordan F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7047-7055Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and subtilisin, 4D. Bao and F. Jordan, unpublished data. and it is at 18.7 ppm in the complex of chymotrypsin with peptidyltrifluoromethylketone (29Liang T.-C. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7603-7608Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Halkides C.J. Wu Y.Q. Murray C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15941-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In both types of transition-state analog complexes, the His57 is protonated, hence the LBHB is present in both ground state and transition-state complexes. Yet, these resonances are not even seen between pH 5.14 and 9.46 in spectra of OpB and PO, ruling out an LBHB at any pH in these enzymes at their active centers. It is concluded that in PO and OpB there are very likely two non-catalytic histidines present, which are in a strongly hydrogen bonded environment, enabling us to observe resonances for both Nδ1H and Nε2H. According to a sequence alignment (23Kanatani A. Masuda T. Shimoda T. Misoka F. Lin X.S. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), there are six sets of conserved histidines in these enzymes at positions (first number is for PO and the one in parentheses is for OpB) 20 (15.Zhong, S. (1991) Multinuclear NMR Studies of Boronic Acid Transition State Inhibitors of Serine Proteases. Ph.D. thesis, Rutgers, Newark, NJ.Google Scholar), 213 (204), 307 (289), 456 (436), 640 (616), and 680 (652). The last one (680 in PO and 652 in OpB) has been identified as the one at the active center. Further research will be required to determine which two of the five remaining conserved histidines are being observed in these experiments and are deduced to participate in strong hydrogen bonds. The inability to observe the active center His resonances in spectra of OpB and PO strongly suggests that the Asp-His hydrogen bond is much weaker in these enzymes than in the chymotrypsin/subtilisin classes of serine peptidases. The absence of such a strong hydrogen bond between the active center Asp and His in OpB and PO suggests that: (a) there is no LBHB at this position in these two enzymes in the uncomplexed form or in the tetrahedral complexes formed with the aldehyde-based so called “transition-state” analogs; (b) there is an LBHB in the tetrahedral complex formed with the peptide boronic acid, which installs a negative charge on the Nε2side as well. One may also conclude (as we did in Ref. 13Jordan F. Polgár L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6366-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that near neutral pH values, the negative charge at the Nε2 side creates a better transition-state analog in terms of electrostatic interactions (AspCOO− HisH+SerX−) than the aldehyde, which appears to form a neutral tetrahedral complex (AspCOO− HisHo SerX; compare results on OpB with antipain and the peptide boronic acid and the results on trypsin in the presence of leupeptin in Ref. 16.Haghjoo, K. (1996) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Investigation of the Interaction of Serine Proteases with Protease Inhibitors.Ph.D. thesis, Rutgers, Newark, NJ.Google Scholar). In the case of OpB, the boronate complex with the tetrahedral anionic character evidently induces a stronger hydrogen bond between the Asp and Nδ1H at the active center. These results are consistent with previous reports on transition-state analogs that install a negative charge on the Nε2 side, such as complexes of peptide boronates (13Jordan F. Polgár L.

Jordan F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), all of which uniformly raise the pK a (increase the basicity) of the active center histidine substantially. Similarly elevated pK a of the active center His in going to the transition state would be expected with the developing oxyanion, thereby reducing the ΔpK a between the histidine and the serine, and with possible concomitant strengthening of the hydrogen bond between the Asp and Nδ1H. The results also confirm that such exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds, reflected by such unusually large chemical shifts, will be revealed in the structures of many enzymes. Additional examples are provided by some coenzyme-dependent enzymes: the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes that gave rise to several resonances with chemical shifts between 13–20 ppm, one of them assigned to the pyridinium N1-proton (32Kintanar A.

Zhang, F. Guo, and F. Jordan, unpublished observations. In summary, there are distinct differences found between the active centers of this new prolyl oligopeptidase class of serine peptidases and the well studied chymotrypsin/trypsin and subtilisin classes. (a) There is no LBHB in the ground state, but there are two non-catalytic histidines that appear to participate in LBHBs in the prolyl oligopeptidase class. (b) One can design potent, slow-binding peptide boronic acid-type inhibitors for both the prolyl oligopeptidase, and the chymotrypsin/trypsin and subtilisin classes. But, while the former appears to form a boronate complex to His Nε2 (or simultaneously to His and Ser, a possibility that is difficult to differentiate by NMR methods) at the active center, the chymotrypsin/trypsin and subtilisin classes form a serine-bound boronate. It is concluded, therefore, that there are subtle novel features observed in both the ground state and in the transition-state type complexes in this prolyl oligopeptidase class of serine peptidases that have not been previously seen in any other serine proteases.

A heterologous in vivo approach for studying the function of Toc36 was developed in this study by introducing a member of Toc36 into E. coli to assess its effect on bacterial protein translocation. The presence of Toc36 enhances the translocation of two bacterial periplasmic proteins in a manner resembling the chloroplast system. Translocation of the two bacterial periplasmic proteins was less sensitive to sodium azide, resembling more the azide-insensitive nature of the chloroplast protein import process. Mutated Toc36 proteins were not capable of causing the same effect as that observed for unaltered Toc36. Toc36 was also capable of complementing bacterial strains with temperature-sensitive secA mutations that affected protein translocation. The combined results provide evidence that Toc36 plays a central role in the chloroplast protein translocation process.

The combined results provide evidence that Toc36 plays a central role in the chloroplast protein translocation process. Nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins synthesized outside the organelle are imported into the compartment via a complex process. The import process involves a host of components such as energy, transit signals, proteinaceous envelope membrane factors, processing peptidases and chaperones (1Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-501Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schnell D.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 521-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These components facilitate various steps of the translocation process such as unfolding, binding to surface receptors, translocation across envelope membranes, and maturation (1Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-501Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schnell D.J.

The multi-subunit protein translocation machinery of the chloroplast envelope membrane plays a central role in this process (2Schnell D.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 521-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The implication of components with a role in the chloroplast envelope protein import apparatus have so far relied heavily on physical approaches that show spatial proximity to a translocating protein. Therefore, approaches must be developed to provide a much needed insight into the actual function of each component. A number of other components of the plastid import pathway share mechanistic features in common with factors involved in the transport of proteins across bacterial membranes and have indeed been demonstrated to be interchangeable to a certain extent. The organellar-targeting transit signals of chloroplast precursor proteins can be recognized by the bacterial protein export machinery and transported into the periplasm with correct processing (4Seidler A. Michel H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1743-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The processing site of many chloroplast transit sequences follows the bacterial cleavage site and are readily cleaved by E. coli signal peptidase (5Halpin C. Elderfield P.D. James H.E. Zimmerman R. Dubar B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3917-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to transit signals, thylakoid lumen proteins contain prokaryotic-like intra-organellar sorting domains (6Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Juan J.G.

Some lumen proteins even traverse the thylakoid via an azide-sensitive pathway resembling bacterial azide-sensitive protein transport (6Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Juan J.G.

The parallelism of the chloroplast and bacterial protein translocation systems suggests that other plastid components are likely to be functionally interchangeable to some degree in a bacterial environment. Therefore, adaption of the bacterial system for studying the chloroplast envelope protein import apparatus may open up valuable opportunities and features afforded by the bacterial system that can be of assistance for elucidating functional aspects. This potential was realized by expressing a 44-kDa Toc36 1The abbreviations used are: Toc, protein translocation component of the chloroplast outer envelope; Oee1Dhfr, a fusion between the transit peptide of the 33-kDa protein of the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex and mouse cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase; IgG, immunoglobin G. component of the chloroplast envelope protein import apparatus in bacteria (14Wu C.

(The 44-kDa components formerly designated Com44/Cim44 have been renamed in accordance with a newly implemented universal nomenclature). DNA fragments encoding Bce44B and Oee1Dhfr were subcloned into pGEM11Z (Promega) to facilitate T7 RNA polymerase-directed expression (15Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Ko K. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Truncated Bce44B were generated by exonuclease III/S1 digestion and joined to the DNA sequence for the first four residues of the transit peptide for the pea small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (17Wu C. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19384-19391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bce44B-N1 lacked 42 residues from the NH2terminus, and the sequence of the fusion site is MASMISSLSVPPQ-. Bce44B-N2 was made by joining the DNA sequence for the first 23 amino acids of Bce44B to the N1 deletion. The EcoRI-HinfI DNA fragment encoding the NH2-terminal 23 residues and the 5′-untranslated region was inserted into pGEM4 via EcoRI and SmaI (HinfI was converted to a blunt end) and was used for the construction of Bce44B-N2. The Bce44B-N2 fusion was completed by joining to an Asp-718-HindIII DNA fragment retrieved from Bce44B-N1 via the BamHI and HindIII sites of the above vector. The Asp-718 and BamHI sites were made blunt, and the sequence of the fusion point is -GLGIVPP-. Bce44B-N1 and -N2 were subsequently transferred to pGEM11Z. Procedures for the introduction of recombinant plasmids into the E. colistrains JM109(DE3), MC4100, and MM52 were as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β-lactamase (5′-3′). Cells were grown in LB-ampicillin (25 μg/ml) broth to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0, diluted at a ratio of 0.02:1 into M9 minimal broth-ampicillin (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) (25 μg/ml ampicillin) and M9(Pi)-ampicillin broth (contains 0.15 m Tris and 50 μm phosphate to allow cell growth). Both M9 broths additionally contain 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 0.2% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm of each amino acid. Cells were collected at the two indicated growth periods, normalized with respect to cell number, and analyzed as above using anti-alkaline phosphatase IgGs (5′-3′). Bacterial strains were grown in LB-ampicillin broth to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0 before plating onto LB agar plates containing increasing amounts of ampicillin. Plates were incubated at appropriate temperatures overnight to determine the number of colonies formed. Cells were grown at 30 °C (permissive temperature for the secA temperature sensitive mutant MM52) overnight in LB-ampicillin broth before diluting to 0.02:1 in the same media. One group of cultures remained at 30 °C (permissive temperature), and the other group was shifted to 37 °C (nonpermissive temperature). Samplings were at different time points between 0–2 h after dilution and analyzed as above. Cells were grown and inoculated as above into broth containing an increasing amount of sodium azide (0–1.0 mm) and incubated for 2 h. Time course studies were conducted with 0.5 mm sodium azide for periods of up to 2 h at the indicated temperatures. Samples were analyzed as above. Expression of bce44B (a member of the Toc36 envelope proteins) in bacteria gave rise to a multiple-protein pattern (Fig.1 A). The two largest bands correspond to full-length Bce44B (44 kDa) and a smaller 42-kDa product. The expressed proteins were predominantly in the cytosol. Other smaller proteins that fractionate with the cytosol and inclusion bodies are most likely derived from a combination of post-translational degradation and translation-related events, e.g. internal translation initiations or premature translation termination. A portion of the larger-sized Bce44Bs (44 and 42 kDa) co-fractionated with cytoplasmic membranes (both outer and inner) and crude inclusion bodies (Fig. 1 A) and were removable from these fractions by detergent-containing washes (Fig. 1 A). These bands were absent in the control Oee1Dhfr cells (Fig. 1 A). A portion of the Bce44Bs associated with membrane vesicles (right-side-out and inside-out) were resistant to postfractionation thermolysin treatments, becoming sensitive only in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig.1 A). Mock protease treatments did not exhibit any degradation. The protease-resistant membrane-associated Bce44Bs are most likely protected by the bacterial membranes and appear to be associated in a manner similar to its natural habitat, the chloroplast envelope (15Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the bacterial protein translocation machinery recognizes Bce44B, assembling Bce44B with membranes. Interestingly, the distribution of Bce44B in the bacterial membranes was also dual in nature, resembling the situation found in the chloroplast envelope, with the exception of being opposite to the directionality of the envelope distribution pattern. Higher amounts of Bce44B were instead found associated with the outer membrane rather than the inner membrane. The directionality of the distribution of Bce44B may reflect the direction of protein translocation, namely outward in bacteria and inward in chloroplasts. The behavior displayed by Bce44B in bacterial membranes raises the possibility that Bce44B may be functional as a foreign component of the bacterial protein transport apparatus. This prediction was assessed by monitoring changes to the translocation of two periplasmic enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase is a single copy gene and is transported into the periplasm upon induction by phosphate starvation. Bce44B-containing bacteria (Bce44B cells) displayed a growth profile distinct from the control Oee1Dhfr strain (Oee1Dhfr cells) expressing a chimeric chloroplast precursor protein. Bce44B cells displayed a healthier growth rate with two periods of growth in low phosphate, whereas Oee1Dhfr cells exhibited only one weak period and very little overall growth. Bce44B cells harvested from the two growth periods contain higher levels of processed alkaline phosphatase relative to the Oee1Dhfr cells at the same sampling time (Fig. 1 B). The differences were apparent even under phosphate-abundant conditions. The amount of transported alkaline phosphatase detected reflects changes in protein translocation activity. Even though phosphate is vital for the survival of a bacterium and there is a variety of mechanisms operating for survival under phosphate limitation, the data suggest that the presence of Bce44B contributes to the enhanced levels of periplasmic alkaline phosphatase, allowing cells to grow further by releasing more phosphates from limited sources. The same effect was observed with β-lactamase, a plasmid-borne multi-copy gene (25Levy S.B. Bryan L.E. Antimicrobial Drug Resistance. Academic Press, Inc., New York1984: 191-240Crossref Google Scholar). β-lactamase levels are higher than induced alkaline phosphatase, representing a more sensitive monitor of protein translocation changes without complications posed by low phosphate. The level of antibiotic tolerance conferred thus reflects changes to protein transport activity. Bce44B cells formed colonies with ampicillin concentrations as high as 3 mg/ml, whereas Oee1Dhfr cells cannot form colonies beyond 1 mg/ml (Fig. 1 C). The plasmid copy number was determined to be comparable in both strains (approximately 700–800) and was not expected to have an impact on β-lactamase expression. The higher level of ampicillin tolerance displayed by the Bce44B cells was mirrored in the enhanced level of transported β-lactamase (Fig. 1 C). The level of processed β-lactamase is higher on a per cell basis in Bce44B cells than in Oee1Dhfr cells at all ampicillin concentrations tested. These findings parallel the results derived from chemical cross-linking experiments indicating the close physical proximity of Bce44B to β-lactamase during or shortly after translocation, implicating the involvement of Bce44B (data not shown). Sodium azide is a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein translocation activity acting via the SecA protein (26Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.G. Dolam K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 27Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.G. Jarosik G.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 311-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both alkaline phosphatase and β-lactamase utilize the SecA-dependent pathway and thus can be inhibited by azide, accumulating as precursor forms. In contrast, transport across the chloroplast envelope is azide-tolerant, even though the translocation of some proteins across the internal thylakoid system is azide-sensitive (6Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Juan J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Knott T.G. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7843-7846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Bce44B cells were therefore tested for changes in azide sensitivity to assess whether protein translocation in these cells has been altered by Bce44B to resemble the chloroplast protein transport system. The level of sodium azide (0.5 mm) used partially inhibits SecA activity and the effects on transport were monitored with anti-β-lactamase IgGs (Fig. 2). In the absence of azide, Bce44B cells displayed higher levels of exported/processed β-lactamase than Oee1Dhfr cells at all the time points sampled. In the presence of azide, the Oee1Dhfr cells displayed increasing amounts of precursor β-lactamase and a concomitant decrease in the levels of mature transported form. The pattern was different in the Bce44B cells, where both precursor and mature forms of β-lactamase increased, suggesting that Bce44B is capable of sustaining the transport of β-lactamase at an elevated level even though SecA was partially hampered by azide. These results suggest that Bce44B can partially compensate for the azide-sensitive SecA-dependent protein transport pathway and, to an extent, function in a manner resembling its chloroplastic nature. The compensatory capabilities of Bce44B were further investigated using the temperature-sensitive secA bacteria mutant, MM52, and its parental wild-type strain, MC4100 (28Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). MM52 displays mild protein-translocation deficiencies at 30 °C and is exacerbated at 37 °C. At 30 °C, Bce44B had the same effect in both strains as described above (Fig.3 A). Plasmid copy numbers of these strains were comparable. One observable difference was the rate of colony growth, the MM52 strains required 48 h versus the 16 h for the MC4100 strains. The compensatory effects of Bce44B on protein translocation were active even under nonpermissive conditions. Bce44B-containing MM52 cells (MM52-Bce44B) displayed increasing levels of mature β-lactamase over the 2-h study period at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, similar to the pattern exhibited by the MC4100 counterparts (Fig.3 B). In contrast, Oee1Dhfr-containing MM52 cells (MM52-Oee1Dhfr) displayed deficiencies at both 30 °C and 37 °C, manifesting in the accumulation of precursors. The compensatory effect of Bce44B was also evident in the presence of azide. MM52-Oee1Dhfr cells exhibit the expected deficiency, manifesting in the accumulation of β-lactamase precursors at a relatively low azide concentration (0.125 mm) compared with the MM52-Bce44B cells, which behaved like the MC4100 counterparts (Fig. 3 C). MC4100 strains began displaying precursor accummulation only when azide was elevated above 0.37 mm. MC4100-Oee1Dhfr cells began displaying the precursor form at 0.25 mm azide. The positive effect Bce44B exerts on protein transport is most likely due to its membrane-associated interaction with the bacterial protein translocation apparatus since mutations affecting membrane association and/or complexing mechanisms of Bce44B abolish its capabilities. Bce44B-N1 and Bce44B-N2 did not display any of the observed effects, behaving more similarly to the control cell lines (Fig.4 A-C). The truncations appear to affect outer and inner membrane distribution, more evenly in the case of Bce44B-N1 and only to the inner membrane in the case of Bce44B-N2. Other structural features affected by the truncations were not investigated and will be the subject of an upcoming study. Bce44B-N1 cells were not able to form colonies above 500 μg/ml of ampicillin, and Bce44B-N2 cells formed colonies only up to 250 μg/ml. Bce44B-N1 and Bce44B-N2 cells were relatively more azide-sensitive with higher amounts of precursor accumulation at a lower azide level, which corroborates the higher sensitivity to ampicillin and the much lower protein transport activity observed. Bce44B is a member of the Toc36 chloroplast envelope proteins (formerly designated Com44/Cim44) previously identified to be proximal to a partially translocated chimeric chloroplast precursor protein and by virtue of this criterion was ascribed a role in protein translocation (14Wu C. Seibert F. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ko K. Budd D. Wu C. Seibert F. Kourtz L. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28601-28608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The current study provides much needed functional evidence that Bce44B is a central component of the chloroplast protein import apparatus. The evidence suggests that Bce44B is clearly involved in protein translocation in a central-like capacity whether it is in bacterial membranes or in the chloroplast envelope. Both systems recognize and assemble Bce44B in a similar manner into both the outer and inner cytoplasmic membranes of the bacterium. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of Bce44B between the outer and inner cytoplasmic membranes was similar to the chloroplast envelope relative to the direction of protein translocation. Bacterial membrane-associated Bce44B affects the SecA-dependent protein transport of periplasmic enzymes by enhancing translocation via a more azide-tolerant mode of action and can be found proximal to translocating or newly translocated proteins (chemical cross-linking data not shown). The compensatory capabilities of Bce44B in the protein transport mutant bacterial strain, MM52, provide further evidence that Bce44B is actively involved in the facilitation of protein transport. This capability occurs even during the impairment of secA at nonpermissive temperatures, providing strong evidence that the observed enhancement of periplasmic protein transport is not due to the up-regulation of the endogenous bacterial protein translocation system. It is not known at present whether Bce44B acts independently by forming new more azide-tolerant pathways, most likely via the assembly of a chimeric protein translocation machinery, or by altering a portion of the pathways already in existence, thus becoming less azide-sensitive overall such as that found in chloroplasts. The combination of the close proximity of Bce44B and β-lactamase (data not shown), the partial nature of the azide insensitivity and the compensation characteristics, tend to point to the first possibility. Studies with truncated Bce44B provide more evidence that the effects are due to intact membrane-associated Bce44Bs and are not attributed to the mere presence of Bce44B in the cell, causing the effects via up-regulation of the bacterial protein transport system. The truncated Bce44B proteins in fact perturbed bacterial protein transport, which further suggests the process that Bce44B effects is protein translocation. The overall outcome of this study clearly indicates that it may be very useful to explore heterologous in vivo systems for studying the functional aspects of other protein translocation components of the chloroplast envelope. The outcome of this study also adds more evidence to the hypothesis that different protein translocation systems share common mechanistic features and, in our case, protein transport across the chloroplast envelope and the bacterial cytoplasmic membranes.

The protein secondary structure content deduced from the amide I band is approximately 30–35% α-helix, 37–40% β-structure, and 13–15% random coil for native membranes from shark rectal gland and from pig kidney, in both the Na- and K-forms. Trypsinization in either Rb+ (a K+ congener) or Na+ removes approximately 35% of the amide I band intensity of native membranes from shark rectal gland. The protein secondary structural content of the trypsinized membranes lies in the range of approximately 23–32% α-helix, 37–46% β-structure, and 12–18% random coil for the shark and kidney enzymes. The distribution of intensity between the bands corresponding to protonated and deuterium-exchanged α-helices, and between the component bands attributed to β-structure, changes considerably on trypsinization, in the direction of a greater proportion of protonated α-helix and a broader range of frequencies for β-structure. The kinetics of deuteration of the slowly exchanging population of protein amide groups is also changed on trypsinization. The mean rate constant for deuteration of trypsinized membranes is approximately half that for native membranes, whereas the proportion of amides contributing to this population increases on trypsinization. The temperature dependence of the amide I band in the Fourier transform infrared spectra indicates that the onset of thermal denaturation occurs at 58 °C for native membranes (in either Na+ or K+) and for membranes trypsinized in Rb+, but the major denaturation event for membranes trypsinized in Na+ occurs at approximately 84 °C.

These results correlate with the functional properties of the intramembranous section of the enzyme. The Na,K-ATPase 1The abbreviations used are: Na,K-ATPase, Na+/K+-transporting ATP hydrolase (EC3.6.1.37); FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; CDTA,trans-1,2-cyclohexyldinitrilotetraacetic acid. is a large transmembrane protein that is composed of α-subunits (112 kDa) and β-subunits (36 kDa) with equimolar stoichiometry. It transports Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane in an electrogenic antiport fashion coupled to ATP hydrolysis and is responsible for maintaining the ionic balance in the cell. A considerable portion of the enzyme lies outside the membrane. The α-subunit bears the ATP site on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is thought to have 10 transmembrane segments (Ref. 1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig.1). The β-subunit, on the other hand, is thought to have a single transmembrane segment with the bulk of its extramembranous part, which is highly glycosylated, lying on the extracellular side of the membrane (see Fig. 1). Considerable progress has been made in simplifying this complex transport enzyme by the finding that extensive trypsinization in the presence of Rb+ (a K+ congener) yields a preparation in which a large part of the extramembranous portion of the α-subunit is removed, but the remaining transmembrane fragments retain the ability to occlude Rb+ ions (2Karlish S.J.D. Goldschleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The tryptic fragments that remain in the membrane have molecular masses in the range 8–12 kDa, consistent with their constituting one or two transmembrane domains; in addition, a larger 19- kDa fragment remains that could constitute a transmembrane four-helix bundle (see Fig.1). Peptide sequencing of the tryptic fragments indicates that they account for all of the putative transmembrane segments of the α-subunit (3Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldschleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the β-subunit of the shark enzyme remains intact on trypsinization. For the enzyme from shark rectal gland, trypsinization in the presence of Na+ leads further to degradation of the 19-kDa membrane-embedded fragment, and concomitantly the Rb+occlusion capability is lost (4Esmann M. Karlish S.J.D. Sottrup-Jensen L. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8044-8050Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, we have quantitated the lipid-protein interactions and made rotational diffusion measurements with trypsinized preparations of shark Na,K-ATPase membranes (4Esmann M. Karlish S.J.D. Sottrup-Jensen L. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8044-8050Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From these studies, it was found that trypsinization in RbCl preserves the state of association of the intramembranous domains of the enzyme, whereas on trypsinization in NaCl the intramembranous assembly is disturbed. In the present article, we report complementary studies on the trypsinized enzyme that are performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The secondary structure of the native and trypsinized enzyme is analyzed by using the amide I band in the FTIR spectrum. The kinetics of deuteration of the protein are followed to obtain information on the tertiary assembly of the intramembranous domains, and their thermodynamic stability is determined by thermal denaturation experiments. A very significant result is that the trypsinized Na,K-ATPase preparations still contain a substantial proportion of β-structure, as has been found also for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (5Görne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and recently for another P-type ATPase (6Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E.

Membranous Na,K-ATPase was prepared from the rectal gland of Squalus acanthias (as described in Ref. 7Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar. Enzyme assays, both ATPase and para-nitrophenyl phosphatase, were performed as described in the same reference. Membranes were pelleted at 50,000 rpm for 45 min and subsequently washed with D2O buffer (30 mm histidine, 1 mm CDTA, pH 7.4, with 30 mm NaCl or KCl), and incubated for 1 day at 4 °C to promote deuteration of the protein amide groups. To study the kinetics of deuteration, membranes were pelleted for 10 min in a benchtop centrifuge (or by ultracentrifugation for the trypsinized membranes) and injected into an FTIR cell at 20 °C. The zero time point was taken as that of the initial resuspension in D2O buffer. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS25 spectrometer using CaF2 cells with 50-μm Teflon spacers in a metal cell housing thermostatted to within 0.1 °C. Except for time-dependent experiments, the spectrometer was flushed with dry nitrogen for 30 min before recording the spectra, to reduce water vapor distortions. Interferograms were accumulated over the spectral range 400–4000 cm−1 with a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1 and apodized with a triangular function before Fourier transformation. For the kinetic experiments, 10 interferograms, and otherwise 100 interferograms, were recorded. Band narrowing by Fourier self-deconvolution was performed using a program provided by H. H. Mantsch (National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada) (11Kauppinen J.K. Moffatt J.D. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar). A triangular apodization was used, assuming an initial bandwidth of half-width at half-height (HWHH) = 17 cm−1, and a line-narrowing factor in the range K = 1.5–2.4. The positions of the component bands were determined by fitting Gaussian bands to the spectrum deconvoluted with a value of K = 2.4. The relative intensities of the component bands in the amide I region (1600–1700 cm−1) were determined by band fitting to the non-deconvoluted spectrum (i.e. for K = 1). For this band fitting, the positions of the component bands were held fixed at the values determined from the deconvoluted spectrum and the bandwidths, and the relative contribution of Gaussian and Lorentzian components to the bandshapes were allowed to vary in the least-squares minimization. The method used for construction of difference spectra was that described in Ref. 12Heimburg T. Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2408-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar. Spectra are plotted as absorbance, with the ordinate units given such that the integrated area of the entire band is normalized to 100 × cm−1. Representative FTIR spectra in the amide and carbonyl band regions of native shark Na,K-ATPase membranes and those trypsinized in 10 mm Na+, both suspended in 30 mm Na+ buffer, are given in Fig. 2. Also shown is the difference spectrum obtained by subtracting the spectrum of trypsinized membranes from that of the native membrane, using the lipid carbonyl band as end point criterion. To remove the carbonyl band, it was necessary to subtract 68% of the integrated intensity from the spectrum for the native membrane, implying that 32% of the protein was removed on trypsinization. Similar results were obtained for native membranes and membranes trypsinized in 10 mm Rb+, both resuspended in 30 mm K+ (data not shown). In this case, the subtraction end point corresponded to subtracting 65% of the total intensity from the spectrum of the native membrane. The phospholipid/protein ratios determined for the different preparations were 0.9 ± 0.1, 1.2 ± 0.15, and 1.3 ± 0.15 (w/w) for native membranes and membranes trypsinized in RbCl and NaCl, respectively. The size of the increase in phospholipid/protein ratio on trypsinization is consistent with the loss in the amide band intensity determined by FTIR. Similar FTIR results were also obtained with Na,K-ATPase membranes from pig kidney (data not shown), except that 85% of the intensity was subtracted from native membranes to obtain the difference spectrum end point. Bands corresponding to carboxylic acid-containing side chains, in the region of 1580–1590 cm−1 for aspartic acid and 1560–1580 cm−1 for glutamic acid (13Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), are also seen in Fig. 2. The proportions of these relative to the amide I band intensity that are obtained by band fitting are approximately 11% Asp and 5–6% Glu for native shark membranes (Na-form), and 12% Asp and 7% Glu for trypsinized membranes. Spectra of the amide I band region that have been subjected to band narrowing by Fourier self-deconvolution are compared for membranes in 30 mm Na+ and in 30 mmK+ in Fig. 3. As seen from the difference spectra given in the upper panel, there is very little difference between the Na- and K-forms (E1 and E2 conformations, respectively) of the native membranes. For the membranes trypsinized in 10 mm Rb+ or in 10 mm Na+ and resuspended in 30 mm K+ or 30 mm Na+, respectively, the differences between the Na- and K-forms are somewhat greater than found for the native membranes, but are still relatively small. Band fitting of the non-deconvoluted spectra, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” is illustrated in Fig.4 for the amide I regions of native and trypsinized membranes. The relative intensities of the component bands are given in Table I. Data are presented for both the Na- and K-forms of the native membranes and for the membranes trypsinized in Na+ and in Rb+. Fourier deconvolution, used to determine the component band positions, reveals that the band in the region characteristic of α-helical structures is split, with components at 1649–1654 cm−1and 1657–1661 cm−1 corresponding to the positions expected for deuterated and protonated α-helices, respectively (14Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). A single band is obtained at 1640–1643 cm−1 in the region characteristic of random structures in D2O. Several bands are obtained in the region 1612–1636 cm−1 expected for β-sheet and extended structures, along with a weak band at 1674–1678 cm−1. Bands found at 1664–1670 cm−1 and 1682–1687 cm−1 may possibly be attributable to β-turns. (For assignments see, e.g., Refs. 15Byler D.M. Susi H.

In addition, differences between the native shark and kidney enzymes are relatively small, except with regard to the distribution of band intensities in the β-region for the Na-form of the shark enzyme. The largest differences are found between the native and trypsinized enzymes, although these differences are mostly in the relative distribution of band intensities within a region assigned to a particular secondary structure. The ratio of protonated to deuterated α-helix is greater for the trypsinized enzymes than for the native enzymes. This is consistent with the amide groups of the membrane-embedded sections being more protected from exchange with D2O than are those of the extramembranous sections of the protein. The distribution of intensity among the bands assigned to β-structure is also broader in the trypsinized than in the native enzymes. This suggests differences in the precise nature of the β-sheet/extended chain structure between the membrane-embedded and extramembranous parts of the enzyme, although some rearrangement on trypsinization cannot be excluded. Overall, the net secondary structural content is estimated to be approximately 34–35% (30%) α-helix, 38–40% (37–39%) β-structure, 13% (14–15%) random, and 12–13% (16–17%) β-turns for the native shark (kidney) enzymes, and is 23–31% (29–32%) α-helix, 42–46% (37–41%) β-structure, 16–18% (12–13%) random, and 11% (16–18%) β-turns for the trypsinized shark (kidney) enzyme. Results similar to those obtained for the native shark membranes were also obtained for the secondary structural content of shark Na,K-ATPase that had been solubilized, purified, and reconstituted (data not shown). The dependence of the amide I region of the FTIR spectra from Na,K-ATPase membranes on time after transfer from H2O buffer into D2O buffer is given in Fig. 5. Progressive changes in the overall band shape are seen corresponding to shifts in the component bands of the peptide amide groups on deuteration (Fig. 5,upper panel). The kinetics of amide deuteration can be followed from the difference spectra obtained with increasing time that are given in the lower panel of Fig. 5 (see Ref. 12Heimburg T. Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2408-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This method circumvents potential problems in the amide II region of the spectrum that are associated with the leakage of background water vapor into the cell at long incubation times. The decrease in intensity of the difference spectra with time (relative to a spectrum obtained at very long times of deuteration) is shown in Fig.6. This gives the kinetics of deuteration of the slowly exchanging population of amide groups. The proportion of such groups is considerably larger in the trypsinized enzyme than in the native enzyme. Clear differences are seen in the kinetics of amide exchange between native and trypsinized membranes.Figure 6Kinetics of deuteration of the amide groups in shark Na,K-ATPase membranes at 20 °C.

These were found to have values of 〈k〉 = 0.0026 and 0.0023 min−1 for native membranes in 30 mmK+ and 30 mm Na+, respectively, and 〈k〉 = 0.0013 and 0.0012 min−1 for membranes trypsinized in 10 mm Rb+ and 10 mmNa+ (and resuspended in 30 mm K+and 30 mm Na+), respectively. The dependence of the amide I region of the FTIR spectra from Na,K-ATPase membranes on temperature is given in Fig. 7. With increasing temperature beyond 57 °C, there is a progressive increase in intensity in the outer regions of the amide I band, at the expense of the central region (Fig. 7, upper panel). These changes are seen clearly in the difference spectra constructed by subtracting a normalized spectrum recorded at lower temperature (Fig. 7, lower panel). The new bands that appear at higher temperature are those that have been found previously to be characteristic of the thermal denaturation of other proteins (12Heimburg T. Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2408-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Muga A. Mantsch H.H. Surewicz W.K.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9731-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The temperature dependences of the intensities for difference spectra of the type illustrated in Fig. 7 (lower panel) are given in Fig. 8 for native membranes in K+ or in Na+ and for membranes trypsinized in either Rb+ or Na+ and resuspended in K+ and Na+, respectively. An abruptly cooperative change in the temperature dependence is seen corresponding to the onset of denaturation in the native membranes (in both Na+ and K+) and in the membranes trypsinized in Rb+, at 58 °C. For membranes trypsinized in Na+, the temperature dependence is quite different, with the major denaturation event occurring at 84 °C, and only a small change at 58 °C. These results indicate a clear difference in thermal stability of the two trypsinized membranes. The time course of product formation on assaying the hydrolytic activity of native shark Na,K-ATPase membranes at various temperatures above that of the standard assay (i.e. 37 °C) is shown in Fig.9. At 45 °C, the initial activity is higher than that at 37 °C, but decreases during the period of the assay, as seen from the non-linearity of the time course for release of inorganic phosphate. At higher temperatures, the activity decreases rapidly with increasing temperature and the enzyme becomes practically inactive at temperatures of 55 °C and above. Similar results were found also for the temperature dependence of the potassium-para-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity of the native shark enzyme (data not shown). By normalizing the FTIR spectra with respect to the integrated intensity of the lipid carbonyl band, it is found that approximately 35% of the peptide residues of the protein are removed on trypsinizing the shark enzyme (see Fig. 2). Correction for possible differences in the amide I extinction coefficients for different secondary structures will increase this value by less than 20% (cf. Ref. 6Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This figure for the extent of trypsinization is reasonably consistent with the limited structural data on the protein and the known sites of tryptic cleavage. From image reconstruction studies with electron microscopy, it was estimated that 58% of the protein, including the β-subunit that is not cleaved, is extramembranous (20Maunsbach A.B. Skriver E. Soderholm M. Hebert H. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 268A: 39-56Google Scholar). From rotational diffusion studies, it was also concluded that 50–70% of the intact protein is external to the membrane (21Esmann M. Hideg K. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the β-subunit plus the tryptic peptides is 87 kDa (calculated from the amino acid composition), whereas that of the intact αβ-protomer is 147 kDa (cf. Fig. 1). Therefore, approximately 40% of the molecular mass is removed on trypsinization, which is in fair agreement with the estimate from FTIR of the proportion of peptide residues that are removed. For the kidney enzyme, the proportion of peptide residues that are removed, as estimated from the amide I band intensities, is considerably smaller. The reason for this is not known. The relative proportions of carboxylic acid side chains identified in the FTIR spectra of the native and trypsinized preparations do not correspond exactly with those estimated from the amino acid composition. The predicted values are 5.4% (4.4%) Asp and 6.6% (6.3%) Glu for the native (trypsinized) enzyme (22Kawakami K. Noguchi S. Noda M. Takahashi H. Ohta T. Kawamura M. Nojima H. Nagano K. Hirose T. Inayama S. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Numa S. Nature. 1985; 316: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Kawakami K. Nojima H. Ohta T. Nagano K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2833-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The discrepancy may represent difficulties in band assignment and variable degrees of overlap from residual protonated amide II bands in the FTIR spectra. The results obtained from fitting the amide I band of the intact protein show that it has a relatively high proportion of both α-helical and extended chain (or β-sheet) structure (see Fig. 4 and Table I). Models for the ATP binding site, as well as phosphorylation and transduction domains of P-type ATPases, suggest both α-helical and β-sheet elements for these sections of the protein (24MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the part of the protein that is removed on trypsinization is relatively enriched in α-helical structure but nonetheless still contains comparable amounts of both secondary structural elements. Very little difference is seen in the secondary structural content of the Na- and K-forms of the native enzymes, in agreement with previous FTIR studies (25Chetverin A.B. Brazhnikov E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7817-7819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the part of the protein remaining after trypsinization is still relatively enriched in extended chain or β-sheet structures. This β-sheet structure is distinct from that in the parts of the protein that are removed by trypsinization because the distribution of intensity among the component bands in the low frequency β-sheet region of the spectra from the trypsinized preparations differs from that in the FTIR spectra of the whole protein (see Figs. 3 and 4 and Table I). The situation here for the Na,K-ATPase is different from that found for the Ca-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum, where extensive proteolysis resulted in a preparation in which the secondary structure was mostly α-helical (6Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Teruel J.A. Villalaı́n J. Gomez-Fernández J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, similar conclusions were drawn recently for a plasma membrane H+-ATPase from Neurospora crassa (6Vigneron L. Ruysschaert J.-M. Goormaghtigh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17685-17696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this latter work, infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of β-sheet structures in the membrane-associated domains of this P-type ATPase. These and the present findings are also similar to those of an FTIR study on the proteolytically cleaved nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (5Görne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), from which it was concluded that the transmembrane domains were relatively rich in β-structures, in agreement with suggestions based on electron microscope image reconstructions (27Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Currently, electron crystallography of the Na,K-ATPase does not yet approach this sort of resolution (28Skriver E. Kaveus U. Hebert H. Maunsbach A.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 108: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, it is not known to what extent the relatively high content of β-type structures of the trypsinized enzyme may be attributable to a rearrangement of the secondary structure in the parts of the tryptic fragments that remain external to the membrane. Although it is possible that the latter may be responsible for the increase of intensity in the flanks of the amide I band, a region of the spectrum that has previously been associated with aggregation processes (29Muga A. Surewicz W.K. Wong P.T.T. Mantsch H.H. Singh V.K. Shinohara T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2925-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,30Surewicz W.K. Leddy J.J. Mantsch H.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8106-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nor is it known how much β-structure may be contributed by the β-subunit, which remains intact on trypsinization. However, the extramembranous sections are likely to be relatively small and attempts to shave the preparation more closely have so far proved unsuccessful, although the greater extent of cleavage by trypsinization in NaCl does not lead to an appreciable change in β-structural content relative to trypsinization in RbCl. In addition, simple calculations show that, even if it were entirely in a β-sheet/extended chain conformation (which is highly unlikely), the intact β-subunit is hardly sufficient to account for the whole of the β-structural content of the trypsinized enzyme. Therefore, it seems most likely that part, possibly an appreciable part, of the intramembranous domain of the α-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase has a β-sheet or extended chain structure. The average rate of proton-deuteron exchange for the populations of amide groups that exchange slowly is faster in the native enzyme than in the trypsinized preparation. This is consistent with a greater proportion of these amide groups being buried within the membrane in the trypsinized enzyme. Correspondingly, the proportion of residual protonated α-helical structures is also found to be greater in the trypsinized enzyme (cf. Fig. 4). The amide exchange results provide no evidence for the existence of a pore-like structure through which the ions could pass and which is unmasked to give rapid amide exchange on removing extramembranous parts of the protein. This negative result is consistent with the fact that membranes trypsinized in RbCl are still able to occlude Rb+ions. Also in correspondence with the relative proportions of protonated and deuterated α-helical structures found in the static experiments of Fig. 4, the proportion of slowly exchanging amide groups in the kinetic experiments is larger in the trypsinized membranes than in the native membranes (see Fig. 6). This is true even if the kinetic data for the trypsinized preparations are corrected down by a factor of 0.65–0.68 to represent their contribution to the total amide population in the native enzyme. It is possible that this excess of slowly exchanging amide groups represents those that are not exchanged at all in the native enzyme (as evidenced by the larger residual protonated amide II band in the difference spectrum in Fig. 2 (trace c)) and become partially accessible to water after the proteolytic cleavage. Results on structural aspects of the thermal denaturation of the Na,K-ATPase have, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported previously. Denaturation of the native enzyme occurs at approximately 58 °C, a temperature considerably higher than that at which appreciable loss of activity occurs on prolonged incubation (31Esmann M. Horváth L.I. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8675-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used here, this denaturation process is irreversible. It is accompanied by the appearance of bands in the FTIR spectrum that have previously been attributed to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting from an irreversible aggregation of the protein (29Muga A. Surewicz W.K. Wong P.T.T. Mantsch H.H. Singh V.K. Shinohara T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2925-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Surewicz W.K. Leddy J.J. Mantsch H.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8106-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The temperature found here for the onset of denaturation of the Na,K-ATPase is considerably higher than that reported (45 °C) from FTIR studies of the Ca-ATPase (26Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Teruel J.A. Villalaı́n J. Gomez-Fernández J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The thermal denaturation is mirrored by the temperature dependence of the activity of the native shark enzyme in membranous preparations. Both the Na,K-ATPase and potassium-para-nitrophenyl phosphatase activities are high at 45 °C, but decrease rapidly at higher temperatures, tending toward zero immediately below the denaturation temperature. The denaturation temperature obtained by FTIR for the enzyme trypsinized in RbCl is identical to that found for the native enzyme. This is an interesting result, because it implies that the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme structure (although not necessarily its activity) is controlled by the intramembranous domains of the protein. The major denaturation event for the enzyme trypsinized in NaCl is shifted to considerably higher temperature, implying a significant rearrangement in the intramembranous domains of the protein. Recently, it has been shown that thermal unfolding of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit exposes to the extracellular side epitopes, which, in the native protein, are within the transmembrane segments, and that simultaneously the C terminus becomes exposed to the extracellular side, whereas it is located on the intracellular side in the native conformation (32Arystarkhova E. Gibbons D.L. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8785-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These parts of the protein are contained within the 19-kDa fragment. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the denaturation patterns observed for native as well as for Rb-trypsinized enzymes are similar because structural intactness of the C terminus of the α-chain is maintained, and that the difference between thermal denaturation in Rb- and Na-trypsinized membranes arises because the 19-kDa fragment is not preserved when the α-subunit is trypsinized in the presence of NaCl. This is also in agreement with spin label studies, which found that, whereas the rotational mobility of the intramembranous section of the protein was unchanged on trypsinization in RbCl, it was decreased appreciably on trypsinization in NaCl (4Esmann M. Karlish S.J.D. Sottrup-Jensen L. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8044-8050Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the Rb occlusion function that is retained by membranes trypsinized in RbCl was lost on trypsinization in NaCl. A similar study on the Ca-ATPase reported a significant increase in denaturation temperature on proteolysis (26Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Teruel J.A. Villalaı́n J. Gomez-Fernández J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), to a level comparable to that found here for the native Na,K-ATPase. Whether this implies that the intramembranous domains of the Ca-ATPase have retained functional assembly on proteolysis is not clear. The present FTIR results on proteolytically shaved Na,K-ATPase membranes suggest that the intramembranous domains may contain appreciable β-secondary structure. At least part of the amide groups in these intramembranous structures are less accessible for deuterium exchange than are those in the extramembranous domains. The functional assembly of the intramembranous domains of the enzyme trypsinized in RbCl extends to a thermal stability that is characteristic of the native enzyme."

Moreover, a functional interaction occurred with Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) consistent with colocation of K+/H+ antiport and apical NHE-3, not basolateral NHE-1. K+/H+ antiport was shown by intracellular pH measurements to be inhibited by arginine vasopressin and 8-bromo-cAMP through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) activation. These results demonstrate the presence of a K+/H+ antiport mechanism, which is inhibited by arginine vasopressin via protein kinase A, in the apical membrane of the MTAL. To characterize and localize a K+/H+ antiport mechanism in the renal medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), membrane vesicles were isolated from a rat MTAL homogenate. K+/H+ antiport (in > out H+ gradient-stimulated86Rb+ uptake) was abolished by barium and verapamil (apparent K i of 55 μm) but unaffected by other K+ channel blockers such as quinidine and high amiloride concentrations. SCH 28080, a H+/K+-ATPase blocker, did not affect K+/H+ antiport. K+/H+antiport activity was correlated positively with the enrichment factor of the membranes in the apical marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.875, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with the enrichment factor in basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (r = −0.665,p < 0.05). Moreover, a functional interaction occurred with Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) consistent with colocation of K+/H+ antiport and apical NHE-3, not basolateral NHE-1.

These results demonstrate the presence of a K+/H+ antiport mechanism, which is inhibited by arginine vasopressin via protein kinase A, in the apical membrane of the MTAL. From intracellular pH (pH i), variations in cell membrane potential difference, and potassium transport measurements, Amlal et al. (1Amlal H. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21962-21971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described recently in this laboratory a new electroneutral K+/NH4+(H+) antiport mechanism in intact medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL) 1The abbreviations used are: MTAL, medullary thick ascending limb; SCH 28080, (3-cyanomethyl-2-methyl-8-phenylmethoxy)imidazo[1,2-α]pyridine; AVP, arginine vasopressin; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A); AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; H-89,N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide; HOE 694, (3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)guanidine methanesulfonate; NHE, Na+/H+ exchange; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; iMTAL, MTAL of the inner stripe of kidney outer medulla. cells; the K+/NH4+(H+) antiport mechanism was blocked by 10 mm barium and 0.1 mm verapamil, whereas it was unaffected by other K+ channel blockers such as quinidine and millimolar concentrations of amiloride or by the H+/K+-ATPase blocker SCH 28080. Because K+ conductances appeared unable to transport NH4+ (1Amlal H. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21962-21971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was in agreement with previous membrane vesicles (2Kinne R. Kinne-Saffran E. Schütz H. Schölermann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and electrophysiological (3Bleich M. Schlatter E. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21962-21971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the K+/NH4+(H+) antiport mechanism could account for the luminal barium-sensitive NH4+ transport that had been demonstrated in isolated and perfused MTAL tubules and hypothetically attributed to NH4+ transport by MTAL apical K+ channels (5Kikeri D. Sun A. Zeidel M.L. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Kikeri D. Sun A. Zeidel M.L. Hebert S.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Watts III, B.A. Good D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 917-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, because the tissue used in the previous work consisted of MTAL fragments in suspension, the apical or basolateral location of the K+/NH4+(H+) antiport mechanism could not be assessed and remained uncertain (1Amlal H. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21962-21971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the knowledge of the cellular location of this NH4+ transport pathway is necessary to understand the mechanisms of NH4+transepithelial transport by the MTAL, which is critical to ammonia accumulation in the renal medulla and subsequent secretion in adjacent medullary collecting ducts (8Good D.W. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F459-F471PubMed Google Scholar); this specialized NH4+ renal pathway is thus of major importance with regard to urinary net acid excretion by which the kidney regulates acid-base balance. The aims of the present work were therefore to establish directly the presence of a K+/H+ antiport mechanism in isolated MTAL membrane vesicles and to localize to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane this transport mechanism. To these purposes, we have adapted to a MTAL homogenate the principle of the Mg2+-EGTA aggregation plus differential centrifugation method to isolate a MTAL membrane vesicle preparation highly enriched in apical membrane; the preparation, however, also contained noticeable amounts of basolateral membrane. The results demonstrate that a barium- and verapamil-sensitive electroneutral K+/H+antiport mechanism is located in the apical and not in the basolateral plasma membrane of the preparation. In addition, we show that the K+/H+ antiport mechanism is inhibited by arginine vasopressin (AVP) and 8-bromo-cAMP through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway. The method used was that described previously in detail (9Froissart M. Borensztein P. Houillier P. Leviel F. Poggioli J. Marty E. Bichara M. Paillard M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C963-C970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Leviel F. Borensztein P. Houillier P. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with some modifications designed to improve the MTAL fragment recovery. In brief, 14–22 kidneys of anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g in body weight) were bathed in situ for 1 min with ice-cold dissecting solution before rapidly removing them to avoid anoxic damage to medullary tissues and improve cell viability. The kidneys were then cut into thin slices along the corticopapillary axis into ice-cold Hanks' solution supplemented with 24 mm bicarbonate and bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, pH 7.38. Small tissue pieces of inner stripes of outer medulla were then subjected at 37 °C to successive 6-min periods of collagenase digestion (0.40 g/liter in the above solution). To separate long MTAL fragments from isolated cells and small fragments of other medullary tissues, the pooled supernatants were first centrifuged at 150 × g for 2 min, and the resulting supernatant was discarded; the pellet was suspended in a medium containing 300 mm mannitol, 6 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 12 mm Trizma (Tris base), pH 7.4, centrifuged at 230 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. This maneuver was repeated, and the final tubular fragment pellet was resuspended in the latter medium, which gave the final MTAL suspension. The latter was made almost exclusively of MTAL tubules (>95%), occasional thin descending limb fragments, few medullary collecting tubules, and no isolated cells, as observed frequently by light microscopy. These characteristics were checked by electron microscopy, which confirmed that there was no proximal tubule fragment (S3) in this suspension obtained from carefully dissected inner stripes of outer medulla. 2Electron microscopy was performed by Gerard Feldmann and Alain Moreau, INSERM U.327, Paris, France. MTAL cells were loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECF, and pH i was monitored at 37 °C as described in detail previously (9Froissart M. Borensztein P. Houillier P. Leviel F. Poggioli J. Marty E. Bichara M. Paillard M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C963-C970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Leviel F. Borensztein P. Houillier P. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were prepared from the MTAL suspension by modifications of the Mg2+-EGTA-aggregation method used by Biber et al. (11Biber J. Stieger B. Haase W. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) to prepare proximal brush-border membranes. All steps of the fractionation procedure were performed at 2–4 °C and are schematized in Fig. 1. The MTALs suspension (21.4 ml) was homogenized first five times in a Dounce homogenizer and second in a Waring Blendor homogenizer at 22,000 rpm for 1.5 min; 30 ml of bi-distilled water with MgCl2 was then added to the homogenate to obtain a final concentration of 12 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 mm EGTA and a final osmolarity of ∼170 mosmol/liter. After 20 min, the homogenate (H in Fig. 1) was divided into two ∼25-ml fractions that were processed further in parallel; each fraction was centrifuged at 10,600 × g for 15 min with a Beckman J2-MC centrifuge and JS-13.1 rotor, which gave the pellet P1 and the supernatant S1 in Fig. 1. S1 was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 24 min with a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge and SS-34 rotor, which gave the vesicle-containing pellet P2 and the supernatant S2. The pooled membrane vesicles were resuspended in 15 ml of one of the loading solutions described below, and the resulting vesicle suspension was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 40 min; this loading maneuver was repeated to ensure complete loading of the vesicles with the appropriate solution; the final membrane vesicle pellet was suspended manually and homogenized by repeated passage through a 27-gauge needle in a small volume (150–300 μl) of the loading solution. The membrane vesicle suspension was stored at −80 °C and used within 2 weeks for transport studies and enzyme assays. All transport studies in membrane vesicles were performed at ambient temperature (22–25 °C) by a filtration technique using 0.45-μm cellulose acetate-nitrate filters (Millipore, HAWP). Membrane vesicles were thawed and kept on ice until use. When transport inhibitors were used, controls were performed in the presence of the vehicles of these inhibitors. K+/H+ antiport activity was assessed by measuring the uptake of 86Rb+, a substitute for K+, stimulated by an in > out H+gradient. Membrane vesicles were loaded as described above with solution A, pH 6.6, or A′, pH 8.0, listed in TableI. The uptake reaction was initiated by diluting and mixing 15–40-μg proteins of the membrane vesicles (10 μl) in 65 μl of isoosmolar solution B, pH 6.6, or C, pH 8.0 (TableI), containing in final concentrations 0.25–0.40 mm86RbCl (0.20–0.35 μCi/ml), 0.1 mm quinidine, and 1.5 mm furosemide to minimize background86Rb+ uptake by other MTAL K+carriers such as quinidine-sensitive K+ channels (1Amlal H. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21962-21971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bleich M. Schlatter E. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 415: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and furosemide-sensitive K+(NH4+)-Cl−cotransport (12Amlal H. Paillard M. Bichara M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1607-C1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake reaction was terminated after timed periods by rapid dilution of the reaction mixture with 2 ml of an isoosmolar ice-cold “stop solution” containing 275.5 mmmannitol, 16 mm Hepes, 16.9 mm Tris, 10 mm BaCl2, 0.1 mm quinidine, and 1.5 mm furosemide, pH 8.0; the latter transport inhibitors were present in the stop solution to prevent some release of86Rb+ from the vesicles into the cold stop solution from occurring. The diluted sample was poured immediately on a filter kept under suction and washed rapidly with an additional 12 ml of the ice-cold stop solution. The filter was placed in 4 ml of Ultimagold MV scintillation fluid (Packard) and counted by scintillation spectroscopy. Filter blanks were determined by diluting 10 μl of the loading solution in 65 μl of the reaction medium, and the resulting mixture was processed exactly as above. For one membrane vesicle preparation, each uptake condition and its filter blank were performed in triplicate; the mean filter blank value was subtracted from the experimental values to determine the amounts taken up by the vesicles. We first tested whether any binding of86Rb+ occurred in the membrane vesicles. For this purpose we have measured 86Rb+ uptake at equilibrium (120–150 min) at various medium osmolarities that were adjusted with mannitol. As shown in Fig.2, extrapolation of the regression line to infinite osmolarity (1/osmolarity approaching zero), a point at which the intravesicular free space should be negligible, indicates the presence of a binding component for 86Rb+ at low Rb+ concentration (0.38 mm); the86Rb+ binding component accounted for 60% of the equilibrium value observed at standard osmolarity (340 mosmol/liter). As will be shown below (see Fig. 5 B),86Rb+ binding was only intravesicular because there was no evidence for immediate binding;86Rb+ binding was thus secondary to86Rb+ transport inside the vesicles. Thus correction for a 60% binding component was made for equilibrium values but not for values at early times since the latter truly represented86Rb+ transport. At standard osmolarity (340 mosmol/liter), the distribution space of free86Rb+ was 2.6 μl/mg of protein.Table IComposition of experimental solutions used in vesicle studiesExperimentA loadaA′ loadaB uptakebC uptakebD uptakecE uptakecF load1-dNa+-K+-2Cl cotransport.G uptake1-dNa+-K+-2Cl cotransport.Mannitol175.75174.5173.65172.4173.75172.528683Hepes12065.512065.512065.51616Tris14.257014.257014.257088MgCl2101010101010Mg-(gluconate)21010RbCl0.250.25NaCl0.250.250.5KCl (or choline-Cl)100Quinidine0.10.1Furosemide1.51.51.51.5Amiloride2pH6.68.06.68.06.68.07.47.4a,b Rb+/H+ antiport.a,c Na+/H+ antiport.1-d Na+-K+-2Cl cotransport.

Na+/H+ antiport activity was assessed by measuring the uptake of 22Na+ stimulated by an in > out H+ gradient. Membrane vesicles were loaded as described above with solution A, pH 6.6 (Table I). The uptake reaction was initiated by diluting and mixing 15–30-μg proteins of the membrane vesicles (10 μl) in 65 μl of isoosmolar solution D, pH 6.6, or E, pH 8.0 (Table I), containing in final concentrations 0.25 mm22NaCl (1.75 μCi/ml) and 1.5 mm furosemide to minimize background22Na+ uptake by Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport. The uptake reaction was terminated after timed periods by rapid dilution of the reaction mixture with 2 ml of an isoosmolar ice-cold stop solution containing 273.6 mm mannitol, 16 mmHepes, 16.9 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm furosemide, and 2 mm amiloride, pH 8.0. The diluted sample was poured immediately on a filter kept under suction and washed rapidly with an additional 9 ml of the ice-cold stop solution. Scintillation counting, determinations of filter blanks, and calculations were made as described above for86Rb+. Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity was assessed by measuring the bumetanide-sensitive uptake of22Na+ stimulated by an inwardly directed 100 mm KCl gradient. Membrane vesicles were loaded as described above with solution F (Table I). The uptake reaction was initiated by diluting and mixing 10–20-μg proteins of membrane vesicles (10 μl) in 40 μl of isoosmolar solution G (Table I) containing 0.5 mm22NaCl (5.25 μCi/ml) and 2 mmamiloride to minimize background 22Na+ uptake by Na+ channels and Na+/H+exchange. The uptake reaction was terminated after timed periods by rapid dilution of the reaction mixture with 2 ml of an isoosmolar ice-cold stop solution containing 293 mm mannitol, 16 mm Hepes, 8 mm Tris, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm amiloride, and 1 mmbumetanide, pH 7.4; 5 mm NaCl and KCl were present in the stop solution to optimize bumetanide binding to the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (for review, see Ref. 13Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C869-C885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diluted sample was poured immediately on a filter kept under suction and washed rapidly with an additional 6 ml of the ice-cold stop solution. Scintillation counting, determinations of filter blanks, and calculations were made as described above for86Rb+. Protein amounts were determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar); alkaline phosphatase activity was measured by the colorimetric determination of p-nitrophenol produced after sample addition by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate used as a substrate (Sigma Diagnostics, Technical Bulletin 104). Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C, pH 7.4, by a radioisotopic method after treatment of the various tissue fractions by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with bovine serum albumin as a detergent buffer, as described by Forbush (15Forbush III, B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as follows. 9.5 μg/ml tissue proteins were preincubated for 10 min in the presence of 943.2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 67 μg/ml SDS (bovine serum albumin/SDS ratio = 14.1 and SDS/protein ratio = 7.1; osmolarity = 315 mosmol/liter); then the mixture was incubated for 15 min in the additional presence of 9 mm Tris-ATP and a tracer amount of [γ-32P]ATP (final osmolarity ∼ 195 mosmol/liter). The reaction was terminated by the addition of activated charcoal diluted in 1 n HCl (25%, w/v) and cooling to 2–4 °C. After centrifugation, the radioactivity of an aliquot of the supernatant containing 32P was determined by standard liquid scintillation techniques. Samples without tissue were processed in parallel to determine the spontaneous breakdown of ATP, which was subtracted from the experimental values. Na+/K+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference in ATP hydrolysis between that observed with 2.5 mm KCl plus 50 mm NaCl and that observed with 2.5 mm ouabain in the nominal absence of Na+and K+. All media contained 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm SCH 28080 to avoid any contribution of the MTAL ouabain-sensitive K+-ATPase activity (16Younes-Ibrahim M. Barlet-Bas C. Buffin-Meyer B. Cheval L. Rajerison R. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1141-F1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Carrier-free 22NaCl,86RbCl, and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, U. K.

AEBSF, amiloride, bumetanide, furosemide, quinidine, verapamil, Tris-ATP, AVP, 8-bromo-cAMP, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-chimie S.A.R.L., LaVerpillière, France. SCH 28080 was a gift from Schering-Plough Laboratories; HOE 694 was a gift from L. Counillon and J. Pouysségur. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance between experimental groups was assessed by Student's t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) completed by a t test using the within-groups residual variance of ANOVA, as appropriate. In some figures, curves fitting the data points were drawn by computer-assisted nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific). The specific activities, enrichment factors, and yields of marker enzymes for the apical membrane (alkaline phosphatase) and the basolateral membrane (Na+/K+-ATPase) are summarized in TableII. Alkaline phosphatase was selected as an enzyme marker for the MTAL apical membrane because, first, this enzyme copurifies with [3H]bumetanide binding sites in canine medullary membranes (17Forbush III, B. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11787-11792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and, second, Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity is strongly linearly correlated with the alkaline phosphatase enrichment factor of rat MTAL membranes (r = 0.91,p < 0.0001), a fact that we have established in another work (18Attmane-Elakeb A. Sibella V. Paillard M. Bichara M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 1251Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the membrane vesicle fraction P2 had a high enrichment factor (23.9 ± 2.6, ranging from 14 to 36) and a high yield (32.7 ± 4.7%, ranging from 15 to 56%) in the apical marker alkaline phosphatase. The enrichment factor (3.4 ± 0.2) and yield (4.7 ± 0.6%) in Na+/K+-ATPase, although seemingly low compared with those of alkaline phosphatase, must be considered as representing a relatively important amount of basolateral membranes because the total surface area of the basolateral membrane is ˜24 times larger than that of the apical membrane of the rat MTAL in the inner stripe of outer medulla (19Pfaller W. Rittinger M. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the sealing of basolateral membranes is usually incomplete (for review, see Ref. 20Murer H. Gmaj P. Kidney Int. 1986; 30: 171-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); it was established in a previous work from this laboratory that only 30% of MTAL basolateral membranes isolated with a Ca2+ aggregation method were sealed and thus could contribute to solute transport by the vesicles (21Attmane-Elakeb A. Chambrey R. Tsimaratos M. Leviel F. Blanchard A. Warnock D.G. Paillard M. Podevin R.-A. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy examination showed that the preparation was composed essentially of round or oval vesicles having a mean diameter of ∼0.3 μm2. From these considerations we conclude that both apical and basolateral membrane vesicles were present in substantial amounts in the membrane vesicles used in the present study.Table IISpecific activities, enrichment factors, and yields of marker enzymes in fractions obtained during the membrane isolation procedureFractionProteinAlkaline phosphataseNa+/K+-ATPaseQuantityYieldSpecific activityEnrichment factorYieldSpecific activityEnrichment factorYieldmg%%%H24.2 ± 3.525.9 ± 3.31,373 ± 67P115.4 ± 2.462.9 ± 1.716.5 ± 2.50.7 ± 0.142.2 ± 4.91,572 ± 1171.2 ± 0.171.9 ± 3.1S26.9 ± 0.829.3 ± 1.212.8 ± 1.20.53 ± 0.0515.6 ± 1.698 ± 190.08 ± 0.022.3 ± 0.6P20.34 ± 0.071.4 ± 0.1644 ± 14023.9 ± 2.632.7 ± 4.74,776 ± 5833.4 ± 0.24.7 ± 0.6Total recovery93.5 ± 2.290.5 ± 3.678.9 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab The membrane vesicles displayed strong Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity, which is clear evidence for the presence of apical membrane vesicles in important amounts. As shown in Fig.3 A, most of 0.5 mm22Na+ uptake during early times was 1 mm bumetanide-sensitive in the presence of an inwardly directed 100 mm KCl gradient; the KCl gradient-stimulated22Na+ uptake probably reached after 30 s a value higher than the eventual equilibrium value (overshoot), whereas22Na+ uptake in the presence of 1 mm bumetanide increased almost linearly toward the equilibrium value. Thus the 1 mm bumetanide-sensitive component of 0.5 mm22Na+ uptake (Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity) reached by 30 s a maximum value of 320 ± 32 pmol/mg of protein (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, in the presence of an inwardly directed 100 mm choline-Cl gradient,22Na+ uptake was ∼75% lower than with KCl, which was not different from the uptake observed in the absence of a Cl− gradient and was not affected by 1 mmbumetanide (not shown); thus there was no bumetanide-sensitive K+-independent Na+-Cl−cotransport. Extrapolation of the curves in Fig. 3 A to time zero indicates that an almost immediate 22Na+uptake occurred similarly in the presence or absence of bumetanide, probably because of rapid external binding of22Na+. Finally, 22Na+uptake equilibrium values were identical in the presence or absence of bumetanide (Fig. 3 A), which indicates that bumetanide did not modify 22Na+ binding. These observations demonstrate that the bumetanide-sensitive component of the KCl gradient-stimulated 22Na+ uptake was mediated by the activity of the apical MTAL Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter. Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) activity was demonstrated as the amiloride-sensitive H+ gradient-stimulated22Na+ uptake by the membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 0.25 mm22Na+ uptake at 10 s was stimulated more than 2-fold by an in (i) > out (o) H+ gradient (pH i = 6.6/pH o = 8.0); the H+gradient-stimulated 22Na+ uptake was abolished by 2 mm amiloride, a high amiloride concentration that completely blocks the NHE-1, NHE-2, and NHE-3 isoforms of the rat Na+/H+ antiport at this low Na+concentration (22Orlowski J.

It must be emphasized that 25 μmamiloride and 50 μm HOE 694 inhibited to similar extents (−34.6 ± 8.0 and −39.9 ± 6.3%, respectively) NHE activity estimated as the difference in 22Na+uptake between the presence and absence of a H+ gradient (Fig. 4 A); the latter effects could be explained by inhibition of the amiloride- and HOE 694-sensitive NHE-1 isoform but not by inhibition of the amiloride- and HOE 694-resistant NHE-3 isoform (23Counillon L.

Indeed, Fig. 4 B shows that ∼90% of the 50 μm HOE 694-sensitive Na+/H+antiport activity was blocked by concentrations of HOE 694 as low as 0.1 and 1 μm, which demonstrates blockade by HOE 694 of the NHE-1 isoform only (23Counillon L.

Similarly, 25 μmamiloride inhibits NHE-1 by ∼94% and NHE-3 by only ∼20% in the presence of 0.25 mmNa+. 3The extent of inhibition of Na+/H+ antiport was calculated with the following equation, which is derived from Michaelis-Menten equation:V/V max = [S]/([S] + Km,Na × (1+[I]/K i)), where V/V max is the residual activity as a fraction of the maximum velocity; [S] and [I] are the concentrations of substrate (Na+) and inhibitor (amiloride), respectively; Km,Na and K i are Michaelis constant for Na+ and the dissociation constant for amiloride, respectively.Km,Na and amiloride K i values for NHE-1 and NHE-3 were taken from Ref.22Orlowski J.

In +/+ islets cultured with 2 mm free fatty acids (FFA) the proinsulin mRNA ratio rose 2.4-fold at 12 h. In fa/+ islets, the ratio rose only 65% above normal. There was no change in fa/fa islets.

Recent studies in our lab suggest that β-cell compensation for the insulin resistance of adiposity is, at least in part, driven by the accompanying elevations of long-chain free fatty acids (FFA) 1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; ZDF, Zucker diabetic fatty; TG, triglyceride; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; OB-R, leptin receptor; NO, nitric oxide. in tissues and plasma (8Milburn J.L.

Since leptin regulates the metabolic fate of FFA in tissues by blocking intracellular esterification and by enhancing intracellular oxidation (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), leptin action may influence the ability of β-cells to augment insulin production in response to FFA. Indeed, in leptin-resistant obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats with defective leptin receptors (5Phillips M.S. Liu Q.Y. Hammond H.A. Dugan V. Hey P.J. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 6Iida M. Murakami T. Ishida K. Mizuno A. Kuwajima M. Shima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), there is a marked increase in the triglyceride (TG) content in islets during the developement of the β-cell defects of adipogenic diabetes, so-called “lipotoxicity” (11Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, “underleptinization” might be the proximal cause of the β-cell dysfunction that results in the noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus of ZDF rats. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of leptin upon FFA-induced up-regulation of proinsulin mRNA in islets of lean wild-type ZDF rats (+/+), of obese prediabetic ZDF rats, which are homozygous for the mutation in the leptin receptor (fa/fa), and of lean heterozygous ZDF rats (fa/+). The islets of +/+ ZDF rats are entirely normal and fully responsive to the lipopenic action of leptin (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), whereas the fat-laden islets of fa/faZDF rats are completely unresponsive to leptin (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) and cannot be used to study leptin action. The islets of lean heterozygous ZDF rats with a single normal OB-R allele, therefore, became the focus of this study. Their fat content is slightly higher than islets of wild-type ZDF rats (12Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and, as in homozygous rats, they do not mount a normal compensatory increase in insulin production in response to FFA (9Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R. Nagasawa Y. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5633-5637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, since high levels of leptin will reduce their fat content (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), they can be employed to test the premise that leptin action plays a role in the FFA-induced increase in proinsulin gene expression. The following studies were designed to test this hypothesis. All groups of rats were studied at 7 weeks of age. Homozygous male obese prediabetic ZDF-drt rats (fa/fa), which become diabetic at 8–10 weeks of age, heterozygous lean ZDF littermates (fa/+), and wild-type lean ZDF rats (+/+) were bred in our laboratory from ZDF/drt-fa (F10) stock purchased from Dr. Richard Peterson (University of Indianapolis School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). All rats received standard rat chow (Teklad F6 8664, Teklad, Madison, WI) ad libitum and had free access to water. The institutional guidelines for animal care and use were followed. DNA was extracted from rat tails (∼8 mm) by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (13Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). Primers 5′-GTTTGCGTATGCAAGTCACAG-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCAGAGATTCCGAG-3′ were used to amplify products from 5 ng of genomic DNA in a 50-μl reaction mixture. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 90 s, and 68 °C for 5 min was employed. PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme MspI for 2 h at 37 °C and analyzed on a 2% agarose gel (5Phillips M.S. Liu Q.Y. Hammond H.A. Dugan V. Hey P.J. Caskey C.T. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets were isolated from 7-week-old rats by the method of Naber et al. (14Naber S.P. McDonald J.M. Jarett L. McDaniel M.L. Ludvigsen C.W. Lacy P.E. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as modified by Lee et al. (15Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). They were maintained for 3 days in suspension culture in 60-mm glass Petri dishes at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air as described previously (8Milburn J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The culture consisted of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 8.0 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2% bovine serum albumin, fraction V (Bayer Corp., Kankakee, IL). In some experiments, 20 ng/ml recombinant leptin (kindly provided by Todd Kirchgessner, Bristol-Myers Squibb) and/or 2 mm of a 2:1 oleate:palmitate mixture in 2% albumin were added to the culture medium (Sigma). Glucose usage in cultured islets was measured by the method of Zawalich and Matchinsky (16Zawalich W.S. Matchinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Zawalich et al. (17Zawalich W.S. Pagliara A.S. Matchinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as described previously (8Milburn J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from islets by the TRIzol isolation method (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) from about 200 isolated islets. 2-μg aliquots of total RNA were treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega), and the first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using the oligod(T) primer in 1st-strandTM cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH). The primers used were: 5′-TGCCCGGGCTTTTGT CAAAC-3′ for insulin sense primer and 5′-CTCCAGTGCCAAGGTCTGAA-3′ for insulin antisense primer, corresponding to 4244–4263 and 4411–4430 base pairs of the proinsulin sequence (GeneBankTM Data Bank accession number J00747); and 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGGACGATATGG-3′ for β-actin sense primer and 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′ for β-actin antisense primer, corresponding to 1552–1575 and 2968–2991 base pairs of the β-actin sequence (GeneBankTM Data Bank accession number J00691). Linearity of the PCR reaction was tested by amplification of 100 ng first-strand cDNA per reaction from 10 to 45 cycles. The linear range was found to be between 10 and 35 cycles. In no case did the amount of first-strand cDNA used for PCR reaction exceed 100 ng per reaction. The samples were amplified for 22 cycles using the following parameters: 92 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on an agarose gel, and Southern blotting was carried out on a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled internal oligo primers (5′-ACACACCAGGTACAGAGCCTCCACCAGGTG-3′ for proinsulin and 5′-GGTCAGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAG-3′ for β-actin). Insulin mRNA and β-actin mRNA levels were quantified using the phosphorimager. β-actin was employed as an internal standard for normalizing proinsulin mRNA. After the 3-day culture period in medium containing either 0 or 2 mm FFA, islets from all groups of rats were randomly selected, washed twice with PBS, and stained with fluorescein diacetate and ethidium bromide for 1 min. Approximately 500 cells from each of the six groups were counted at random under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Optiphot UFX 1-A, Garden City, NY). Green cells were counted as viable and red cells as dead. The data were expressed as percent viability. All results are expressed as ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test on two-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's multiple comparison. The effect of 2 mm FFA on the proinsulin/β-actin mRNA ratio is shown in Fig.1. FFA up-regulated proinsulin mRNA to a peak 2.4-fold of the control level at 12 h after the start of culture. By contrast, up-regulation of the proinsulin mRNA ratio by 16 mm glucose reached a peak 3 times the control value at 4 h (Fig. 1). Enhancement of insulin production by FFA does not occur in islets from rats that are either homozygous (fa/fa) or heterozygous (fa/+) for a mutant leptin receptor (9Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R. Nagasawa Y. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5633-5637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We determined if the failure of islets of ZDF rats to increase insulin production in response to FFA was associated with impairment of the response of the proinsulin mRNA/β-actin mRNA ratio. In contrast to the 2.4-fold increase in proinsulin mRNA in islets from normal wild-type (+/+) ZDF rats, it rose by only 65% in islets from the heterozygous (fa/+), while the ratio remained unchanged in homozygous (fa/fa) rats (Fig.2). Thus, the full FFA-induced response in proinsulin mRNA, like the previously reported FFA-induced changes in insulin secretion (8Milburn J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M.

Nagasawa Y. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5633-5637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), seems to require the presence of two normal leptin receptor alleles. To exclude the possibility that these differences in proinsulin mRNA were the spurious consequence of a greater cytotoxic effect of the 2 mm FFA on leptin receptor-defective β-cells, we conducted viability studies on islets from the three groups after culture for 3 days in the presence or absence of 2 mm FFA. FFA reduced the percent of viable cells in islets from wild-type ZDF rats by 8%, compared with 11 and 13% in islets from heterozygous and homozygous ZDF rats, respectively. These small intergroup differences in viability were regarded as insufficient to explain the large differences in FFA-induced insulin gene expression. To determine whether the failure of insulin gene expression to respond to FFA represented an FFA-restricted defect or a nonspecific and general inability to respond to increased insulin demand, we compared the proinsulin/β-actin mRNA ratio in islets from the three groups of rats cultured for 3 days in the presence of 8 or 16 mmglucose. As shown in Fig. 3, the proinsulin mRNA ratio in islets from fa/fa rats was not increased by glucose, perhaps because the massive increase in fat content had seriously impaired the ability of β-cell to respond to any increase in insulin need. However, in islets from heterozygous ZDF rats, 16 mm glucose induced a greater than 2.5-fold increase in proinsulin mRNA, not significantly different from the proinsulin mRNA response to glucose of islets from wild-type ZDF rats, whereas the response to FFA was only 30% of that of wild-type rats. Thus, the defect in islets of heterozygous ZDF rats seemed to be FFA-restricted without impairment of the glucose-induced response of proinsulin mRNA. Previous findings from this laboratory indicate that in normal islets leptin promotes the channeling of FFA into oxidative rather than lipogenic pathways (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Since islets of fa/fa rats cannot respond to leptin (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), they have an increased rate of FFA esterification (12Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), islet TG content rises to extremely high levels (15Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), and FFA enhancement of β-cell function is somehow blocked. Islets of heterozygous rats, by contrast, have a much less marked increase in TG content (12Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but FFA enhancement of β-cell function is, nevertheless, attenuated. However, their islets respond partially to 20 ng/ml leptin with a lowering of TG content, as shown in TableI (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To determine if exposure to leptin would repair the partial defect in the response of proinsulin mRNA to FFA, we added 20 ng/ml recombinant hormone to the culture medium and reassessed the effect of FFA on proinsulin mRNA. The presence of leptin in the culture medium reduced the increase in TG otherwise observed in islets of heterozygous rats cultured in the presence of 1 mm FFA from 27 ng/islet to only 4.6 ng/islet (Table I). Concomitantly, the response of proinsulin mRNA to FFA was restored to normal (Fig. 4); by contrast, in islets of homozygous ZDF rats, neither the TG content nor FFA induction of proinsulin mRNA were affected by leptin.Table ITriglyceride content (ng/islet) in islets treated 48 h with or without recombinant leptinFFALeptinLean +/+ ZDFLean fa/+ ZDFObesefa/fa ZDFmmng/ml008.9 ± 0.512.1 ± 3.354.2 ± 5.00202.6 ± 1.21-ap < 0.01 versus 0 leptin.7.7 ± 1.21-ap < 0.01 versus 0 leptin.51.9 ± 9.31034.7 ± 4.31-bp < 0.01 versus 0 FFA.38.9 ± 3.11-bp < 0.01 versus 0 FFA.134.6 ± 10.21-bp < 0.01 versus 0 FFA.1206.0 ± 2.81-ap < 0.01 versus 0 leptin.16.7 ± 2.31-ap < 0.01 versus 0 leptin.132.4 ± 10.21-a p < 0.01 versus 0 leptin.1-b p < 0.01 versus 0 FFA.

Since insulin production varies with glucose metabolism by islets (18Matchinsky F.M. Trus M. Burch P. Berner D. Ghosh A. Zawalich W. Weill V. Waldhausl W.K. Diabetes 1979. Excerpta Medica, Arsterdam1980: 154-159Google Scholar, 19Meglasson M.D. Matchinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that FFA effects on insulin gene expression were mediated by the increase in glucose usage. We, therefore, compared the chronology of the FFA-induced proinsulin mRNA response and the rise in low Km glucose usage. As shown in TableII, glucose usage was rising at 12 h, the time at which the FFA-induced increase was at its peak. This indicated that the improved effect of FFA on proinsulin mRNA might have been mediated via enhanced glucose metabolism.Table IITime course of FFA-induced increase in low Km3H-glucose usage (pmol/h/islet) by cultured islets isolated from groups of ZDF rats2 mm FFA0 h4 h12 h24 hLean +/+ ZDF24.0 ± 0.6 (5)30.5 (2)37.7 ± 1.3 (4)48.8 (2)Lean fa/+ ZDF34.7 ± 1.2 (3)35.9 (2)40.9 ± 1.7 (4)42.2 (2)Obesefa/faZDF182.7 (2)157.1 (2)170.3 ± 3.4 (3)175.8 (2) Open table in a new tab Since the foregoing result did not prove a relationship between low Km glucose usage and proinsulin mRNA up-regulation, we exploited the fact that the normal up-regulatory effect of FFA on proinsulin mRNA is absent in cultured islets of heterozygous ZDF rats but is restored by exposure of the islets to leptin (Fig. 4). Low Km glucose usage should also be improved by leptin if the leptin-induced improvement in the proinsulin mRNA response to FFA were mediated by increased glucose metabolism. As shown in Table II, leptin did not increase low Kmglucose usage, indicating that the leptin-mediated normalization of proinsulin mRNA does not depend upon an increase in low Km glucose usage. There is now substantial evidence to indicate that the increased insulin production required to compensate for obesity-induced insulin resistance is stimulated by fatty acids reaching the islets (8Milburn J.L.

McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), coupled with a dramatically increased esterification capacity resulting from the lack of leptin action (12Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the TG content of islets from obese prediabetic ZDF rats, in which the β-cells have successfully compensated for the concomitant insulin resistance, is ∼13–17-fold that of lean Wistar rats (12Lee Y. Hirose H. Zhou Y.-T. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The increased insulin production observed in vivo in these obese compensated prediabetic rats can be duplicated in vitro by culturing normal islets from lean rats in 1 or 2 mm FFA (8Milburn J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We refer to these changes as “compensatory.” Later in the course of prediabetic obesity, islet fat content rises to 50–100-fold that of lean Wistar rats, at which time basal and stimulated insulin production significantly decline (15Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). These in vivo changes can be duplicated in vitro by culturing islets from compensated prediabetic obese rats in 1 or 2 mm FFA (9Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Inman L.R. Nagasawa Y. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5633-5637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have referred to this effect of FFA on β-cell function as “lipotoxic” since we attribute it to the lipid overload (11Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent work suggests that lipotoxicity is mediated by excessive levels of nitric oxide (NO) in islets (20Shimabukuro M. Ohneda M. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Since leptin reduces islet TG via the leptin receptor (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), it was logical to ascribe the fat overload of ZDF rats and the β-cell dysfunction in these animals to their abnormal leptin receptor. However, since islets of homozygous ZDF rats cannot respond to leptin, we could not test the validity of the premise that underleptinization causes their β-cell phenotype. We therefore employed islets of heterozygous fa/+ rats, which are responsive to high concentrations of leptin (10Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) but which do not mount a normal compensatory increase in insulin production response to FFA in vitro. Leptin reduced the rise in islet TG that otherwise occurs when islets from heterozygous ZDF islets are cultured in FFA, and this was associated with normalization of the attenuated FFA-induced response of the proinsulin/β-actin mRNA ratio. However, a causal relationship between the elevated islet TG and the impairment in FFA-induced compensatory changes of β-cells in fa/+ rats is difficult to substantiate inasmuch as the differences in fat content from +/+ controls are unimpressive. While it is possible that by shifting FFA from esterification to other pathways in fa/+ islets, leptin provided the FFA substrate required to up-regulate β-cell function; however, a clearcut relationship between the leptin-mediated improvement in FFA-induced proinsulin mRNA response to the observed changes in lipid metabolism could not be established. Nor does it appear that the FFA-induced up-regulation of proinsulin mRNA is mediated by the previously demonstrated FFA-induced increase in low Km glucose metabolism (8Milburn J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. BeltrandelRio H. Newgard C.B. Johnson J.H. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1295-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Hirose H.

If the proinsulin mRNA response to FFA had been secondary to increased low Km glucose usage, leptin treatment, which restored the impaired FFA-induced proinsulin mRNA response of fa/+ islets to normal, should also have restored to normal the FFA-mediated increase in low Km glucose usage. Since leptin failed to improve FFA induction of low Km glucose usage, we concluded that the amelioration in the proinsulin mRNA response attributed to leptin action was independent of changes in low Km glucose metabolism.

The emergence of strains of Plasmodium falciparum which are resistant to many anti-malarial drugs has made the development of a malaria vaccine an urgent priority. Considerable effort has been directed toward the development of a subunit vaccine incorporating recombinant proteins corresponding to defined malarial antigens (1Anders R.F. Saul A.J. Good M.F. Saul A.J. Molecular Immunological Considerations in Malaria Vaccine Development. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 167-195Google Scholar). Because the merozoite stage of Plasmodium is transiently accessible to plasma antibodies, molecules expressed at the merozoite surface are of particular interest as potential targets of a vaccine-induced immune response. One promising vaccine candidate is apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1), 1The abbreviations used are: AMA-1, apical membrane antigen-1; scFv, single chain variable fragment; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; VH, variable heavy; VL, variable light; Vk, variable kappa; TBS, tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AMA-1B, recombinant ectodomain of AMA-1; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzythiazolinesulfonate; CDR, complementarity-determining region. 1The abbreviations used are: AMA-1, apical membrane antigen-1; scFv, single chain variable fragment; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; VH, variable heavy; VL, variable light; Vk, variable kappa; TBS, tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AMA-1B, recombinant ectodomain of AMA-1; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzythiazolinesulfonate; CDR, complementarity-determining region. which appears on the merozoite surface after being released from apical organelles within the parasite (2Peterson M.G.

This redistribution event occurs around the time of parasite release and reinvasion, and it has been proposed that AMA-1 plays a role in the invasion process. Clearly a molecule with such an important function would be an ideal candidate for use in a subunit vaccine. Sequences have been determined for the gene for AMA-1 from a number of different species of Plasmodium (3Cheng Q. Saul A. Mol. Biochem.

AMA-1 is relatively well conserved within and between Plasmodium species and lacks the extensive polymorphisms described in other malarial antigens. The conservation of 16 cysteine residues, in the ectodomain of AMA-1, among rodent, human, and simian malaria parasites suggests that the structure of AMA-1 is constrained by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Hodder et al. (9Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Matthew M.L.S.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Anders R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29446-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) have recently determined the cysteine connectivity of these disulfide bonds, and their distribution is consistent with a three-domain substructure for the AMA-1 ectodomain. Immunization of rhesus monkeys with PK66, the Plasmodium knowlesi homolog of AMA-1, isolated from parasites, conferred partial immunity against challenge with P. knowlesi parasites (10Deans J.A. Knight A.M. Jean W.C. Waters A.P. Cohen S. Mitchell G.H. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1988; 10: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). More effective protection was achieved in monkeys and mice challenged with Plasmodium fragile and Plasmodium chabaudi, respectively, by immunization with recombinant forms of the corresponding AMA-1 (11Collins W.E. Pye D. Crewther P.E. Vandeberg K.L. Galland G.C. Sultzer A.J. Kemp D.J. Edwards S.J. Coppel R.L. Sullivan J.S. Morris C.L. Anders R.F. Am. J. Trop. Med.

Protection against P. chabaudi was obtained only if mice were immunized with AMA-1 that had been refolded in vitro, under conditions that allowed correct disulfide bond pairing, and not if the mice were immunized with a preparation of reduced and alkylated AMA-1 (13Anders R.F. Crewther P.E. Edwards S. Margetts M. Matthew M.L.S.M. Pollock B. Pye D. Vaccine. 1997; (in press): 15PubMed Google Scholar). The humoral arm of the immune system has been shown to play a critical role in protection. In the trials conducted to date, a strong correlation has been established between anti-AMA-1 antibody titers and levels of protection (10Deans J.A. Knight A.M. Jean W.C. Waters A.P. Cohen S. Mitchell G.H. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1988; 10: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Collins W.E. Pye D. Crewther P.E. Vandeberg K.L. Galland G.C. Sultzer A.J. Kemp D.J.

Matthew M.L.S.M. Pollock B. Pye D. Vaccine. 1997; (in press): 15PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against PK66 was shown to block the invasion in vitro of rhesus erythrocytes by P. knowlesi (14Deans J.A. Alderson T. Thomas A.W. Mitchell G.H. Lennox E.S. Cohen S.C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1982; 49: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar); moreover, Fab fragments were found to be more effective in this blocking than the intact antibody (15Thomas A.W. Deans J.A. Mitchell G.H. Alderson T. Cohen S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, passive transfer of purified IgG from rabbits immunized with recombinant P. chabaudi AMA-1 effected a rapid elimination of parasites from the circulation of mice infected with P. chabaudi (12Crewther P.E. Matthews M.L.S.M. Flegg R.H. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The success of passive immunization strategies using anti-AMA-1 antibodies raises the possibility that life-threatening cases of malaria in humans could be treated with anti-AMA-1 antibodies. Such a strategy would require a readily available source of anti-AMA-1 antibodies with defined specificities. Large scale production of antibody reagents is now possible because of recent advances in recombinant antibody technology (16Siegel D.L. Silberstein L.E. Blood. 1994; 83: 2334-2344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Samuelsson A. Yari F. Hinkula J. Eroy O. Norrby E. Persson M.A.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3029-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which overcome many of the problems associated with the production of monoclonal antibodies by conventional hybridoma technology. We have therefore undertaken the production of a library of single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies against P. chabaudi AMA-1. This work represents an important advance toward the development of a recombinant antibody-based therapy for malaria. scFv antibodies consist of the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of antibodies linked via a short peptide spacer (18Huston J.S. Levinson D. Mudgett H.M. Tai M.S. Novotny J. Margolis M.N. Ridge R.J. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Crea R. Oppermann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5879-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). scFv molecules derived from hybridomas have been shown to retain the binding specificities of the parent monoclonal antibody and, where measured, have similar binding affinities (18Huston J.S. Levinson D. Mudgett H.M. Tai M.S. Novotny J. Margolis M.N. Ridge R.J. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Crea R. Oppermann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5879-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 19Bird R.E. Hardman K.D. Jacobson J.W. Johnson S. Kaufman B.M. Lee S.M. Lee T. Pope S.H. Riordan G.S. Whitlow M. Science. 1988; 242: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Specific scFvs can also be produced by selection from a diverse library displayed on the surface of phage (20Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Midgley C. Lane D. Winter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 21Winter G. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 349: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). There are several important advantages associated with the production of recombinant antibodies. First, the phage display technology includes a powerful enrichment strategy that allows rapid and simple selection of reagents with desired properties. Second, the scFv fragments can be produced in large quantities in bacteria. Third, the genes for the scFvs can be manipulated to introduce mutations that enhance the binding characteristics of the antibody reagents (22Burton D.R. Barbas C.F. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 57: 191-280Crossref Google Scholar). In this work we have used spleens from mice protected against malaria challenge by previous injection with recombinant P. chabaudiAMA-1 (12Crewther P.E. Matthews M.L.S.M. Flegg R.H. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the starting material for the production of a library of phage-displayed scFv. Selective binding strategies were used to isolate four independent scFvs that specifically recognize AMA-1 from P. chabaudi DS strain. Perhaps surprisingly, none of the scFvs tested recognized AMA-1 from the 556KA strain of P. chabaudi, which differs from AMA-1 (DS) by only 36 nucleotide substitutions (12Crewther P.E. Matthews M.L.S.M. Flegg R.H. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a subset of scFvs recognized AMA-1 from P. falciparum. The epitopes recognized by the scFv antibodies were found to be disulfide bond-dependent, thus mimicking the conformational constraint of AMA-1 which is necessary for the induction of a protective immune response. This work provides a defined set of recombinant antibodies against AMA-1 which can be used to probe the structure of AMA-1 to identify “protective” epitopes. This analysis will be valuable in the development of both passive and active immunization strategies based on AMA-1. Spleens from four hyperimmune mice were homogenized in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, and total RNA was precipitated after extraction with phenol/chloroform. mRNA was isolated from the total RNA using the poly(AT)tract system according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). The Recombinant Phage Antibody System-scFv Module (AMRAD, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to construct a mouse scFv phage display library according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, mRNA from hyperimmune mice was used for random primed cDNA synthesis. cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of the murine IgG variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain gene fragments, using a family of primers specific to these sequences supplied with the kit. PCR products were gel purified, and equal amounts of VH, VL, and a linker sequence were mixed. Assembly of the VH and VL regions to form scFv fragments was effected during seven cycles at 94 °C for 1 min and 63 °C for 4 min. The scFv fragments were then amplified by PCR using a mixture of VH-specific primers containing a 5′-SfiI site and a mixture of VL-specific primers containing a 3′-NotI site. After gel purification and quantitation, the PCR products were digested with SfiI and NotI and ligated into the phagemid expression vector, pCANTAB 5E (Pharmacia). The ligation mixture was purified and electroporated into Escherichia coli TG1 cells at an efficiency of 1 × 109 transformants/μg of plasmid. A library of 4 × 104 individual clones was produced, with almost 100% of the clones carrying a scFv insert. The library was rescued by infection with the helper phage VCSM13 (1012plaque-forming units). Phage were precipitated from the culture supernatant by the addition of 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and 3% (w/v) NaCl followed by incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation. Precipitated phage were resuspended in TBS, 1% BSA and centrifuged. Supernatants were stored at −20 °C. The recombinant forms of the AMA-1 ectodomain were expressed in E. coli with NH2-terminal hexahistidine tags for purification by Ni-chelate chromatography. The purification and refolding in vitro of the P. chabaudi adami DS strain AMA-1 have been described by Anders et al. (13Anders R.F. Crewther P.E. Edwards S. Margetts M. Matthew M.L.S.M. Pollock B. Pye D. Vaccine. 1997; (in press): 15PubMed Google Scholar). The P. chabaudi adami 556KA AMA-1 and the P. falciparum 3D7 strain AMA-1 were prepared using similar procedures. The reduction and alkylation of the AMA-1 molecules were performed as described by Crewther et al. (12Crewther P.E. Matthews M.L.S.M. Flegg R.H. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant phage (up to 1 × 1014colony-forming units/ml) carrying scFv insert were subjected to four rounds of panning against recombinant P. chabaudi (DS strain) AMA-1 ectodomain (AMA-1B), which had been expressed and refolded in vitro. AMA-1B (1 μg/50 μl) was coated onto microtiter wells at 4 °C overnight, except for the last round of panning where wells were coated with 10-fold lower concentrations (0.1 μg/50 μl) to enrich for higher affinity binding phage. Wells were washed twice with distilled water and then blocked with 5% BLOTTO (made up in TBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Recombinant phage (up to 5 × 1012 colony-forming units) were incubated in the AMA-1B-coated wells for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (once for round 1, 5 times for round 2, and 10 times for subsequent rounds), bound phage were eluted by incubation with 50 μl of 100 mm HCl (pH 2.2) and neutralized immediately with 3 μl of 2 m Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified by infection of fresh E. coli TG1 cells and phage rescue as outlined above. The phage produced after four rounds of panning were used to infect E. coli TG1 cells, and the phagemid DNA was recovered (Wizard minipreps, Promega). To produce soluble scFv antibodies, the DNA was used to transform E. coli HB2151 cells. This strain of E. coli recognizes the amber stop codon between the scFv and the gene III fragment. Overnight induction of 50 ml of E. coli HB2151 cells containing phagemid DNA with 1 mm isopropyl β-,d-thiogalactopyranoside thus led to the production of a soluble form of the scFv antibody fragment, which is secreted into the periplasm. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and supernatants (containing any extracellular soluble scFvs) were filtered through a 0.45-mm filter and stored at −20 °C. To prepare periplasmic extracts, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at top speed in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants (containing soluble periplasmic scFvs) were transferred to a clean tube and stored at −20 °C. The remaining cell pellet was also stored at −20 °C for further analysis. Recombinant phage were rescued from individual clones and screened for AMA-1B binding by ELISA. Microtiter wells were coated with AMA-1B as described previously and blocked with 5% BLOTTO for 1 h at 37 °C. Phage were incubated in the wells for 1 h at 37 °C and then subjected to three washes with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Bound phage were detected by incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-M13 antibody (Strategene) followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1,000 dilution) for 30 min at 37 °C. Detection was achieved by the addition of ABTS substrate. When soluble scFvs were used as the primary antibody, detection was achieved by incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the E-tag at the COOH terminus of the scFv and, after washing, further incubation with an α-murine IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The extent of binding was visualized by addition of ABTS substrate to the wells. Nitrocellulose filters were placed in a dot-blotting apparatus (Bartelt Instruments Proprietary Ltd.), and defined areas were coated with AMA-1B (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, then blocked with 5% BLOTTO for 1 h at room temperature. Detection and visualization were achieved as described above but using either 4-chloro-1-napthol or enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Proteins separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and blocked and probed as described above. Proteins were electrophoresed either in the presence (reducing conditions) or absence (nonreducing conditions) of β-mercaptoethanol. Nucleic acid sequencing of selected clones was carried out using a Taq fluorescent dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA), and the products were analyzed on a 373A automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Primers were S1 and S6 sequencing primers for the pCANTAB vectors (Pharmacia). All sequences were searched in the Kabat data base using the BLAST search facility available through the World Wide Web (URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) to compare them with previously sequenced VH and VL chains. The sequence analysis workshop (SAW) program (23Elgavish R.A. Schroeder Jr., H.W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1066-1071PubMed Google Scholar) and the international immunogenetics (IMGT) data base (24Giudicelli V. Chaume D. Bodmer J. Muller W. Busin C. Marsh S. Bontrop R. Marc L. Malik A. Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were used to propose assignment of scFvs to potential germline genes and assess V, D, and J segment usage. The IMGT tool DNAPLOT was accessed via the website (URL:http://www.Genetik.uni-Koeln.de/dnaplot/). The DNAsis program (Hitachi Corp.) was used for alignment and sequence manipulation. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription from mRNA isolated from the spleens of four mice that had been protected against malaria by prior immunization with the refolded ectodomain of AMA-1 from P. chabaudi (12Crewther P.E. Matthews M.L.S.M. Flegg R.H. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3310-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene fragments corresponding to the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH) and light chains (VL) of the repertoire of antibody genes were amplified by PCR. The fragments were joined to form a series of scFv gene sequences that were ligated into the phagemid vector pCANTAB5E (Pharmacia). To examine the integrity of the library, 20 colonies were picked at random, and all were found to contain inserts of the appropriate size. Recombinant phage, expressing a library of scFv polypeptides on their surface, were produced by helper phage rescue and selectively enriched by panning against immobilized refolded P. chabaudi AMA-1 ectodomain. The phage were pooled after each successive round of panning and tested for their ability to bind to P. chabaudi AMA-1 in an ELISA. The pool of phage rescued from the library before panning showed no binding to P. chabaudi AMA-1; however, after four rounds of selection, phage showed greatly enhanced specific binding to P. chabaudiAMA-1 (Fig. 1). The specificity of the interaction with AMA-1 was indicated by the absence of binding of the phage population to BSA (data not shown). The pool of phage selected by four rounds of panning was used to infect an E. coli (TG1) culture, and subsequent plating on agar containing ampicillin allowed individual colonies harboring phagemid to grow. To verify that individual phage clones could bind to P. chabaudi AMA-1, phage were rescued from 24 individual colonies (selected at random) and tested for binding to P. chabaudiAMA-1 by ELISA. All but two clones exhibited substantial binding to immobilized P. chabaudi AMA-1. This is in contrast to 24 random clones selected from the unpanned library, none of which showed significant binding activity (Fig.2). To produce soluble scFv, E. coli HB2151 cells were infected with phage obtained after four rounds of panning (R4 phage). Recognition of the amber stop codon between the scFv and the M13 gene III protein resulted in the production of soluble scFv by this strain of E. coli. The soluble scFvs are directed to the periplasmic space by an NH2-terminal gene III protein leader sequence. Incorporation of a small peptide epitope (an E-tag) at the COOH-terminal end of the scFv allows detection with an anti E-tag antibody. Upon induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, an immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of about 34 kDa was detected in the periplasmic extracts from E. coli infected with R4 phage (Fig.3). This represents the pool of scFvs enriched by panning. A band of similar size was also observed in the bacterial growth medium, indicating that there was some leakage of the scFvs from the periplasm (data not shown). The periplasmic extract prepared from HB2151 cells infected with R4 phage contained functional scFv polypeptides that bound to P. chabaudi AMA-1 and could discriminate between P. chabaudi AMA-1 and BSA even at a 1:1,000 dilution of the periplasmic extract (Fig. 4 A). This specificity was also obvious when P. chabaudi AMA-1 and BSA were probed with scFvs in immunoblotting experiments (Fig.4 B). Periplasmic extracts prepared from bacteria infected with R3 phage (i.e. isolated after three rounds of panning) showed less binding to P. chabaudi AMA-1. Soluble scFvs prepared from the unpanned phage library did not bind to P. chabaudi AMA-1 (Fig. 4 B). The culture supernatant also contain functional scFvs that specifically recognize P. chabaudi AMA-1 (Fig. 5 A,lane 3).Figure 5R4 scFv bind specifically to conformational epitopes on P. chabaudi AMA-1. Panel A, periplasmic extracts (lane 1), whole cell extracts (lane 2), and supernatants (lane 3) from E. coli HB2151 containing phagemid from R4 clones were incubated with nitrocellulose filters on which P. chabaudi AMA-1, P. falciparum AMA-1, and BSA had been adsorbed. Panel B, periplasmic extracts were incubated with nitrocellulose filters containing P. chabaudi AMA-1 transferred after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run under both nonreducing conditions (lane 1) and reducing conditions (lane 2). Detection of bound scFv was achieved by using an anti-E-tag antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The binding characteristics of the scFvs obtained from four rounds of panning (R4 scFv) were examined in further detail by immunoblot analysis. The pool of R4 scFv antibodies bound specifically to AMA-1 from P. chabaudi but, under the conditions of this experiment, was unable to recognize P. falciparum AMA-1 (Fig. 5 A) even though the ectodomains of these molecules share 48% homology at the amino acid level. Importantly, the scFvs also discriminate between the nonreduced and reduced forms of P. chabaudi AMA-1 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively), indicating that the selected scFvs recognize conformational epitopes stabilized by disulfide bonds in the refolded P. chabaudi AMA-1. It is interesting to note that the serum of the mice that were used in the construction of the library contained antibodies that recognize reduced AMA-1, as well as antibodies that recognize folded AMA-1 (data not shown). The enrichment strategy used in the production of the scFvs involves panning on the refolded antigen, which appears to select scFvs recognizing reduction-sensitive epitopes. Because the above studies were performed on the enriched pool of scFv antibodies it was important to examine the binding characteristics of individual scFvs. Periplasmic extracts, containing soluble scFvs, were prepared from individual colonies after four rounds of panning. Each cloned scFv showed specific binding to P. chabaudi AMA-1 (Fig. 6). None of the scFv clones showed any binding to BSA (not shown). The scFv inserts from 50 clones (R4) were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers to the flanking vector sequence. Digestion of the products with BstNI, which cuts mammalian DNA frequently, enabled the assignment of clones into various groups defined by the pattern of restriction fragments. The 50 clones from the R4-selected phage gave a restricted set of digestion patterns, and each clone could be assigned to one of four groups designated scAMA-A, scAMA-B, scAMA-C, and scAMA-D (for s ingle chain antibody to AMA-1). Ten clones selected at random from the unpanned library each showed unique BstNI restriction patterns (data not shown). The majority of clones (43/50) were assigned to the scAMA-A group, possibly indicating that this group of scFvs has the highest binding affinity. To determine the fine specificity of individual recombinant antibodies, we performed dot-blot analysis of single clones from scAMA-A, -B, and -C group antibodies using three different AMA-1 molecules. As expected, all three antibodies recognized AMA-1 from the P. chabaudiDS strain used to pan the phage display library (Fig.7). There was, however, no detectable binding of any of the antibodies to AMA-1 from the heterologous 556KA strain of P. chabaudi (Fig. 7, middle row). By contrast, the serum of the donor mice did react with AMA-1 from P. chabaudi 556KA (data not shown). Interestingly, the clone representing the scAMA-B group showed strong binding to P. falciparum AMA-1. The scFvs from the scAMA-C group recognized this heterologous antigen to a lesser extent, whereas the scAMA-A scFvs, the major contributor to the R4 pool of scFv antibodies, only recognized P. chabaudi DS AMA-1. These data indicate that the four rounds of panning have enriched for a subset of scFv which recognizes P. chabaudi AMA-1 and that scFvs with distinct antibody specificities have been obtained. The nucleotide sequences encoding the VH and VLchains were determined from at least two representative clones from each group, with the exception of scAMA-D, for which only one clone was obtained. The deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig.8. Sequencing of different clones within the scAMA-B group revealed two sequences that differed by six nucleotides (the alternative sequence is designated scAMA-B*). Five of these nucleotide substitutions would cause amino acid substitutions (Fig. 8). Thus, five unique heavy chains have been selected which can participate in binding to P. chabaudi AMA-1. As expected, the majority of the diversity is contained within the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the VH chain, which varies both in sequence and in length. The DNA sequences from both the VH and VL were searched against the Kabat data base using the BLAST algorithm and were shown to be novel sequences. The V gene, D segment, and J segment usage for the four scFv groups were analyzed by IMGT data base searching via the World Wide Web, and the results are shown in Table I.

Ca2+-ATPase couples active Ca2+ transport to the hydrolysis of ATP. A simplified form of its reaction cycle is shown in Fig.1. Ca2+ is bound from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to high affinity binding sites of the ATPase (left-hand step in Fig. 1); ATP then phosphorylates the ATPase (upper step in Fig. 1), which occludes the bound Ca2+ ions in the protein. Subsequently, the phosphoenzyme converts from the ADP-sensitive to the ADP-insensitive form, and Ca2+ is released into the SR lumen (right-hand step in Fig. 1). Hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoenzyme completes the reaction cycle (bottom step in Fig. 1). For reviews see Refs. 1Andersen J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Georg H. Barth A. Kreutz W. Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that the infrared absorbance changes of these two reaction steps can be separated temporally using time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). With the high quality FTIR spectra now obtained in real time, we can unambiguously show that it is the phosphoenzyme conversion and Ca2+ release step that reverses most of the structural changes induced by Ca2+ binding to the unphosphorylated ATPase. The resulting implications for the Ca2+ transport mechanism will be discussed. Samples for time-resolved infrared spectroscopy of the Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P reaction were prepared as described previously (9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by removal of free water from an SR suspension in a stream of nitrogen. Samples were immediately rehydrated with 20% Me2SO in H2O or 2H2O. This method resulted in active ATPase samples (5Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Approximate concentrations were 0.7 mm ATPase, 300 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glutathione, 20 mm caged ATP, 0.5 mg/ml A23187, 2 mg/ml adenylate kinase, 20% Me2SO in approximately 1 μl of sample volume. Approximately 2–3 mm ATP were released per flash. Time-resolved FTIR measurements of the Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P reaction were performed with a modified Bruker IFS 66 spectrometer as described previously (9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Difference spectra for the reaction were obtained by subtracting a spectrum recorded 3.3–11 (H2O) or 11–19 s (2H2O) after photolysis of caged ATP from a spectrum recorded between 88 and 146 s (H2O and2H2O) and were normalized as described (9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded at 1 °C. Difference spectra of Ca2+ release from the unphosphorylated ATPase were obtained from experiments originally monitoring Ca2+ binding at 25 °C at pH 7.0 after the release of Ca2+ from DM-nitrophen (8Georg H. Barth A. Kreutz W. Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but were processed in a different way for a better comparison with the conversion spectra; the spectrum after Ca2+ release from DM-nitrophen was subtracted from the spectrum beforeCa2+ release. These spectra then represent the absorbance of the Ca2+-free state E minus the absorbance of Ca2 E 1 and thus the Ca2+release reaction from the unphosphorylated ATPase Ca2 E 1 → E. Infrared bands due to the photolysis reaction were subtracted as described (8Georg H. Barth A. Kreutz W. Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Difference spectra were normalized to equal protein content by normalizing spectra measured in H2O to an amide II absorbance of 0.26 (difference in absorbance between 1546 and 1492 cm−1) and spectra measured in 2H2O to an amide I absorbance of 0.47 (difference in absorbance between 1706 and 1648 cm−1). Fig. 2 shows infrared difference spectra of Ca2+ release from the unphosphorylated (Ca2 E 1 → E,dotted lines) and the phosphorylated ATPase (Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P, solid lines) in H2O (Fig. 2 A) and 2H2O (Fig.2 B). Negative bands are characteristic for the states Ca2 E 1 and Ca2 E 1-P, positive bands for the Ca2+ free states E and E 2-P. For Ca2+ release from the phosphoenzyme we note that the spectra show the overall transition from Ca2 E 1-P to E 2-P. The term Ca2+ release therefore refers to the overall Ca2+ transfer from Ca2 E 1-P to the SR lumen. Putative intermediates in this reaction, such as a Ca2+ form of the ADP insensitive phosphoenzyme Ca2 E 2-P were not detected in our former experiments and if they exist are only short-lived intermediates (9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The spectral range shown in Fig. 2 covers the absorption region of the C=O mode of protonated carboxyl groups (1800–1700 cm−1), the νas COO− mode of unprotonated carboxyl groups (1610–1540 cm−1 in water in the presence of counterions (15Tackett J.E. Appl. Spectrosc. 1989; 43: 483-489Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the amide I (1700–1610 cm−1) and the amide II (1580–1520 cm−1) mode of the polypeptide backbone. Other amino acid side chains may contribute to the signals below 1700 cm−1. Thus, the difference spectra are expected to reveal backbone secondary structure changes as well as perturbations of the putative Ca2+ ligating carboxyl groups (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Their vibrational frequencies are sensitive to the mode by which carboxylates bind ions (15Tackett J.E. Appl. Spectrosc. 1989; 43: 483-489Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 16Deacon G.B. Phillips R.J. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1980; 33: 227-250Crossref Scopus (4841) Google Scholar, 17Nara M. Tasumi M. Tanokura M. Hiraoki T. Yazawa M. Tsutsumi A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (i.e. unidentate, bidentate, and bridging), and their extinction coefficient is relatively high (18Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 19Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), making them ideal reporter groups for events at the Ca2+ binding sites. Therefore, band shifts upon Ca2+ release are expected in the region of the νas COO− vibration (around 1570 cm−1). In addition, protonated carboxyl groups absorb in the 1700–1800 cm−1 region without interference by bands of other groups, which makes the assignment straightforward. Signals in the difference spectra of ATPase partial reactions have been tentatively assigned to Ca2+ release from carboxylate groups (at 1570/1554 cm−1) and protonation of at least two carboxylate groups (at 1758 and 1710 cm−1) (7Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Troullier A. Gerwert K. Dupont Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2970-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, spectra of Ca2+ release are remarkably similar irrespective of whether or not the ATPase is phosphorylated (compare solid and dotted lines in Fig. 2). However, some differences are observed between the two types of Ca2+ release spectra, which we discuss first before turning to the implications of the similarities. Differences between the Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P and the Ca2 E 1 → E spectra are expected because release from the unphosphorylated ATPase is to the cytoplasm, whereas release from the phosphoenzyme is toward the SR lumen. Furthermore, the Ca2+ binding sites of Ca2 E 1 and Ca2 E 1-P are different in that the binding site of Ca2 E 1 is accessible from the cytoplasm, whereas the bound Ca2+ in Ca2 E 1-P is occluded and the affinity for Ca2+ may be different in the two enzyme states. Totally unrelated spectra may be expected if Ca2+ release proceeds from binding sites that are different or different in structure in Ca2 E 1 and Ca2 E 1-P, i.e. if ATPase phosphorylation moves the Ca2+ ions from one set of binding sites to another or if it changes the structure. However, there is only one major difference between the two types of release spectra, found between 1650 and 1620 cm−1, and some subtle differences at 1689 cm−1 (H2O), 1580 cm−1(2H2O) and 1555 cm−1(H2O and 2H2O). They point to structural differences between E and E 2-P as well as between Ca2 E 1 and Ca2 E 1-P, which are associated with the Ca2+ release reactions. In addition, the different conditions under which the two types of experiment were performed may also contribute to the differences: (i) A regulatory ATP molecule is bound to the two forms of the phosphoenzyme (7Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which are monitored after ATP release but not to the unphosphorylated ATPase, because there is no ATP present in these experiments. (ii) Experiments with the phosphorylated ATPase were done in the presence of Me2SO, A23187, and adenylate kinase, none of which were present in the experiments with unphosphorylated ATPase. The buffer used in the latter experiments was MOPS containing KCl at 25 °C, whereas imidazole without KCl at 1 °C was used in the former. Given the number of factors that could result in differences in the Ca2+ release spectra, the overall similarity of the spectra is striking. Nearly all positive and negative bands are found at approximately the same wavenumber in both types of Ca2+release spectra, and this holds for H2O and2H2O. As each of the bands corresponds to a particular change in structure and interaction, we conclude that parallel secondary structure changes and parallel alterations of amino acid side chain interactions take place in the two Ca2+release reactions Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P and Ca2 E 1 → E. To put it differently, during enzyme turnover most of the structural changes induced by Ca2+ binding to the unphosphorylated ATPase are reversed upon phosphoenzyme conversion and Ca2+ release to the SR lumen, thus confirming our previous interpretation (7Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Georg H. Barth A. Kreutz W. Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Buchet, Martonosi, and co-workers have reached a different conclusion (11Buchet R. Jona I. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Buchet R. Jona I. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Martonosi A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Martonosi A.N. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 263-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) by focusing attention on a positive band at 1650 cm−1 and its negative side bands in ATP-induced difference spectra. These spectra were assigned to the Ca2 E 1 → Ca2 E 1-P transition, which is supported by the lack of the E 2-P marker bands at 1750, 1616 (shoulder), and 1552 cm−1 (7Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Buchet, Martonosi, and co-workers suggest that the bands near 1650 cm−1 in the Ca2 E 1 → Ca2 E 1-P spectra represent the reversal of structural changes induced by Ca2+ binding E → Ca2 E 1. We have shown (7Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that the ATP-induced 1650 cm−1 band is already present upon nucleotide binding and increases further in intensity upon phosphorylation as well as upon phosphoenzyme conversion and Ca2+ release. It is tempting to speculate that this band represents a structural transition proceeding stepwise in one direction in these consecutive reactions. Therefore, it seems difficult to assign the reversal of Ca2+ induced changes observed near 1650 cm−1 to only one of these steps. On the other hand, the intensities at 1650 cm−1 in Fig. 2 approximately match, thus arguing in favor of a reversal of the associated conformational changes in the conversion and Ca2+ release step, in line with most other changes as discussed above. The similarity of the spectra of Ca2+ release from the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated ATPase sheds some light on the Ca2+ binding sites of the different enzyme states. Nearly all of the negative bands and minima in Fig. 2, which are characteristic for the Ca2+ loaded forms Ca2 E 1 and Ca2 E 1-P, are found in both Ca2+ release spectra. Therefore, characteristic structural features of the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites of Ca2 E 1 are also present in Ca2 E 1-P, comprising elements of secondary structure and aspects of the Ca2+ binding mode (see above). This suggests that after phosphorylation Ca2+remains bound to the same sites in Ca2 E 1-P as it was in Ca2 E 1, in agreement with site-directed mutagenesis studies (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the model of Jencks and co-workers (20Jencks W.P. Yang T. Peisach D. Myung J.

In particular, in both Ca2+ release reactions signals of at least two protonated carboxyl groups are observed (bands at 1758 and 1710 cm−1). In principle, these signals may originate from the protonation of carboxyl groups or from a change in the environment of already protonated carboxyl groups. The latter seems to be unlikely, because it would lead to a shift in the vibrational frequency and therefore to negative and positive bands in the 1700–1800 cm−1 region of the difference spectrum, of which the negative bands are not observed. Therefore, we think that at least two carboxyl groups of E and E 2-P become protonated in both Ca2+ release reactions. They are first discussed for the unphosphorylated ATPase. Ca2+ binding to the unphosphorylated ATPase E→ Ca2 E 1 is accompanied by H+ release, and the protonated residues have been associated with the Ca2+ binding sites and proton countertransport (3Inesi G.

At pH 7.0 and 25 °C, the conditions for recording the Ca2 E 1 → E spectra, there seems to be either an equilibrium of species holding one or three protons at the Ca2+ binding sites (22Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the predominant species holds two protons (27Martin R.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 59-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Proton ejection during enzyme turnover has been observed at 25 °C and pH 6–8 (23Levy D. Seigneuret M. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19524-19534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yu X. Hao L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16656-16661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed (29de Meis L. Vianna A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) that the Ca2+ binding sites become accessible for high affinity binding from the cytoplasm only after a conformational change of the Ca2+ free enzyme, which switches the accessibility from the lumen to the cytoplasm. However, several partial reactions involving the cytoplasmic high affinity sites are unaffected by 20–40 mm lumenal Ca2+ (26Henderson I.M.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Myung J. Jencks W.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Myung J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8775-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that such a transition may not occur. The Ca2+/H+ exchange at the high affinity sites for Ca2+ is expected to be detected in the infrared difference spectrum, which was recorded under similar conditions (see above). As the most straightforward interpretation of the protonation signals of carboxyl groups seen in the Ca2 E 1 → E spectra, we therefore suggest that these carboxyl groups are those that participate in the Ca2+/H+ exchange and tentatively assign them to residues within the high affinity binding sites. The high affinity binding sites are thought to be located in the transmembrane region of the Ca2+-ATPase (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and to be in a hydrophobic environment (32Pick U. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with this we find that one of the protonated carboxyl groups has a vibrational frequency characteristic of a nonhydrogen-bonded carbonyl group (1758 cm−1) (8Georg H. Barth A. Kreutz W. Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,10Troullier A. Gerwert K. Dupont Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2970-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The frequency of the second protonated carboxyl group (1710 cm−1) indicates that it is hydrogen-bonded (8Georg H. Barth A. Kreutz W. Siebert F. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Troullier A. Gerwert K. Dupont Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2970-2983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This, however, does not necessarily mean that it is in a hydrophilic environment, because the hydrogen bond donor may be a protein residue in an otherwise hydrophobic protein environment. Ca2+ uptake is paralleled by lumenal alkalinization, which has been attributed to proton binding to E2-P (33Yamaguchi M. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4896-4900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Steiner M. Bauer H. Krassnigg F. Schill W.-B. Adam H. Clin. Chem.

Biophys. 1979; 193: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because this has been observed at 4 °C, pH 6.0–6.4 (33Yamaguchi M. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4896-4900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi M. Kanazawa T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19524-19534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Yu X. Carrol S. Rigaud J.-L. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1232-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), conditions not far removed from the 1 °C, pH 7.0 used to record the Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P spectra, we suggest that the protons responsible for the protonation signals of E 2-P in these spectra (Fig. 2) are those that cause lumenal alkalinization and therefore originate from the lumen. Protonation of protein residues of E 2-P has been found to increase the stability of the phosphoenzyme (39Inesi G. Lewis D. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 996-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to ensure the low affinity for Ca2+ (40de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4253-4261Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 41de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1289-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may well be that the protonated carboxyl groups that we detect in the conversion spectra mediate both effects. The C=O bands of the two (or more) protonated carboxyl groups of E and E 2-P are observed at the same characteristic wavenumbers in the difference spectra, clearly indicating that each group experiences a hydrogen bonding strength that is the same in E and E 2-P. This coincidence strongly suggests that the same amino acid residues become protonated in the two enzyme states. For E, they have been associated with the high affinity binding sites (see above). For E 2-P, we therefore propose that residues that form the high affinity sites of Ca2 E 1 become protonated when Ca2+ is released from the phosphoenzyme Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P. This requires that lumenal protons have access to these residues during this reaction via a proton conducting network or a channel. In the latter case Ca2+ would probably also have access to these residues, which then would be involved in high as well as low affinity binding of Ca2+. The above line of argument concludes from the identical positions of the two bands in both Ca2+ release reactions that the same two carboxyl groups are involved in proton binding to E and E 2-P and locates them in the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites of Ca2 E 1. They are thought to be those Ca2+ ligands that are involved in the H+/Ca2+ exchange. Pursuing this, one might look for possible candidates that meet the criterion of participating in both, Ca2+ and H+ binding. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified several carboxyl groups that are thought to be Ca2+ ligands of the high affinity binding site: Glu309, Glu771, Asp800, and perhaps Glu908 (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Of these, only Glu309 and Glu771 seem to be crucial for phosphoenzyme hydrolysis E 2-P → E, and this has been explained with their possible role in proton binding to E 2-P and proton countertransport (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because these residues seem to bind protons in the E 2-P state and Ca2+ in Ca2 E 1and Ca2 E 1-P, they are likely candidates for the carboxyl groups that give rise to the protonation signals in the Ca2 E 1 →E and Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P spectra. As a working hypothesis, we therefore tentatively assign the two protonation signals in both Ca2+ release spectra to Glu309 and Glu771. A definite assignment would require studies with site-directed mutants, which are presently not available in the quantities needed for infrared experiments. The simplest model consistent with our data would assume only one pair of Ca2+ binding sites on the ATPase, serving both Ca2+ translocation and H+ countertransport. However, more complicated models with two pairs of binding sites cannot be ruled out (reviewed in Refs. 2Mintz E. Guillain F. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and 13Martonosi A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results then require that residues of the high affinity binding sites have access to lumenal protons at some stage of the Ca2+ release reaction Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P."
https://openalex.org/W2090980544,"Previously we demonstrated that transmembrane back insertion of glycophorin A, a solubilizable intrinsic protein, can be obtained in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar vesicles, MLVs, by electropulsation (Raffy, S., and Teissié, J. (1995)Eur. J. Biochem. 230, 722–732). Here we report that transmembrane back insertion of protein is obtained by electropulsion of unilamellar giant vesicles, termed interdigitation-fusion vesicles (IFVs), which are better membrane models than MLVs due to their unilamellarity. Electropulsation promotes a field-dependent local permeabilization of the lipid layer, as shown by the associated leakage of entrapped calcein. Glycophorin insertion is assayed by immunofluorescence. Electroinsertion is obtained by pulsing the vesicle/protein mixture. Glycophorin insertion is observed under more drastic electrical conditions than needed for permeabilization. Direct observation of glycophorin insertion in the vesicles under a microscope shows a localized process in agreement with the theoretical prediction. A quantitative evaluation of the immunofluorescence pattern shows that insertion was higher on one side of the vesicle than on the other. This suggests that an electrophoretic movement of the solubilized glycophorin could take place during electropulsation. Insertion of glycophorin, a prefolded intrinsic protein, is then obtained in the lipid bilayer brought transiently to the electropermeabilized state. Previously we demonstrated that transmembrane back insertion of glycophorin A, a solubilizable intrinsic protein, can be obtained in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar vesicles, MLVs, by electropulsation (Raffy, S., and Teissié, J.

Insertion of glycophorin, a prefolded intrinsic protein, is then obtained in the lipid bilayer brought transiently to the electropermeabilized state. Spontaneous insertion of integral membrane proteins across lipid bilayers is unlikely from a thermodynamic point of view (1Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 247-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Repulsion of polar fragments prevent their transfer as long as structural disorganization of the lipid matrix is not present, at least transiently (2Jain M.K. Zakim D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 33-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This was associated with a permeabilized state of the membrane (2Jain M.K. Zakim D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 33-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An experimental evaluation of these effects was still missing. The organization of lipid layers is under the control of the transmembrane potential (3Neumann E. Neumann E. Sowers A.E Jordan C. Electroporation and Electrofusion in Cell Biology. Plenum Press, New York1989: 61-82Crossref Google Scholar). It is now well established that electric field-induced transient permeabilization is due to the field-mediated membrane potential difference increase (3Neumann E. Neumann E. Sowers A.E Jordan C. Electroporation and Electrofusion in Cell Biology. Plenum Press, New York1989: 61-82Crossref Google Scholar). Permeabilization is observed when this electrical parameter is higher than 200 mV (4Teissié J. Rols M.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65 (0): 409-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Electropermeabilization of lipid bilayers has been described both in lipid vesicles (5Teissié J. Tsong T.Y.

The behavior of lipid vesicles is rather similar to what was observed in cells (13Chernomordik L.V. Sukharev S.I. Popov S.V. Pastushenko V.F. Sokirko A.V. Abidor I.G. Chizmadzhev Yu Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 360-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), i.e. permeabilization was reversible, a fusogenic state was induced (14Hub H.H. Zimmermann U. Ringsdorf H.

Sokolov A.V. Budker V.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Permeabilization was shown to be a very transient phenomenon in pure lipid systems, while it is long lived in cells (19Benz R. Zimmermann U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 640: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).31P NMR spectroscopy showed that the polar heads of phospholipid bilayers were transiently tilted during the electric pulse with very fast relaxation (20Stulen G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 640: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such tilting was observed in electropermeabilized mammalian cells but with a very long lifetime (21Lopez A. Rols M.P. Teissié J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1222-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The difference in the lifetime of this structural change between pure lipid systems and mammalian cell membranes was due to stabilization of the permeabilized state by the cytoskeleton in viable cells (22Rols M.P. Teissié J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is therefore clear that, even if a strong analogy is present in the basic process of electropermeabilization of pure lipid layers and of cell membranes, differences are present, showing that proteins play a role in cells and that electropermeabilization is not just punching “holes” in the lipid matrix. A key step nevertheless affects phospholipids. Studies have reported the so-called “electroinsertion” of proteins, having a membrane spanning sequence, such as glycophorin and CD4, into eukaryotic cell membranes by exposing the cell suspension to electric field pulses (23Mouneimne Y. Tosi P.F. Gazitt Y. Nicolau C. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Mouneimne Y. Tosi P.F. Barhoumi R. Nicolau C. Biochim. Biophys.

The insertion took place only in the “electropermeabilized” part of the cell surface (27El Ouagari K. Gabriel B. Benoist H. Teissié J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28El Ouagari K. Benoist H. Sixou S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochim. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This observation means that the structural modification associated with electropermeabilization has brought the membrane organization to a new state in which spontaneous insertion occurs. Localized perturbation of the polar head group region of phospholipids, which supports the transient permeabilization of lipid bilayers, allows spontaneous trans-insertion of glycophorin across the lipid bilayers in the case of multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) 1The abbreviations used are: MLV, multilamellar vesicle; DPPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; IFV, interdigitation-fusion vesicle; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 1The abbreviations used are: MLV, multilamellar vesicle; DPPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; IFV, interdigitation-fusion vesicle; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.

Biochem. 1972; 41: 753-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) as pertinent models for biological membranes more than 20 years ago. Over the years, a variety of methods have been developed to form liposomes of different types: small or large, unilamellar or multilamellar (31Szoka F.C. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). MLVs are probably the easiest liposomes to prepare. Due to their multilayered character, they have rather low capture volumes, exclude solute, and are heterogeneous in size. MLVs are a rather crude model of a cell because they have many closely packed lipid bilayers. Small vesicles obtained by sonication of MLVs are too small to be pertinent models of cells. Dramatic tensions in the membrane are present due to the small diameters. Because liposomes are used as model systems to study basic membrane properties, an ideal liposome must have a homogeneous cell size population with a single bilayer. Consequently, the ideal liposome is a very large unilamellar vesicle with a diameter larger than 1 μm. Several methods for preparation of such liposomes have been reported (31Szoka F.C. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar, 32Oku N. MacDonald R.C. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983; 734: 54-61Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), yielding either very small liposomes (20–200 nm) or mixtures of unilamellar and multilamellar liposomes (≤1 μm) (33Hargreaves H.D. Deamer D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 17: 3759-3768Google Scholar, 34Antanavage J. Biophys J. 1978; 21: A1224Google Scholar), or a few vesicles which are partially or completely filled internally with smaller unilamellar vesicles (14Hub H.H. Zimmermann U. Ringsdorf H. FEBS Lett. 1982; 140: 254-260Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Swelling of planar lipid layers spread on glass slides gives giant vesicles but only in pure water (35Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 73: 49-60Google Scholar). Recently, a new method has been described to make liposomes of high capture volume from saturated chain lipids under transition temperature (T m) (36Perkins W.R. Minchey S.R. Ahl P.L. Janoff A.S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 64: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These liposomes, termed interdigitation-fusion vesicles (IFVs), arise from an interdigitation-induced fusion of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). These liposomes are large and predominately unilamellar vesicles. They can be prepared in ion-containing buffers. IFVs are useful as model systems for drug carriers, since their large internal volume allows for efficient encapsulation (37Seltzer S.E. Blau M. Herman L.W. Hooshmand R.L. Hermann L.A. Adams D.F.

In this work, we have studied electropermeabilization and glycophorin A electroinsertion in giant unilamellar lipid systems. IFVs were used to obtain cell-sized liposomes and because the medium can be changed easily. We selected lecithin vesicles made from synthetic,i.e. chemically pure, saturated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), which was previously shown to be electropermeabilized when in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (5Teissié J.

Its primary structure shows a large glycosylated external domain, then a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids with a transmembraneous helical conformation and a cytoplasmic fragment. Despite its intrinsic character, this protein can be isolated from the membrane without the use of detergent due to its high ionic charge. For that reason, it is very often used in studies on lipid-protein interactions (39Ahl P.L. Chen L. Perkins W.R. Minchey S.R. Boni L.T. Taraschi T.F. Janoff A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This study shows that electropulsation can insert glycophorin into giant unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicles and demonstrates protein electroinsertion in unilamellar lipid systems. DPPC (reference P5911), calcein (reference C1075), and glycophorin A (reference G5017) were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody antiglycophorin A (reference 0167) and fluorescein-labeled goat polyclonal antibody to mouse IgG(H + L)F(ab′) (reference 0819) were purchased from Immunotech SA (France). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water from a Millipore Milli-Q unit (Millipore, France) was used for the preparation of the buffers. IFVs were prepared as described by Ahl et al. (39Ahl P.L. Chen L. Perkins W.R. Minchey S.R. Boni L.T. Taraschi T.F. Janoff A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 10 mg of phospholipids were dissolved in glass redistilled optical grade chloroform and then evaporated under vacuum to complete dryness. 1 ml of 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was added, and then the hydrated lipid samples were incubated for 10 min in buffer at 55 °C,i.e. above the phospholipid T m (41 ± 1 °C) to ensure formation of intact vesicles. SUVs were made by sonicating (Vibra cell, Bioblock Scientific) MLV samples above the T m for 3 min, until optically clear. Titanium dust produced by the sonicator tip was removed from the sample by centrifugation (15 min at 1600 × g in a Jouan centrifuge, France). A volume of absolute ethanol was added to bring the final ethanol concentration in the sample to 4 m. The samples were immediately vortexed. This procedure generally quickly transformed the transparent SUV suspension into an extremely viscous, opaque white suspension of interdigitated phospholipid sheets. After the addition of ethanol, the samples were sealed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, then incubated for 15 min at 55 °C,i.e. again above the T m of the lipid. The caps of the sample vials were then loosened to allow ethanol evaporation, and the incubations were continued for another 30 min at the same temperature. After this time, the samples were bubbled above the T m by a gentle stream of N2 to remove ethanol. Next, they were washed three times with 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at room temperature by 15-min centrifugations at 12,000 × g using a Sorvall centrifuge equipped with a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The vesicles were stored at 4 °C. It was difficult to observe these unilamellar vesicles under a phase contrast microscope, as reported previously (40Stoicheva N.G. Hui S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IFVs were mixed with a 10 μm 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) solution in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Emission was observed at 478 nm with an excitation at 377 nm on a spectrofluorimeter (JY3 Jobin Yvon, France). Binding was monitored at 21 °C. The methods were adapted from those previously described (15Teissié J. Rols M.P. Blangero C. Neumann E. Sowers A.E. Jordan C. Electroporation and Electrofusion in Cell Biology. Plenum Press, New York1989: 203-214Crossref Google Scholar). Electropulsation was operated by use of a CNRS cell electropulsator (Jouan, France). It delivered square-wave pulses whose parameters (voltage, pulse duration, number of pulses, and delays between pulses) were all independently adjustable. Two flat stainless-steel parallel electrodes, with an anode-cathode distance of 1.5 mm connected to the voltage generator, gave a uniform electric field for a 30-μl volume. The pulse field intensity kept a constant value during the pulse, whatever the pulsing buffer composition. The voltage pulse applied to the suspension was monitored with an oscilloscope connected to the cell pulsator. The field intensities were those directly observed on the oscilloscope. Due to the associated Joule heating, it was not possible to use pulse intensities higher than 7.5 kV/cm and/or a buffer with a high ionic content. Calcein efflux was used to monitor permeabilization. A similar procedure was used in our previous study with MLVs (8Raffy S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). IFVs were prepared in a 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer to which calcein (2.5 mm) was added. After IFV formation, external dye was washed out in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) while internalized dye molecules remained trapped inside the vesicles. Just after application of the pulses, the vesicles were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 ×g, and the vesicle supernatant (50 μl) was diluted in 2 ml of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer. Fluorescence intensity of the supernatant was measured on a spectrofluorimeter (JY3 Jobin Yvon, France) with λexc = 496 nm and λem = 520 nm. Permeabilization was quantified through fluorescence intensity. Glycophorin A is soluble in aqueous solution, perhaps as micelles, after its extraction from red blood cells by a detergent-free method (41Springer G.F. Nagai Y. Tegtmeyer H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3254-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 5 μl of glycophorin A, at a 2 mg/ml concentration in Hepes 1 mm, was added to 50 μl of IFVs (10 mg/ml). The methods were adapted from those previously described in the case of red blood cells or CHO cells (23Mouneimne Y. Tosi P.F. Gazitt Y. Nicolau C. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27El Ouagari K. Gabriel B. Benoist H. Teissié J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, i.e. below the transition temperature of the lipids, the electrical pulses were applied. Immediately after the pulses, the vesicles were washed three times with Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The final pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 °C with 5 μl of 0.2 mg/ml anti-human glycophorin monoclonal antibody for 30 min. They were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated with 5 μl of 1 mg/ml fluorescein-labeled goat polyclonal antibody to mouse IgG(H + L)F(ab′)2 at 37 °C for 30 additional minutes. The IFVs were finally washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The enhancement of the fluorescent signal was quantified by spectrofluorimetry (λexc = 487 nm and λem = 520 nm) on a Jobin Yvon JY3 spectrofluorimeter. Control samples in which vesicles had been subjected to all steps, except electrical pulses, were used as references for each corresponding case. Another control was carried out without fluorescein- labeled goat polyclonal antibody. Liposomes were observed under a Leitz Fluovert fluorescence inverted microscope. A 63× oil immersion objective was used to observe the vesicles. The fluorescence emission was detected by a light-intensifying camera (Lhesa, France) associated with a black and white monitor. The video images were digitized. The Optimas software (Imasys, France) was used for image treatment. This software contains the major routines for digital image processing. All images were corrected for background signal and for illumination heterogeneity (42Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallah D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6168) Google Scholar, 43Teissié J. Gabriel B. Montané M.H. Rouan D. NATO ASI Ser. Ser.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This methodology gives access to a true quantitative, highly sensitive observation of electroinsertion. External fields induce a modulation of the membrane potential difference when applied to vesicles. This field effect ΔV obeys the classical equation at the steady state (3Neumann E. Neumann E. Sowers A.E Jordan C. Electroporation and Electrofusion in Cell Biology. Plenum Press, New York1989: 61-82Crossref Google Scholar) ΔV=fgrEcosθEquation 1 in which f is a shape factor (1.5 in the case of a sphere), g is the associated electrical conductivity of the membrane (here the lipid bilayer); r is the radius of the vesicle; E is the intensity of the applied field, and θ is the angle between the normal of the membrane and the direction of the field. Electropermeabilization is triggered locally when the field-induced membrane potential difference ΔV is larger than a critical threshold ΔV p (4Teissié J. Rols M.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65 (0): 409-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 5Teissié J. Tsong T.Y. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1548-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Electropermeabilization is then triggered for θ = 0 (or Π), i.e. in the parts of the vesicle facing the electrodes, when ΔV is the largest at a given field strength. A field threshold E c is then present given by ΔVp=fgrEcEquation 2 E c is a function of both ΔV p and the cell size. ΔV p is known to be constant for a given system (4Teissié J. Rols M.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65 (0): 409-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A direct consequence is that larger cells are permeabilized at lower intensities than are smaller cells (45Sixou S. Teissié J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The main consequence of electropermeabilization is to permit a free exchange of small molecules and of ions across the plasma membrane. The flow Φ(S, t ) of exchanged molecules (S, i.e. ions, fluorescent dye) at a delay t after the pulse was described by the mathematical expression (46Rols M.P. Teissié J. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) Φ(S,t)=PSΔS(t)X(N,T)1−EcE(exp−(K(T,N)t))Equation 3 in which P S is the permeability coefficient of S when the membrane is permeabilized. K is a parameter describing the membrane resealing that is a function of the nature of the cell (physiological control), N is the number of pulses, T is the pulse duration.X (N, T ) is the probability that permeabilization indeed occurs at a given point in the critical cap of the cell surface where the potential difference is higher than the permeabilizing threshold. It depends on the pulse number and pulse duration. E c is the threshold field and ΔS (t ) is the concentration gradient of S between the internal compartment and the external buffer. The electric field strength controls the geometrical extent of the permeabilization, but the pulse number and duration act as modulating factors affecting the magnitude of the flow,i.e. the membrane perturbation X as well as the lifetime of the phenomenon K −1. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we used a digitized video microscope where the contrast of the object can be increased. Vesicles appeared to be mostly spherical (Fig. 1 A). Due to the problems of observation, we took into account IFVs only with diameters larger than 4.5 μm. The size values were obtained from direct videomicroscopy observation of the vesicle suspension. 100 vesicles per preparation were observed, and this was repeated four times. This gives the distribution shown in Fig. 1 B. The average diameter was 9.3 ± 1.6 μm for IFVs. A value of 5 ± 0.5 μm was obtained for MLVs in our previous study (8Raffy S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). But it has to be reemphasized that a large number of smaller vesicles were present in IFV preparations but were not taken into account in this distribution due to the size distribution threshold we selected. As reported under “Experimental Procedures,” the difficulty of observing the vesicles under a microscope was a good indication of unilamellarity (40Stoicheva N.G. Hui S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To obtain further experimental evidence that the vesicles were unilamellar, the binding of the amphiphilic dye ANS to phospholipid assemblies was studied as reported previously (47Teissié J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission in buffer was negligible. ANS binding to lipid assemblies is associated with a strong increase in its emission. Binding from water to the lipid interface is very fast (48Slavik J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), but despite its amphiphilic character, ANS crosses the lipid layer very slowly. When ANS is added to a lipid dispersion, a very fast increase in emission is then observed followed by a slow increase. The ratio of the amplitudes of the slow to the fast process is indicative of the number of layers in the vesicles. When the ratio is equal to one, the vesicle is unilamellar. In the case of IFVs, an instantaneous fluorescence increase is observed when mixing with ANS solution (Fig.2). A slower increase is then present up to a plateau value, which is reached 5 min after mixing (Fig. 2). The ratio of the amplitudes of the fast to the slow increase is 1. This shows that there are as many binding sites on the outer layer as inside. This conclusion is indicative of the unilamellarity of the IFVs. Calcein-loaded DPPC liposomes were electropulsed with increasing intensity while keeping a constant pulse duration and number (5 × 7 ms). As described above in the theoretical part of the vesicle electropermeabilization, the use of pulses with long duration gives a high level of leakage and should facilitate the detection of events. Calcein was detected in the supernatant when the field intensity was set at 0.3 kV/cm. Above this critical strength, calcein fluorescence in the supernatant,i.e. the dye leakage, was observed to increase with the field intensity (Fig. 3). This observation shows that DPPC IFVs are electropermeabilized when pulses higher than a critical intensity are applied. One should notice that the field threshold value is lower than what we previously observed with DPPC MLVs (1.3 kV/cm) (8Raffy S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Bio"
https://openalex.org/W2049186757,"Abstract A unique mannose-binding lectin, highly specific for terminal Man(α1,3)Man groups, was isolated from bulbs of crocus (Crocus vernus All.). The lectin failed to bind to a mannose affinity column and was purified by simple gel permeation chromatography (Sephacryl S200). The purified lectin, obtained in crystalline form, had a molecular mass of 44 kDa on gel filtration and showed a single peptide band with a molecular mass of 11 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating it to be a tetrameric protein composed of four identical subunits. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the crocus lectin showed essentially no homology with that of other mannose-binding bulb lectins. The crocus lectin selectively interacted with the wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other mannans carrying terminal Man(α1,3)Man but not with those lacking this disaccharide unit. In hapten inhibition studies, methyl α-mannopyranoside did not inhibit the mannan-lectin interaction. Of various α-mannooligosaccharides, those having the Man(α1,3)Man sequence showed the highest inhibitory potency, confirming the strict requirement of lectin for terminal α1,3-linked mannosylmannose units. An affinity column of immobilized lectin enabled the complete resolution of yeast mannan and glycogen. The immobilized lectin may provide a useful tool for purification and analysis of biologically important polysaccharides and glycoproteins."
