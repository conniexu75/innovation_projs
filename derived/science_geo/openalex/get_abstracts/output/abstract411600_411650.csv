https://openalex.org/W2094212509,"Whole genome sequencing of viruses directly from clinical samples is integral for understanding the genetics of host-virus interactions. Here, we report the use of sample sparing target enrichment (by hybridisation) for viral nucleic acid separation and deep-sequencing of herpesvirus genomes directly from a range of clinical samples including saliva, blood, virus vesicles, cerebrospinal fluid, and tumour cell lines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by deep-sequencing 13 highly cell-associated human herpesvirus genomes and generating full length genome alignments at high read depth. Moreover, we show the specificity of the method enables the study of viral population structures and their diversity within a range of clinical samples types."
https://openalex.org/W2073156337,"Benthic primary producers in marine ecosystems may significantly alter biogeochemical cycling and microbial processes in their surrounding environment. To examine these interactions, we studied dissolved organic matter release by dominant benthic taxa and subsequent microbial remineralization in the lagoonal reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release were assessed for several common benthic reef organisms from the backreef habitat. We assessed microbial community response to dissolved exudates of each benthic producer by measuring bacterioplankton growth, respiration, and DOC drawdown in two-day dark dilution culture incubations. Experiments were conducted for six benthic producers: three species of macroalgae (each representing a different algal phylum: Turbinaria ornata – Ochrophyta; Amansia rhodantha – Rhodophyta; Halimeda opuntia – Chlorophyta), a mixed assemblage of turf algae, a species of crustose coralline algae (Hydrolithon reinboldii) and a dominant hermatypic coral (Porites lobata). Our results show that all five types of algae, but not the coral, exuded significant amounts of labile DOC into their surrounding environment. In general, primary producers with the highest rates of photosynthesis released the most DOC and yielded the greatest bacterioplankton growth; turf algae produced nearly twice as much DOC per unit surface area than the other benthic producers (14.0±2.8 µmol h−1 dm−2), stimulating rapid bacterioplankton growth (0.044±0.002 log10 cells h−1) and concomitant oxygen drawdown (0.16±0.05 µmol L−1 h−1 dm−2). Our results demonstrate that benthic reef algae can release a significant fraction of their photosynthetically-fixed carbon as DOC, these release rates vary by species, and this DOC is available to and consumed by reef associated microbes. These data provide compelling evidence that benthic primary producers differentially influence reef microbial dynamics and biogeochemical parameters (i.e., DOC and oxygen availability, bacterial abundance and metabolism) in coral reef communities."
https://openalex.org/W2136326394,"Members of the genus Xenorhabdus are entomopathogenic bacteria that associate with nematodes. The nematode-bacteria pair infects and kills insects, with both partners contributing to insect pathogenesis and the bacteria providing nutrition to the nematode from available insect-derived nutrients. The nematode provides the bacteria with protection from predators, access to nutrients, and a mechanism of dispersal. Members of the bacterial genus Photorhabdus also associate with nematodes to kill insects, and both genera of bacteria provide similar services to their different nematode hosts through unique physiological and metabolic mechanisms. We posited that these differences would be reflected in their respective genomes. To test this, we sequenced to completion the genomes of Xenorhabdus nematophila ATCC 19061 and Xenorhabdus bovienii SS-2004. As expected, both Xenorhabdus genomes encode many anti-insecticidal compounds, commensurate with their entomopathogenic lifestyle. Despite the similarities in lifestyle between Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria, a comparative analysis of the Xenorhabdus, Photorhabdus luminescens, and P. asymbiotica genomes suggests genomic divergence. These findings indicate that evolutionary changes shaped by symbiotic interactions can follow different routes to achieve similar end points."
https://openalex.org/W2040972615,"Background It is unclear whether, like in schizophrenia, psychosis-related disruption in connectivity between certain regions, as an index of intrinsic functional disintegration, occurs in schizophrenia-like psychosis of epilepsy (SLPE). In this study, we sought to determine abnormal patterns of resting-state EEG oscillations and functional connectivity in patients with SLPE, compared with nonpsychotic epilepsy patients, and to assess correlations with psychopathological deficits. Methodology/Principal Findings Resting EEG was recorded in 21 patients with focal epilepsy and SLPE and in 21 clinically-matched non-psychotic epilepsy controls. Source current density and functional connectivity were determined using eLORETA software. For connectivity analysis, a novel nonlinear connectivity measure called “lagged phase synchronization” was used. We found increased theta oscillations in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN), namely the medial and lateral parietal cortex bilaterally in the psychotic patients relative to their nonpsychotic counterparts. In addition, patients with psychosis had increased beta temporo-prefrontal connectivity in the hemisphere with predominant seizure focus. This functional connectivity in temporo-prefrontal circuits correlated with positive symptoms. Additionally, there was increased interhemispheric phase synchronization between the auditory cortex of the affected temporal lobe and the Broca's area correlating with auditory hallucination scores. Conclusions/Significance In addition to dysfunction of parietal regions that are part of the DMN, resting-state disrupted connectivity of the medial temporal cortex with prefrontal areas that are either involved in the DMN or implicated in psychopathological dysfunction may be critical to schizophrenia-like psychosis, especially in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. This suggests that DMN deficits might be a core neurobiological feature of the disorder, and that abnormalities in theta oscillations and beta phase synchronization represent the underlying neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W1988975697,"FOXO3a is a forkhead transcription factor that regulates a multitude of important cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism. Doxorubicin treatment of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells results in FOXO3a nuclear relocation and the induction of the stress-activated kinase p38 MAPK. Here, we studied the potential regulation of FOXO3a by p38 in response to doxorubicin. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in MCF-7 cells demonstrated a direct interaction between p38 and FOXO3a. We also showed that p38 can bind and phosphorylate a recombinant FOXO3a directly in vitro. HPLC-coupled phosphopeptide mapping and mass spectrometric analyses identified serine 7 as a major site for p38 phosphorylation. Using a phosphorylated Ser-7 FOXO3a antibody, we demonstrated that FOXO3a is phosphorylated on Ser-7 in response to doxorubicin. Immunofluorescence staining studies showed that upon doxorubicin treatment, the wild-type FOXO3a relocalized to the nucleus, whereas the phosphorylation-defective FOXO3a (Ala-7) mutant remained largely in the cytoplasm. Treatment with SB202190 also inhibits the doxorubicin-induced FOXO3a Ser-7 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation in MCF-7 cells. In addition, doxorubicin caused the nuclear translocation of FOXO3a in wild-type but not p38-depleted mouse fibroblasts. Together, our results suggest that p38 phosphorylation of FOXO3a on Ser-7 is essential for its nuclear relocalization in response to doxorubicin."
https://openalex.org/W2014986361,"Inflammatory mediators in the tumour microenvironment promote tumour growth, vascular development and enable evasion of anti-tumour immune responses, by disabling infiltrating dendritic cells. However, the constituents of the tumour microenvironment that directly influence dendritic cell maturation and function are not well characterised. Our aim was to identify tumour-associated inflammatory mediators which influence the function of dendritic cells. Tumour conditioned media obtained from cultured colorectal tumour explant tissue contained high levels of the chemokines CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL5 in addition to VEGF. Pre-treatment of monocyte derived dendritic cells with this tumour conditioned media inhibited the up-regulation of CD86, CD83, CD54 and HLA-DR in response to LPS, enhancing IL-10 while reducing IL-12p70 secretion. We examined if specific individual components of the tumour conditioned media (CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL5) could modulate dendritic cell maturation or cytokine secretion in response to LPS. VEGF was also assessed as it has a suppressive effect on dendritic cell maturation. Pre-treatment of immature dendritic cells with VEGF inhibited LPS induced upregulation of CD80 and CD54, while CXCL1 inhibited HLA-DR. Interestingly, treatment of dendritic cells with CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL5 or VEGF significantly suppressed their ability to secrete IL-12p70 in response to LPS. In addition, dendritic cells treated with a combination of CXCL1 and VEGF secreted less IL-12p70 in response to LPS compared to pre-treatment with either cytokine alone. In conclusion, tumour conditioned media strongly influences dendritic cell maturation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2121844070,"The rate at which viruses replicate and disseminate in competent arthropod vectors is limited by the temperature of their environment, and this can be an important determinant of geographical and seasonal limits to their transmission by arthropods in temperate regions.Here, we present a novel statistical methodology for estimating the relationship between temperature and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and apply it to both published and novel data on virus replication for three internationally important orbiviruses (African horse sickness virus (AHSV), bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV)) in their Culicoides vectors. Our analyses show that there can be differences in vector competence for different orbiviruses in the same vector species and for the same orbivirus in different vector species. Both the rate of virus replication (approximately 0.017-0.021 per degree-day) and the minimum temperature required for replication (11-13°C), however, were generally consistent for different orbiviruses and across different Culicoides vector species. The estimates obtained in the present study suggest that previous publications have underestimated the replication rate and threshold temperature because the statistical methods they used included an implicit assumption that all negative vectors were infected.Robust estimates of the temperature dependence of arbovirus replication are essential for building accurate models of transmission and for informing policy decisions about seasonal relaxations to movement restrictions. The methodology developed in this study provides the required robustness and is superior to methods used previously. Importantly, the methods are generic and can readily be applied to other arbovirus-vector systems, as long as the assumptions described in the text are valid."
https://openalex.org/W1970850921,"During wakefulness and in absence of performing tasks or sensory processing, the default-mode network (DMN), an intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) network, is in an active state. Non-human primate and human CNS imaging studies have identified the DMN in these two species. Clinical imaging studies have shown that the pattern of activity within the DMN is often modulated in various disease states (e.g., Alzheimer's, schizophrenia or chronic pain). However, whether the DMN exists in awake rodents has not been characterized. The current data provides evidence that awake rodents also possess ‘DMN-like’ functional connectivity, but only subsequent to habituation to what is initially a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment as well as physical restraint. Specifically, the habituation process spanned across four separate scanning sessions (Day 2, 4, 6 and 8). At Day 8, significant (p<0.05) functional connectivity was observed amongst structures such as the anterior cingulate (seed region), retrosplenial, parietal, and hippocampal cortices. Prior to habituation (Day 2), functional connectivity was only detected (p<0.05) amongst CNS structures known to mediate anxiety (i.e., anterior cingulate (seed region), posterior hypothalamic area, amygdala and parabracial nucleus). In relating functional connectivity between cingulate-default-mode and cingulate-anxiety structures across Days 2-8, a significant inverse relationship (r = −0.65, p = 0.0004) was observed between these two functional interactions such that increased cingulate-DMN connectivity corresponded to decreased cingulate anxiety network connectivity. This investigation demonstrates that the cingulate is an important component of both the rodent DMN-like and anxiety networks."
https://openalex.org/W2067335713,"In plants, fatty oils are generally stored in spherical intracellular organelles referred to as oleosomes that are covered by proteins such as oleosin. Seeds with high oil content have more oleosin than those with low oil content. However, the exact role of oleosin in oil accumulation is thus far unclear. Here, we report the isolation of a catalytically active 14 S multiprotein complex capable of acylating monoacylglycerol from the microsomal membranes of developing peanut cotyledons. Microsomal membranes from immature peanut seeds were solubilized using 8 m urea and 10 mm CHAPS. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we identified 27 proteins in the 14 S complex. The major proteins present in the 14 S complex are conarachin, the major allergen Ara h 1, and other seed storage proteins. We identified oleosin 3 as a part of the 14 S complex, which is capable of acylating monoacylglycerol. The recombinant OLE3 microsomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been shown to have both a monoacylglycerol acyltransferase and a phospholipase A(2) activity. Overexpression of the oleosin 3 (OLE3) gene in S. cerevisiae resulted in an increased accumulation of diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols and decreased phospholipids. These findings provide a direct role for a structural protein (OLE3) in the biosynthesis and mobilization of plant oils."
https://openalex.org/W2121083229,"Aims To investigate the relationship between hyperuricemia (HUA) and the clinical backgrounds in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods After a cross-sectional study evaluating the association of HUA with the clinical characteristics in 1,213 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the incidence of diabetic macroangiopathies was investigated in a prospective observational study in 1,073 patients during a 3.5 year period. HUA was defined by serum uric acid levels >327 μmol/L or as patients using allopurinol. Results The frequency of HUA was significantly higher in the diabetic patients (32% in men and 15% in women) than in the normal controls (14% in men and 1% in women). In total, HUA was found in 299 (25%) of the patients during the cross-sectional study. Even after adjusting for sex, drinking status, treatment for diabetes mellitus, body mass index, hypertension, use of diuretics, hyperlipidemia, HbA1c and/or the eGFR, the HUA was independently associated with some diabetic complications. The eGFR was significantly reduced in HUA patients compared to those with normouricemia in the 12 months after observation was started. HUA was also an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease even after adjustment in the Cox proportional hazard model. Conclusions HUA is a associated with diabetic micro- and macroangiopathies. HUA is a predictor of coronary heart disease and renal dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the influence of HUA is considered to be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2050879671,"Background Large-scale outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) occurred repeatedly in the Central Plain of China (Shandong, Anhui, and Henan provinces) from 2007 until now. These epidemics have increased in size and severity each year and are a major public health concern in mainland China. Principal Findings Phylogenetic analysis was performed and a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo tree was constructed based on the complete VP1 sequences of HEV71 isolates. These analyses showed that the HFMD epidemic in the Central Plain of China was caused by at least 5 chains of HEV71 transmission and that the virus continued to circulate and evolve over the winter seasons between outbreaks. Between 1998 and 2010, there were 2 stages of HEV71 circulation in mainland China, with a shift from evolutionary branch C4b to C4a in 2003–2004. The evolution rate of C4a HEV71 was 4.99×10-3 substitutions per site per year, faster than the mean of all HEV71 genotypes. The most recent common ancestor estimates for the Chinese clusters dated to October 1994 and November 1993 for the C4a and C4b evolutionary branches, respectively. Compared with all C4a HEV71 strains, a nucleotide substitution in all C4b HEV71 genome (A to C reversion at nt2503 in the VP1 coding region, which caused amino acid substitution of VP1–10: Gln to His) had reverted. Conclusions The data suggest that C4a HEV71 strains introduced into the Central Plain of China are responsible for the recent outbreaks. The relationships among HEV71 isolates determined from the combined sequence and epidemiological data reveal the underlying seasonal dynamics of HEV71 circulation. At least 5 HEV71 lineages circulated in the Central Plain of China from 2007 to 2009, and the Shandong and Anhui lineages were found to have passed through a genetic bottleneck during the low-transmission winter season."
https://openalex.org/W2017351479,"Background Uremic cardiomyopathy contributes substantially to mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) may improve cardiac function, but is mainly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Methodology/Principal Findings In a rat model of chronic renal failure, 5/6-nephrectomized [5/6N] rats were treated orally with DPP-4 inhibitors (linagliptin, sitagliptin, alogliptin) or placebo once daily for 4 days from 8 weeks after surgery, to identify the most appropriate treatment for cardiac dysfunction associated with CKD. Linagliptin showed no significant change in blood level AUC(0-∞) in 5/6N rats, but sitagliptin and alogliptin had significantly higher AUC(0-∞) values; 41% and 28% (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0324), respectively. No correlation of markers of renal tubular and glomerular function with AUC was observed for linagliptin, which required no dose adjustment in uremic rats. Linagliptin 7 µmol/kg caused a 2-fold increase in GLP-1 (AUC 201.0 ng/l*h) in 5/6N rats compared with sham-treated rats (AUC 108.6 ng/l*h) (p = 0.01). The mRNA levels of heart tissue fibrosis markers were all significantly increased in 5/6N vs control rats and reduced/normalized by linagliptin. Conclusions/Significance DPP-4 inhibition increases plasma GLP-1 levels, particularly in uremia, and reduces expression of cardiac mRNA levels of matrix proteins and B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP). Linagliptin may offer a unique approach for treating uremic cardiomyopathy in CKD patients, with no need for dose-adjustment."
https://openalex.org/W2050701501,"α-Synuclein is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. However, the normal functions of synucleins and how these relate to disease pathogenesis are uncertain. We characterized endogenous zebrafish synucleins in order to develop tractable models to elucidate the physiological roles of synucleins in neurons in vivo. Three zebrafish genes, sncb, sncg1, and sncg2 (encoding β-, γ1-, and γ2-synucleins respectively), show extensive phylogenetic conservation with respect to their human paralogues. A zebrafish α-synuclein orthologue was not found. Abundant 1.45-kb sncb and 2.7-kb sncg1 mRNAs were detected in the CNS from early development through adulthood and showed overlapping but distinct expression patterns. Both transcripts were detected in catecholaminergic neurons throughout the CNS. Zebrafish lacking β-, γ1-, or both synucleins during early development showed normal CNS and body morphology but exhibited decreased spontaneous motor activity that resolved as gene expression recovered. Zebrafish lacking both β- and γ1-synucleins were more severely hypokinetic than animals lacking one or the other synuclein and showed delayed differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and reduced dopamine levels. Phenotypic abnormalities resulting from loss of endogenous zebrafish synucleins were rescued by expression of human α-synuclein. These data demonstrate that synucleins have essential phylogenetically conserved neuronal functions that regulate dopamine homeostasis and spontaneous motor behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2022610769,"The precursor of nerve growth factor (proNGF) has been described as a biologically active polypeptide able to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells, via the neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) and the sortilin receptor. Herein, it is shown that proNGF is produced and secreted by breast cancer cells, stimulating their invasion. Using Western blotting and mass spectrometry, proNGF was detected in a panel of breast cancer cells as well as in their conditioned media. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated an overproduction of proNGF in breast tumors, when compared with benign and normal breast biopsies, and a relationship to lymph node invasion in ductal carcinomas. Interestingly, siRNA against proNGF induced a decrease of breast cancer cell invasion that was restored by the addition of non-cleavable proNGF. The activation of TrkA, Akt, and Src, but not the MAP kinases, was observed. In addition, the proNGF invasive effect was inhibited by the Trk pharmacological inhibitor K252a, a kinase-dead TrkA, and siRNA against TrkA sortilin, neurotensin, whereas siRNA against p75(NTR) and the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 had no impact. These data reveal the existence of an autocrine loop stimulated by proNGF and mediated by TrkA and sortilin, with the activation of Akt and Src, for the stimulation of breast cancer cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2116710595,"A proper cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels is essential for processes such as development, growth, metabolism, and angiogenesis. The response to decrease in oxygen supply, referred to as hypoxia, is also involved in numerous human diseases including cancer, inflammatory conditions, and vascular disease. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), a key player in the hypoxic response, is kept under stringent regulation. At normoxia, the levels are kept low as a consequence of the efficient degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and in response to hypoxia, the degradation is blocked and the accumulating HIF-1α promotes a transcriptional response essential for proper adaptation and survival. Here we show that the ubiquitin-specific protease-19 (USP19) interacts with components of the hypoxia pathway including HIF-1α and rescues it from degradation independent of its catalytic activity. In the absence of USP19, cells fail to mount an appropriate response to hypoxia, indicating an important role for this enzyme in normal or pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2121554658,"This study aims to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into oligodendrocyte precursors and assess their recovery potential in a demyelinated optic chiasm model in rats.We generated a cell population of oligodendrocyte progenitors from hiPSCs by using embryoid body formation in a defined medium supplemented with a combination of factors, positive selection and mechanical enrichment. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analyses showed that stage-specific markers, Olig2, Sox10, NG2, PDGFRα, O4, A2B5, GalC, and MBP were expressed following the differentiation procedure, and enrichment of the oligodendrocyte lineage. These results are comparable with the expression of stage-specific markers in human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Transplantation of hiPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors into the lysolecithin-induced demyelinated optic chiasm of the rat model resulted in recovery from symptoms, and integration and differentiation into oligodendrocytes were detected by immunohistofluorescence staining against PLP and MBP, and measurements of the visual evoked potentials.These results showed that oligodendrocyte progenitors generated efficiently from hiPSCs can be used in future biomedical studies once safety issues have been overcome."
https://openalex.org/W2024988675,"Background The specific interaction between hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase (P protein) and the ε RNA stem-loop on pregenomic (pg) RNA is crucial for viral replication. It triggers both pgRNA packaging and reverse transcription and thus represents an attractive antiviral target. RNA decoys mimicking ε in P protein binding but not supporting replication might represent novel HBV inhibitors. However, because generation of recombinant enzymatically active HBV polymerase is notoriously difficult, such decoys have as yet not been identified. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used a SELEX approach, based on a new in vitro reconstitution system exploiting a recombinant truncated HBV P protein (miniP), to identify potential ε decoys in two large ε RNA pools with randomized upper stem. Selection of strongly P protein binding RNAs correlated with an unexpected strong enrichment of A residues. Two aptamers, S6 and S9, displayed particularly high affinity and specificity for miniP in vitro, yet did not support viral replication when part of a complete HBV genome. Introducing S9 RNA into transiently HBV producing HepG2 cells strongly suppressed pgRNA packaging and DNA synthesis, indicating the S9 RNA can indeed act as an ε decoy that competitively inhibits P protein binding to the authentic ε signal on pgRNA. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates the first successful identification of human HBV ε aptamers by an in vitro SELEX approach. Effective suppression of HBV replication by the S9 aptamer provides proof-of-principle for the ability of ε decoy RNAs to interfere with viral P-ε complex formation and suggests that S9-like RNAs may further be developed into useful therapeutics against chronic hepatitis B."
https://openalex.org/W2112734769,"Nucleotide-diphospho-sugars (NDP-sugars) are the building blocks of diverse polysaccharides and glycoconjugates in all organisms. In plants, 11 families of NDP-sugar interconversion enzymes (NSEs) have been identified, each of which interconverts one NDP-sugar to another. While the functions of these enzyme families have been characterized in various plants, very little is known about their evolution and origin. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that all the 11 plant NSE families are distantly related and most of them originated from different progenitor genes, which have already diverged in ancient prokaryotes. For instance, all NSE families are found in the lower land plant mosses and most of them are also found in aquatic algae, implicating that they have already evolved to be capable of synthesizing all the 11 different NDP-sugars. Particularly interesting is that the evolution of RHM (UDP-L-rhamnose synthase) manifests the fusion of genes of three enzymatic activities in early eukaryotes in a rather intriguing manner. The plant NRS/ER (nucleotide-rhamnose synthase/epimerase-reductase), on the other hand, evolved much later from the ancient plant RHMs through losing the N-terminal domain. Based on these findings, an evolutionary model is proposed to explain the origin and evolution of different NSE families. For instance, the UGlcAE (UDP-D-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase) family is suggested to have evolved from some chlamydial bacteria. Our data also show considerably higher sequence diversity among NSE-like genes in modern prokaryotes, consistent with the higher sugar diversity found in prokaryotes. All the NSE families are widely found in plants and algae containing carbohydrate-rich cell walls, while sporadically found in animals, fungi and other eukaryotes, which do not have or have cell walls with distinct compositions. Results of this study were shown to be highly useful for identifying unknown genes for further experimental characterization to determine their functions in the synthesis of diverse glycosylated molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2007486330,"Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is key for the production of second generation biofuels, which represent a long-standing leading area in the field of sustainable energy. Despite the wealth of knowledge about cellulase structure and function, the elusive mechanism by which these enzymes disintegrate the complex structure of their insoluble substrate, which is the gist of cellulose saccharification, is still unclear. We herein present a time-resolved structural characterization of the action of cellulases on a nano-flat cellulose preparation, which enabled us to overcome previous limitations, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As a first step in substrate disintegration, elongated fissures emerge which develop into coniform cracks as disintegration continues. Detailed data analysis allowed tracing the surface evolution back to the dynamics of crack morphology. This, in turn, reflects the interplay between surface degradation inside and outside of the crack. We observed how small cracks evolved and initially increased in size. At a certain point, the crack diameter stagnated and then started decreasing again. Stagnation corresponds with a decrease in the total amount of surface which is fissured and thus leads to the conclusion that the surface hydrolysis ""around"" the cracks is proceeding more rapidly than inside the cracks. The mesoscopic view presented here is in good agreement with various mechanistic proposals from the past and allows a novel insight into the structural dynamics occurring on the cellulosic substrate through cellulase action."

https://openalex.org/W1976052108,"In most industrialized countries, different epidemiologic studies show that chronic renal failure is dramatically increasing. Such major public health problem is a consequence of acquired systemic diseases such as type II diabetes, which is now the first cause for end stage renal failure. Furthermore, lithogenic diseases may also induce intratubular crystallization, which may finally result in end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Up to now, such rare diseases are often misdiagnosed. In this study, based on twenty four biopsies, we show that SR µFTIR (Synchrotron Radiation-µFourier transform infrared) spectroscopy constitutes a significant opportunity to characterize such pathological µcalcifications giving not only their chemical composition but also their spatial distribution in the tissues. This experimental approach offers new opportunities to the clinicians to describe at the cell level the physico-chemical processes leading to the formation of the pathological calcifications which lead to ESRF."

The absence of MBP results in the loss of almost all compact myelin in the CNS. MBP mRNA is sorted into RNA granules that are transported to the periphery of oligodendrocytes in a translationally inactive state. A central mediator of this transport process is the trans-acting factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2 that binds to the cis-acting A2-response element in the 3′UTR of MBP mRNA. Recently, we found that activation of the Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn in oligodendrocytes leads to phosphorylation of hnRNP A2 and to increased translation of MBP mRNA. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein hnRNP F as a novel component of MBP mRNA transport granules. It is associated with hnRNP A2 and MBP mRNA in cytoplasmic granular structures and is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of MBP expression. Fyn kinase activity results in phosphorylation of hnRNP F in the cytoplasm and its release from MBP mRNA and RNA granules. Our results define hnRNP F as a regulatory element of MBP expression in oligodendrocytes and imply an important function of hnRNP F in the control of myelin synthesis.

The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is balanced by the repression of CDP-diacylglycerol pathway enzymes and the induction of Kennedy pathway enzymes. PAH1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase catalyzes the penultimate step in triacylglycerol synthesis, and the diacylglycerol generated in the reaction may also be used for phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway. In this work, we showed that the expression of PAH1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase was induced by zinc deficiency through a mechanism that involved interaction of the Zap1p zinc-responsive transcription factor with putative upstream activating sequence zinc-responsive elements in the PAH1 promoter. The pah1Δ mutation resulted in the derepression of the CHO1-encoded phosphatidylserine synthase (CDP-diacylglycerol pathway enzyme) and loss of the zinc-mediated regulation of the enzyme. Loss of phosphatidate phosphatase also resulted in the derepression of the CKI1-encoded choline kinase (Kennedy pathway enzyme) but decreased the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine when cells were deficient of zinc.

In the CDP-DAG pathway, PC and PE are derived from PA via CDP-DAG, whereas in the Kennedy pathway, these phospholipids are derived from PA via DAG (Fig. 1). PI and PS are only derived from PA via CDP-DAG (Fig. 1). Zinc limitation causes changes in cellular phospholipid composition that include a decrease in PE content and an increase in PI content (5Iwanyshyn W.M. Han G.S. Carman G.M.

In this work, we found that the expression of PAH1-encoded PA phosphatase was induced by zinc deficiency through a mechanism that involved interaction of the Zap1p zinc-responsive transcription factor with putative UASZRE sequences in the PAH1 promoter. Moreover, loss of Pah1p PA phosphatase resulted in the derepression of both choline kinase and PS synthase activities and loss of the zinc-mediated regulation of PS synthase.

https://openalex.org/W2048774414,"Pancreatic cancer has one of the worst mortality rates of all cancers. Little is known about its etiology, particularly regarding inherited risk. The PanScan project, a genome-wide association study, identified several common polymorphisms affecting pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABO, sonic hedgehog (SHH), telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2) were found to be associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Moreover the scan identified loci on chromosomes 13q22.1 and 15q14, to which no known genes or other functional elements are mapped. We sought to replicate these observations in two additional, independent populations (from Germany and the UK), and also evaluate the possible impact of these SNPs on patient survival. We genotyped 15 SNPs in 690 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and in 1277 healthy controls. We replicated several associations between SNPs and PDAC risk. Furthermore we found that SNP rs8028529 was weakly associated with a better overall survival (OS) in both populations. We have also found that NR5A2 rs12029406_T allele was associated with a shorter survival in the German population. In conclusion, we found that rs8028529 could be, if these results are replicated, a promising marker for both risk and prognosis for this lethal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2116208806,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airways disease in which respiratory viral infections frequently trigger exacerbations. Current treatment of asthma with combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta2 agonists improves asthma control and reduces exacerbations but what impact this might have on innate anti-viral immunity is unclear. We investigated the in vitro effects of asthma drugs on innate anti-viral immunity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy and asthmatic donors were cultured for 24 hours with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, imiquimod, or rhinovirus 16 (RV16) in the presence of budesonide and/or formoterol. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of anti-viral intracellular signalling molecules were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR respectively. In PBMC from healthy donors, budesonide alone inhibited IP-10 and IL-6 production induced by imiquimod in a concentration-dependent manner and the degree of inhibition was amplified when budesonide and formoterol were used in combination. Formoterol alone had little effect on these parameters, except at high concentrations (10−6 M) when IL-6 production increased. In RV16 stimulated PBMC, the combination of budesonide and formoterol inhibited IFNα and IP-10 production in asthmatic as well as healthy donors. Combination of budesonide and formoterol also inhibited RV16-stimulated expression of the type I IFN induced genes myxovirus protein A and 2′, 5′ oligoadenylate synthetise. Notably, RV16 stimulated lower levels of type Myxovirus A and oligoadenylate synthase in PBMC of asthmatics than control donors. These in vitro studies demonstrate that combinations of drugs commonly used in asthma therapy inhibit both early pro-inflammatory cytokines and key aspects of the type I IFN pathway. These findings suggest that budesonide and formoterol curtail excessive inflammation induced by rhinovirus infections in patients with asthma, but whether this inhibits viral clearance in vivo remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2050442423,"The total amount of native vegetation is an important property of fragmented landscapes and is known to exert a strong influence on population and metapopulation dynamics. As the relationship between habitat loss and local patch and gap characteristics is strongly non-linear, theoretical models predict that immigration rates should decrease dramatically at low levels of remaining native vegetation cover, leading to patch-area effects and the existence of species extinction thresholds across fragmented landscapes with different proportions of remaining native vegetation. Although empirical patterns of species distribution and richness give support to these models, direct measurements of immigration rates across fragmented landscapes are still lacking.Using the Brazilian Atlantic forest marsupial Gray Slender Mouse Opossum (Marmosops incanus) as a model species and estimating demographic parameters of populations in patches situated in three landscapes differing in the total amount of remaining forest, we tested the hypotheses that patch-area effects on population density are apparent only at intermediate levels of forest cover, and that immigration rates into forest patches are defined primarily by landscape context surrounding patches. As expected, we observed a positive patch-area effect on M. incanus density only within the landscape with intermediate forest cover. Density was independent of patch size in the most forested landscape and the species was absent from the most deforested landscape. Specifically, the mean estimated numbers of immigrants into small patches were lower in the landscape with intermediate forest cover compared to the most forested landscape.Our results reveal the crucial importance of the total amount of remaining native vegetation for species persistence in fragmented landscapes, and specifically as to the role of variable immigration rates in providing the underlying mechanism that drives both patch-area effects and species extinction thresholds."

Because Fn-binding proteins are likely to be important virulence factors of Mycobacterium spp., Ag85 may contribute to the adherence, invasion, and dissemination of organisms in host tissue. In this study, we reported the Fn binding affinity of Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) (KD values were determined from 33.6 to 68.4 nm) and mapped the Ag85-binding motifs of Fn. Fn14, a type III module located on the heparin-binding domain II (Hep-2) of Fn, was discovered to interact with Ag85 from MAP. The peptide inhibition assay subsequently demonstrated that a peptide consisting of residues 17–26 from Fn14 (17SLLVSWQPPR26, termed P17–26) could interfere with Ag85B binding to Fn (73.3% reduction). In addition, single alanine substitutions along the sequence of P17–26 revealed that the key residues involved in Ag85-Fn binding likely contribute through hydrophobic and charge interactions. Moreover, binding of Ag85 on Fn siRNA-transfected Caco2 cells was dramatically reduced (44.6%), implying the physiological significance of the Ag85-Fn interaction between mycobacteria and host cells during infection. Our results indicate that Ag85 binds to Fn at a novel motif and plays a critical role in mycobacteria adherence to host cells by initiating infection.

https://openalex.org/W2168882293,"The histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein-B (HptB; PA3345) is an intermediate protein involved in transferring a phosphoryl group from multiple sensor kinases to the response regulator PA3346 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The objective of this study was to elucidate the biological significance of the HptB-PA3346 interaction and the regulatory mechanisms thereafter. The transcription profiling analysis of an hptB knock-out mutant showed that the expression of a number of motility-related genes was altered consistent with the non-swarming phenotype observed for the mutant. Domain analysis indicated that the PA3346 C-terminal region (PA3346C) exhibits ∼30% identity with the anti-σ factor SpoIIAB of Bacillus subtilis. The presence of Ser/Thr protein kinase activity targeting an anti-σ antagonist, PA3347, at Ser-56 was confirmed in PA3346C using an in vitro phosphorelay assay. Furthermore, PA3346C and the anti-σ(28) factor FlgM were found to interact with PA3347 individually both in vivo and in vitro. FlgM displaced PA3346C in binding of PA3347 and was then competitively displaced by σ(28) from the PA3347-FlgM complex, forming a phosphorylation-dependent partner-switching system. The significance of PA3347 phosphorylation in linking the partner-switching system and swarming motility was established by analyzing the swarming phenotype of the PA3347 knock-out mutant and its complement strains."
https://openalex.org/W2011291007,"Though roles of β-catenin signaling during testis development have been well established, relatively little is known about its role in postnatal testicular physiology. Even less is known about its role in post-meiotic germ cell development and differentiation. Here, we report that β-catenin is highly expressed in post-meiotic germ cells and plays an important role during spermiogenesis in mice. Spermatid-specific deletion of β-catenin resulted in significantly reduced sperm count, increased germ cell apoptosis and impaired fertility. In addition, ultrastructural studies show that the loss of β-catenin in post-meiotic germ cells led to acrosomal defects, anomalous release of immature spermatids and disruption of adherens junctions between Sertoli cells and elongating spermatids (apical ectoplasmic specialization; ES). These defects are likely due to altered expression of several genes reportedly involved in Sertoli cell-germ cell adhesion and germ cell differentiation, as revealed by gene expression analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that β-catenin is an important molecular link that integrates Sertoli cell-germ cell adhesion with the signaling events essential for post-meiotic germ cell development and maturation. Since β-catenin is also highly expressed in the Sertoli cells, we propose that binding of germ cell β-catenin complex to β-catenin complex on Sertoli cell at the apical ES surface triggers a signaling cascade that regulates post-meiotic germ cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1994735484,"3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is a biogenic amine derivative of thyroid hormone present in tissue and blood of vertebrates. Approximately 99% of the circulating thyroid hormones are bound to plasma proteins, including three major thyroid hormone-binding proteins, and the question arises as to whether circulating T1AM is also bound to serum factors. We report here that T1AM is largely bound to a single protein component of human serum. Using T1AM-affinity chromatography, we isolated this protein, and sequence analysis identified it as apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), the protein component of several low density lipoprotein particles. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrate that >90% of specifically bound T1AM in human serum resides in the apoB-100-containing low density lipoprotein fraction. T1AM reversibly binds to apoB-100-containing lipoprotein particles with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 17 nm and a T1AM/apoB-100 stoichiometry of 1:1. Competition binding assays demonstrate that this binding site is highly selective for T1AM. Intracellular T1AM uptake is significantly enhanced by apoB-100-containing lipoprotein particles. Modest enhancements to apoB-100 cellular uptake and secretion by T1AM were observed; however, multidose T1AM treatment did not affect lipid or lipoprotein inventory in vivo. Thus, it appears that apoB-100 serves as a carrier of circulating T1AM and affords a novel mechanism by which T1AM gains entry to cells. 3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is a biogenic amine derivative of thyroid hormone present in tissue and blood of vertebrates.

https://openalex.org/W2011507807,"Development of pharmacologic agents that protect podocytes from injury is a critical strategy for the treatment of kidney glomerular diseases. Retinoic acid reduces proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in multiple animal models of kidney diseases. However, clinical studies are limited because of significant side effects of retinoic acid. Animal studies suggest that all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) attenuates proteinuria by protecting podocytes from injury. The physiological actions of ATRA are mediated by binding to all three isoforms of the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs): RARα, RARβ, and RARγ. We have previously shown that ATRA exerts its renal protective effects mainly through the agonism of RARα. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel boron-containing derivative of the RARα-specific agonist Am580. This new derivative, BD4, binds to RARα receptor specifically and is predicted to have less toxicity based on its structure. We confirmed experimentally that BD4 binds to RARα with a higher affinity and exhibits less cellular toxicity than Am580 and ATRA. BD4 induces the expression of podocyte differentiation markers (synaptopodin, nephrin, and WT-1) in cultured podocytes. Finally, we confirmed that BD4 reduces proteinuria and improves kidney injury in HIV-1 transgenic mice, a model for HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Mice treated with BD4 did not develop any obvious toxicity or side effect. Our data suggest that BD4 is a novel RARα agonist, which could be used as a potential therapy for patients with kidney disease such as HIVAN."
https://openalex.org/W2013774963,"Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells represent a T cell subset with well-characterized immunosuppressive effects during immune homeostasis and chronic infections, and there is emerging evidence to suggest these cells temper pulmonary inflammation in response to acute viral infection. Recent studies have demonstrated treatment with PC61 CD25-depleting antibody potentiates inflammation in a murine model of RSV infection, while paradoxically delaying recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the site of inflammation. The present study therefore sought to examine the role of these cells in a murine model of acute influenza A virus infection through the administration of PC61 CD25-depleting antibody. PC61 antibody is able to partially deplete CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells to a comparable degree as seen within previous work examining RSV, however this does not alter influenza A-virus induced mortality, weight loss, viral clearance and cellularity within the lung. Collectively, these data demonstrate that partial depletion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells with PC61 antibody does not alter the course of influenza A virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2054952253,"Acute pancreatitis is a serious and sometimes fatal inflammatory disease of the pancreas without any reliable treatment or imminent cure. In recent years, impaired metabolism and cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) overload in pancreatic acinar cells have been implicated as the cardinal pathological events common to most forms of pancreatitis, regardless of the precise causative factor. Therefore, restoration of metabolism and protection against cytosolic Ca(2+) overload likely represent key therapeutic untapped strategies for the treatment of this disease. The plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) provides a final common path for cells to ""defend"" [Ca(2+)](i) during cellular injury. In this paper, we use fluorescence imaging to show for the first time that insulin treatment, which is protective in animal models and clinical studies of human pancreatitis, directly protects pancreatic acinar cells from oxidant-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) overload and inhibition of the PMCA. This protection was independent of oxidative stress or mitochondrial membrane potential but appeared to involve the activation of Akt and an acute metabolic switch from mitochondrial to predominantly glycolytic metabolism. This switch to glycolysis appeared to be sufficient to maintain cellular ATP and thus PMCA activity, thereby preventing Ca(2+) overload, even in the face of impaired mitochondrial function."

To understand the structural basis for the thermostability and catalytic mechanism, we report here the crystal structures of FnCel5A and the complex with glucose at atomic resolution. FnCel5A exhibited a (β/α)8-barrel structure typical of clan GH-A of the glycoside hydrolase families with a large and deep catalytic pocket located in the C-terminal end of the β-strands that may permit substrate access. A comparison of the structure of FnCel5A with related structures from thermopile Clostridium thermocellum, mesophile Clostridium cellulolyticum, and psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis showed significant differences in intramolecular interactions (salt bridges and hydrogen bonds) that may account for the difference in their thermostabilities. The substrate complex structure in combination with a mutagenesis analysis of the catalytic residues implicates a distinctive catalytic module Glu167-His226-Glu283, which suggests that the histidine may function as an intermediate for the electron transfer network between the typical Glu-Glu catalytic module.

The active site is located at the C-terminal end of the β-strands; this is characteristic of all known family 5 members. Two strictly conserved glutamic acids located at the C terminus of β-strands 4 and 7 have been identified as the proton donor and the nucleophile, respectively, and play an important role for catalysis (20.Søgaard M. Kadziola A. Haser R. Svensson B. Site-directed mutagenesis of histidine 93, aspartic acid 180, glutamic acid 205, histidine 290, and aspartic acid 291 at the active site and tryptophan 279 at the raw starch binding site in barley α-amylase 1.J.

Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Several aromatic and polar groups form the surface of a deep extended substrate-binding cleft that can accommodate at least four d-glucosyl subsites, two on each side of the labile glycosidic bond. For instance, the catalytic residues Glu140 and Glu280 in Clostridium thermocellum CtCelC are located at the bottom of the cleft together with residues Arg46, His90, Asn139, His198, Tyr200, and Trp313 in the structural prototype, all of which are highly conserved in family 5 glycosyl hydrolases. These amino acids interact with each other and with the substrate through a network of hydrogen bonds. Recently, His198 was reported to be essential for catalysis (22.Domínguez R. Souchon H. Lascombe M. Alzari P.M. The crystal structure of a family 5 endoglucanase mutant in complexed and uncomplexed forms reveals an induced fit activation mechanism.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, whether the histidine can act as a catalytic residue requires further investigation. Considerable efforts have been made to analyze the structural features that determine the thermal stability of proteins from thermophiles. Understanding the structural basis for the enhanced stability of proteins from thermophilic organisms relative to their mesophilic and psychrophilic counterparts is a highly relevant but complex and challenging problem. Previous comparisons of high resolution crystal structures of enzymes with the same fold and function in psychrophiles, mesophiles, and thermophiles have revealed a number of potentially stabilizing features (23.Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Hyperthermophilic enzymes: sources, uses, and molecular mechanisms for thermostability.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of cellulases from thermophilic bacterium Acidothermus cellulolyticus (AcCelE1; Protein Data Bank code 1ECE), C. thermocellum (CtCelC; Protein Data Bank code 1CEC), mesophiles Clostridium cellulolyticum (CcCel5A; Protein Data Bank code 1EDG) and Paenibacillus pabuli (PpXG5; Protein Data Bank code 2JEP), and psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhCel5G; Protein Data Bank code 1TVP) have provided basic insight into cellulase thermostability, but many important aspects remain to be resolved. The thermophilic bacterium Fervidobacterium nodosum Rt17-B1 belongs to the eubacterial order Thermotogales, which comprises the most extremely thermophilic eubacteria presently known and represents the deepest branch within the bacteria (24.Zhaxybayeva O. Swithers K.S. Lapierre P. Fournier G.P. Bickhart D.M. DeBoy R.T. Nelson K.E. Nesbø C.L. Doolittle W.F. Gogarten J.P. Noll K.M. On the chimeric nature, thermophilic origin, and phylogenetic placement of the Thermotogales.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5865-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is capable of growing at temperature above 60 °C with an optimal growth temperature of ∼80 °C. Several genes encoding putative cellulases have been annotated in the genome, but none have been characterized. Recently, a novel cellulase gene encoding a thermostable endoglucanase from F. nodosum was cloned and expressed; it was designated as FnCel5A for being a member of glycoside hydrolase family 5, and it is the first cellulase cloned from organisms of the genus Fervidobacterium (25.Wang Y. Wang X. Tang R. Yu S. Zheng B. Feng Y. A novel thermostable cellulase from Fervidobacterium nodosum.J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2010; 66: 294-301Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant FnCel5A is remarkably active and stable at high temperatures. Specifically, it shows a high hydrolase activity on carboxylmethylcellulose (CMC 3The abbreviations used are: CMCcarboxylmethylcelluloseToptoptimal temperaturer.m.s.d.root mean square deviation.; 440 IU/mg), regenerated amorphous cellulose (402 IU/mg), β-d-glucan from barley (1360 IU/mg), and galactomannan (895 IU/mg) with an optimal activity temperature of 80–83 °C. Furthermore, this enzyme is highly thermostable and has a half-life of 48 h at 80 °C. The well characterized cellulases CtCelC and CcCel5A only show 65 IU/mg activity on the typical endoglucanase substrate CMC at Topt 62 °C and 117 IU/mg at Topt 50 °C, respectively. To our knowledge, FnCel5A has the highest endoglucanase activity among the reported homologues. carboxylmethylcellulose optimal temperature root mean square deviation. To understand the structural basis for the extreme thermostability and high catalytic efficiency, we report here the crystal structure of the recombinant FnCel5A and its complex with glucose. A comparison of the structure with its mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts in amino acid composition, intramolecular interactions, and other structural factors, which all potentially involve the thermal stability of the enzyme, was performed. In addition, mutagenesis of the residues that are related to catalysis was carried out. The structural information in combination with biochemical experiments provided an interpretation of the structural basis for the highly efficient catalysis activity of FnCel5A. The DNA fragment encoding the mature protein was amplified by PCR from F. nodosum Rt17-B1 genomic DNA using the primers listed in supplemental Table 1 and inserted into the vector pET-15b (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were then cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to midexponential phase (A600 = 0.6) and for an additional 3 h after adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce protein expression. SeMet-labeled FnCel5A was produced in E. coli B834 containing the pET15b-FnCel5A plasmid with recombinant protein expression induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation at 16 °C for 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, and then homogenized by sonication. Crude bacterial extracts were subjected to heat incubation at 65 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove the heat-aggregated proteins and cell debris. The supernatant was then applied onto a Ni2+-chelating affinity column (1.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose). Contaminant protein was thoroughly washed off with at least 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), and the target protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole for an approximate total of 15 ml. Resource Q anion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare) was subsequently used with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The target protein was finally eluted with ∼0.2 m NaCl. The N-terminal deletion mutant FnCel5AND was constructed in pET-11b for co-crystallization because of the great facility in substrate binding. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were then cultured at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin. When the culture density reached an A600 of 0.6–0.8, induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was performed, and cell growth continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, and then homogenized by sonication. Crude bacterial extracts were subjected to heat incubation at 65 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove heat-aggregated proteins and cell debris. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g was then applied onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column. Contaminant protein was thoroughly washed off with at least 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm NaCl), and the target protein was eluted with a linear gradient buffer (0–1 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. The target fractions were collected and desalted. Resource Q anion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare) was subsequently applied using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The target protein was finally eluted with ∼0.2 m NaCl. The concentrated target protein was then applied on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mm NaCl. Vectors carrying the H226A, H226K, H226S, H226F, H226Y, H226E, E167A, E167Q, E167D, E167S, E167R, E167F, E283A, E283Q, W61A, W204A, and W240A mutants were generated using a PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with the plasmid pET15b-FnCel5A as the template DNA and the primers listed in supplemental Table 1. The expression and purification procedures of these mutants were the same as described for the wild type. Protein purity was checked by 12% SDS-PAGE. Cellulase activities and enzymatic kinetics of the wild type and mutants were measured using a glucose assay kit (Bioassay Systems). The standard assay was performed by incubating 80 μg of protein and substrate CMC for 5 min at 80 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) with 1 ml of the reaction mixture. The specific activities of the wild-type and mutant proteins were determined with a CMC concentration of 10 mg/ml. After incubation, 5 μl of reaction product was transferred into 500 μl of reagent, and the mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 8 min. The absorbance of the specific color reaction at 630 nm is directly proportional to the concentration of reduced sugars in the products. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of reduced sugar from CMC in 1 min. The Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km for CMC were determined by initial rate measurements with 0.2–100 mg/ml substrate concentration ranges. The initial steady-state velocities of substrate hydrolysis were monitored at five to seven different substrate concentrations. All kinetic data were analyzed by linear regression to a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot using OriginLab Corp. software OriginPro 8.0 SR2, and the standard errors for each parameter were estimated by curve fitting. Far-UV CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer in a configuration described by Jasco hardware manual P/N:0302-0265A. Secondary structure determination spectra were performed with protein concentrations of ∼0.02 mg/ml in PBS (pH 7.0). The spectra were measured in quartz Hellma 110-QS cells with a 1-cm optical path length. A sufficient signal-to-noise ratio is achieved by recording three accumulations for the far-UV CD spectra. Crystals of Se-FnCel5A and native FnCel5A (∼20 mg/ml) were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 291 K in 1.2 m NaH2PO4 and KH2PO4 (1:1) and 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6). Each drop contained 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution with 200 μl of reservoir solution in the well. The FnCel5A-glucose complex crystals were prepared by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, and co-crystallization of the cellobiose and FnCel5AND (∼20 mg/ml) occurred in 23% PEG 8000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6). The molar ratio of proteins to polysaccharide substrates (cellobiose or CMC) was 1:1.5. All crystals were cryoprotected by the addition of 20% glycerol (v/v) to the crystallization conditions. A 1.7-Å resolution data set was collected from a SeMet-FnCel5A crystal at 100 K using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector on beamline BL5A at the Photon Factory (Japan). The diffraction data of the FnCel5A-glucose complex and native FnCel5A were collected on the home Rigaku MM-007 x-ray source. All data sets were integrated, scaled, and reduced with the HKL2000 software package (26.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Macromol. Crystallogr. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38527) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of FnCel5A was solved at 1.7-Å resolution by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method from the Se-Met derivative of FnCel5A. Three of the four potential selenium atoms in one FnCel5A monomer were located by SHELEX (27.Sheldrick G.M. A short history of SHELX.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80563) Google Scholar), and initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE (28.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Automated MAD and MIR structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Density modification (solvent flipping) and phase extension to 1.7 Å were performed using RESOLVE (29.Terwilliger T.C. Maximum-likelihood density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The initial model of Se-FnCel5A was automatically traced using the program ARP/wARP (30.Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. ARP/wARP and molecular replacement.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) to ∼90% completeness, and the refinement of the Se-FnCel5A model was performed with the program REFMAC5 (31.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 program suite and by manual adjustment in COOT (32.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) in the space group P212121. After several rounds of adjustment and refinement, the Rwork and Rfree converged to 20.8 and 24.5%, respectively, in the resolution range of 50.0–1.7 Å. It is worth mentioning that the structure of the native FnCel5A was solved at 2.4-Å resolution using the molecular replacement method with the Se-FnCel5A as a searching model by using the PHASER program (33.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined to an Rwork of 17.8% and an Rfree of 24.6%. The crystal showed space group P21212, and the model consisted of only one FnCel5A monomer. The crystal structure of the FnCel5A-glucose complex was solved at 2.2-Å resolution by the molecular replacement method with the Se-FnCel5A as a searching model. The structure was subsequently refined to an Rwork of 17.6% and an Rfree of 24.7% over the resolution range 50.0–2.2 Å. The model consisted of one FnCel5A monomer, three glucose molecules, and an additional 299 solvent molecules. Data collection and model refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Sequence alignment was performed using the programs ClustalW and ESPript. Structure comparison was carried out using the DALI server. All structure figures were created using the program PyMOL. To gain a better understanding of the structural basis for the extraordinary catalytic characteristics and thermal stability of FnCel5A, the recombinant FnCel5A, Se-Met derivative, and the FnCel5A complex with glucose were crystallized at 291 K using NaH2PO4/KH2PO4 as a precipitant (34.Zheng B. Yang W. Wang Y. Feng Y. Lou Z. Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of thermophilic cellulase from Fervidobacterium nodosum Rt17-B1.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Se-FnCel5A was determined using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined to 1.7-Å resolution with a final Rwork value of 17.8% (Rfree = 24.5%). There are two FnCel5A molecules in an asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 2.6 Å3/Da (corresponding to 48% solvent content) (Fig. 1a). Each monomer is composed of 10 β-strands and 10 α-helices arranged in a α1-β1-α2-β2-α3-β3-α4-α5-β4-α6-β5-β6-α7-α8-β7-α9-β8-β9-β10-α10 topology with dimensions of 50 × 35 × 30 Å (Fig. 1b). The first subunit contains residues 28–343, and the second contains residues 29–343 due to the lack of electron density. Subunit 2 can be superimposed onto the first subunit with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.67 Å. The two FnCel5A monomers are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis to form a tight dimer with an extensive subunit interface. The main contact region concerns helix α6, α8, and the loop between α4 and α6, β5 and β6, α7, and α8 of one subunit. However, according to analytical gel filtration experiments, the purified FnCel5A in buffer conditions (20 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm NaCl) is 34 kDa (25.Wang Y. Wang X. Tang R. Yu S. Zheng B. Feng Y. A novel thermostable cellulase from Fervidobacterium nodosum.J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2010; 66: 294-301Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting a monomeric state of the FnCel5A molecule in aqueous solution. Therefore, the formation of such a crystallographic dimer was a result of crystal packing. The co-crystallization was performed with FnCel5A and its natural inhibitor, cellobiose; however, the electron density map of the complex showed that we eventually captured the enzyme complex with the product glucose due to the slow hydrolysis of cellobiose. The complex structure of FnCel5A-glucose refined to 2.2-Å resolution reveals a large, deep pocket in front of the C-terminal end of the (β/α)8-barrel. Three glucose molecules are located in the pocket. The surface electrostatic potential of the substrate-binding cleft site shows highly acidic character. Structural comparison of FnCel5A-glucose and CtCelC-cellobiose (Protein Data Bank code 1CEN) showed that the spatial position of the three glucose units was similar to the CtCelC-cellobiose complex structure to some extent (Fig. 1c). Therefore, three glucose molecules were defined by +1, −1, and −2 pyranose rings in the complex structure of FnCel5A-glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2051797067,"Isolation of polyadenilated mRNA from human immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line BEP2D revealed the presence of multiple isoforms of RNA coded by the CHRNA9 gene for α9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). BEP2D cells were homozygous for the rs10009228 polymorphism encoding for N442S amino acid substitution, and also contained mRNA coding for several truncated isoforms of α9 protein. To elucidate the biologic significance of the naturally occurring variants of α9 nAChR, we compared the biologic effects of overexpression of full-length α9 N442 and S442 proteins, and the truncated α9 variant occurring due to a loss of the exon 4 sequence that causes frame shift and early termination of the translation. These as well as control vector were overexpressed in the BEP2D cells that were used in the assays of proliferation rate, spontaneous vs. tobacco nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced cellular transformation, and tumorigenicity in cell culture and mice. Overexpression of the S442 variant significantly increased cellular proliferation, and spontaneous and NNK-induced transformation. The N442 variant significantly decreased cellular transformation, without affecting proliferation rate. Overexpression of the truncated α9 significantly decreased proliferation and suppressed cellular transformation. These results suggested that α9 nAChR plays important roles in regulation of bronchial cell growth by endogenous acetylcholine and exogenous nicotine, and susceptibility to NNK-induced carcinogenic transformation. The biologic activities of α9 nAChR may be regulated at the splicing level, and genetic polymorphisms in CHRNA9 affecting protein levels, amino acid sequence and RNA splicing may influence the risk for lung cancer."

Neurons are considered the most complex cell type of higher organisms. To ensure appropriate function within an intricate network, their molecular constituents have to be synthesized, modified, sorted, and degraded in due time. Synapses in particular are constantly modified in an activity-dependent manner (1Alvarez V.A. Sabatini B.L. Anatomical and physiological plasticity of dendritic spines.Annu. Rev.

Different types of granules exist with distinct contents of proteins and RNAs (8Brendel C. Rehbein M. Kreienkamp H.J. Buck F. Richter D. Kindler S.

To better understand the molecular action of PABP in regulating mRNA fate in nerve cells, we have employed yeast two-hybrid techniques to identify binding partners required in support of its function. Here, we report the characterization of a novel PABP-interacting protein, RING zinc finger protein Makorin-1 (MKRN1) (24Gray T.A. Hernandez L. Carey A.H. Schaldach M.A. Smithwick M.J. Rus K. Marshall Graves J.A. Stewart C.L. Nicholls R.D. The ancient source of a distinct gene family encoding proteins featuring RING and C(3)H zinc finger motifs with abundant expression in developing brain and nervous system.Genomics. 2000; 66: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mkrn1 gene belongs to family members that encode putative RNA-binding proteins. MKRN1 is a modular protein with distinct arrays of C3H zinc finger (ZF) motifs, a ZF structure with unusual cysteine/histidine spacing, and a RING domain typically found in E3 ubiquitin ligases (25Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Apparently, MKRN1 exhibits divergent functions both in the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase it acts on itself and the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (26Kim J.H. Park S.M. Kang M.R. Oh S.Y. Lee T.H. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. Ubiquitin ligase MKRN1 modulates telomere length homeostasis through a proteolysis of hTERT.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), p53 and p21 (27Lee E.W. Lee M.S. Camus S. Ghim J. Yang M.R. Oh W. Ha N.C. Lane D.P. Song J. Differential regulation of p53 and p21 by MKRN1 E3 ligase controls cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2100-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MKRN1 modulates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (28Omwancha J. Zhou X.F. Chen S.Y. Baslan T. Fisher C.J. Zheng Z. Cai C. Shemshedini L. Makorin RING finger protein 1 (MKRN1) has negative and positive effects on RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription.Endocrine. 2006; 29: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and may play a role in mRNA decay (29Lehner B. Sanderson C.M. A protein interaction framework for human mRNA degradation.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1315-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In our yeast two-hybrid screen with PABP bait, we have exclusively isolated a shorter isoform (called MKRN1-short) of hitherto unknown function encoded by exons 1–5 of the mkrn1 gene. We show that this protein is the major isoform in rat brain. MKRN1-short expression in forebrain neurons is more abundant than elsewhere in the brain, and the protein resides in both the nucleus as well as the cell body and dendrites. MKRN1-short contains a PAM2 (PCI/PINT associated module 2)-like motif that mediates its interaction with PABP in an RNA-independent manner. PAM2 motifs are found in several PABP-interacting proteins, for example the PABP-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1) and PAIP2 (30Kozlov G. Safaee N. Rosenauer A. Gehring K. Structural basis of binding of P-body-associated proteins GW182 and ataxin-2 by the Mlle domain of poly(A)-binding protein.J. Biol.

Yu A.T. Sonenberg N.

Kahvejian A. De Crescenzo G. Costa-Mattioli M. Sonenberg N. A mechanism of translational repression by competition of Paip2 with eIF4G for poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9494-9499Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MKRN1-short exerts a strong positive effect on translation when it is tethered to a reporter mRNA in primary neurons. In vivo, MKRN1-short accumulates in dendrites after induction of long term potentiation (LTP), a cellular process that requires de novo protein synthesis (33Sutton M.A. Schuman E.M. Dendritic protein synthesis, synaptic plasticity, and memory.Cell. 2006; 127: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 34Richter J.D. Translational control of synaptic plasticity.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that in mammalian brain neurons MKRN1-short functions as a modulator of local protein synthesis in dendrites. Wistar- or Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Animals were bred and handled in accordance with national guidelines for animal welfare. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–500 g; Charles River) were deeply anesthetized with urethane (1.25 g/kg body weight, subcutaneously initially, and additional injections as needed). Surgery and stimulation procedures were performed as described (35Schwarzacher S.W. Vuksic M. Haas C.A. Burbach G.J. Sloviter R.S. Deller T. Neuronal hyperactivity induces astrocytic expression of neurocan in the adult rat hippocampus.Glia. 2006; 53: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, stimulating electrodes were placed in the angular bundle of the medial perforant path. Recording microelectrodes were placed in the dorsal blade of the granule cell layer. High frequency stimulation was applied for 2 h to maximally evoke population spikes and induce robust LTP in granule cells as has been described (36Steward O. Wallace C.S. Lyford G.L. Worley P.F. Synaptic activation causes the mRNA for the IEG Arc to localize selectively near activated postsynaptic sites on dendrites.Neuron. 1998; 21: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). One train consisted of 8 pulses (500 μA, 0.1-ms pulse duration) of 400 Hz once per 10 s. Immediately after the end of the stimulation, rats were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. DNAs encoding PABP, MKRN1, DDX6, and Shank3 were either amplified by PCR techniques, or constructs were generated by subcloning procedures. Constructs generated by PCR were subjected to DNA sequencing. The clones employed in this study are summarized in supplemental Table 1. The following vectors were used: pGEX-6P-3 (GE Healthcare), pGBKT7 (Clontech), pcDNA6/myc-His (Invitrogen), pEGFP-C (Clontech). pN22-C1 and pN22-FLAG3-C1 are derivatives of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), in which the EGFP cDNA has been replaced by regions encoding 22 amino acid residues from the N protein of the phage λ (N22; 37) and a fusion protein consisting of N22 and three consecutive FLAG epitopes, respectively. The eukaryotic expression vector pinFiRein-boxB16B is based on the previously described plasmid pFiRe-basic (38Schütt J. Falley K. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. Kindler S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 25479-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It contains two recombinant genes, both of which are controlled by independent CMV immediate-early promoters, contain a chimeric intron from pFN21 (Promega) upstream of the coding region, and encode Photinus (PhoLuc) and Renilla luciferase (RenLuc), respectively. In their 3′-UTRs, PhoLuc transcripts include 16 consecutive copies of the 15-nucleotide RNA hairpin termed box B that specifically interacts with the N22 domain (37Baron-Benhamou J. Gehring N.H. Kulozik A.E. Hentze M.W. Using the λN peptide to tether proteins to RNAs.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 135-154PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR was chosen for box B insertions because this part of mRNAs often regulates translation (39Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). pcDNA-T7 is a pcDNA3 derivative (Invitrogen) containing a T7 tag-encoding sequence (kindly provided by Dr. Hans-Jürgen Kreienkamp, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against full-size human MKRN1-short and rat PABP C terminus fused to GST. Antisera were produced by Pineda Antibody-Service (Berlin, Germany) and used at a dilution of 1:10 000 (anti-MKRN1) and 1:2000 (anti-PABP) unless stated otherwise. The following antibodies and antibody matrices were employed at the manufacturer recommended dilutions for the respective applications: GFP-Trap®_A (Chromotek), monoclonal mouse anti-T7 (Novagen), monoclonal mouse anti-T7-agarose (Novagen), monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene), monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma), monoclonal mouse anti-MAP2 (Chemicon), monoclonal mouse anti-myc (Sigma), rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Dianova), goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Dianova), mouse anti-rabbit IgG (light chain specific)-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), rabbit anti-mouse IgG (light chain specific)-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova), Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova), Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). HEK-293 and HeLa cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transfection experiments, antibiotics were omitted. Cells were plated at densities of 9–10 × 105 cells/6-cm dish and 2–3 × 106 cells/10 cm dish, respectively. Transfections were done with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a 3:1 ratio of FuGENE 6:DNA. In some cases cells were grown in the presence of 10 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem) for 1–4 h. Cells were lysed 24–36 h after transfections. Rat hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared from rat embryos (E19) according to published procedures (40Blichenberg A. Schwanke B. Rehbein M. Garner C.C. Richter D. Kindler S. Identification of a cis-acting dendritic targeting element in MAP2 mRNAs.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8818-8829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications; neurons were grown in Neurobasal A medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) without a glial feeder layer, and transfections were performed at day 7 in vitro (7 DIV) using calcium phosphate co-precipitation techniques (40Blichenberg A. Schwanke B. Rehbein M. Garner C.C. Richter D. Kindler S. Identification of a cis-acting dendritic targeting element in MAP2 mRNAs.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8818-8829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For luciferase assays and quantitative PCR analyses (see below), respective constructs were transfected in at least five independent series of transfections. Rat PABP cDNA was cloned into pGBKT7 (see “Cloning Procedures”). PABP-interacting proteins were identified by using the matchmaker® yeast-pretransformed human brain cDNA library (Clontech) as outlined in the manufacturer's instruction manual. Total RNA from cultured cells and tissues was prepared with PeqGold RNAPure (PeqLab) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by a cleanup using RNeasy (Qiagen). RNA purity and concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. 2–5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) or RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) according to manufacturer instructions. Subsequently, RNA was digested with 2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen or Fermentas) for 20 min at 37 °C. For quantitative PCR analyses (see below) RNAs were subjected to two independent cDNA syntheses. 2 μl of cDNAs were subjected to PCR in 50-μl reaction volumes using the ProofStart DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were employed: MKRN1-short forward primer 5′-TGTTCAGCGCAGCAAGGAC-3′ (accession number NM_001004233, nucleotides 819–837) and reverse primer 5′-AGATTTAACGGATGGTGGATTTTT-3′ (accession number NM_001004233, nucleotides 1347–1372); MKRN1-long forward primer 5′-GTGGGATCTGCATGGAGGTGGTCT-3′ (accession number AAHX01058705, nucleotide residues 23043–23068) and reverse primer 5′-CCTTCGTTGGGCCTGGTATCTGCT-3′ (accession number AAHX01058705, nucleotide residues 22662–22685). PCR products were subjected to DNA sequencing. A TaqMan® PCR reaction (20 μl) included 1.4 μl of cDNA, 1× TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and either the TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays RenLuc (Applied Biosystems custom-made part no./assay ID 4332079/AIGJPCV) or PhoLuc (Applied Biosystems custom-made part no./assay ID 4332079/AIFAQ6N), respectively. TaqMan® PCR was carried out in a Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems PRISM® 7900 HT thermocycler using the standard program (2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C) and analyzed with Applied Biosystems PRISM® 7900 HT software. Data were evaluated using the comparative CT (threshold cycle) method for the relative quantification of the amount of PhoLuc cDNA normalized to RenLuc cDNA as a reference, given by 2−ΔΔCT. The CT parameter is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence exceeds a fixed threshold value. Each cDNA was analyzed in triplicate with both TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays. Non-template and no reverse transcriptase controls were included in each run. Semiquantitative determination of mRNA levels in immunoprecipitated messenger ribonucleoproteins (see below) was performed with the QuantiTectTM SYBR® Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and QuantiTectTM Primer assays Arc (QT00373086, Qiagen), MAP2 (QT01084244), and β-tubulin 3 (QT00188818) according to the manufacturer's protocol on a Rotor-Gene 3000 cycler (Corbett/Qiagen). PCR reactions (20 μl each) were done in duplicate and included 1 μl of RNA solution. Non-template and no reverse transcriptase controls were included in each run. Data analysis was performed using REST (relative expression software tool) 2008 software for group-wise comparison and statistical analysis of relative expression results in real-time PCR (41Pfaffl M.W. Horgan G.W. Dempfle L. Relative expression software tool (REST) for group-wise comparison and statistical analysis of relative expression results in real-time PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with a multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech). 25 ng of MKRN1-short cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, GE Healthcare) to high specific activity using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Non-incorporated nucleotides were removed by PCR column purification (Qiagen). RNA blots were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C with 10 ml of ULTRAhyb solution (Ambion). Hybridization was performed in 10 ml of fresh ULTRAhyb solution with the addition of labeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) at 42 °C overnight. Blots were washed in 2× saline, sodium citrate (SSC; 20× 3 m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS (2 × 10 min at room temperature), 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (15 min, room temperature), 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (15 min, room temperature), 0.2 × SSC, 1% SDS (30 min, 50 °C), and exposed to x-ray film. Separation of polysomes from freshly prepared rat hippocampal homogenates by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (15–45% sucrose) was done as described (42Mohr E. Morris J.F. Richter D. Differential subcellular mRNA targeting. Deletion of a single nucleotide prevents the transport to axons but not to dendrites of rat hypothalamic magnocellular neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Individual 1-ml gradient fractions were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. For RNA precipitation, ⅕ of each fraction was incubated in 70% ethanol, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.044 mg/ml yeast tRNA for 2 h at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged for 15 min, 12,000 × g, and 4 °C. RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free H2O and further purified as described above. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 0.8 ml/6-cm dish of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v:v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Complete®, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and 16000 × g. Two rat hippocampi were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% (v:v) glycerol, 1% (w:v) Triton X-100, and Complete®) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min and 4 °C. Neurons were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Per 10-cm dish, cells were lysed in 0.425 ml of lysis buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w:v) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete®, Roche Applied Science and 200 units/ml RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Fermentas). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and 13,000 × g. Aliquots for RNA extraction (10%; input RNA) and Western blot analyses (2.5%, input protein) were withdrawn. The remainder was subjected to immunoprecipitation (see below). Protein concentration was determined using the Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Immunoprecipitations of proteins dissolved in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (see below) were usually performed with 700–1000 μg of proteins at a concentration of ∼1 μg/μl. For FLAG-agarose, T7-agarose, and GFP-Trap®_A (Chromotek), 20 μl of monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2- or anti-T7- agarose or 10 μl of GFP-Trap®_A/reaction were washed 5× with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Protein lysate was added and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed, and the agarose was washed 3× with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 1× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer at 95–99 °C for 5 min. In some cases immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of RNase A as described (8Brendel C. Rehbein M. Kreienkamp H.J. Buck F. Richter D. Kindler S. Characterization of Staufen 1 ribonucleoprotein complexes.Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations of recombinant proteins from transfected primary neurons were performed with 40 μl of GFP-Trap®_A/reaction. Lysates from two 10-cm dishes were combined, NaCl was added (final concentration, 200 mm), and lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. Beads were washed 6× with 500 μl each of lysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Aliquots of beads (∼5%) were withdrawn for Western blot analysis. From the remaining beads RNA was eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w:v) SDS) for 10 min at 70 °C. RNAs were purified using PeqGold RNAPure as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and semi-dry-blotted onto Protran BA 85 (Schleicher & Schuell) in 25 mm Tris base, 150 mm glyci"
https://openalex.org/W2016582914,"The view that clot time-based assays do not provide a sufficient assessment of an individual's hemostatic competence, especially in the context of anticoagulant therapy, has provoked a search for new metrics, with significant focus directed at techniques that define the propagation phase of thrombin generation. Here we use our deterministic mathematical model of tissue-factor initiated thrombin generation in combination with reconstructions using purified protein components to characterize how the interplay between anticoagulant mechanisms and variable composition of the coagulation proteome result in differential regulation of the propagation phase of thrombin generation. Thrombin parameters were extracted from computationally derived thrombin generation profiles generated using coagulation proteome factor data from warfarin-treated individuals (N = 54) and matching groups of control individuals (N = 37). A computational clot time prolongation value (cINR) was devised that correlated with their actual International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, with differences between individual INR and cINR values shown to derive from the insensitivity of the INR to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The analysis suggests that normal range variation in TFPI levels could be an important contributor to the failure of the INR to adequately reflect the anticoagulated state in some individuals. Warfarin-induced changes in thrombin propagation phase parameters were then compared to those induced by unfractionated heparin, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, and a reversible thrombin inhibitor. Anticoagulants were assessed at concentrations yielding equivalent cINR values, with each anticoagulant evaluated using 32 unique coagulation proteome compositions. The analyses showed that no anticoagulant recapitulated all features of warfarin propagation phase dynamics; differences in propagation phase effects suggest that anticoagulants that selectively target fXa or thrombin may provoke fewer bleeding episodes. More generally, the study shows that computational modeling of the response of core elements of the coagulation proteome to a physiologically relevant tissue factor stimulus may improve the monitoring of a broad range of anticoagulants."
https://openalex.org/W2020334112,"Background A fundamental life history question is how individuals should allocate resources to reproduction optimally over time (reproductive allocation). The reproductive restraint hypothesis predicts that reproductive effort (RE; the allocation of resources to current reproduction) should peak at prime-age, whilst the terminal investment hypothesis predicts that individuals should continue to invest more resources in reproduction throughout life, owing to an ever-decreasing residual reproductive value. There is evidence supporting both hypotheses in the scientific literature. Methodology/Principal Findings We used an uncommonly large, 38 year dataset on Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) shot at various times during the rutting period to test these two hypotheses. We assumed that body mass loss in rutting males was strongly related to RE and, using a process-based approach, modelled how male relative mass loss rates varied with age. For different regions of our study area, we provide evidence consistent with different hypotheses for reproductive allocation. In sites where RE declined in older age, this appears to be strongly linked to declining body condition in old males. In this species, terminal investment may only occur in areas with lower rates of body mass senescence. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that patterns of reproductive allocation may be more plastic than previously thought. It appears that there is a continuum from downturns in RE at old age to terminal investment that can be manifest, even across adjacent populations. Our work identifies uncertainty in the relationship between reproductive restraint and a lack of competitive ability in older life (driven by body mass senescence); both could explain a decline in RE in old age and may be hard to disentangle in empirical data. We discuss a number of environmental and anthropogenic factors which could influence reproductive life histories, underlining that life history patterns should not be generalised across different populations."
https://openalex.org/W2013552849,"A high intracellular bacillary load of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages induces an atypical lysosomal cell death with early features of apoptosis that progress to necrosis within hours. Unlike classical apoptosis, this cell death mode does not appear to diminish M. tuberculosis viability. We previously reported that culturing heavily infected macrophages with naïve macrophages produced an antimicrobial effect, but only if naïve macrophages were added during the pre-necrotic phase of M. tuberculosis-induced cell death. In the present study we investigated the mechanism of antimicrobial activity in co-cultures, anticipating that efferocytosis of bacilli in apoptotic bodies would be required. Confocal microscopy revealed frustrated phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages with no evidence that significant numbers of bacilli were transferred to the naïve macrophages. The antimicrobial effect of naïve macrophages was retained when they were separated from infected macrophages in transwells, and conditioned co-culture supernatants transferred antimicrobial activity to cultures of infected macrophages alone. Antimicrobial activity in macrophage co-cultures was abrogated when the naïve population was deficient in IL-1 receptor or when the infected population was deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase. The participation of nitric oxide suggested a conventional antimicrobial mechanism requiring delivery of bacilli to a late endosomal compartment. Using macrophages expressing GFP-LC3 we observed the induction of autophagy specifically by a high intracellular load of M. tuberculosis. Bacilli were identified in LC3-positive compartments and LC3-positive compartments were confirmed to be acidified and LAMP1 positive. Thus, the antimicrobial effect of naïve macrophages acting on M. tuberculosis in heavily-infected macrophages is contact-independent. Interleukin-1 provides an afferent signal that induces an as yet unidentified small molecule which promotes nitric oxide-dependent antimicrobial activity against bacilli in autolysosomes of heavily infected macrophages. This cooperative, innate antimicrobial interaction may limit the maximal growth rate of M. tuberculosis prior to the expression of adaptive immunity in pulmonary tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2070621017,"Diabetic wounds remain a major medical challenge with often disappointing outcomes despite the best available care. An impaired response to tissue hypoxia and insufficient angiogenesis are major factors responsible for poor healing in diabetic wounds. Here we show that the antimycotic drug ciclopirox olamine (CPX) can induce therapeutic angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. Treatment with CPX in vitro led to upregulation of multiple angiogenic genes and increased availability of HIF-1α. Using an excisional wound splinting model in diabetic mice, we showed that serial topical treatment with CPX enhanced wound healing compared to vehicle control treatment, with significantly accelerated wound closure, increased angiogenesis, and increased dermal cellularity. These findings offer a promising new topical pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of diabetic wounds."

High fidelity in this reaction is crucial to the accurate decoding of genetic information and is ensured, in part, by proofreading of the newly synthesized aminoacyl-tRNAs. Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRS) mischarge tRNAPro with alanine or cysteine due to their smaller or similar sizes relative to cognate proline. Mischarged Ala-tRNAPro is hydrolyzed by an editing domain (INS) present in most bacterial ProRSs. In contrast, the INS domain is unable to deacylate Cys-tRNAPro, which is hydrolyzed exclusively by a freestanding trans-editing domain known as YbaK. Here, we have used computational and experimental approaches to probe the molecular basis of INS domain alanine specificity. We show that the methyl side chain of alanine binds in a well defined hydrophobic pocket characterized by conserved residues Ile-263, Leu-266, and Lys-279 and partially conserved residue Thr-277 in Escherichia coli ProRS. Site-specific mutation of these residues leads to a significant loss in Ala-tRNAPro hydrolysis, and altering the size of the pocket modulates the substrate specificity. Remarkably, one ProRS INS domain variant displays a complete switch in substrate specificity from alanine to cysteine. The mutually exclusive aminoacyl-tRNA substrate specificities of the WT and engineered INS domains is consistent with the evolution of two distinct editing domains that function to clear Ala-tRNAPro and Cys-tRNAPro in vivo.

AaRSs catalyze aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis in a two-step reaction. In the first step, amino acids are activated by ATP to form an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate, and in the second step, the activated amino acid is transferred from the adenylate to the 3′ terminus of the tRNA. AaRSs can confuse cognate amino acids with isosteric noncognate amino acids. For example, prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) mischarges tRNAPro with alanine and cysteine, in addition to the cognate proline. Mistakes by aaRSs are generally cleared either by hydrolysis or selective release of the aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate (pre-transfer editing) or by hydrolysis of the mischarged aminoacyl-tRNA (post-transfer editing). Post-transfer editing is catalyzed by a distinct editing domain that is either appended to the ancient catalytic core of the aaRS or encoded by a freestanding domain. In the ProRS system, several distinct homologous domains play a role in post-transfer editing. An editing domain (INS) that clears mischarged Ala-tRNAPro is appended to most bacterial ProRSs, whereas Cys-tRNAPro is cleared by a freestanding editing domain known as YbaK (12An S.

At least three additional freestanding editing domain homologs of unknown function (YeaK, ProX, and PA2301) have been identified based on sequence similarity to INS and YbaK (16So B.R. An S. Kumar S.

Although freestanding editing domains with homology to the editing domains of alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) and threonyl-tRNA synthetase have also been identified, YbaK is the only known editing domain with a distinct substrate specificity relative to the homologous synthetase domain. We recently showed that YbaK uses a unique substrate-assisted mechanism of catalysis involving thiol-specific chemistry to cleave Cys-tRNAPro (16So B.R. An S. Kumar S. Das M. Turner D.A. Hadad C.M.

We hypothesize that due to the similar sizes of cysteine and proline, the ProRS INS domain could not evolve a substrate binding pocket that hydrolyzed both Ala- and Cys-tRNAPro while excluding Pro-tRNAPro. Here, we explore the proposed steric exclusion mechanism of substrate discrimination by the INS domain using computational modeling and biochemical approaches. We identify a hydrophobic substrate binding pocket that is optimized for Ala-tRNAPro hydrolysis but can be engineered to allow larger amino acids such as cysteine to bind and be hydrolyzed efficiently. The tunable nature of the substrate binding pocket is consistent with a steric exclusion mechanism. Remarkably, an INS variant that hydrolyzed Cys-tRNAPro but not Pro-tRNAPro also failed to hydrolyze Ala-tRNAPro, in accordance with the evolution of distinct editing domains that act upon each mischarged substrate in vivo.

The system was energy-minimized for 2000 steps, keeping the protein rigid, followed by a 5000-step minimization for the entire system. In a preproduction MD simulation of 100 ps, the temperature of the system was raised from 0 to 300 K with a small force constant on the protein to restrict any drastic changes. Final production MD simulations were performed for 15 ns under constant temperature and pressure. The MD trajectory was analyzed for stability using Visual Molecular Dynamics software. The atomic fluctuations were calculated using the ptraj module of AMBER10. Following MD simulation of the free protein, 25 snapshots of the protein structure were extracted at equal time intervals across the 15-ns MD simulation and were used for molecular docking. The structure of the 5′-CCA-Ala ligand was generated using the xleap module of AMBER10. This ligand was docked onto the 25 structures of INS using AutoDock 4.0 (21Huey R. Morris G.M. Olson A.J.

Conformation of all of the ligand torsions were sampled during docking using a genetic algorithm. Side chain torsions of several residues in the binding pocket predicted from existing structural and biochemical data as well as MD simulation of the free protein, including Ile-263, Lys-279, Val-281, Glu-316, Phe-330, Val-333, and His-366, were allowed to change while the rest of the protein torsions were fixed. Each docking simulation involved generation of 200 different conformers, which were then clustered using a root mean square deviation cutoff of 2.0 Å. Resulting clusters were manually inspected, and four docked structures, deemed probable complex structures based on biochemical data, were chosen for further analysis. These structures were minimized using the ff03 force field in AMBER10, followed by 15 ns of MD simulation, as described above. A binding energy for each ligand was calculated using the Molecular Mechanic-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area module of AMBER10. The complex structure displaying the most stable trajectory and the best binding energy was further minimized and was used as the final model for the INS·CCA-Ala complex.

Following aminoacylation reactions, the substrate aminoacyl-tRNAs were phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and stored at −80 °C for use in deacylation assays. To compare the loss in deacylation activity of WT and mutant ProRS, 5 μm enzyme concentration was used in all assays. Deacylation of Ala-, Ser-, Cys-, Pro-, and 2-Abu-tRNAPro was carried out at 25 °C, whereas deacylation of Cys-tRNAPro was carried out at 25 °C or 37 °C according to published protocols (13An S.

For 2-Abu-3′-[32P]tRNAPro, reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 unit/μl P1 nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0) on ice. After digestion for 20 min at room temperature, 1 μl of quenched mixture was spotted onto a PEI-cellulose TLC plate pre-run with water. Separation of 2-Abu-AMP and AMP was accomplished by developing the TLC plates in 0.1 m ammonium chloride and 5% acetic acid. The radioactivity was analyzed using a Typhoon PhosphorImager, and data were analyzed using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). The level of deacylation was determined from the ratio of 2-Abu-AMP remaining over the total AMP plus 2-Abu-AMP, as described previously (28Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Modulation of tRNAAla identity by inorganic pyrophosphatase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fraction of aminoacyl-tRNA remaining was plotted as a function of time following subtraction of the buffer-only hydrolysis background reaction and fitted to a single-exponential equation to obtain kobs. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Several homologous domains, including the INS domain of bacterial ProRS and the freestanding editing domains, YbaK and PrdX, have been shown to enhance the fidelity of proline codon translation by editing mischarged tRNAPro. To understand the molecular basis of substrate selection and discrimination by the INS domain, we first used computational approaches to generate a model of the bacterial ProRS INS domain bound to an Ala-tRNA substrate analog, 5′-CCA-Ala. Crystal structures represent one of many possible conformations that proteins may adopt and are often not well suited for the molecular docking of a large substrate. MD simulations of the free protein not only allow the sampling of these dynamic motions, but also provide information on the flexible regions of the protein that may be involved in substrate binding. We performed a 15-ns all-atom MD simulation of the E. faecalis ProRS INS domain (PDB code 2J3L, residues 224–407). Atomic fluctuations of backbone atom C, Cα, and N for each residue, calculated as the root mean square deviation from the starting structure over the course of the simulation, identified several flexible regions of the protein (Fig. 1A). In addition to the linker regions of the INS domain (Fig. 1B), flexible regions were generally localized around the Lys-279 residue, earlier identified as critical for catalysis (22Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K.

Residue Gly-331, part of the highly conserved GXXXP motif hypothesized to play an analogous role to that of an oxyanion hole (30Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Crystal structure of YbaK protein from Haemophilus influenzae (HI1434) at 1.8 Å resolution: functional implications.Proteins. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was also found to be highly flexible. Residue His-366, which is equivalent to residue His-369 in E. coli ProRS and previously implicated in Ala specificity of the INS domain (22Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Functional role of the prokaryotic proline-tRNA synthetase insertion domain in amino acid editing.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), does not show high flexibility but lies close to more flexible regions of the protein. The congruence between the flexible regions of the protein and the catalytically important residues is consistent with putative substrate binding in this region of the protein. A truncated substrate analog of Ala-tRNA, 5′-CCA-Ala, was docked into the putative active site of the protein. Twenty-five snapshots of the protein structure were extracted at equal time intervals from the MD trajectory of the free INS domain. A large grid, encompassing all of the flexible regions of the protein, was used for the docking of the substrate. All torsions of the substrate and side chain torsions of several bulky residues in the flexible regions of the protein, including Ile-263, Lys-279, Val-281, Glu-316, Phe-330, Val-333, and His-366, were conformationally sampled. The substrate generally clustered near the flexible regions, but the computed binding energy did not show a significant preference for any conformation. Because previous studies have shown Lys-279 and His-366 (His-369 in E. coli ProRS) residues to be important in catalysis and substrate specificity, respectively, a weak constraint that the Cα carbon atom of the substrate alanine should be within 10 Å of these residues was applied. Four unique conformations of the substrate were selected for further analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). These structures of the INS·CCA-Ala complex were energy minimized and subjected to 5 ns of equilibration MD and 10 ns of production MD. Complex A (supplemental Fig. 1) showed a stable trajectory during the MD simulation, as well as the best binding energy calculated by Mechanic-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area, and was further optimized and selected as the final structure of the INS·CCA-Ala complex. The model of the INS·CCA-Ala complex (Fig. 2A) reveals several key interactions of the substrate with the protein (Fig. 2, B–D). The A76 phosphate group interacts with the Lys-279 residue via charge-charge interaction. This interaction may be crucial for the positioning of the 3′-end of the tRNA in the INS active site and would explain the essential role of Lys-279 residue in catalysis. The adenine base of the substrate is predicted to form three H-bonds with the protein, one between N7 and the Leu-282 backbone amine and two between the N6 hydrogens and the Leu-282 and Ala-317 carbonyl groups. The adenine base also interacts with residue Phe-330 via a stacking interaction (Fig. 2B). These interactions may play an important role in orienting the substrate in a catalytically competent manner in the active site. The C75 and C74 bases bind on the surface of the INS domain and H-bond to residues Glu-316 and Asp-299, respectively. The 5′-end of the substrate remains exposed to the solvent in a manner that would be compatible with binding of full-length tRNA. The substrate alanine binds in a hydrophobic cleft in the INS domain. The amine group makes H-bonds with the backbone carbonyls of residues Gly-331 and Ile-333, as well as with the His-366 side chain. The substrate carbonyl group is directed toward the positively charged GXXXP loop (Figs. 2C and 3A). The methyl side chain of the alanine substrate binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of highly conserved residues Lys-279, Ile-263, and Val-266 (Leu-266 in E. coli ProRS) (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. 2). The partially conserved residue Ile-277 (Thr-277 in E. coli ProRS) interacts with Ile-263 and Val-266 and completes the hydrophobic pocket into which the substrate alanine binds; however, it does not interact directly with the substrate. Overall, this alanine binding pocket is relatively large, and based on the docking model, we predict that this pocket would be able to fit slightly larger hydrophobic substrates. Biochemical data show that the INS domain selectively hydrolyzes Ala-tRNAPro but not Cys-tRNAPro or Pro-tRNAPro (12An S. Musier-Forsyth K. Trans-editing of Cys-tRNAPro by Haemophilus influenzae YbaK protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Beuning P.J.

To understand the molecular basis of this selectivity, we generated models of the INS domain bound to 5′-CCA-Cys (Fig. 3B) and 5′-CCA-Pro (Fig. 3C) by changing the alanine residue of the docked substrate to cysteine or proline, followed by energy minimization. The model of INS·CCA-Ala (Fig. 3A) shows that the carbonyl group of the substrate points to the backbone amine groups of the GXXXP loop (residues 331–333). The oxyanionic tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis is likely stabilized by this low electron density oxyanion hole. As mentioned above, this orientation of the substrate is further stabilized by H-bonds of the substrate amine group (Fig. 2B). There are two water molecules in our models that may play catalytic or structural roles. One water is situated close to the Cα of the substrate alanine and forms H-bonds with the 2′-OH (Fig. 3A) and Gly-261 carbonyl (data not shown). This water may play a catalytic role as it is positioned for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl center of the substrate. Another water molecule on the active site floor (Fig. 3), which is also present in the crystal structure of"

It is unclear if the amount released per vesicle is dependent upon the nature of the developing fusion pore and whether full fusion and transient kiss and run exocytosis are regulated by similar mechanisms. We hypothesise that if consistent relationships exist between these aspects of exocytosis then they will remain constant across any age. Using amperometry in mouse chromaffin cells we measured catecholamine efflux during single exocytotic events at P0, 1 month and 6 months. At all ages we observed full fusion (amperometric spike only), full fusion preceded by fusion pore flickering (pre-spike foot (PSF) signal followed by a spike) and pure ""kiss and run"" exocytosis (represented by stand alone foot (SAF) signals). We observe age-associated increases in the size of all 3 modes of fusion but these increases occur at different ages. The release probability of PSF signals or full spikes alone doesn't alter across any age in comparison with an age-dependent increase in the incidence of ""kiss and run"" type events. However, the most striking changes we observe are age-associated changes in the relationship between vesicle size and the membrane bending energy required for exocytosis. Our data illustrates that vesicle size does not regulate release probability, as has been suggested, that membrane elasticity or flexural rigidity change with age and that the mechanisms controlling full fusion may differ from those controlling ""kiss and run"" fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2085993848,"The Notch signalling pathway mediates cell-cell communication in a wide variety of organisms. The major components, as well as the basic mechanisms of Notch signal transduction, are remarkably well conserved amongst vertebrates and invertebrates. Notch signalling results in transcriptional activation of Notch target genes, which is mediated by an activator complex composed of the DNA binding protein CSL, the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor, and the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind. In the absence of active signalling, CSL represses transcription from Notch target genes by the recruitment of corepressors. The Notch activator complex is extremely well conserved and has been studied in great detail. However, Notch repressor complexes are far less understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, the CSL protein is termed Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)]. Su(H) functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding Hairless, the major antagonist of Notch signalling in Drosophila, which in turn recruits two general corepressors – Groucho and C-terminal binding protein CtBP. Recently, we determined that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Su(H) binds Hairless and identified a single site in Hairless, which is essential for contacting Su(H). Here we present additional biochemical and in vivo studies aimed at mapping the residues in Su(H) that contact Hairless. Focusing on surface exposed residues in the CTD, we identified two sites that affect Hairless binding in biochemical assays. Mutation of these sites neither affects binding to DNA nor to Notch. Subsequently, these Su(H) mutants were found to function normally in cellular and in vivo assays using transgenic flies. However, these experiments rely on Su(H) overexpression, which does not allow for detection of quantitative or subtle differences in activity. We discuss the implications of our results."

The results support the conclusion that the (Ctm)PrP, a transmembrane form of the prion protein, adopts a different conformation than the reported structures of the normal prion protein determined in solution. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement studies with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid indicated that the conserved hydrophobic region peptide is not inserted symmetrically in the micelle, thus suggesting the presence of a guanidium-phosphate ion pair involving the side chain of the terminal arginine and the detergent headgroup. Titration of dodecylphosphocholine into a solution of PrP110-136 revealed the presence of a surface-bound species. In addition, paramagnetic probes located the surface-bound peptide somewhere below the micelle-water interface when using the inserted helix as a positional reference. This localization of the unknown population would allow a similar ion pair interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2130196955,"The current model of planarian anterior regeneration evokes the establishment of low levels of Wnt signalling at anterior wounds, promoting anterior polarity and subsequent elaboration of anterior fate through the action of the TALE class homeodomain PREP. The classical observation that decapitations positioned anteriorly will regenerate heads more rapidly than posteriorly positioned decapitations was among the first to lead to the proposal of gradients along an anteroposterior (AP) axis in a developmental context. An explicit understanding of this phenomenon is not included in the current model of anterior regeneration. This raises the question what the underlying molecular and cellular basis of this temporal gradient is, whether it can be explained by current models and whether understanding the gradient will shed light on regenerative events. Differences in anterior regeneration rate are established very early after amputation and this gradient is dependent on the activity of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. Animals induced to produce two tails by either Smed-APC-1(RNAi) or Smed-ptc(RNAi) lose anterior fate but form previously described ectopic anterior brain structures. Later these animals form peri-pharyngeal brain structures, which in Smed-ptc(RNAi) grow out of the body establishing a new A/P axis. Combining double amputation and hydroxyurea treatment with RNAi experiments indicates that early ectopic brain structures are formed by uncommitted stem cells that have progressed through S-phase of the cell cycle at the time of amputation. Our results elaborate on the current simplistic model of both AP axis and brain regeneration. We find evidence of a gradient of hedgehog signalling that promotes posterior fate and temporarily inhibits anterior regeneration. Our data supports a model for anterior brain regeneration with distinct early and later phases of regeneration. Together these insights start to delineate the interplay between discrete existing, new, and then later homeostatic signals in AP axis regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1992604340,"Initiation of glucose polymerization by glycogenin autoglucosylation at Tyr-194 is required to prime de novo biosynthesis of glycogen. It has been proposed that the synthesis of the primer proceeds by intersubunit glucosylation of dimeric glycogenin, even though it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism is responsible for the described polymerization extent of 12 glucoses produced by the dimer. We reported previously the intramonomer glucosylation capability of glycogenin without determining the extent of autoglucopolymerization. Here, we show that the maximum specific autoglucosylation extent (MSAE) produced by the non-glucosylated glycogenin monomer is 13.3 ± 1.9 glucose units, similar to the 12.5 ± 1.4 glucose units measured for the dimer. The mechanism and capacity of the dimeric enzyme to carry out full glucopolymerization were also evaluated by construction of heterodimers able to glucosylate exclusively by intrasubunit or intersubunit reaction mechanisms. The MSAE of non-glucosylated glycogenin produced by dimer intrasubunit glucosylation was 16% of that produced by the monomer. However, partially glucosylated glycogenin was able to almost complete its autoglucosylation by the dimer intrasubunit mechanism. The MSAE produced by heterodimer intersubunit glucosylation was 60% of that produced by the wild-type dimer. We conclude that both intrasubunit and intersubunit reaction mechanisms are necessary for the dimeric enzyme to acquire maximum autoglucosylation. The full glucopolymerization capacity of monomeric glycogenin indicates that the enzyme is able to synthesize the glycogen primer without the need for prior dimerization."

Mutations of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene were revealed to be the causation of DGI type II (DGI-II). In this study, we identified a novel mutation (NG_011595.1:g.8662T>C, c.135+2T>C) lying in the splice donor site of intron 3 of DSPP gene in a Chinese Han DGI-II pedigree. It was found in all affected subjects but not in unaffected ones or other unrelated healthy controls. The function of the mutant DSPP gene, which was predicted online and subsequently confirmed by in vitro splicing analysis, was the loss of splicing of intron 3, leading to the extended length of DSPP mRNA. For the first time, the functional non-splicing of intron was revealed in a novel DSPP mutation and was considered as the causation of DGI-II. It was also indicated that splicing was of key importance to the function of DSPP and this splice donor site might be a sensitive mutation hot spot. Our findings combined with other reports would facilitate the genetic diagnosis of DGI-II, shed light on its gene therapy and help to finally conquer human diseases."

For immunofluorescence assay, DRG neurons were electroporated using NucleofectorTM-II and the immunocytochemistry staining experiment was carried out 48 h later. For collection of cell surface proteins, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4, with 0.1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+) and then incubated with Sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.3 mg/ml in cold PBS) for 45 min at 4 °C to biotinylate surface proteins. Unreacted biotin was quenched twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1 mm Ca2+. Cells were lysed in TNE lysis buffer, which contains 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were rotated for 45 min at 4 °C, and the cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min). Biotinylated surface proteins were then pulled down by avidin-agarose, and the remaining supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic protein samples. For quantifying endogenous RET and TrkB surface levels in DRG neurons, surface biotinylation was performed first, and then one-half of the clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with avidin beads to capture cell surface receptors. The other half of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-RET (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-TrkB (Upstate) antibodies (total RET or TrkB groups) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads to capture total RET or TrkB. The beads were washed three times with TNE lysis buffer; the precipitated proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot. RET or TrkB proteins were detected by goat anti-RET (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse anti-TrkB (1:1000; BD) antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Pierce) and quantified by NIH Image J software (NIH Image, Bethesda, MD). Endogenous RET and TrkB expression were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. P7 newborn rat DRGs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose/PBS overnight. Ganglions were sectioned at 40 μm thickness by a freezing microtome (Microm HM550, Thermo) at −20 °C onto gelatin-coated slides. These sections were then stained with goat anti-RET (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-TrkB (1:100, Upstate) antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Fluorescence images were acquired by a HQ2 cool CCD camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U microscope, and assigned to a pseudo color (red, green). All of the images were collected using a 10× objective lens and processed by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA). To visualize cell surface levels of GFP-fused receptors in transfected PC12 cells and DRG neurons, immunofluorescence staining methods were used from our previous study (19Zhao L. Sheng A.L. Huang S.H. Yin Y.X. Chen B. Li X.Z. Zhang Y. Chen Z.Y. Mechanism underlying activity-dependent insertion of TrkB into the neuronal surface.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3123-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, fixed cells were stained with anti-Flag M2 antibody (1:1000, Sigma) under non-permeabilized conditions followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen). All of the images were acquired using a 60× objective lens by a HQ2 cool CCD camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U microscope. In each experiment, a consistent set of acquisition parameters was used for each set of images, which were processed by MetaMorph software and assigned to a pseudo color (red, green). The intensity of anti-FLAG staining (red) or GFP (green) for each of selected cells was measured by MetaMorph software. A peptide containing the predicted PKC phosphorylation site at Thr675 of human RET (SAEMpTFRRP-C) was used to immunize rabbits. Crude serum was first passed through an affinity column made by coupling the non-phosphorylated version of the peptide. Flow-through from this column was then passed through a column made by coupling the phosphopeptide. Specificity of collected antibody (rabbit anti-pT675-RET) was tested by a peptide competition assay in which a more than 5-fold weight excess of either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated RET peptide was pre-incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then used for immunoblotting with TPA-treated PC12 cells lysates transfected with RET-GFP. PC12 cells electroporated with low amounts of indicated constructs (0.5 μg) were cultured at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml onto 6-cm dishes coated with poly-d-lysine. 24 h later, cells were serum starved for 12 h and then treated with 50 ng/ml GDNF (PeproTech) plus 300 ng/ml soluble GFRα1 (R&D System) for 5, 10, and 60 min. Total cell lysates were obtained as described previously. To detect receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation levels, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-RET antibody, followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-pTyr (pY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-RET antibodies respectively. For Erk and Akt activation, anti-pErk1/2, anti-Erk1/2, anti-pAkt, and anti-Akt Western blots were performed, respectively, as previously described. Immunoreactive bands were scanned and quantitated using NIH Image J software. Ratios of phosphoprotein over total protein were defined to present protein activation levels. 12 h after transfection with a low amount of the indicated constructs (0.5 μg), PC12 cells were switched to differentiation medium (DMEM, 0.5% horse serum, 0.25% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mm glutamine) in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml GDNF plus 300 ng/ml soluble GFRα1. Cells were left to differentiate for 3 days, and subsequent images were collected using a ×10 objective lens with a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U microscope. GFP-expressing cells, carrying neurites at least twice the diameter of the cell soma, were defined as differentiated cells. Differentiation percentage was calculated as the number of differentiated cells divided by the total number of transfected cells, which had GFP-fluorescence. At least 300 cells from ten different fields were counted for each construct. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc tests. Data were presented as mean ± S.E., and differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Although RET and TrkB receptors are both expressed in non-peptidergic DRG neurons, direct investigations of their co-expression are rarely reported (20Kramer I. Sigrist M. de Nooij J.C. Taniuchi I.

As the receptor surface levels may play a critical role in cell responsiveness to particular stimuli, we compared the endogenous RET and TrkB surface levels in DRG neurons by surface biotinylation assay and calculated the ratios of surface RET and TrkB compared with their respective total amounts. Quantitative analyses of immunoblotting revealed that RET exhibits significantly higher cell surface expression than TrkB (Fig. 1B). We then sought to determine the structural basis for the differential RET and TrkB cell surface levels. Chimeric receptors with switched intracellular domains for RET and TrkB were constructed (RETTrkBIC and TrkBRETIC) and transfected into PC12 cells, a well-established neuronal cell line with little endogenous RET and TrkB expression and as such a model system to express various RET and TrkB mutants (supplemental Fig. S1) (22Greene L.A.

Using a surface biotinylation assay, we found that though their extracellular domains were replaced, RET and TrkB chimeras containing their respective cytoplasmic domains still exhibited differential cell surface levels (Fig. 2, A and B), which suggested that the intracellular domains of RET and TrkB were responsible for their differential surface expression.FIGURE 2The differential RET and TrkB surface levels depends on their intracellular portion. A, cell surface levels of RET and RETTrkBIC receptors were compared. RET and RETTrkBIC chimeric receptors were constructed on the pcDNA3.1 backbone and electroporated into PC12 cells. Surface proteins were collected by biotinylation methods and run on an SDS-PAGE gel. Cell lysates were added as protein level control. Immunoreactive bands were quantified by Image J software, and surface levels were represented as surface/lysate ratios. Relative receptor surface levels were normalized to that of RET. The results are represented as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments (**, p < 0.01 versus RET surface levels; Student's t test). B, cell surface levels of TrkBRETIC and TrkB receptors were compared. TrkB and TrkBRETIC chimeric receptors were constructed on the pcDNA3.1 backbone and electroporated into PC12 cells. The same experiment process was carried out as in A. Relative receptor surface levels were normalized to that of TrkBRETIC. The results are represented as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments (**, p < 0.01 versus TrkBRETIC surface levels; Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide a convenient and visible method for comparing relative receptor cell surface levels, we adopted a ratiometric fluorescence assay described in a previous study of TrkB surface insertion (19Zhao L. Sheng A.L. Huang S.H. Yin Y.X. Chen B. Li X.Z. Zhang Y. Chen Z.Y. Mechanism underlying activity-dependent insertion of TrkB into the neuronal surface.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3123-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this assay, receptors were Flag-tagged at the N-terminal of the extracellular domain and fused with green fluorescence protein (GFP) in the cytoplasmic C-terminal. Thus, cell-surface receptor levels were quantified by fluorescence intensity of Flag staining normalized to GFP intensity per cell under non-permeabilized conditions, which served to control for variable receptor expression levels in each cell due to transient transfection. Having shown that the extracellular domain was not responsible for the differential surface levels of RET and TrkB (Fig. 2), we then generated the chimeric RET-GFP receptor, which expressed the Flag-tagged TrkB extracellular domain to eliminate the potential detection bias due to accessibility differences of the Flag epitope between the receptors (Fig. 3A). After transfection into PC12 cells, surface biotinylation experiments showed that the cell surface levels of Flag-tagged TrkB-GFP was ∼0.61-fold compared with that of RET-GFP (Fig. 3B), which was consistent with the surface levels differences between RET and TrkB under endogenous conditions in DRG neurons and suggested that the Flag and GFP tag did not affect the surface distribution of the receptors. Next we performed the ratiometric fluorescence assay. Quantitative fluorescence analysis revealed that the surface receptor levels of TrkB-GFP was ∼0.65-fold compared with that of RET-GFP (Fig. 3C), which further confirmed our surface biotinylation results. Taken together, these data suggest that cell surface levels of RET and TrkB are differentially expressed and that this differential expression is mediated by the residues within the intracellular domain. Having determined that the differential surface levels of RET and TrkB might be due to the intracellular domain, we then sought to determine whether there was a key motif responsible for this difference. The ratiometric fluorescence assay was used to define the potential regions in the RET receptor required for higher surface expression levels compared with TrkB. We generated chimeras in which different RET domains (transmembrane, juxtamembrane, kinase, and C-terminal) were substituted with the corresponding TrkB domains (Fig. 4, A and B). We hypothesized that monitoring for a decrease in the cell surface expression levels from these chimeras would allow us to identify the motif necessary for the higher RET surface levels compared with TrkB. In PC12 cells, we observed that substitution of only the TrkB juxtamembrane region into RET (RETTrkBJM-GFP) led to a significant decrease in RET surface levels comparable to that of wild-type TrkB (Fig. 4B). Swapping in other TrkB domains had no effect on surface expression of RET chimeras. These observations indicated that the RET juxtamembrane region contains structural elements that are necessary for the differential RET and TrkB surface expression. We next sought to determine whether the RET juxtamembrane region was sufficient for the higher RET surface levels compared with TrkB. Various domains including the juxtamembrane region were transplanted from RET into TrkB, and their surface expression levels were assessed (Fig. 4C). Only the TrkB chimera swapped with the RET juxtamembrane region (TrkBRETJM-GFP) showed a significant increase in surface expression comparable with wild-type RET (Fig. 4C), which suggested that the RET juxtamembrane region was not only necessary but also sufficient for the differential RET and TrkB cell surface levels. To define more precisely the structural motif in the juxtamembrane region required for efficient RET surface targeting, we divided the RET juxtamembrane region into three boxes (Fig. 5A). Chimeric receptors with swapped sequences between the corresponding boxes of RET and TrkB were generated and their cell surface levels were assessed in PC12 cells by ratiometric fluorescence assay. Substitution of TrkB Box1 into RET led to a significant decrease in surface receptor levels similar to that observed with RETTrkBJM-GFP (Fig. 5B). Conversely, transplantation of RET Box1 into TrkB led to a significant increase in surface receptor levels equivalent to that observed with TrkBRETJM-GFP (Fig. 5C). Swapping in other boxes had no significant effect on RET and TrkB chimera surface expression levels. Representative PC12 immunostaining images are shown in Fig. 5D. Receptor surface biotinylation experiments were performed to confirm our ratiometric fluorescence results. Quantitative analysis of the immunoblotting results showed that RETTrkBBox1-GFP exhibited decreased surface levels similar to TrkB. In contrast, TrkBRETBox1-GFP showed significantly increased cell surface levels comparable to RET-GFP (Fig. 5E). Finally we repeated the immunostaining experiment in primary cultured DRG neurons where we found results consistent with those observed in PC12 cells (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggest that Box1 in the RET juxtamembrane domain (amino acid 658–683) is necessary and sufficient for the differential RET and TrkB cell surface levels.FIGU"
