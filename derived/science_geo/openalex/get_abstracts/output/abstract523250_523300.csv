https://openalex.org/W2009356149,"The analysis of structural mobility in molecular dynamics plays a key role in data interpretation, particularly in the simulation of biomolecules. The most common mobility measures computed from simulations are the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) of the structures. These are computed after the alignment of atomic coordinates in each trajectory step to a reference structure. This rigid-body alignment is not robust, in the sense that if a small portion of the structure is highly mobile, the RMSD and RMSF increase for all atoms, resulting possibly in poor quantification of the structural fluctuations and, often, to overlooking important fluctuations associated to biological function. The motivation of this work is to provide a robust measure of structural mobility that is practical, and easy to interpret. We propose a Low-Order-Value-Optimization (LOVO) strategy for the robust alignment of the least mobile substructures in a simulation. These substructures are automatically identified by the method. The algorithm consists of the iterative superposition of the fraction of structure displaying the smallest displacements. Therefore, the least mobile substructures are identified, providing a clearer picture of the overall structural fluctuations. Examples are given to illustrate the interpretative advantages of this strategy. The software for performing the alignments was named MDLovoFit and it is available as free-software at: http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/mdlovofit"

https://openalex.org/W2047527379,"Processing multiple sensory modalities is critical for executing complex behaviors. This study finds that single cerebellar granule cells integrate inputs from both vestibular and visual input pathways, each exhibiting characteristic synaptic strengths and plasticities. These are translated into output dynamics that enhance the network's representation of complex sensory contexts. The ability of the brain to rapidly process information from multiple pathways is critical for reliable execution of complex sensory-motor behaviors, yet the cellular mechanisms underlying a neuronal representation of multimodal stimuli are poorly understood. Here we explored the possibility that the physiological diversity of mossy fiber (MF) to granule cell (GC) synapses in the mouse vestibulocerebellum may contribute to the processing of coincident multisensory information at the level of individual GCs. We found that the strength and short-term dynamics of individual MF-GC synapses can act as biophysical signatures for primary vestibular, secondary vestibular and visual input pathways. Most GCs receive inputs from different modalities, which, when coactivated, produced enhanced GC firing rates and distinct first spike latencies. Thus, pathway-specific synaptic response properties permit temporal coding of correlated multisensory inputs by single GCs, thereby enriching sensory representation and facilitating pattern separation."
https://openalex.org/W1989756662,"Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI), a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities in preterm infants, is characterized by reduced oligodendrocyte formation. NG2-expressing oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2 cells) are exposed to various extrinsic regulatory signals, including the neurotransmitter GABA. We investigated GABAergic signaling to cerebellar white matter NG2 cells in a mouse model of DWMI (chronic neonatal hypoxia). We found that hypoxia caused a loss of GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic input to NG2 cells, extensive proliferation of these cells and delayed oligodendrocyte maturation, leading to dysmyelination. Treatment of control mice with a GABAA receptor antagonist or deletion of the chloride-accumulating transporter NKCC1 mimicked the effects of hypoxia. Conversely, blockade of GABA catabolism or GABA uptake reduced NG2 cell numbers and increased the formation of mature oligodendrocytes both in control and hypoxic mice. Our results indicate that GABAergic signaling regulates NG2 cell differentiation and proliferation in vivo, and suggest that its perturbation is a key factor in DWMI."
https://openalex.org/W1992759203,"Working memory is a key executive function for flying an aircraft. This function is particularly critical when pilots have to recall series of air traffic control instructions. However, working memory limitations may jeopardize flight safety. Since the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) method seems promising for assessing working memory load, our objective is to implement an on-line fNIRS-based inference system that integrates two complementary estimators. The first estimator is a real-time state estimation MACD-based algorithm dedicated to identifying the pilot's instantaneous mental state (not-on-task vs. on-task). It does not require a calibration process to perform its estimation. The second estimator is an on-line SVM-based classifier that is able to discriminate task difficulty (low working memory load vs. high working memory load). These two estimators were tested with 19 pilots who were placed in a realistic flight simulator and were asked to recall air traffic control instructions. We found that the estimated pilot's mental state matched significantly better than chance with the pilot's real state (62% global accuracy, 58% specificity, and 72% sensitivity). The second estimator, dedicated to assessing single trial working memory loads, led to 80% classification accuracy, 72% specificity, and 89% sensitivity. These two estimators establish reusable blocks for further fNIRS-based passive brain computer interface development."
https://openalex.org/W2037580111,"Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) are promising home fortification products, but the optimal zinc level needed to improve growth and reduce morbidity is uncertain. We aimed to assess the impact of providing SQ-LNS with varied amounts of zinc, along with illness treatment, on zinc-related outcomes compared with standard care. In a placebo-controlled, cluster-randomized trial, 34 communities were stratified to intervention (IC) or non-intervention cohorts (NIC). 2435 eligible IC children were randomly assigned to one of four groups:1) SQ-LNS without zinc, placebo tablet; 2) SQ-LNS containing 5mg zinc, placebo tablet; 3) SQ-LNS containing 10mg zinc, placebo tablet; or 4) SQ-LNS without zinc and 5mg zinc tablet from 9–18 months of age. During weekly morbidity surveillance, oral rehydration salts were provided for reported diarrhea and antimalarial therapy for confirmed malaria. Children in NIC (n = 785) did not receive SQ-LNS, tablets, illness surveillance or treatment. At 9 and 18 months, length, weight and hemoglobin were measured in all children. Reported adherence was 97±6% for SQ-LNS and tablets. Mean baseline hemoglobin was 89±15g/L. At 18 months, change in hemoglobin was greater in IC than NIC (+8 vs -1g/L, p<0.0001), but 79.1% of IC were still anemic (vs. 91.1% in NIC). Final plasma zinc concentration did not differ by group. During the 9-month observation period, the incidence of diarrhea was 1.10±1.03 and of malaria 0.54±0.50 episodes per 100 child-days, and did not differ by group. Length at 18 months was significantly greater in IC compared to NIC (77.7±3.0 vs. 76.9±3.4cm; p<0.001) and stunting prevalence was significantly lower in IC (29.3%) than NIC (39.3%; p<0.0001), but did not differ by intervention group within IC. Wasting prevalence was also significantly lower in IC (8.7%) than in NIC (13.5%; p = 0.0003). Providing SQ-LNS daily with or without zinc, along with malaria and diarrhea treatment, significantly increased growth and reduced stunting, wasting and anemia prevalence in young children.

https://openalex.org/W2111584621,"Many daily behaviors require us to actively focus on the current task and ignore all other distractions. Yet, ignoring everything else might hinder the ability to discover new ways to achieve the same goal. Here, we studied the neural mechanisms that support the spontaneous change to better strategies while an established strategy is executed. Multivariate neuroimaging analyses showed that before the spontaneous change to an alternative strategy, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) encoded information that was irrelevant for the current strategy but necessary for the later strategy. Importantly, this neural effect was related to future behavioral changes: information encoding in MPFC was changed only in participants who eventually switched their strategy and started before the actual strategy change. This allowed us to predict spontaneous strategy shifts ahead of time. These findings suggest that MPFC might internally simulate alternative strategies and shed new light on the organization of PFC."
https://openalex.org/W2040887230,"Neuropathic pain is caused by long-term modifications of neuronal function in the peripheral nervous system, the spinal cord, and supraspinal areas. Although functional changes in the forebrain are thought to contribute to the development of persistent pain, their significance and precise subcellular nature remain unexplored. Using somatic and dendritic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, we discovered that sciatic nerve injury caused an activity-dependent dysfunction of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated (HCN) channels in the dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons resulting in enhanced integration of excitatory postsynaptic inputs and increased neuronal firing. Specific activation of the serotonin receptor type 7 (5-HT7R) alleviated the lesion-induced pathology by increasing HCN channel function, restoring normal dendritic integration, and reducing mechanical pain hypersensitivity in nerve-injured animals in vivo. Thus, serotoninergic neuromodulation at the forebrain level can reverse the dendritic dysfunction induced by neuropathic pain and may represent a potential therapeutical target."
https://openalex.org/W1966240013,"CD16a and CD16b are IgG Fc receptors expressed by human natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils, respectively. Both CD16 isoforms undergo a rapid down-regulation in expression by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage upon cell activation by various stimuli. We examined soluble CD16 released from activated NK cells and neutrophils by mass spectrometric analysis, and identified three separate cleavage sites in close proximity at P1/P1′ positions alanine195/valine196, valine196/serine197, and threonine198/isoleucine199, revealing a membrane proximal cleavage region in CD16. Substitution of the serine at position 197 in the middle of the cleavage region for a proline (S197P) effectively blocked CD16a and CD16b cleavage in cell-based assays. We also show that CD16a/S197P was resistant to cleavage when expressed in the human NK cell line NK92 and primary NK cells derived from genetically-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells. CD16a is a potent activating receptor and despite blocking CD16a shedding, the S197P mutation did not disrupt IgG binding by the receptor or its activation of NK92 cells by antibody-treated tumor cells. Our findings provide further characterization of CD16 cleavage by ADAM17 and they demonstrate that a non-cleavable version of CD16a can be expressed in engineered NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038146310,"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a product of a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified pathway consisting of five conserved genes, pqqA-E. PqqE is a radical S-adenosylmethionine (RS) protein with a C-terminal SPASM domain, and is proposed to catalyze the formation of a carbon-carbon bond between the glutamate and tyrosine side chains of the peptide substrate PqqA. PqqD is a 10-kDa protein with an unknown function, but is essential for PQQ production. Recently, in Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), PqqD and PqqE were shown to interact; however, the stoichiometry and KD were not obtained. Here, we show that the PqqE and PqqD interaction transcends species, also occurring in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 (Me). The stoichiometry of the MePqqD and MePqqE interaction is 1:1 and the KD, determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR), was found to be ∼12 μm. Moreover, using SPR and isothermal calorimetry techniques, we establish for the first time that MePqqD binds MePqqA tightly (KD ∼200 nm). The formation of a ternary MePqqA-D-E complex was captured by native mass spectrometry and the KD for the MePqqAD-MePqqE interaction was found to be ∼5 μm. Finally, using a bioinformatic analysis, we found that PqqD orthologues are associated with the RS-SPASM family of proteins (subtilosin, pyrroloquinoline quinone, anaerobic sulfatase maturating enzyme, and mycofactocin), all of which modify either peptides or proteins. In conclusion, we propose that PqqD is a novel peptide chaperone and that PqqD orthologues may play a similar role in peptide modification pathways that use an RS-SPASM protein.

https://openalex.org/W2144367857,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that secretes the exopolysaccharide alginate during infection of the respiratory tract of individuals afflicted with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among the proteins required for alginate production, Alg44 has been identified as an inner membrane protein whose bis-(3′,5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) binding activity post-translationally regulates alginate secretion. In this study, we report the 1.8 Å crystal structure of the cytoplasmic region of Alg44 in complex with dimeric self-intercalated c-di-GMP and characterize its dinucleotide-binding site using mutational analysis. The structure shows that the c-di-GMP binding region of Alg44 adopts a PilZ domain fold with a dimerization mode not previously observed for this family of proteins. Calorimetric binding analysis of residues in the c-di-GMP binding site demonstrate that mutation of Arg-17 and Arg-95 alters the binding stoichiometry between c-di-GMP and Alg44 from 2:1 to 1:1. Introduction of these mutant alleles on the P. aeruginosa chromosome show that the residues required for binding of dimeric c-di-GMP in vitro are also required for efficient alginate production in vivo. These results suggest that the dimeric form of c-di-GMP represents the biologically active signaling molecule needed for the secretion of an important virulence factor produced by P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2045604909,"Shallow tubewells are the primary drinking water source for most rural Bangladeshis. Fecal contamination has been detected in tubewells, at low concentrations at the source and at higher levels at the point of use. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether improving the microbiological quality of tubewell drinking water by household water treatment and safe storage would reduce diarrhea in children <2 years in rural Bangladesh.We randomly assigned 1800 households with a child aged 6-18 months (index child) into one of three arms: chlorine plus safe storage, safe storage and control. We followed households with monthly visits for one year to promote the interventions, track their uptake, test participants' source and stored water for fecal contamination, and record caregiver-reported child diarrhea prevalence (primary outcome). To assess reporting bias, we also collected data on health outcomes that are not expected to be impacted by our interventions.Both interventions had high uptake. Safe storage, alone or combined with chlorination, reduced heavy contamination of stored water. Compared to controls, diarrhea in index children was reduced by 36% in the chlorine plus safe storage arm (prevalence ratio, PR = 0.64, 0.55-0.73) and 31% in the safe storage arm (PR = 0.69, 0.60-0.80), with no difference between the two intervention arms. One limitation of the study was the non-blinded design with self-reported outcomes. However, the prevalence of health outcomes not expected to be impacted by water interventions did not differ between study arms, suggesting minimal reporting bias.Safe storage significantly improved drinking water quality at the point of use and reduced child diarrhea in rural Bangladesh. There was no added benefit from combining safe storage with chlorination. Efforts should be undertaken to implement and evaluate long-term efforts for safe water storage in Bangladesh.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01350063."

Here we investigate how a motor program is constructed within a large network. We imaged populations of neurons in the Aplysia pedal ganglion during execution of a locomotion motor program. We found that the program was built from a very small number of dynamical building blocks, including both neural ensembles and low-dimensional rotational dynamics. These map onto physically discrete regions of the ganglion, so that the motor program has a corresponding modular organization in both dynamical and physical space. Using this dynamic map, we identify the population potentially implementing the rhythmic pattern generator and find that its activity physically traces a looped trajectory, recapitulating its low-dimensional rotational dynamics.

This mixture of systems means that population imaging of the Aplysia pedal ganglion is representative of the analytical challenges that will become increasingly common for large-scale recordings of complex neural systems (Cunningham and Yu, 2014Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Dimensionality reduction for large-scale neural recordings.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), as we know that the recorded populations will have captured multiple dynamical systems within them. We thus had to develop new dimension-reduction approaches to deconstruct population recordings into the motor program’s component systems. In this paper, we report that the locomotion motor program is built from a very small number of dynamical building blocks that are common to every execution. These include both ensembles and low-dimensional dynamics. We show that this dynamical decomposition unexpectedly maps onto physically discrete regions of the ganglion, such that the motor program is built from physical as well as functional building blocks in a distributed network. Using this dynamic map, we identify a population with rotational dynamics potentially implementing the rhythmic pattern generator. We further show that its activity physically traces a looped trajectory. These findings shed light on the general principles of implementing motor programs in distributed networks, place strong constraints on circuit mechanisms underlying locomotion in Aplysia, and pave the way for targeted studies of attractor-like dynamics in neural systems. We used a setup that was designed to simultaneously record neural populations at high temporal and spatial resolution during execution of a single motor program (Hill et al., 2010Hill E.S. Moore-Kochlacs C. Vasireddi S.K. Sejnowski T.J. Frost W.N. Validation of independent component analysis for rapid spike sorting of optical recording data.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 3721-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Figure 1; see Experimental Procedures). Aversive tail stimuli elicit escape locomotion in Aplysia, which consists of a rhythmic series of head reaches and muscular contraction cycles that roll head to tail down the length of the animal (Jahan-Parwar and Fredman, 1979Jahan-Parwar B.

Sharp-electrode studies showed rhythmically bursting motorneurons located mostly in the pedal ganglion’s rostro-medial quadrant (Hening et al., 1979Hening W.A. Walters E.T. Carew T.J. Kandel E.R. Motorneuronal control of locomotion in Aplysia.Brain Res. 1979; 179: 231-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and phase locked to the rhythmic muscle contractions (Hening et al., 1979Hening W.A.

The ganglion’s functional and physical organization during locomotion is otherwise largely unknown. Using an isolated brain preparation, we reliably elicited fictive locomotion by stimulation of pedal nerve 9, while simultaneously recording the spike trains of individual neurons across the entire ganglion at high temporal resolution (1.6 kHz) using voltage-sensitive dye imaging with a photodiode array (Figure 1A) (Hill et al., 2010Hill E.S. Moore-Kochlacs C. Vasireddi S.K. Sejnowski T.J. Frost W.N. Validation of independent component analysis for rapid spike sorting of optical recording data.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 3721-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We simultaneously recorded 57–125 neurons in each of 12 preparations, a total of 1,145 neurons, with each record truncated to the initial 80 s in which each preparation consistently showed locomotion-related activity. We accurately mapped the location of every recorded neuron in the two-dimensional imaging plane (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures 3; Figure 3A). Decomposing the motor program required combining recordings to identify dynamical building blocks common to each execution of the program. However, recorded executions varied in both timescale (Figures S1A–S1C) and intensity (the distribution of firing rates significantly differed between 55 of the 66 unique pairs of recordings; K-S test at α = 0.05). This variation between recordings, combined with the likely mixture of dynamics within each recording, made analysis with standard dimension reduction techniques challenging (Machens, 2010Machens C.K. Demixing population activity in higher cortical areas.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Illustrating this difficulty, we found that applying principal components analysis (Briggman et al., 2005Briggman K.L. Abarbanel H.D.I. Kristan Jr., W.B. Optical imaging of neuronal populations during decision-making.Science. 2005; 307: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Levi et al., 2005Levi R. Varona P. Arshavsky Y.I. Rabinovich M.I. Selverston A.I. The role of sensory network dynamics in generating a motor program.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9807-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to each recording revealed hints of attractor-like dynamics (Figures S1D and S1E), but the number of principal components capturing 95% of the variance in a recording ranged from 2 to 12, indicating that each recording captured different sets of dynamics within the same motor program. To solve these problems, our starting point was to seek the existence of neural ensembles within each recording. Finding these would provide evidence of ensembles within a distributed network implementation of a motor program; as we will show, these also provide a basis for solving the problem of combining information across variable recordings to decompose the dynamic systems within a program. Our analysis strategy for decomposing the motor program is illustrated in Figure 1B; below we detail the new algorithms introduced at each step. As there are an unknown number and size of ensembles in each execution—potentially zero—we developed an unsupervised algorithm for ensemble detection (Experimental Procedures). Each recording is characterized as a functional network of correlations between neuron pairs (Figure 1C), where each node is a neuron and each link encodes correlation strength. Our algorithm is based on the concept of community detection in arbitrary networks: it separates each functional network into modules (“communities”) of nodes by directly optimizing the modularity score Q, which is maximized by grouping nodes into modules that have dense connections within them and sparse connections between them (Newman, 2006bNewman M.E.J. Modularity and community structure in networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8577-8582Crossref PubMed Scopus (7455) Google Scholar, Humphries, 2011Humphries M.D. Spike-train communities: finding groups of similar spike trains.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These modules are thus groups of neurons whose activity patterns are more similar to each other than to any other neuron and give a quantitative definition of “neural ensemble” (or “cell assembly”) (Wehr and Laurent, 1996Wehr M. Laurent G. Odour encoding by temporal sequences of firing in oscillating neural assemblies.Nature. 1996; 384: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, Harris, 2005Harris K.D.

Olfactory pattern classification by discrete neuronal network states.Nature. 2010; 465: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To solve the problem of reliably clustering each recording for later between-recording comparison, we developed a new consensus-clustering approach to community detection (Supplemental Experimental Procedures 1). Consensus community detection was highly effective in organizing the raw recording traces into separate ensembles of temporally correlated neurons (illustrated in Figures 2A–2C). We found that each execution of the locomotion motor program decomposed into multiple neural ensembles. The recordings captured between 7 and 18 ensembles each (total of 147), ranging in size from 2 to 24 neurons (median 8 neurons; Figure 2D). Every ensemble was highly self-similar (Figure 2E), indicating that the algorithm was very successful at separating each functional network into its component modules. The modularity of each preparation was approximately the same (mean Q = 0.18 ± 0.05 SD), confirming that the recordings were sampling the correlation structure of the circuit in a consistent manner. The number of ensembles scaled with the number of recorded neurons in the preparation (Figure 2F), suggesting that each recording is sampling a subset of all simultaneously present ensembles. Figure S2 shows that our detected ensemble structures are robust to order of magnitude changes in the timescale of correlation and to using an adaptive timescale that accounts for population firing rate changes over the recording. To understand how each motor program execution is distributed across the network, we then sought the physical layout of the ensembles in each recording. Our use of voltage-sensitive dye imaging with a photodiode array and independent component analysis to isolate the spike trains (Hill et al., 2010Hill E.S. Moore-Kochlacs C. Vasireddi S.K. Sejnowski T.J. Frost W.N. Validation of independent component analysis for rapid spike sorting of optical recording data.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 3721-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) allowed us to recover the location of each neuron within the two-dimensional imaging plane of the ganglion (Figure 3A; Supplemental Experimental Procedures 3). Across all recordings, we found that most ensembles (100/147) were physically cohesive (p < 0.05, permutation test), as illustrated in Figure 3A, such that strongly correlated neurons were physically close. We then asked whether this physical cohesiveness meant that ensembles comprising a single execution of the program were intermingled or discretely arranged. As each recording sampled a subset of all likely ensembles, to check for discreteness we needed to solve the problems of incomplete data, of unknown, likely irregular physical shapes of ensembles, and of possible noise in the clustering. To do so, we developed a parameter-free method for interpolating the physical extent of each ensemble, illustrated in Figures 3B and 3C (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures 3). We found most ensembles (110/147) had at least half their neurons in one continuous patch of space and so were highly discrete (Figure S3). Most strikingly, as illustrated in Figure 3C, the physical arrangement of ensembles in each recording was also highly discrete (mean proportion of neurons in a single continuous patch was between 52% and 92%; all were greater than 95% confidence interval, permutation test). Functionally defined ensembles thus correspond to physically separate neuron groups: a single execution of the locomotion motor program is distributed across the network as a set of physically discrete neural ensembles. Having characterized each execution, we turn to the central problem of combining recordings to identify the dynamical building blocks of the motor program (Figure 1B, step 2). We had identified a database of 147 ensembles across all recordings. We classified these ensembles into one of four classes defined by significant peaks or troughs in their autocorrelograms (Figure 4; Experimental Procedures), which allowed us to capture their oscillation pattern invariant to the timescale or intensity of the motor program execution to which they belonged. We show below that this broad classification allowed us to isolate dynamical systems within each recording. We found all four possible classes of oscillation pattern existed within the locomotion motor program (Figure 4). Most ensembles (85%) fell into the three classes of oscillator: “oscillatory” (63%); “bursters” (19%); and “pausers” (3%). The remaining 15% of ensembles had no strong oscillation, yet neurons in these ensembles were recruited by the onset of the motor program (Figure S4). These data suggest that a neural motor program also incorporates neural ensembles that are not manifestations of some oscillation. We found that the oscillator and burster classes identified separate dynamic systems. For each recording, we selected the subset of ensembles belonging to a particular class and then projected all neurons in that selected population into a low-dimensional space using PCA to visualize the population dynamics (Briggman et al., 2005Briggman K.L. Abarbanel H.D.I. Kristan Jr., W.B. Optical imaging of neuronal populations during decision-making.Science. 2005; 307: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Levi et al., 2005Levi R.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9807-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In most recordings, we found that the oscillator-class population was dominated by an oscillation of constant amplitude and frequency throughout the program’s execution, shown by the first principal component (Figure 5A). Projecting the population onto the first two principal components showed that this constant oscillation corresponded to a constant rotation of population activity (Figure 5A). Such consistent rotation in two dimensions indicates that the underlying oscillatory activity in this population was phase locked throughout the recording. In recordings with sufficient numbers of identified burster-class ensembles, we found that the burster-class population was dominated by evolving activity over the course of the program, shown by the first principal component (Figure 5B). To confirm this, we correlated the projection onto the first principal component against time and found a strong relationship (median r2 = 0.34, n = 11 recordings), consistent with a change in baseline activity over time. Projecting the population onto the first two principal components showed that this evolving oscillation did not correspond to a constant rotation of population activity (Figure 5B). Our identification of four classes of oscillation pattern shows that the locomotion motor program can be decomposed into at least three dynamic systems, one showing correlated firing but not oscillating (“non-oscillators”); one that implements a constant oscillator (“oscillators”); and one that evolves over the program’s execution (“bursters”). The pauser class may correspond to a fourth separate dynamic system, but no single recording contained sufficient numbers for us to check. Having identified these four classes of dynamical building blocks of the motor program, we then sought to understand how they are distributed over the physical network (Figure 1B, step 3). To do so, we took the map of extrapolated ensemble locations for each recording (such as the example in Figure 3C) and labeled each location with the oscillatory class of that ensemble. We then"

The objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia at Ayder Referral Hospital and Mekelle Hospital in Mekelle, Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. Methods The study was a cross-sectional survey in which sociodemographic characteristics, drug attitudes, insight and side effects were measured and explored in terms of their relationship with medication adherence. A structured questionnaire as a data collection tool was used. Data were analyzed with the help of SPSS Version 20.0. Results A total of 393 patients participated, 26.5% were non-adherent to their antipsychotic medication. The factors significantly associated with better adherence were positive treatment attitudes (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.55), fewer side effects (AOR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), awareness of illness (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.85) and the ability to relabel symptoms (AOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.07). However, khat chewers (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.68), being illiterate (AOR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) and older age group (AOR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.16) were associated with less medication adherence. Conclusions A high prevalence of medication non-adherence was found among patients with schizophrenia. Intervention strategies focused on educating the patients to better understand the illness, medications and their potential side effects might be useful in improving adherence to antipsychotic medication treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2103568211,"Although the coding transformation between visual thalamus and cortex has been known for over 50 years, whether a similar transformation occurs between auditory thalamus and cortex has remained elusive. Such a transformation may occur for time-varying sounds, such as music or speech. Most subcortical neurons explicitly encode the temporal structure of sounds with the temporal structure of their activity, but many auditory cortical neurons instead use a rate code. The mechanisms for this transformation from temporal code to rate code have remained unknown. Here we report that the membrane potential of rat auditory cortical neurons can show stimulus synchronization to rates up to 500 Hz, even when the spiking output does not. Synaptic inputs to rate-coding neurons arose in part from temporal-coding neurons but were transformed by voltage-dependent properties and push-pull excitatory-inhibitory interactions. This suggests that the transformation from temporal to rate code can be observed within individual cortical neurons."

However, it remains unclear the expression pattern and biological function of OCT4 isoforms in cervical cancer. Here, we reported that both nuclear OCT4A and cytoplasmic OCT4B were overexpressed in CC. OCT4A was responsible for self-renewal of cervical cancer stem–like cells (CCSCs). Furthermore, OCT4B overexpression in SiHa cervical cancer cell line significantly increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptosis. Moreover, OCT4B enhanced angiogenesis by the upregulation of CD34, VEGF, HIF-1α and IL-6, and promoted tumor cell mobility to the surrounding tissue by the upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9, and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In conclusion, nuclear OCT4A may serve as a marker of CCSCs and the driving force for cervical cancer metastasis and recurrence, while cytoplasmic OCT4B may cooperate with OCT4A to regulate the progression of cervical cancer through inducing angiogenesis and EMT."

In this study, a mercury-reducing bacterium, Photobacterium spp. strain MELD1, with an MIC of 33 mg x kg(-1) mercury was isolated from a severely mercury and dioxin contaminated rhizosphere soil of reed (Phragmites australis). While the whole genome sequencing of MELD1 confirmed the presence of a mer operon, the mercury reductase MerA gene showed 99% sequence identity to Vibrio shilloni AK1 and implicates its route resulted from the event of horizontal gene transfer. The efficiency of MELD1 to vaporize mercury (25 mg x kg(-1), 24 h) and its tolerance to toxic metals and xenobiotics such as lead, cadmium, pentachlorophenol, pentachloroethylene, 3-chlorobenzoic acid, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is promising. Combination of a long yard bean (Vigna unguiculata ssp. Sesquipedalis) and strain MELD1 proved beneficial in the phytoprotection of mercury in vivo. The effect of mercury (Hg) on growth, distribution and tolerance was examined in root, shoot, leaves and pod of yard long bean with and without the inoculation of strain MELD1. The model plant inoculated with MELD1 had significant increases in biomass, root length, seed number, and increased mercury uptake limited to roots. Biolog plate assay were used to assess the sole-carbon source utilization pattern of the isolate and Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) productivity was analyzed to examine if the strain could contribute to plant growth.

However, distribution and frequencies of mutations in PAM pathway are unclear in breast cancer patients from the mainland of China and the correlation between these mutations and breast cancer outcome remains to be identified.A total of 288 patients with invasive ductal breast cancer were recruited in this study. Mutations in PIK3CA (exons 4, 9 and 20), KRAS (exon 2) and AKT1 (exon 3) were detected using Sanger sequencing. PTEN loss was measured by immunohistochemistry assay. Correlations between these genetic aberrations and clinicopathological features were analyzed.The frequencies of PIK3CA mutation, KRAS mutation, AKT1 mutation and PTEN loss were 15.6%, 1.8%, 4.4% and 35.3%, respectively. However, except for PTEN loss, which was tied to estrogen receptor (ER) status, these alterations were not associated with other clinicopathological features. Survival analysis demonstrated that PIK3CA mutation, PTEN loss and PAM pathway activation were not associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Subgroup analysis of patients with ER positive tumors revealed that PIK3CA mutation more strongly reduced DFS compared to wild-type PIK3CA (76.2% vs. 54.2%; P = 0.011). PIK3CA mutation was also an independent factor for bad prognosis in ER positive patients.AKT1, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss all exist in women with breast cancer in the mainland China. PIK3CA mutation may contribute to the poor outcome of ER positive breast carcinomas, providing evidence for the combination of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and endocrine therapy."

Yet, surrounded by one of the biggest economic rims of China, its ecological functions have been declining rapidly in recent two decades under the heavy anthropogenic impacts. The Laizhou Bay is the smallest one of the three main bays in the Bohai Sea. Owing to the rich brine deposits, chemical industries using brine as raw materials are booming in the southern coast of the Laizhou Bay, the scale of which ranks as the largest one in China. In order to monitor and assess the environmental quality, surface sediments were collected from the coastal waters of southwestern Laizhou Bay and the rivers it connects with during summer and autumn in 2012, and analyzed for heavy metals. Several widely adopted methods were used in the overall assessment of heavy metal pollution status and potential ecological risks in these sediments, and the data were analyzed to infer the main sources of the pollutants. The results showed that the remarkably high concentrations of heavy metals were almost all recorded in a small number of riverine sites. Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were the main environmental threat according to the sediment quality guidelines. The marine area was generally in good condition with no or low risk from the studied metals and adverse effects on biota could hardly occur. Natural sources dominated the concentrations and distributions of Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the marine area. Our results indicated that heavy metal pollution was not a main cause of the ecological degradation of the Laizhou Bay at present."

We tested hypotheses that exposure to IPV, non-partner rape, hunger, pregnancy, depression and substance abuse predicted change in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell count in a dataset of 103 HIV infected young women aged 15-26 enrolled in a cluster randomised controlled trial. Multiple regression models were fitted to measure rate of change in CD4 and CD8 and including terms for age, person years of CD4+/CD8+ T-cell observation, HIV positivity at baseline, and stratum. Exposure variables included drug use, emotional, physical or sexual IPV exposure, non-partner rape, pregnancy and food insecurity. Mean CD4+ T cell count at baseline (or first HIV+ test) was 567.6 (range 1121-114). Participants were followed for an average of 1.3 years. The magnitude of change in CD4 T-cells was significantly associated with having ever experienced emotional abuse from a current partner at baseline or first HIV+ test (Coeff -132.9 95% CI -196.4, -69.4 p<0.0001) and drug use (Coeff -129.9 95% CI -238.7, -21.2 p=0.02). It was not associated with other measures. The change in CD8 T-cells was associated with having ever experienced emotional abuse at baseline or prior to the first HIV+ test (Coeff -178.4 95%CI -330.2, -26.5 p=0.02). In young ART-naive HIV positive women gender-based violence exposure in the form of emotional abuse is associated with a faster rate of decline in markers of cellular immunity. This highlights the importance of attending to emotional abuse when studying the physiological impact of IPV experience and the mechanisms of its impact on women’s health."
https://openalex.org/W1969907995,"Circulating redox state changes, determined by the ratio of reduced/oxidized pairs of different metabolites, have been associated with metabolic diseases. However, the pathogenic contribution of these changes and whether they modulate normal tissue function is unclear. As alterations in hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogen metabolism are hallmarks that characterize insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we tested whether imposed changes in the extracellular redox state could modulate these processes. Thus, primary hepatocytes were treated with different ratios of the following physiological extracellular redox couples: β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB)/acetoacetate (Acoc), reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and cysteine/cystine. Exposure to a more oxidized ratio via extracellular βOHB/Acoc, GSH/GSSG, and cysteine/cystine in hepatocytes from fed mice increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide without causing oxidative damage. On the other hand, addition of more reduced ratios of extracellular βOHB/Acoc led to increased NAD(P)H and maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity in hepatocytes. Greater βOHB/Acoc ratios were also associated with decreased β-oxidation, as expected with enhanced lipogenesis. In hepatocytes from fasted mice, a more extracellular reduced state of βOHB/Acoc led to increased alanine-stimulated gluconeogenesis and enhanced glycogen synthesis capacity from added glucose. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that the extracellular redox state regulates the major metabolic functions of the liver and involves changes in intracellular NADH, hydrogen peroxide, and mitochondrial respiration. Because redox state in the blood can be communicated to all metabolically sensitive tissues, this work confirms the hypothesis that circulating redox state may be an important regulator of whole body metabolism and contribute to alterations associated with metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1992250578,"Many attempts have been made to find novel therapeutic strategies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), while their clinical efficacy is unclear. We have recently reported a novel rodent model of NASH using melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice, which exhibit the sequence of events that comprise hepatic steatosis, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma with obesity-related phenotypes. In the liver of MC4R-KO mice, there is a unique histological feature termed hepatic crown-like structures (hCLS), where macrophages interact with dead hepatocytes and fibrogenic cells, thereby accelerating inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we employed MC4R-KO mice to examine the effect of highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a clinically available n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, on the development of NASH. EPA treatment markedly prevented the development of hepatocyte injury, hCLS formation and liver fibrosis along with lipid accumulation. EPA treatment was also effective even after MC4R-KO mice developed NASH. Intriguingly, improvement of liver fibrosis was accompanied by the reduction of hCLS formation and plasma kallikrein-mediated transforming growth factor-β activation. Moreover, EPA treatment increased the otherwise reduced serum concentrations of adiponectin, an adipocytokine with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. Collectively, EPA treatment effectively prevents the development and progression of NASH in MC4R-KO mice along with amelioration of hepatic steatosis. This study unravels a novel anti-fibrotic mechanism of EPA, thereby suggesting a clinical implication for the treatment of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2001271493,"Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is an endonuclease that catalyzes the essential removal of the 5′ end of tRNA precursors. Until recently, all identified RNase P enzymes were a ribonucleoprotein with a conserved catalytic RNA component. However, the discovery of protein-only RNase P (PRORP) shifted this paradigm, affording a unique opportunity to compare mechanistic strategies used by naturally evolved protein and RNA-based enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. Here we investigate the enzymatic mechanism of pre-tRNA hydrolysis catalyzed by the NYN (Nedd4-BP1, YacP nuclease) metallonuclease of Arabidopsis thaliana, PRORP1. Multiple and single turnover kinetic data support a mechanism where a step at or before chemistry is rate-limiting and provide a kinetic framework to interpret the results of metal alteration, mutations, and pH dependence. Catalytic activity has a cooperative dependence on the magnesium concentration (nH = 2) under kcat/Km conditions, suggesting that PRORP1 catalysis is optimal with at least two active site metal ions, consistent with the crystal structure. Metal rescue of Asp-to-Ala mutations identified two aspartates important for enhancing metal ion affinity. The single turnover pH dependence of pre-tRNA cleavage revealed a single ionization (pKa ∼ 8.7) important for catalysis, consistent with deprotonation of a metal-bound water nucleophile. The pH and metal dependence mirrors that observed for the RNA-based RNase P, suggesting similar catalytic mechanisms. Thus, despite different macromolecular composition, the RNA and protein-based RNase P act as dynamic scaffolds for the binding and positioning of magnesium ions to catalyze phosphodiester bond hydrolysis.Background: A protein-only ribonuclease P (PRORP) has been recently discovered.Results: PRORP activity has a single ionization (pKa ∼ 8.7) important for catalysis and a cooperative dependence on Mg2+ (nH = 2).Conclusion: PRORP uses catalytic strategies similar to RNA-dependent RNase P.Significance: These results provide evidence for the mechanistic convergence of two different enzymatic macromolecules (RNA and protein) that perform the same biological function. Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is an endonuclease that catalyzes the essential removal of the 5′ end of tRNA precursors. Until recently, all identified RNase P enzymes were a ribonucleoprotein with a conserved catalytic RNA component. However, the discovery of protein-only RNase P (PRORP) shifted this paradigm, affording a unique opportunity to compare mechanistic strategies used by naturally evolved protein and RNA-based enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. Here we investigate the enzymatic mechanism of pre-tRNA hydrolysis catalyzed by the NYN (Nedd4-BP1, YacP nuclease) metallonuclease of Arabidopsis thaliana, PRORP1. Multiple and single turnover kinetic data support a mechanism where a step at or before chemistry is rate-limiting and provide a kinetic framework to interpret the results of metal alteration, mutations, and pH dependence. Catalytic activity has a cooperative dependence on the magnesium concentration (nH = 2) under kcat/Km conditions, suggesting that PRORP1 catalysis is optimal with at least two active site metal ions, consistent with the crystal structure. Metal rescue of Asp-to-Ala mutations identified two aspartates important for enhancing metal ion affinity. The single turnover pH dependence of pre-tRNA cleavage revealed a single ionization (pKa ∼ 8.7) important for catalysis, consistent with deprotonation of a metal-bound water nucleophile. The pH and metal dependence mirrors that observed for the RNA-based RNase P, suggesting similar catalytic mechanisms. Thus, despite different macromolecular composition, the RNA and protein-based RNase P act as dynamic scaffolds for the binding and positioning of magnesium ions to catalyze phosphodiester bond hydrolysis. Background: A protein-only ribonuclease P (PRORP) has been recently discovered. Results: PRORP activity has a single ionization (pKa ∼ 8.7) important for catalysis and a cooperative dependence on Mg2+ (nH = 2). Conclusion: PRORP uses catalytic strategies similar to RNA-dependent RNase P. Significance: These results provide evidence for the mechanistic convergence of two different enzymatic macromolecules (RNA and protein) that perform the same biological function."

However, little is known about its function and mechanism involving in NPC development and progression.Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect miR-145 expression in NPC cell lines and clinical samples. Wound healing, Transwell migration and invasion, three-dimension spheroid invasion assays, and lung metastasis model were performed to test the migratory, invasive, and metastatic ability of NPC cells. Luciferase reporter assay, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blotting were used to verify the target of miR-145.MiR-145 was obviously decreased in NPC cell lines and clinical samples (P<0.01). Ectopic overexpression of miR-145 significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive ability of SUNE-1 and CNE-2 cells. In addition, stably overexpressing of miR-145 in SUNE-1 cells could remarkably restrain the formation of metastatic nodes in the lungs of mice. Furthermore, fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) was verified as a target of miR-145, and silencing FSCN1 with small RNA interfering RNA could suppress NPC cell migration and invasion.Our findings demonstrated that miR-145 function as a tumor suppressor in NPC development and progression via targeting FSCN1, which could sever as a potential novel therapeutic target for patients with NPC."

These proteins are further substituted by sperm-specific protamines, P1 and P2, to form a highly condensed sperm chromatin. In spermatozoa, a small proportion of chromatin, which ranges from 1 to 10% in mammals, retains the nucleosomal architecture and is implicated to play a role in transgenerational inheritance. However, there is still no mechanistic understanding of the interaction of chromatin machinery with histones and transition proteins, which facilitate this selective histone replacement from chromatin. Here, we report the identification of 16 and 19 novel post-translational modifications on rat endogenous transition proteins, TP1 and TP2, respectively, by mass spectrometry. By in vitro assays and mutational analysis, we demonstrate that protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT4 (CARM1) methylates TP2 at Arg71, Arg75, and Arg92 residues, and lysine methyltransferase KMT7 (Set9) methylates TP2 at Lys88 and Lys91 residues.

Significance: This work provides insight into the chromatin remodeling events during spermiogenesis and establishment of the sperm epigenome. Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged with canonical histones and its variants constituting the nucleosomal architecture of chromatin. Chromatin proteins, including histones, harbor several post-translational modifications, and this epigenetic landscape of chromatin proteins along with effector proteins determines the chromatin structure and mediates several chromatin-templated processes (1.Bannister A.J.

This chromatin architecture is continuously reconfigured during male germ cell differentiation. Mammalian spermatogenesis is a developmental process in which diploid spermatogonial stem cells differentiate to haploid spermatozoa. Spermiogenesis is the last phase of spermatogenesis, during which haploid round spermatids undergo change in their cellular and nuclear morphology to form mature sperms, accompanied by a remarkable change in chromatin structure and composition (3.Rathke C.

The nucleosomal architecture of haploid round spermatids is transformed into toroidal nucleoprotamine fiber in the mature spermatozoa in a two-step process. In the first step, intermediate basic proteins, transition proteins replace 90% of the histones. In the second step, highly basic proteins, protamines replace transition proteins to occupy 90–99% of the sperm chromatin in different mammals (3.Rathke C. Baarends W.M. Awe S. Renkawitz-Pohl R.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In rats, spermiogenesis comprises of 19 steps. During the first eight steps, haploid round spermatids are transcriptionally active, which ceases in step 9 or 10 as the chromatin reconfiguration process is initiated (4.Meistrich M.L. Mohapatra B. Shirley C.R. Zhao M. Roles of transition nuclear proteins in spermiogenesis.Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Histone eviction begins with histone H4 hyperacetylation during steps 9–12, initiating the deposition of the transition proteins. Brdt, a double bromodomain protein, is suggested to facilitate eviction of histones by recognizing acetylated histone H4 and through its interaction with Smarce1 (BAF57), a key member of ATP-dependent remodeling complex SWI/SNF (10.Dhar S.

Transition proteins (TP1, TP2, and TP4) replace most of the histones and briefly organize the chromatin during spermiogenesis steps 12–15. Protamines (P1 and P2) are deposited with a concomitant complete replacement of the transition proteins during steps 16–19 to decorate the sperm chromatin (3.Rathke C. Baarends W.M. Awe S.

Sperm nucleosomes are largely present in intergenic and intronic regions and associate with retrotransposable elements and centromeric repeats. A small subset of sperm nucleosomes are retained in the promoter regions of development-regulatory proteins, which become activated in preimplantation embryos (13.Samans B. Yang Y. Krebs S.

Many of the sperm nucleosomal loci exhibit characteristic active and repressive histone modifications, reflecting their expression status in embryogenesis (9.Brykczynska U. Hisano M. Erkek S.

Recently, mouse sperm protamines also have been demonstrated to harbor post-translational modifications (17.Brunner A.M. Nanni P. Mansuy I.M. Epigenetic marking of sperm by post-translational modification of histones and protamines.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2014; 7: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, sperm chromatin has a defined epigenetic signature and is suggested to play a fundamental role in transgenerational inheritance (17.Brunner A.M. Nanni P. Mansuy I.M.

However, the mechanism of selective histone replacement at defined chromatin regions during spermiogenesis is not known (6.Gaucher J. Reynoird N. Montellier E. Boussouar F. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. From meiosis to postmeiotic events: the secrets of histone disappearance.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The genomic positioning of residual histones in sperm chromatin is determined in early spermatids when the majority of the histones are replaced by transition proteins. This is indicative of a role that transition proteins may play to establish the sperm epigenome. Transition proteins are believed to have evolved in mammals (4.Meistrich M.L. Mohapatra B. Shirley C.R. Zhao M. Roles of transition nuclear proteins in spermiogenesis.Chromosoma. 2003; 111: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); however, a TP-like protein has been described in Drosophila (3.Rathke C.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In mammals, TPs are indispensable because TP1−/− and TP2−/− double mutant mice are infertile (20.Shirley C.R. Hayashi S. Mounsey S. Yanagimachi R. Meistrich M.L. Abnormalities and reduced reproductive potential of sperm from Tnp1- and Tnp2-null double mutant mice.Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Transition proteins TP1, TP2, and TP4 constitute 90% of chromatin basic proteins in condensing spermatids before protamine deposition. The levels of TP1 are 2.5 times that of TP2, whereas TP4 represents only 2% of the total basic proteins of condensing spermatids (4.Meistrich M.L. Mohapatra B. Shirley C.R. Zhao M.

Global chromatin remodeling during mammalian spermiogenesis is poorly understood, with little information available about chaperones, chromatin remodelers, DNA repair pathways, nuclear shaping, proteasomal pathways, chromatin modification writers, erasers, and effectors involved in the chromatin restructuring events (3.Rathke C.

Based on the premise that, similar to the known diverse biological functions of histone modifications, the post-translational modifications of transition proteins may also play a critical role in the chromatin restructuring process during mammalian spermiogenesis, we embarked to comprehensively identify PTMs 4The abbreviations used are: PTMpost-translational modificationWBWestern blotSRSsonication-resistant spermatidPCAperchloric acidAUTacid-urea-TritonTPtransition proteinrTP2recombinant TP2PRMTprotein arginine methyltransferaseK25me1K39me1, K88me1, K91me1, and R92me1, lysine 25, 39, 88, and 91 and arginine 92 monomethylation, respectivelyK83me2 and R92me2lysine 83 and arginine 92 dimethylation, respectivelyH3R17me2ahistone H3 arginine 17 asymmetric dimethylation. of the two major transition proteins, TP1 and TP2.

Furthermore, we demonstrate PRMT4 (also known as CARM1) and KMT7 (also known as Set7/9 or Set9) as the enzymes responsible for the catalysis of arginine and lysine methylation of TP2, respectively. The results described here establish the PTM repertoire of TP1 and TP2, which, in combination with the diverse roles of chromatin modifiers and readers, should provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlining the global chromatin remodeling event during the late steps of mammalian male germ cell differentiation and consequently establishment of the sperm epigenome. post-translational modification Western blot sonication-resistant spermatid perchloric acid acid-urea-Triton transition protein recombinant TP2 protein arginine methyltransferase K39me1, K88me1, K91me1, and R92me1, lysine 25, 39, 88, and 91 and arginine 92 monomethylation, respectively lysine 83 and arginine 92 dimethylation, respectively histone H3 arginine 17 asymmetric dimethylation.

Plasmids expressing mutant PRMT4 or rTP2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent) following the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sequences used for cloning and mutagenesis are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers used for quantitative PCR, semiquantitative PCR, cloning, and mutations Open table in a new tab TP2 plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen). Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C shaking. Bacterial cells from 1 liter of culture were pelleted at 3,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 25–30 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.57 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF) and 1 mg/ml chicken egg white lysozyme. After a 30 min incubation on ice with intermittent vortexing, cells were lysed by sonication at a pulse of 5 s on/7 s off, 40% amplitude for 10 min, and centrifuged at 13,400 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. Supernatant was centrifuged again for 40 min, followed by another spin of 30 min until the supernatant was clarified. Heparin-agarose beads (Sigma) were equilibrated in lysis buffer, and 500 μl of beads were added to the supernatant and kept for 4 h (to overnight) binding in an end-to-end rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed three times through the column at a slow flow rate, allowing beads to settle, followed by a wash with 5 volumes of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by a step gradient of increasing salt concentration of 0.6, 1, and 1.4 m NaCl in lysis buffer, and 500-μl fractions were collected. The fractions were checked on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the presence of TP2 protein, and the selected fractions were dialyzed against 1% acetic acid with 10 μm ZnSO4. Dialyzed samples were lyophilized and reconstituted in water. The following antibodies were used: anti-PRMT4 (P4995, Sigma; WB, 1:500; immunofluorescence, 1:50), anti-KMT7 (ab119400, Abcam; WB, 1:500; immunofluorescence, 1:50), anti-H3 (39163, Active Motif; WB, 1:5,000), anti-H3R17me2a (07-214, Millipore; WB, 1:500), anti-Rme1 (8015, Cell Signaling; WB, 1:1,000), anti-Rme2a (39231, Active Motif; WB, 1:500), anti-Rme2s (07-413, Millipore; WB, 1:500), anti-Kme1/2 (ab23366, Abcam; WB, 1:500), and anti-H4 (05–858, Millipore; WB, 1:10,000).

Antigens were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the cysteine residue. After sufficient boosters, blood was collected from the marginal ear vein of rabbit. The blood was collected from mouse by retro-orbital blood collection method. Blood was kept at room temperature to allow it to clot. Separated serum was transferred to fresh tubes.

SNAREs zipper up from the N to C terminus bringing the two membranes into close apposition. Their transmembrane domains (TMDs) might be mere anchoring devices, deforming bilayers by mechanical force. Structural studies suggested that TMDs might also perturb lipid structure by undergoing conformational transitions or by zipping up into the bilayer. Here, we tested this latter hypothesis, which predicts that the activity of SNAREs should depend on the primary sequence of their TMDs. We replaced the TMDs of all vacuolar SNAREs (Nyv1, Vam3, and Vti1) by a lipid anchor, by a TMD from a protein unrelated to the membrane fusion machinery, or by artificial leucine-valine sequences. Individual exchange of the native SNARE TMDs against an unrelated transmembrane anchor or an artificial leucine-valine sequence yielded normal fusion activities. Fusion activity was also preserved upon pairwise exchange of the TMDs against unrelated peptides, which eliminates the possibility for specific TMD-TMD interactions. Thus, a specific primary sequence or zippering beyond the SNARE domains is not a prerequisite for fusion. Lipid-anchored Vti1 was fully active, and lipid-anchored Nyv1 permitted the reaction to proceed up to hemifusion, and lipid-anchored Vam3 interfered already before hemifusion. The unequal contribution of proteinaceous TMDs on Vam3 and Nyv1 suggests that Q- and R-SNAREs might make different contributions to the hemifusion intermediate and the opening of the fusion pore.

We asked 345 nurses (17 men and 328 women) about their intention to leave their jobs after the accident. We also asked about relevant factors including the participants’ demographic factors, living situation, working status, and knowledge of radiation health effects. We found that living with preschoolers (OR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.02–3.44, p = 0.042), anxiety about life in Fukushima City after the accident (OR = 5.55, 95%CI: 1.18–26.13, p = 0.030), consideration of evacuation from Fukushima after the accident (OR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.45–4.06, p = 0.001), consideration of the possible radiation health effects in children (OR = 1.90, 95%CI: 1.02–3.44, p = 0.042), and anxiety about relationships with colleagues in the hospital after the accident (OR = 3.23, p = 0.001) were independently associated with the nurses’ intention to leave their jobs after the accident. On the other hand, the percentage of nurses with knowledge on radiation health effects was relatively low among those who had the intention to leave the job and among those who did not have the intention to leave the job after the accident, with no significant differences between the two groups. Our results suggest the need for an education program for nurses regarding radiation health effects."
https://openalex.org/W1992135143,"Glabridin is an isoflavan from licorice root, which is a common component of herbal remedies used for treatment of menopausal symptoms. Past studies have shown that glabridin resulted in favorable outcome similar to 17β-estradiol (17β-E2), suggesting a possible role as an estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). This study aims to evaluate the estrogenic effect of glabridin in an in-vitro endometrial cell line -Ishikawa cells via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and ER-α-SRC-1-co-activator assay. Its effect on cell proliferation was also evaluated using Thiazoyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results showed that glabridin activated the ER-α-SRC-1-co-activator complex and displayed a dose-dependent increase in estrogenic activity supporting its use as an ERT. However, glabridin also induced an increase in cell proliferation. When glabridin was treated together with 17β-E2, synergistic estrogenic effect was observed with a slight decrease in cell proliferation as compared to treatment by 17β-E2 alone. This suggest that the combination might be better suited for providing high estrogenic effects with lower incidences of endometrial cancer that is associated with 17β-E2."
https://openalex.org/W2120348732,"Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical dysfunction contributes to morbidity and mortality in a high proportion of patients with sepsis. Here, we provide new insights into the underlying adrenal pathology. Using a murine model of endotoxemia (LPS injection), we demonstrate that adrenal insufficiency is triggered early in the disease. LPS induced a local inflammatory response in the adrenal gland within 4 hours of administration, coupled with increased expression of mRNAs for annexin A1 (AnxA1) and the formyl peptide receptors [(Fprs) 1, 2, and 3], a loss of lipid droplets in cortical cells (index of availability of cholesterol, the substrate for steroidogenesis), and a failure to mount a steroidogenic response to ACTH. Deletion of AnxA1 or Fpr2/3 in mice prevented lipid droplet loss, but not leukocyte infiltration. LPS increased adrenal myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and TLR2 mRNA expression, but not lymphocyte antigen 96 or TLR4. By contrast, neutrophil depletion prevented leukocyte infiltration and increased AnxA1, Fpr1, and Fpr3 mRNAs but had no impact on lipid droplet loss. Our novel data demonstrate that AnxA1 and Fpr2 have a critical role in the manifestation of adrenal insufficiency in this model, through regulation of cholesterol ester storage, suggesting that pharmacologic interventions targeting the AnxA1/FPR/ALX pathway may provide a new approach for the maintenance of adrenal steroidogenesis in sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W2154225307,"Plant chemical defense against herbivores is a complex process which involves a number of secondary compounds. It is known that the concentration of leaf surface lipophilic compounds (SLCs), particularly those of flavonoid aglycones are increased with the defoliation treatment of silver birch Betula pendula. In this study we investigated how the alteration of SLCs concentration in the food affects the fitness and innate immunity of the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar. We found that a low SLCs concentrations in consumed leaves led to a rapid larval development and increased females’ pupae weight (= fecundity) compared to larvae fed with leaves with high SLCs content. Inversely, increasing the compounds concentration in an artificial diet produced the reverse effects: decreases in both larval weight and larval survival. Low SLCs concentrations in tree leaves differently affected larval innate immunity parameters. For both sexes, total hemocytes count in the hemolymph increased, while the activity of plasma phenoloxidase decreased when larvae consume leaves with reduced content of SLCs. Our results clearly demonstrate that the concentration of SLCs in silver birch leaves affects not only gypsy moth fitness but also their innate immune status which might alter the potential resistance of insects against infections and/or parasitoids."

Here, we compare two human bronchial epithelial cell lines, i.e. Hla-susceptible 16HBE14o- and Hla-resistant S9 cells, by a quantitative multi-omics strategy for a better understanding of Hla-induced cellular programs. Phosphoproteomics revealed a substantial impact on phosphorylation-dependent signaling in both cell models and highlights alterations in signaling pathways associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts as well as the actin cytoskeleton as key features of early rHla-induced effects. Along comparable changes in down-stream activity of major protein kinases significant differences between both models were found upon rHla-treatment including activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK1/3 signaling in S9 and repression in 16HBE14o- cells. System-wide transcript and protein expression profiling indicate induction of an immediate early response in either model. In addition, EGFR and MAPK1/3-mediated changes in gene expression suggest cellular recovery and survival in S9 cells but cell death in 16HBE14o- cells. Strikingly, inhibition of the EGFR sensitized S9 cells to Hla indicating that the cellular capacity of activation of the EGFR is a major protective determinant against Hla-mediated cytotoxic effects."

Some of these proteins have been shown to manipulate or subvert cellular processes during infection, but functional roles of a majority of them remain unknown. Lpg0393 is a newly identified Legionella effector classified as a hypothetical protein. Through X-ray crystallographic analysis, we show that Lpg0393 contains a Vps9-like domain, which is structurally most similar to the catalytic core of human Rabex-5 that activates the endosomal Rab proteins Rab5, Rab21 and Rab22. Consistently, Lpg0393 exhibited a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor activity toward the endosomal Rabs. This work identifies the first example of a bacterial guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that is active towards the Rab5 sub-cluster members, implying that the activation of these Rab proteins might be advantageous for the intracellular survival of Legionella."

Eleven competitive male players (13.4 ± 1.3 years) completed both a playing and nonplaying HIIT session of equal distance, in random order. During each HIIT session, heart rate (HR), blood lactate, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored. Before and after each HIIT session, the velocity and accuracy of the serve, and forehand and backhand strokes were evaluated. The results demonstrated that both HIIT sessions achieved an average HR greater than 90% HRmax. The physiological demands (average HR) were greater during the playing session compared to the nonplaying session, despite similar lactate concentrations and a lower RPE. The results also indicate a reduction in shot velocity after both HIIT sessions; however, the playing HIIT session had a more deleterious effect on stroke accuracy. These findings suggest that 1) both HIIT sessions may be sufficient to develop maximal aerobic power, 2) playing HIIT sessions provide a greater physiological demand with a lower RPE, and 3) playing HIIT has a greater deleterious effect on stroke performance, and in particular on the accuracy component of the ground stroke performance, and should be incorporated appropriately into a periodization program in young male tennis players."
https://openalex.org/W2003007218,"The serine peptidases of Trypanosoma brucei have been viewed as potential drug targets. In particular, the S9 prolyl oligopeptidase subfamily is thought to be a good avenue for drug discovery. This is based on the finding that some S9 peptidases are secreted and active in the mammalian bloodstream, and that they are a class of enzyme against which drugs have successfully been developed. We collated a list of all serine peptidases in T. brucei, identifying 20 serine peptidase genes, of which nine are S9 peptidases. We screened all 20 serine peptidases by RNAi to determine which, if any, are essential for bloodstream form T. brucei survival. All S9 serine peptidases were dispensable for parasite survival in vitro, even when pairs of similar genes, coding for oligopeptidase B or prolyl oligopeptidase, were targeted simultaneously. We also found no effect on parasite survival in an animal host when the S9 peptidases oligopeptidase B, prolyl oligopeptidase or dipeptidyl peptidase 8 were targeted. The only serine peptidase to emerge from the RNAi screen as essential was a putative type-I signal peptide peptidase (SPP1). This gene was essential for parasite survival both in vitro and in vivo. The growth defect conferred by RNAi depletion of SPP1 was rescued by expression of a functional peptidase from an RNAi resistant SPP1 gene. However, expression of catalytically inactive SPP1 was unable to rescue cells from the SPP1 depleted phenotype, demonstrating that SPP1 serine peptidase activity is necessary for T. brucei survival."

However, few studies have attempted to identify eQTL in racially admixed populations such as Hispanics. Methods We performed a systematic eQTL study to identify regulatory variants of gene expression in whole blood from 121 Puerto Rican children with (n = 63) and without (n = 58) asthma. Genome-wide genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Omni2.5M Bead Chip, and gene expression was assessed using the Illumina HT-12 microarray. After completing quality control, we performed a pair-wise genome analysis of ~15 K transcripts and ~1.3 M SNPs for both local and distal effects. This analysis was conducted under a regression framework adjusting for age, gender and principal components derived from both genotypic and mRNA data. We used a false discovery rate (FDR) approach to identify significant eQTL signals, which were next compared to top eQTL signals from existing eQTL databases. We then performed a pathway analysis for our top genes. Results We identified 36,720 local pairs in 3,391 unique genes and 1,851 distal pairs in 446 unique genes at FDR <0.05, corresponding to unadjusted P values lower than 1.5x10-4 and 4.5x10-9, respectively. A significant proportion of genes identified in our study overlapped with those identified in previous studies. We also found an enrichment of disease-related genes in our eQTL list. Conclusions We present results from the first eQTL study in Puerto Rican children, who are members of a unique Hispanic cohort disproportionately affected with asthma, prematurity, obesity and other common diseases. Our study confirmed eQTL signals identified in other ethnic groups, while also detecting additional eQTLs unique to our study population. The identified eQTLs will help prioritize findings from future genome-wide association studies in Puerto Ricans."
https://openalex.org/W2092399404,"The non-stereospecific α-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase E (DehE) degrades many halogenated compounds but is ineffective against β-halogenated compounds such as 3-chloropropionic acid (3CP). Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and site-directed mutagenesis we show here that introducing the mutation S188V into DehE improves substrate specificity towards 3CP. MD simulations showed that residues W34, F37, and S188 of DehE were crucial for substrate binding. DehE showed strong binding ability for D-2-chloropropionic acid (D-2CP) and L-2-chloropropionic acid (L-2CP) but less affinity for 3CP. This reduced affinity was attributed to weak hydrogen bonding between 3CP and residue S188, as the carboxylate of 3CP forms rapidly interconverting hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide and side chain hydroxyl group of S188. By replacing S188 with a valine residue, we reduced the inter-molecular distance and stabilised bonding of the carboxylate of 3CP to hydrogens of the substrate-binding residues. Therefore, the S188V can act on 3CP, although its affinity is less strong than for D-2CP and L-2CP as assessed by Km. This successful alteration of DehE substrate specificity may promote the application of protein engineering strategies to other dehalogenases, thereby generating valuable tools for future bioremediation technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2068727558,"Liposomes are promising vehicles to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic agents to cells in vivo. After uptake into cells by endocytosis, liposomes are degraded in the endolysosomal system. Consequently, the encapsulated cargo molecules frequently remain sequestered in endosomal compartments; this limits their usefulness in many applications (e.g. gene delivery). To overcome this, various fusogenic peptides have been developed to facilitate delivery of liposomally-encapsulated molecules into the cytosol. One such peptide is the pH-sensitive influenza-derived peptide INF7. Liposomal delivery of imaging agents is an attractive approach for enabling cell imaging and cell tracking in vivo, but can be hampered by inadequate intracellular accumulation and retention of probes caused by exocytosis (and possible degradation) of endosome-entrapped probes. Such signal loss could be minimized by facilitating escape of probe molecules from endolysosomal compartments into the cytosol. We investigated the ability of co-encapsulated INF7 to release liposomally-delivered rhodamine fluorophores into the cytosol after endosomal acidification/maturation. We co-encapsulated INF7 and fluorescent rhodamine derivatives having vastly different transport properties to show that after endocytosis by CV1 cells, the INF7 peptide is activated by acidic endosomal pH and facilitates efficient release of the fluorescent tracers into the cytosol. Furthermore, we show that INF7-facilitated escape from endosomes markedly enhanced retention of tracers that cannot be actively extruded from the cytosol. Minimizing loss of intracellular probes improves cellular imaging by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of images and lengthening the time window that imaging can be performed. In particular, this will enhance in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, an emergent magnetic resonance imaging modality requires exogenous paramagnetic imaging agents and is highly promising for cellular and molecular imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2069158348,"Couplings between protein sub-structures are a common property of protein dynamics. Some of these couplings are especially interesting since they relate to function and its regulation. In this article we have studied the case of cavity couplings because cavities can host functional sites, allosteric sites, and are the locus of interactions with the cell milieu. We have divided this problem into two parts. In the first part, we have explored the presence of cavity couplings in the natural dynamics of 75 proteins, using 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations. For each of these proteins, we have obtained two trajectories around their native state. After applying a stringent filtering procedure, we found significant cavity correlations in 60% of the proteins. We analyze and discuss the structure origins of these correlations, including neighbourhood, cavity distance, etc. In the second part of our study, we have used longer simulations (≥100 ns) from the MoDEL project, to obtain a broader view of cavity couplings, particularly about their dependence on time. Using moving window computations we explored the fluctuations of cavity couplings along time, finding that these couplings could fluctuate substantially during the trajectory, reaching in several cases correlations above 0.25/0.5. In summary, we describe the structural origin and the variations with time of cavity couplings. We complete our work with a brief discussion of the biological implications of these results."

Avian species contain only one family member, IFIT5, and little is known about the role of this protein in birds. In this study, duck IFIT5 (duIFIT5) full-length mRNA was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE). Based on the sequence obtained, we performed a series of bioinformatics analyses, and found that duIFIT5 was most similar to homologs in other avian species. Also, duIFIT5 contained eight conserved TPR motifs and two conserved multi-domains (TPR_11 and TPR_12). Finally, we used duck hepatitis virus type 1 (DHV-1) and polyriboinosinicpolyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) as a pathogen or a pathogen-associated molecular pattern induction to infect three-day-old domestic ducklings. The liver and spleen were collected to detect the change in duIFIT5 transcript level upon infection by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). DuIFIT5 expression rapidly increased after DHV-1 infection and maintained a high level, while the transcripts of duIFIT5 peaked at 8h after poly (I:C) infection and then returned to normal. Taken together, these results provide a greater understanding of avian IFIT5."

We examined whether prenatal care and social risk factors are confounding variables in the relationship between immigrant status and neonatal morbidity.Retrospective cohort study: 231 pregnant African immigrant women were recruited from 2007-2010 in northern Spain. A Spanish population sample was obtained by simple random sampling at 1:3 ratio. Immigrant status (Spanish, Sub-Saharan and Northern African), prenatal care (Kessner Index adequate, intermediate or inadequate), and social risk factors were treated as independent variables. Low birth weight (LBW < 2500 grams) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) were collected as neonatal morbidity variables. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Positive associations between immigrant women and higher risk of neonatal morbidity were obtained. Crude OR for preterm births in Northern Africans with respect to nonimmigrants was 2.28 (95% CI: 1.04-5.00), and crude OR for LBW was 1.77 (95% CI: 0.74-4.22). However, after adjusting for prenatal care and social risk factors, associations became protective: adjusted OR for preterm birth = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.14-1.32); LBW = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.15-1.52). Poor compliance with prenatal care was the main independent risk factor associated with both preterm birth (adjusted OR inadequate care = 17.05; 95% CI: 3.92-74.24) and LBW (adjusted OR inadequate care = 6.25; 95% CI: 1.28-30.46). Social risk was an important independent risk factor associated with LBW (adjusted OR = 5.42; 95% CI: 1.58-18.62).Prenatal care and social risk factors were major confounding variables in the relationship between immigrant status and neonatal morbidity."

In the present study we have investigated the mechanisms by which methylxanthines induce this aberrant overexpression. RT-PCR analyses suggested little impact of caffeine on SRSF2 total mRNA levels. Instead, caffeine induced changes in the levels of SRSF2 3′ UTR splice variants. Although some of these variants were substrates for nonsense-medicated decay (NMD), and could potentially have been stabilized by caffeine-mediated inhibition of NMD, down-regulation of NMD by a genetic approach was not sufficient to reproduce the phenotype. Furthermore, cell-based assays demonstrated that some of the caffeine-induced variants were intrinsically more efficiently translated than others; the addition of caffeine increased the translational efficiency of most SRSF2 transcripts. MicroRNA array analyses revealed a significant caffeine-mediated decrease in the expression of two SRSF2-targeting miRs, both of which were shown to repress translation of specific SRSF2 splice variants. These data support a complex model whereby caffeine down-regulates SRSF2-targeting microRNAs, leading to an increase in SRSF2 translation, which in turn induces SRSF2 splicing. SRSF2 splice variants are then stabilized by caffeine-mediated NMD inhibition, breaking the normal negative feedback loop and allowing the aberrant increase in SRSF2 protein levels. These findings highlight the complexity of SRSF2 gene regulation, and suggest ways in which SRSF2 expression may be dysregulated in disease.

https://openalex.org/W2028748030,"Human judgment and decision-making (JDM) requires an assessment of different choice options. While traditional theories of choice argue that cognitive processes are the main driver to reach a decision, growing evidence highlights the importance of emotion in decision-making. Following these findings, it appears relevant to understand how individuals asses the attractiveness or riskiness of a situation in terms of emotional processes. The following study aims at a better understanding of the psychophysiological mechanisms underlying threat sensitivity by measuring skin conductance responses (SCRs) in passive threat situations. While previous studies demonstrate the role of magnitude on emotional body reactions preceding an outcome, this study focuses on probability. In order to analyze emotional body reactions preceding negative events with varying probability of occurrence, we have our participants play a two-stage card game. The first stage of the card game reveals the probability of receiving an unpleasant electric shock. The second stage applies the electric shock with the previously announced probability. For the analysis, we focus on the time interval between the first and second stage. We observe a linear relation between SCRs in anticipation of receiving an electric shock and shock probability. This finding indicates that SCRs are able to code the likelihood of negative events. We outline how this coding function of SCRs during the anticipation of negative events might add to an understanding of human JDM."

This study aims to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in inflammation during macrophage-adipocyte interaction.White adipose tissues (WAT) from mice either on a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal chow (NC) were isolated to examine the expression of MKP-2. Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 stably expressing MKP-2 was used to study the regulation of MKP-2 in macrophages in response to saturated free fatty acid (FFA) and its role in macrophage M1/M2 activation. Macrophage-adipocyte co-culture system was employed to investigate the role of MKP-2 in regulating inflammation during adipocyte-macrophage interaction. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)- and p38-specific inhibitors were used to examine the mechanisms by which MKP-2 regulates macrophage activation and macrophage-adipocytes interaction.HFD changed the expression of MKP-2 in WAT, and MKP-2 was highly expressed in the stromal vascular cells (SVCs). MKP-2 inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to FFA stimulation in macrophages. MKP-2 inhibited macrophage M1 activation through JNK and p38. In addition, overexpression of MKP-2 in macrophages suppressed inflammation during macrophage-adipocyte interaction.MKP-2 is a negative regulator of macrophage M1 activation through JNK and p38 and inhibits inflammation during macrophage-adipocyte interaction."

Here, we describe the effect this module has on the aminoacylation and editing capacities of leucyl-tRNA synthetases (LeuRSs) by characterizing the key residues from various species. Mutation of highly conserved basic residues on the third α-helix of this domain impairs the affinity of LeuRS for the anticodon stem of tRNALeu, which decreases both aminoacylation and editing activities. Two glycine residues on this α-helix contribute to flexibility, leucine activation, and editing of LeuRS from Escherichia coli (EcLeuRS).

Based on sequence homology and the structures of the catalytic active sites, aaRSs are divided into two classes of 10 members each. Class I synthetases are further divided into three subclasses, a, b, and c, according to sequence homology (4.Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D.

Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) belongs to class I aaRSs that include a typical Rossmann dinucleotide-binding fold active site architecture with the signature sequence modules HIGH and KMSKS (6.Burbaum J.J. Schimmel P. Structural relationships and the classification of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16965-16968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to evolutionary models, the primitive catalytic core is extended by the insertion and/or fusion of additional domains (also called modules) in LeuRSs (7.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. The 2 Å crystal structure of leucyl-tRNA synthetase and its complex with a leucyl-adenylate analogue.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), most of which have inserted a large connective polypeptide 1 (CP1) domain that is responsible for amino acid editing. To ensure translation accuracy, LeuRSs have evolved a mechanism to remove aminoacyl AMP (aa-AMP; pre-transfer editing) and aa-tRNA (post-transfer editing) (8.Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Gr⊘tli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S.

Although post-transfer editing is carried out by the CP1 domain in most LeuRSs, this domain has been naturally deleted in LeuRS from Mycoplasma mobile (MmLeuRS) (9.Li L. Boniecki M.T. Jaffe J.D.

However, once the CP1 domain of LeuRS from Escherichia coli (EcLeuRS) is inserted into MmLeuRS, the engineered enzyme functions like a typical prokaryotic LeuRS with tRNA-dependent editing activity (10.Tan M.

The refined crystal structure of the EcLeuRS and tRNALeu complex revealed a tRNA anticodon binding domain composed of a cylindrical α-helical bundle domain of five helices that is common to all class Ia synthetases. EcLeuRS establishes nonspecific backbone contacts between tRNALeu nucleotides 12, 13, 22–26, and 42 with amino acid residues 667–686 and 749–760 of enzyme (PDB entry 4AQ7 and 4ARC, see Ref. 11.Palencia A.

Interestingly, a highly conserved structural module following the KMSKS loop exhibits the characteristic α-α-β-α topology in most class Ia and Ib aaRSs (Fig. 1A).

The last α-helix of the SC-fold is almost coaxial to the first α-helix of the helix bundle domain but is separated by a short linker segment in most class I synthetases (13.Sugiura I. Nureki O.

However, the SC-fold of LeuRS lacks this segment, and its last α-helix instead overlaps with the first α-helix of the helix bundle domain (Fig. 1A). A previous study suggested that the effect of this class Ia/b SC-fold domain on tRNA recognition is structure-dependent rather than sequence-dependent, because sequence is much less conserved than structure in this case (17.Casina V.C. Lobashevsky A.A. McKinney W.E. Brown C.L. Alexander R.W. Role for a conserved structural module in assembly of a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase active site.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SC-fold is likely to dock against the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA, thereby positioning the anticodon stem (13.Sugiura I. Nureki O. Ugaji-Yoshikawa Y. Kuwabara S. Shimada A.

Meanwhile, elements embedded in the sequence of each tRNA promote specific interactions with its cognate aaRS (22.Rogers H.H. Griffiths-Jones S. tRNA anticodon shifts in eukaryotic genomes.RNA. 2014; 20: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); for example, the so-called discriminator nucleotide A73 in tRNALeu is critical for both the aminoacylation and editing activities of LeuRS (23.Zhou X.L.

The tertiary interactions between the D- and T-loops that form the elbow region of L-shaped tRNALeu are critical elements for leucine identification (26.Du X. Wang E.D.

All these results were consistent with the seminal studies performed on isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase showing that the editing activity was influenced by the D-loop size of tRNAIle (29.Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. RNA determinants for translational editing. Mischarging a minihelix substrate by a tRNA synthetase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6835-6838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we systematically investigate the key residues of the conserved SC-fold structural module in prokaryotic and eukaryotic LeuRSs (Fig. 1B). Crucial basic and Gly residues in the third α-helix (α3) of the SC-fold were found to modulate the aminoacylation and editing activities of LeuRS. Additionally, several key residues of helix α3 interact with the tRNALeu anticodon stem, whereas acidic residues of the β-strand control the tRNA-dependent editing activity by sensing the size of the tRNALeu D-loop. These findings were further confirmed by experiments performed on the chimeric MmLeuRS-CP1/LSD enzyme, a minimalist LeuRS enzyme fused with the E. coli CP1 domain and LSD (21.Yan W. Tan M. Eriani G.

The role of the β-strand in enhancing the editing activity of the chimera was further confirmed by substituting the crucial residues for the E. coli enzyme. Together, these results support an influential role for the SC-fold module in both aminoacylation and editing functions of LeuRSs.

The MmtRNAUAALeu transcript and its mutated derivatives (-G12U, -G13U, -G24U, -C25U, -U39G, -C40U, -C41U, -C42U, -C41U/C42U) and the MmtRNACAALeu transcript and mutant (+C17a) all had accepting activities between 1200 and 1500 pmol/A260 units. [3H]Ile-EctRNAGAGLeu was obtained using the editing-deficient EcLeuRS-Y330D mutant as described previously (34.Tan M. Zhu B. Zhou X.L. He R. Chen X. Eriani G.

Aminoacylation activities of MmLeuRS, EcLeuRS, and their mutants were measured in a reaction containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 4 mm ATP, 10 μm tRNALeu, 40 μm [3H]Leu (11 Ci/mm), and enzyme (5 nm EcLeuRS or 20 nm MmLeuRS and their mutants). Aminoacylation activities of AaLeuRS (20 nm), PhLeuRS (100 nm), hcLeuRS (20 nm), and their mutants in the presence of their cognate tRNAs were measured as reported previously (30.Chen X. Ma J.J.

Cognate tRNALeu concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 30 μm were used to determine the Km value of enzymes for their cognate tRNALeu. For MmLeuRS, MmLeuRS-CP1/LSD and their mutants, MmtRNAUAALeu were used. The deacylation reaction of EcLeuRS and its mutants was measured by determining hydrolytic rates at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 μm [3H]Ile-EctRNALeu (300 μCi/μm). Reactions were initiated with enzyme diluted to 20 nm. Because radioactive Nva is commercially unavailable, [3H]Ile was used as a source to prepare mischarged tRNALeu. Because the net effect of the editing reaction is the consumption of ATP, editing can be measured by monitoring AMP formation in the presence of a noncognate amino acid. AMP formation rates for MmLeuRS-CP1/LSD, EcLeuRS, hcLeuRS, AaLeuRS, and their mutants were measured as described previously (20.Hu Q.H. Huang Q. Wang E.D.

MmtRNACAALeu and its mutants were used to study the editing ability of the chimeric MmLeuRS-CP1/LSD. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 5 units/ml pyrophosphatase (Roche Applied Science), 3 mm ATP, 20 nm [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 15 mm Nva, and the presence or absence of 5 μm tRNALeu. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the following concentrations of LeuRSs and their mutants: 1 μm MmLeuRS-CP1/LSD (30 °C), 1 μm hcLeuRS (37 °C), 1 μm AaLeuRS (65 °C), and 0.2 μm EcLeuRS (37 °C). At regular time intervals, 1.5-μl aliquots were quenched in 6 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and spotted in duplicate on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (PEI, Merck) that had been pre-washed with water. TLC plates were developed in the presence of 0.1 m ammonium acetate and 5% acetic acid to separate [32P]aminoacyl-adenylate, [32P]AMP, and [32P]ATP. The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging and analyzed using MultiGauge version 3.0 software (Fujifilm). [32P]AMP spot gray densities were compared with those of known [32P]ATP concentrations, and rate constants (kobs) were obtained by plotting [32P]AMP formation versus time. EcLeuRS-[32P]EctRNAGAGLeu, EcLeuRS-[32P]Mm tRNAUAALeu, and hcLeuRS-[32P]hctRNACAGLeu complex formations were monitored using the classical filter binding method of Berg and co-workers (35.Yarus M.

Radiolabeled M. mobile or E. coli [32P]tRNAGAGLeu (60 nm, 60,000 cpm) and human cytoplasmic [32P]tRNACAGLeu (30 nm, 30,000 cpm) were incubated in 50 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2) in the presence of increasing concentrations of LeuRS proteins for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, 0.22 μm) previously equilibrated in washing buffer consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.5) and 50 mm MgCl2. Filters were then washed twice with 0.3 ml of the washing buffer and air-dried before radioactive quantification. All data were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM software. The refined structure of EcLeuRS revealed that the third α-helix (Ser661 to Lys683; helix α3; PDB entry 4ARC and 4AQ7; Fig. 1, B and C) is the only region of the SC-fold that interacts directly with tRNA in both aminoacylation and editing conformations (11.Palencia A. Crépin T. Vu M.T. Lincecum Jr., T.L. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Structural dynamics of the aminoacylation and proofreading functional cycle of bacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetase.Nat. Struct. Mol.

To investigate the effect of the α-helix on enzymatic activity, we constructed a deletion mutant lacking the third α-helix. Despite the 22-amino acid deletion, CD spectroscopy data also indicated the deletion mutant was well expressed in a soluble form and had a definite stable secondary structure (Fig. 2A). However, this construct completely lacked both aminoacylation and editing activities, supporting the hypothesis that this helix is critical for these functions (Fig. 2B and TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Considering the interaction between tRNA and aaRS is predominantly mediated by crucial basic residues (37.Guijarro J.I. Pintar A. Prochnicka-Chalufour A. Guez V. Gilquin B. Bedouelle H. Delepierre M.

EcLeuRS-K671A did not affect the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) at all (Table 1). However, the kcat/Km values of EcLeuRS-R668A and EcLeuRS-R668E had decreased to 23 and 5% of the kcat/Km values of wild-type (WT) EcLeuRS (Table 1). The kcat/Km values of the double mutant EcLeuRS-R668A/R672A was only 6.4% of that of the native enzyme, and the catalytic efficiency of the EcLeuRS-R668E/R672E double-site mutant was severely diminished, with only 1.4% of tRNA aminoacylation activity remaining (Table 1). Although mutations at Arg668 or Arg672 decreased the aminoacylation activity to different extents, all of these mutants, inclu"
https://openalex.org/W2009271335,"The present paper introduces a condition number estimation method for preconditioned matrices. The newly developed method provides reasonable results, while the conventional method which is based on the Lanczos connection gives meaningless results. The Lanczos connection based method provides the condition numbers of coefficient matrices of systems of linear equations with information obtained through the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Estimating the condition number of preconditioned matrices is sometimes important when describing the effectiveness of new preconditionerers or selecting adequate preconditioners. Operating a preconditioner on a coefficient matrix is the simplest method of estimation. However, this is not possible for large-scale computing, especially if computation is performed on distributed memory parallel computers. This is because, the preconditioned matrices become dense, even if the original matrices are sparse. Although the Lanczos connection method can be used to calculate the condition number of preconditioned matrices, it is not considered to be applicable to large-scale problems because of its weakness with respect to numerical errors. Therefore, we have developed a robust and parallelizable method based on Hager's method. The feasibility studies are curried out for the diagonal scaling preconditioner and the SSOR preconditioner with a diagonal matrix, a tri-daigonal matrix and Pei's matrix. As a result, the Lanczos connection method contains around 10% error in the results even with a simple problem. On the other hand, the new method contains negligible errors. In addition, the newly developed method returns reasonable solutions when the Lanczos connection method fails with Pei's matrix, and matrices generated with the finite element method."
https://openalex.org/W2004746997,"Point 1 Management of crops, commercialized or protected species, plagues or life-cycle evolution are subjects requiring comparisons among different demographic strategies. The simpler methods fail in relating changes in vital rates with changes in population viability whereas more complex methods lack accuracy by neglecting interactions among vital rates. Point 2 The difference between the fitness (evaluated by the population growth rate λ) of two alternative demographies is decomposed into the contributions of the differences between the pair-wised vital rates and their interactions. This is achieved through a full Taylor expansion (i.e. remainder = 0) of the demographic model. The significance of each term is determined by permutation tests under the null hypothesis that all demographies come from the same pool. Point 3 An example is given with periodic demographic matrices of the microscopic haploid phase of two kelp cryptic species observed to partition their niche occupation along the Chilean coast. The method provided clear and synthetic results showing conditional differentiation of reproduction is an important driver for their differences in fitness along the latitudinal temperature gradient. But it also demonstrated that interactions among vital rates cannot be neglected as they compose a significant part of the differences between demographies. Point 4 This method allows researchers to access the effects of multiple effective changes in a life-cycle from only two experiments. Evolutionists can determine with confidence the effective causes for changes in fitness whereas population managers can determine best strategies from simpler experimental designs."
https://openalex.org/W2116155762,"The early C. elegans embryo is an attractive model system to investigate fundamental developmental processes. With the exception of mex-3 mRNA, maternally contributed mRNAs are thought to be distributed uniformly in the one-cell embryo. Here, we report and characterize the striking distribution of the mRNA encoding the novel protein ERA-1. We found that era-1 mRNA is enriched in the anterior of the one-cell embryo and present solely in anterior blastomeres thereafter. Although era-1 is not an essential gene, we uncovered that era-1 null mutant embryos are sensitive to slight impairment of embryonic polarity. We found that the asymmetric distribution of era-1 mRNA depends on anterior-posterior polarity cues and on the era-1 3’UTR. Similarly to the era-1 mRNA, the YFP-ERA-1 protein is enriched in anterior blastomeres. Interestingly, we found that the RNA-binding protein MEX-5 is required for era-1 mRNA asymmetry. Furthermore, we show that MEX-5, together with its partially redundant partner MEX-6, are needed to activate era-1 mRNA translation in anterior blastomeres. These findings lead us to propose that MEX-5/6–mediated regulation of era-1 mRNA contributes to robust embryonic development."
