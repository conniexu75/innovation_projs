https://openalex.org/W2138920781,"In many Asian countries, rice crops are prone to destruction by flooding. Most cultivars of rice, Oryza sativa, die after a week of complete submergence, but a few strains can survive a couple of weeks under water due to a major quantitative trait locus called Submergence 1 (Sub1). A detailed study of the Sub1 genes has now identified one, Sub1A, as the primary determinant of tolerance to submergence. The introduction of Sub1A into a widely grown Asian rice cultivar increases its survival rate in flood conditions without sacrificing its high yield and other good properties. A gene that enables some strains of rice to survive under water for a period of time is identified. Furthermore, this gene confers its submergence tolerance when transferred into a strain of rice that normally dies when submerged under water. Most Oryza sativa cultivars die within a week of complete submergence—a major constraint to rice production in south and southeast Asia that causes annual losses of over US$1 billion and affects disproportionately the poorest farmers in the world1,2. A few cultivars, such as the O. sativa ssp. indica cultivar FR13A, are highly tolerant and survive up to two weeks of complete submergence owing to a major quantitative trait locus designated Submergence 1 (Sub1) near the centromere of chromosome 9 (refs 3, 4, 5–6). Here we describe the identification of a cluster of three genes at the Sub1 locus, encoding putative ethylene response factors. Two of these genes, Sub1B and Sub1C, are invariably present in the Sub1 region of all rice accessions analysed. In contrast, the presence of Sub1A is variable. A survey identified two alleles within those indica varieties that possess this gene: a tolerance-specific allele named Sub1A-1 and an intolerance-specific allele named Sub1A-2. Overexpression of Sub1A-1 in a submergence-intolerant O. sativa ssp. japonica conferred enhanced tolerance to the plants, downregulation of Sub1C and upregulation of Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1), indicating that Sub1A-1 is a primary determinant of submergence tolerance. The FR13A Sub1 locus was introgressed into a widely grown Asian rice cultivar using marker-assisted selection. The new variety maintains the high yield and other agronomic properties of the recurrent parent and is tolerant to submergence. Cultivation of this variety is expected to provide protection against damaging floods and increase crop security for farmers."
https://openalex.org/W2047708521,"Small-molecule hormones govern every aspect of the biology of plants. Many processes, such as growth, are regulated in similar ways by multiple hormones, and recent studies have revealed extensive crosstalk among different hormonal signaling pathways. These results have led to the proposal that a common set of signaling components may integrate inputs from multiple hormones to regulate growth. In this study, we tested this proposal by asking whether different hormones converge on a common set of transcriptional targets in Arabidopsis seedlings. Using publicly available microarray data, we analyzed the transcriptional effects of seven hormones, including abscisic acid, gibberellin, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, brassinosteroid, and jasmonate. A high-sensitivity analysis revealed a surprisingly low number of common target genes. Instead, different hormones appear to regulate distinct members of protein families. We conclude that there is not a core transcriptional growth-regulatory module in young Arabidopsis seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W1965124005,"Cellular senescence is a stable state of proliferative arrest that provides a barrier to malignant transformation and contributes to the antitumor activity of certain chemotherapies. Senescent cells can accumulate senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHFs), which may provide a chromatin buffer that prevents activation of proliferation-associated genes by mitogenic transcription factors. Surprisingly, we show that the High-Mobility Group A (HMGA) proteins, which can promote tumorigenesis, accumulate on the chromatin of senescent fibroblasts and are essential structural components of SAHFs. HMGA proteins cooperate with the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor to promote SAHF formation and proliferative arrest and stabilize senescence by contributing to the repression of proliferation-associated genes. These antiproliferative activities are canceled by coexpression of the HDM2 and CDK4 oncogenes, which are often coamplified with HMGA2 in human cancers. Our results identify a component of the senescence machinery that contributes to heterochromatin formation and imply that HMGA proteins also act in tumor suppressor networks."
https://openalex.org/W2095971387,"Amplification of the ErbB2 locus, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, is common in aggressive breast tumors and correlates with poor prognosis. The mechanisms underlying ErbB2-mediated breast carcinoma progression remain incompletely defined. To examine the role of the signaling and cell-adhesion receptor β4 integrin during ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis, we introduced a targeted deletion of the β4 signaling domain into a mouse model of ErbB2-induced mammary carcinoma. Loss of β4 signaling suppresses mammary tumor onset and invasive growth. Ex vivo studies indicate that β4 forms a complex with ErbB2 and enhances activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and c-Jun. STAT3 contributes to disruption of epithelial adhesion and polarity, while c-Jun is required for hyperproliferation. Finally, deletion of the β4 signaling domain enhances the efficacy of ErbB2-targeted therapy. These results indicate that β4 integrin promotes tumor progression by amplifying ErbB2 signaling and identify β4 as a potential target for molecular therapy of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2156057520,"The transmissible agent causing canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is thought to be the tumor cell itself. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genetic markers including major histocompatibility (MHC) genes, microsatellites, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in naturally occurring tumors and matched blood samples. In each case, the tumor is genetically distinct from its host. Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 continents are derived from a single neoplastic clone that has diverged into two subclades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that CTVT most likely originated from a wolf or an East Asian breed of dog between 200 and 2500 years ago. Although CTVT is highly aneuploid, it has a remarkably stable genotype. During progressive growth, CTVT downmodulates MHC antigen expression. Our findings have implications for understanding genome instability in cancer, natural transplantation of allografts, and the capacity of a somatic cell to evolve into a transmissible parasite.

Our findings have implications for understanding genome instability in cancer, natural transplantation of allografts, and the capacity of a somatic cell to evolve into a transmissible parasite. CTVT, also known as Sticker's sarcoma, is a histiocytic tumor that is usually transmitted among dogs through coitus but may also spread through licking, biting, and sniffing tumor-affected areas (Cohen, 1985Cohen D. The canine transmissible venereal tumor: a unique result of tumor progression.Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 43: 75-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Das and Das, 2000Das U. Das A.K. Review of canine transmissible venereal sarcoma.Vet. Res. Commun. 2000; 24: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). First characterized 130 years ago (Novinski, 1876Novinski M.A. Zur Frage uber die Impfung der Krebsigen Geschwulste.Zentralbl. Med. Wissensch. 1876; 14: 790-791Google Scholar), CTVT was frequently used by cancer researchers to study tumor transplantation until the development of inbred strains of rats and mice afforded syngeneic models. The notion that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an allograft came from three lines of observation. First, CTVT can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates (Cohen, 1985Cohen D. The canine transmissible venereal tumor: a unique result of tumor progression.Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 43: 75-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in tumors collected in different geographic regions (Murray et al., 1969Murray M. James Z.H. Martin W.B. A study of the cytology and karyotype of the canine transmissible venereal tumour.Res. Vet. Sci. 1969; 10: 565-568PubMed Google Scholar, Oshimura et al., 1973Oshimura M. Sasaki M. Makino S.

Nowell P.C. Hare W.C. Chromosome studies of a transplanted and a primary canine venereal sarcoma.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1965; 35: 537-547PubMed Google Scholar). Third, a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc (Katzir et al., 1985Katzir N. Rechavi G. Cohen J.B. Unger T. Simoni F. Segal S. Cohen D. Givol D. “Retroposon” insertion into the cellular oncogene c-myc in canine transmissible venereal tumor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) has been found in all tumors examined so far (Katzir et al., 1987Katzir N. Arman E. Cohen D. Givol D. Rechavi G. Common origin of transmissible venereal tumors (TVT) in dogs.Oncogene. 1987; 1: 445-448PubMed Google Scholar) and can be used as a diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is CTVT (Liao et al., 2003Liao K.W. Lin Z.Y. Pao H.N. Kam S.Y. Wang F.I. Chu R.M. Identification of canine transmissible venereal tumor cells using in situ polymerase chain reaction and the stable sequence of the long interspersed nuclear element.J. Vet. Diagn. Invest. 2003; 15: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In two animals that had been experimentally inoculated with CTVT, the resulting tumors contained the LINE-1/c-myc insertion, whereas the normal tissues did not (Katzir et al., 1987Katzir N. Arman E. Cohen D. Givol D. Rechavi G. Common origin of transmissible venereal tumors (TVT) in dogs.Oncogene. 1987; 1: 445-448PubMed Google Scholar, Liao et al., 2003Liao K.W. Lin Z.Y. Pao H.N. Kam S.Y.

Invest. 2003; 15: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in natural transmission, inheritance of a LINE-1 insertion near c-myc in the germline might represent a predisposition to develop CTVT after exposure to an oncogenic agent, similar to the Mendelian LINE-1 insertion in the factor IX gene, which causes mild hemophilia B in dogs (Brooks et al., 2003Brooks M.B. Gu W. Barnas J.L. Ray J. Ray K. A LINE-1 insertion in the Factor IX gene segregates with mild hemophilia B in dogs.Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The recent emergence of a tumor transmitted by biting in the endangered marsupial species the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (Owen and Pemberton, 2006Owen D. Pemberton D. Tasmanian Devil: A Unique and Threatened Animal. Allen & Unwin, London2006Google Scholar) has attracted renewed interest in the concept of cellular transmission, for which CTVT is cited as a precedent (Pearse and Swift, 2006Pearse A.M. Swift K. Allograft theory: transmission of devil facial-tumour disease.Nature. 2006; 439: 549Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, authors of reports describing virus-like particles in CTVT (Ajello and Gimbo, 1965Ajello P. Gimbo A. Presenza di particelle virali nelle cellule del tumore di Sticker.Atti. Soc. Ital. Sci. Nat. 1965; 19: 736-739Google Scholar, Battistacci and Morriconi, 1974Battistacci M. Morriconi F. Ricerche ultastrutturali sul sarcoma di Sticker.Nuova Vet. 1974; 50: 226-236Google Scholar, Lombard and Cabanie, 1967Lombard C. Cabanie P. [Considerations on the nature and studies of the ultrastructure of the Sticker sarcoma of the dog].Bull. Cancer. 1967; 54: 357-365PubMed Google Scholar) considered that an oncogenic virus might play a role in tumorigenesis. Although most specialists in the field accept the cellular transmission of CTVT, definitive data that this is the case have been lacking, and the concept of a contagious cancer cell has tended to be greeted with skepticism by many oncologists and immunologists. Molecular genetic markers have not previously been used to resolve the issue of natural transmission, the breed of origin, or the age of the canine tumor. Here, we compare matched tumor and normal tissues in naturally affected dogs in three countries and analyze the genotype and diversity of further tumors collected worldwide. We provide conclusive evidence that a cancer cell has evolved into a transmissible parasite, which represents the oldest known somatic mammalian cell in continuous propagation. Matched tumor tissues and blood samples were collected from 16 unrelated dogs in Italy, India, and Kenya, and we also examined microdissected tumor cells derived from paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from 24 independent natural tumors from Brazil, the United States, Turkey, Spain, and Italy (Table 1). First we sought to confirm whether the LINE-1 element near c-myc previously detected in CTVT (Katzir et al., 1985Katzir N. Rechavi G. Cohen J.B. Unger T. Simoni F. Segal S. Cohen D. Givol D. “Retroposon” insertion into the cellular oncogene c-myc in canine transmissible venereal tumor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) is specific to the tumor cell or whether it represents a genetic predisposition to develop CTVT after exposure to a transmissible agent. All of the naturally occurring tumors but none of the matched normal samples from 16 dogs possessed this LINE-1 insertion, as shown for 11 tumors in Figure 1A. The tumor-specific LINE-1 insertion was present in all of the archival CTVT samples (Figure 1B), as previously reported for tumors in the United States, Israel, and Taiwan (Katzir et al., 1987Katzir N. Arman E. Cohen D. Givol D. Rechavi G. Common origin of transmissible venereal tumors (TVT) in dogs.Oncogene. 1987; 1: 445-448PubMed Google Scholar, Liao et al., 2003Liao K.W. Lin Z.Y. Pao H.N. Kam S.Y. Wang F.I. Chu R.M. Identification of canine transmissible venereal tumor cells using in situ polymerase chain reaction and the stable sequence of the long interspersed nuclear element.J. Vet. Diagn. Invest. 2003; 15: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the LINE-1 insertion appears to be a specific marker of CTVT resulting from either an insertion during the somatic evolution of the tumor or its presence in the germline of the original host. Germline insertion at this locus has not been reported; however, it has not been examined in the canine lineage from which the tumor appears to be derived (see below). Even if the LINE-1 insertion were in the germline, the chromosome pattern and the molecular genetic analysis presented below indicate that the tumor lineage itself is somatically monoclonal.Table 1Sources of CTVT SamplesFresh Tumors with Matching Blood SamplePlaceNumber Catania, Italy5 Messina, Italy5 Kolkata, India4 Nairobi, Kenya2Paraffin-Embedded Archival TumorsCountryNumber Brazil4 Italy5 Spain4 Turkey9 USA2Total40Details of age, sex, breed of dog, and site of tumor are in Table S1. Open table in a new tab Details of age, sex, breed of dog, and site of tumor are in Table S1. Next we analyzed the sequence of the most polymorphic genes (Kennedy et al., 2002bKennedy L.J. Barnes A. Happ G.M. Quinnell R.J. Courtenay O. Carter S.D. Ollier W.E. Thomson W. Evidence for extensive DLA polymorphism in different dog populations.Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) of the canine MHC (also known as dog leukocyte antigen [DLA]): the class I gene (DLA-88 exons 2 and 3) and three class II genes (exon 2 of DRB1, DQB1, and DQA1). Using generic intron PCR primers followed by sequencing of the amplified DLA alleles, we found that, in each case, the CTVT DLA haplotype was different from those of the hosts but was identical among tumors. We therefore designed PCR amplification primers for the DLA alleles that are tumor specific and confirmed that all of the tumors shared the same alleles in all four DLA genes, which were not present in matched normal tissue (Figure 1A). The tumor-specific alleles were also detected in the paraffin-embedded specimens collected worldwide (Figure 1B). The DLA genotyping indicated that the class II genes in CTVT are either homozygous or hemizygous, except for the DRB1 gene, which possesses two alleles that differ by one nonsynonymous substitution distant from the peptide binding groove. Quantitative PCR was therefore performed to determine DLA gene dosage. While the DLA-88, DRA, and DRB1 genes were diploid in all samples (data not shown), the DQB1 locus was haploid (hemizygous) in 5 of 11 fresh tumors, and the DQA1 locus was haploid in 12 of 29 tumors analyzed, indicating a frequent loss of class II DQ alleles (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Microsatellite genotyping was conducted by PCR amplification of 21 canine microsatellite markers that are widely dispersed across different chromosomes in the normal karyotype (Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L. Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog.Science. 2004; 304: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These were chosen to compare tumor and normal DNA in 11 of the dogs from which both types of tissue were available. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using chord distance (Figure 2), which showed that the tumors and the hosts were genetically separate, with all tumors clustered together. A neighbor-joining tree based on the proportion of alleles shared between pairs of samples gave a similar result (Figure S2). None of the host dogs showed close relatedness to any of the others, consistent with the fact that they came from three locations in Europe, Asia, and Africa and were mongrels. A further polymorphic marker analyzed was the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. A 580 bp sequence was amplified from 11 fresh specimens and compared to the mtDNA of their hosts. In order to place our data in the context of dog and wolf mtDNA sequences, we analyzed our data in conjunction with sequences collected in previous studies of canids (Vila et al., 1997Vila C. Savolainen P. Maldonado J.E. Amorim I.R. Rice J.E. Honeycutt R.L. Crandall K.A. Lundeberg J. Wayne R.K. Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog.Science. 1997; 276: 1687-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, Savolainen et al., 2002Savolainen P. Zhang Y.P. Luo J. Lundeberg J. Leitner T. Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs.Science. 2002; 298: 1610-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). All of the tumor sequences grouped together into two distinct clusters (Figure S3), both of which lie within clade A of the canine mtDNA tree; this clade includes ∼70% of all dog mtDNA sequences (Savolainen et al., 2002Savolainen P. Zhang Y.P. Luo J. Lundeberg J. Leitner T. Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs.Science. 2002; 298: 1610-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequences from the mtDNA from the blood of host dogs bearing the tumor were scattered across clades A, B, and C. Although sequence variation in the mtDNA control region can arise by somatic mutation in human tumors (Vega et al., 2004Vega A. Salas A. Gamborino E. Sobrido M.J. Macaulay V. Carracedo A. mtDNA mutations in tumors of the central nervous system reflect the neutral evolution of mtDNA in populations.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the lack of genetic relatedness between matched normal and CTVT mtDNA haplotypes, and the genetic clustering of the tumors, confirmed that the tumors in the dogs from Italy, India, and Kenya were distinct from their hosts. A shorter 257 bp amplified fragment of mtDNA was analyzed in 21 microdissected tumor cells from paraffin-embedded specimens in addition to the fresh tumor. Several amplicons from each tumor specimen were sequenced because there was some variation within tumors. Figure 3 shows that the majority of tumor mtDNA haplotypes grouped into two clusters. Interestingly, all tumors in mtDNA cluster 1 were homozygous diploid for DLA DQA1, while all of those in cluster 2 except for dog 9 were haploid. This observation indicates that the ancestral tumor clone split into two distinguishable subclades, each of which has become broadly distributed in many countries. We also used the program PAUP∗ (Swofford, 2003Swofford D.L. PAUP∗ 4.0: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods) Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA, USA2003Google Scholar) to estimate a maximum-likelihood tree for a subset of 21 tumor mtDNA sequences and the previously obtained dog and wolf sequences (Figure S4). Although there is considerable uncertainty in the tree, in part due to substantial rate heterogeneity across sites leading to recurrent mutations (Savolainen et al., 2002Savolainen P. Zhang Y.P. Luo J. Lundeberg J. Leitner T. Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs.Science. 2002; 298: 1610-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), the tumor sequences again fall into two main clusters within canid clade A. However, two amplicons from two of the fixed tumor samples contained mtDNA unrelated to the two clusters. The two outliers appear to be incompatible with a monophyletic origin of the amplified mtDNA. In these two tumors, the microdissection may not have removed all of the host cells because other mtDNA sequences from the same tumors were within the clusters. We estimate from histopathology (see below) that approximately 10% of cells in tumors represent host hematopoietic or stromal cells. We sought to determine the genetic ancestry of CTVT by phylogenetic alignment with previously published data based on DLA typing (Kennedy et al., 2002bKennedy L.J. Barnes A. Happ G.M. Quinnell R.J. Courtenay O. Carter S.D. Ollier W.E. Thomson W. Evidence for extensive DLA polymorphism in different dog populations.Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Seddon and Ellegren, 2002Seddon J.M. Ellegren H. MHC class II genes in European wolves: a comparison with dogs.Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and microsatellite analysis (Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L. Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog.Science. 2004; 304: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The DLA class II DQB1 and DQA1 alleles that we detected in CTVT have been previously described: DQB1 03501 was reported in North American wolves and dogs, and DQA1 04202 was reported in huskies. The tumors contained previously undescribed alleles of DLA-88 and DRB1; the two CTVT DRB1 alleles differ from each other by only one nonsynonymous substitution and are related to alleles 04101 of North American wolves and 04701 of Alaskan and Siberian huskies (Figure S5). The DLA data are consistent with a tumor origin in wolves or “old” breeds of dog in or related to the Spitz group. To further investigate the origin of CTVT, we genotyped 73 microsatellite loci in three tumor samples (one each from India, Italy, and Kenya) and a subset of 18 of those microsatellites in an additional 24 CTVT samples of diverse geographic origins. These microsatellites are a subset of the loci genotyped by Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L. Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog.Science. 2004; 304: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar in a sample of 8 wolves and 414 dogs representing 85 breeds. Analysis of the dog genome (Lindblad-Toh et al., 2005Lindblad-Toh K. Wade C.M. Mikkelsen T.S. Karlsson E.K. Jaffe D.B. Kamal M. Clamp M. Chang J.L. Kulbokas 3rd, E.J. Zody M.C. et al.Genome sequence, comparative analysis and haplotype structure of the domestic dog.Nature. 2005; 438: 803-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) confirms that the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) and the gray wolf (Canis lupus) are one species. Contaminating normal alleles were excluded from the analysis (see Experimental Procedures). A model-based clustering algorithm, Structure, was used to investigate the relationship between the CTVT samples and the canid data (Falush et al., 2003Falush D. Stephens M. Pritchard J.K. Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data: linked loci and correlated allele frequencies.Genetics. 2003; 164: 1567-1587PubMed Google Scholar, Pritchard et al., 2000Pritchard J.K. Stephens M. Donnelly P. Inference of population structure using multilocus genotype data.Genetics. 2000; 155: 945-959PubMed Google Scholar). This method groups individuals in a sample into a prespecified number of clusters (K). Our initial analyses applied Structure without giving it any information about the origin of the samples (i.e., dog breed, wolf, or CTVT; Figure S6). At K = 2, the tumor samples grouped with the wolves and a set of dog breeds that was previously identified by Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L. Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog.Science. 2004; 304: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar as being genetically most similar to wolves. At higher values of K, all of the tumor samples clustered into a unique group that is distinct from the dogs and wolves, again indicating that the samples have a single shared origin. To determine the specific origin of CTVT, we performed additional Structure analyses (Figure 4A), focusing on wolves and the subset of breeds that showed some similarity to CTVT in the initial analysis. The model used allowed the CTVT samples to have mixed ancestry, so that if the progenitor animal was a mongrel dog, then the CTVT ancestry should be spread across two or more breeds. In this analysis, the tumor samples clustered most strongly with wolves. A second method of analysis applied a nonparametric clustering technique (a neighbor-joining tree based on pairwise allele sharing among genotypes) and again indicated similarity between CTVT and the wolf samples (Figure 4B). Thus, both the model-based method and the neighbor-joining method for microsatellites are consistent with our DLA analysis and indicate that CTVT may have originated in wolves. However, some caution is required due to the small sample sizes of each breed and the fact that the available dog data were limited to pedigree breeds (Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L. Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog.Science. 2004; 304: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), so an origin in domestic dogs is not excluded. We investigated whether CTVT represents an epidemic of a recently emerged tumor or whether it has a more ancient origin and is in effect a stable parasite of dog populations. The Novinski, 1876Novinski M.A. Zur Frage uber die Impfung der Krebsigen Geschwulste.Zentralbl. Med. Wissensch. 1876; 14: 790-791Google Scholar report would argue that CTVT is at least 130 years old, assuming that the tumors he observed were clonal with modern tumors. The tumors available to us were collected over a period of 28 years (1976–2003) and thus enable us to test whether CTVT has a modern origin. Moreover, given the wide geographic distribution of the tumor and existing knowledge of the time of divergence of different dog breeds (Vila et al., 1997Vila C. Savolainen P. Maldonado J.E. Amorim I.R. Rice J.E. Honeycutt R.L. Crandall K.A. Lundeberg J. Wayne R.K. Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog.Science. 1997; 276: 1687-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, Sundqvist et al., 2006Sundqvist A.K. Bjornerfeldt S. Leonard J. Hailer F. Hedhammar A. Ellegren H. Vila C. Unequal contribution of sexes in the origin of dog breeds.Genetics. 2006; 172: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is possible to estimate minimum and maximum time limits on the emergence of the tumor clone that is currently circulating as a cellular parasite among dogs. We examined the level of microsatellite variation across tumors (Figure 5). The CTVT isolates were far less variable than wolves and dogs as a whole, and even less variable than the most inbred (miniature bull terrier) of the 85 dog breeds studied by Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L.

This observation argues strongly against an ancient date of origin for the common ancestor of CTVT. In 17 of the 18 microsatellites genotyped in the tumors, there is a single genotype that is present in at least half the tumors. We assume that this modal genotype represents that of the ancestral CTVT. There is no trend of distance from the modal genotype as a function of the age of our tumor samples, implying that the common ancestor's date of origin must be substantially older than the 28 year range of our fixed and fresh samples. Ignoring back mutation (which is a small effect when most genotypes are identical), the probability that a genotype matches the ancestral genotype is exp(−μt), where μ is the mutation rate per genotype per year and t is the time in years since the common ancestor. Unfortunately, the microsatellite mutation rate in CTVT is unclear. Microsatellite mutation rates per allele in humans are in the range of 10−3 to 10−4 per generation for typical loci (Huang et al., 2002Huang Q.Y. Xu F.H. Shen H. Deng H.Y. Liu Y.J. Li Y.Z. Li J.L. Recker R.R. Deng H.W. Mutation patterns at dinucleotide microsatellite loci in humans.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). If one assumes that genotype mutation rates per year for CTVT are in this range, then the age estimates range from 250 to 2500 years. If mutation rates are higher in the tumor, as observed in some human tumors (Raptis and Bapat, 2006Raptis S. Bapat B. Genetic instability in human tumors.EXS. 2006; 96: 303-320PubMed Google Scholar), CTVT would be at the younger end of this range. We also computed the average expected heterozygosity of the microsatellites separately for the two CTVT subclades defined by diploid and haploid DQA1 alleles and by mtDNA clusters. The subclades were only slightly less diverse than all CTVT samples (Figure 5). This finding indicates that the two major subclades split relatively soon after the emergence of CTVT, consistent with the wide geographic range of both subclades. Another potential source of information about the age of CTVT is the levels of mtDNA sequence variability within CTVT samples and relative to dog mtDNA in general. Savolainen et al., 2002Savolainen P. Zhang Y.P. Luo J. Lundeberg J. Leitner T. Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs.Science. 2002; 298: 1610-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar have previously estimated that the most recent common ancestor of dog clade A lived about 41,000 years ago, assuming a star-shaped genealogy. We found that pairwise variability of mtDNA within CTVT is larger than the variability within dog clade A (1.38% versus 0.73% pairwise divergence), but these samples included the two dogs with mtDNA apparently unrelated to the two defined clusters (Figure S4). Most likely these samples contained mtDNA from host stromal cells because, unlike the microsatellite analysis, contaminating normal mtDNA was not omitted. However, a possibility remains of mitochondrial heteroplasmy within the tumor cells of some tumors if CTVT became parasitized by host mitochondria during serial passage. While the analysis of mtDNA would suggest a much older origin, such a conclusion seems implausible given the strikingly low microsatellite variation observed. A high mtDNA mutation rate, together with admixture of host mtDNA or heteroplasmy in the samples, may explain the discrepancy. In summary, the data on microsatellite variation, including the lack of significant accumulation of new genotypes over the 28 years of tumor collection, and the historical observations on transplantable CTVT since 1876 indicate that CTVT has been transmitted among dogs for two centuries or more. The microsatellite variability of CTVT is only 56% of that for the least variable dog breed (Figure 5, miniature bull terrier), which is probably less than 200 years old (Parker et al., 2004Parker H.G. Kim L.V. Sutter N.B. Carlson S. Lorentzen T.D. Malek T.B. Johnson G.S. DeFrance H.B. Ostrander E.A. Kruglyak L.

Hedhammar A. Ellegren H. Vila C. Unequal contribution of sexes in the origin of dog breeds.Genetics. 2006; 172: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, since miniature bull terriers were presumably founded by several individuals, the most recent common ancestor of their alleles is probably considerably older than 200 years. These data indicate that the tumor cannot have existed in wolves or dogs since ancient times. Thus, the current clone of CTVT would not appear to have been a parasite for more than 2500 years, and probably is considerably younger. The foregoing analysis shows that CTVT has been transmitted as an allograft across many DLA types through innumerable hosts. Although dogs that have recovered from CTVT are immune to tumor development upon reinoculation, naive dogs of many breeds are susceptible to tumor growth (Cohen, 1985Cohen D. The canine transmissible venereal tumor: a unique result of tumor progression.Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 43: 75-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

This supercurrent is carried by Cooper pairs of electrons with a combined charge of twice the elementary charge, e. The 2e charge quantum is clearly visible in the height of Shapiro steps in Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation and in the magnetic flux periodicity of h/2e in superconducting quantum interference devices. Several different materials have been used to weakly couple superconductors, such as tunnel barriers, normal metals, or semiconductors. Here, we study supercurrents through a quantum dot created in a semiconductor nanowire by local electrostatic gating. Due to strong Coulomb interaction, electrons only tunnel one-by-one through the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot. This nevertheless can yield a supercurrent when subsequent tunnel events are coherent. These quantum coherent tunnelling processes can result in either a positive or a negative supercurrent, i.e. in a normal or a pi-junction, respectively. We demonstrate that the supercurrent reverses sign by adding a single electron spin to the quantum dot. When excited states of the quantum dot are involved in transport, the supercurrent sign also depends on the character of the orbital wavefunctions."

CERT has a pleck-strin homology (PH) domain for Golgi targeting and a START domain catalyzing the intermembrane transfer of ceramide. The region between the two domains contains a short peptide motif designated FFAT, which is supposed to interact with the ER-resident proteins VAP-A and VAP-B. Both VAPs were actually co-immunoprecipitated with CERT, and the CERT/VAP interaction was abolished by mutations in the FFAT motif. These mutations did not affect the Golgi targeting activity of CERT. Whereas mutations of neither the FFAT motif nor the PH domain inhibited the ceramide transfer activity of CERT in a cell-free system, they impaired the ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide in intact and in semi-intact cells at near endogenous expression levels. By contrast, when overexpressed, both the FFAT motif and the PH domain mutants of CERT substantially supported the transport of ceramide from the ER to the site where sphingomyelin is produced. These results suggest that the Golgi-targeting PH domain and ER-interacting FFAT motif of CERT spatially restrict the random ceramide transfer activity of the START domain in cells.

The transport and sorting of lipids from the sites of their synthesis to their appropriate destinations are essential events for membrane biogenesis in cells.

Ceramide is also converted to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) presumably in the cis-Golgi regions or a subdomain of the ER. GlcCer is converted to more complex glycosphingolipids in the Golgi apparatus. The major transport of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for the synthesis of SM is an ATP- and cytosol-dependent pathway (1Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J.

After functional gene rescue experiments, the factor mutated in LY-A cells was identified to be CERT (also known as Goodpasture antigen-binding protein), a 68-kDa cytosolic protein (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). CERT consists of three distinct regions. The N-terminal ∼120 residues of CERT form a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is a phosphoinositide-binding domain (4Raya A. Revert F. Navarro S. Saus J. J. Biol.

The middle region, the ∼250 amino acid residues between the PH and START domains, is predicted to form no globular domains. The PH domain of CERT serves to target the Golgi apparatus by recognizing phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI4P) (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 7Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The START domain of CERT is capable of extracting ceramide from membranes and transferring it to acceptor membranes (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M.

Based on these findings, we have proposed that CERT extracts ceramide from the ER and carries it to the Golgi apparatus. However, it remains unclear how CERT selectively interacts with the ER to extract newly synthesized ceramide in cells, although the middle region of CERT has a putative motif interacting with the ER (9Loewen C.J.

(9Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) showed that conserved short peptide motifs present in OSBP and its yeast relatives are crucial for the interaction of OSBPs with VAP-A. Based on the conserved sequence (EFFDAXE), the motifs are referred to as FFAT motifs (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) (9Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a FFAT motif is present in the middle region of CERT (9Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the present study, we show that CERT actually interacts with VAPs via its FFAT motif. In addition, we show that, when CERT is not overproduced, both the PH domain and the FFAT motif are required for efficient ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide in cells. By contrast, when excess CERT proteins exist, neither the FFAT motif nor the PH domain is essential for the transport of ceramide from the ER to the site where SM is produced. These results suggest that the Golgi-targeting PH domain and the ER-interacting FFAT motif of CERT spatially restrict the random ceramide transfer activity of the START domain in cells. Cells and Cell Cultures—The LY-A cell line, a CHO-K1-derived mutant cell line defective in the CERT-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide, was previously established by us (16Hanada K. Hara T.

CHO cells were routinely maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate at 33 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator (17Hanada K.

HeLa-S3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C. Nutridoma medium (Ham's F-12 containing 1% Nutridoma-SP (Roche Applied Science) and 25 μg/ml of gentamicin) was used as a serum-free medium. Introduction of Point Mutations or a Deletion into the CERT FFAT Motif—DNA constructs encoding the various mutants of human CERT used in this study were made as described in supplementary data part 1. Cloning of Human VAP-A and VAP-B Genes—The open reading frames of the human VAP-A and VAP-B genes fused with the HA epitope or the red fluorescent protein HcRed were constructed as described in supplementary data part 1. Metabolic Labeling of Lipids with [14C]Serine or [3H]-Sphingosine—The metabolic labeling of CHO cells with radioactive serine or sphingosine was performed as described previously (1Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent cell monolayers in 6-cm dishes were incubated in 1.5 ml of Nutridoma medium containing 18.5 kBq of l-[U-14C]serine (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C or 37 kBq of d-erythro-[3-3H]sphingosine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) at 33 °C for 2 h. After two washes with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), labeled lipids extracted from the cells (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43103) Google Scholar) were separated on TLC plates (solvent system; methyl acetate, n-propanol, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl, 25/25/25/10/9, v/v, for the [14C]serine-labeling; chloroform, methanol, water, 65/25/4, v/v, for the [3H]sphingosine-labeling) and analyzed with BAS image analyzers (Fuji Film Inc.). Preparation of Recombinant CERT Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the bacterial expression plasmid pET28a(+) encoding a His6-tagged version of CERT or its mutants. Recombinant CERT proteins were purified from the transformed bacteria cells as described previously (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Assay of Ceramide Trafficking in Semi-intact CHO Cells—The transport of ceramide from the ER to the site where SM is synthesized was assayed in semi-intact CHO cells as described previously (2Funakoshi T.

In brief, perforated LY-A cells were incubated with [3H]sphingosine and palmitoyl-CoA at 15 °C for 30 min to produce [3H]ceramide at the ER. The prelabeled perforated cells (40 μg of protein) were then chased in 90 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 70 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 14.4 μm Fumonisin B1, 0.5 mm UDP-glucose, 0.25 mm GTP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and an ATP-regenerating system) with the cytosol (100 μg) from LY-A or CHO-K1 cells with or without 2 or 100 ng of purified recombinant CERT protein at 37 °C for 30 min. After the reaction was stopped, the lipids were extracted from the reaction mixture and separated by TLC. Radioactive lipids separated on the TLC plates were detected with a BAS1800 image analyzer (Fuji Film Inc.). The radioactivity of lipids in the control experiments, in which perforated LY-A cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]sphingosine in the absence of palmitoyl-CoA and chased, was regarded as back-ground activity derived from imperforated cells existing among the semi-intact cells; thus this value was subtracted from the radioactivity of each lipid produced in the standard counterparts. Cell-free Assay of Intermembrane Transfer of Ceramide—Re-combinant wild-type and mutant CERTs were purified by using a Talon Co2+ affinity column (Clontech) (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), and the transfer of ceramide between artificial phospholipid vesicles was assayed in a cell-free system as described previously (3Hanada K.

Co-immunoprecipitation of Epitope-tagged VAP with CERT—CHO-K1 cells cultured in dishes 100 mm in diameter were transiently co-transfected with 1.0 μg of pcDNAhyg/kzHA-VAP-A and 1.0 μg of various pcDNA/FLAG-CERT constructs by using Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen). The cells grown at 37 °C overnight were rinsed twice with 5 ml of cold PBS. Thereafter, the cells and samples were handled at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise indicated. After being rinsed with PBS, the cells were collected with 5 ml of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 180 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA by scraping and precipitated by centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min. Precipitated cells were suspended with 40 μl of 1% digitonin in Buffer I (50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture, Complete™ (Roche Applied Science)) by pipetting and incubated for 45 min on ice for mild solubilization of cells (15Wyles J.P. McMaster C.R. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29908-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fluid (∼40 μl) was collected. The concentration of protein in the supernatant fluid, typically 3 mg protein/ml, was adjusted to 2 mg protein/ml by adding Buffer I containing 1% digitonin. Then 35 μl of the adjusted supernatant fraction was mixed with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), which was prewashed with 10% bovine serum albumin in Buffer I, and the mixture was incubated for 2.5 h with shaking. The anti-FLAG antibody-coupled gel was precipitated by centrifugation (1000 × g, 1 min), and 5 μl of the supernatant was collected and diluted 20-fold for Western blotting as the immunoprecipitation-supernatant fraction. The gel was washed three times with 1 ml of Buffer I containing 0.1% digitonin. Then it was incubated in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 3.4 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation to precipitate the gel (20,000 × g, 5 min), the supernatant fraction was subjected to Western blotting as the immunoprecipitation pellet fraction. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa-S3 cells were transfected with various phCERT-GFP constructs or pHcRed-VAPA by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and grown on glass coverslips for 48 h. The cells were fixed in Mildform ®10N (Wako) for 20 min and then incubated with 0.1 m NH4Cl in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After two washes with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on PermaFluor™ Aqueous Mounting Medium (Thermo Electron Corp.) and then observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Axiovert 100M; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a LSM510 system (Carl Zeiss). For the staining of the ER, HeLa-S3 cells were transfected and grown on coverslips for 48 h. After a change of medium to a prewarmed culture medium containing 0.25 μm ER-Tracker™ Blue-White DPX probe (Molecular Probes, Inc.), the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then the medium was replaced with normal culture medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, fixed, and observed as described above. Indirect immunocytochemical analysis with anti-GS28 monoclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.) as a primary antibody and Alexa 488-conjugated or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was performed as previously described (19Yasuda S. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4176-4183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CERT Interacts with VAP-A in a FFAT Motif-dependent Manner—To examine whether CERT interacts with VAPs, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation analysis using epitope-tagged human VAP-A and CERT constructs. After their transfection with expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged CERT and HA-tagged VAP-A, CHO-K1 cells were lysed with the mild detergent digitonin, and the supernatant fluid obtained by high speed centrifugation of the lysate was used as a solubilized cell extract. When the FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was used, virtually all of the FLAG-tagged CERT present in the cell extract was precipitated (Fig. 2A, right panels, lane 3), and ∼1% of the HA-tagged VAP-A present in the extract was also precipitated (Fig. 2A, left panels, lane 3). Far less HA-tagged VAP-A was precipitated in the absence of FLAG-tagged CERT, although the expression of HA-tagged VAP-A was not affected by the co-expression of FLAG-tagged CERT (Fig. 2A, left panels, lanes 2 and 3). Note that the 33-kDa doublet bands observed in the anti-HA blots were identified as the HA-tagged VAP-A protein, because such bands were absent in the extract of control cells not transfected with the HA-tagged VAP-A expression plasmid (Fig. 2A, left panels, lane 1). Collectively, these results indicated that VAP-A is co-immunoprecipitated with CERT. We next determined whether the co-immnunoprecipitation of VAP-A with CERT was dependent on the FFAT motif of CERT. For this, we made two mutants of human CERT: CERT(D324A) and CERT ΔFFAT (Fig. 1). The CERT(D324A) mutant has an aspartic acid residue thought to be crucial to the function of the FFAT motif (9Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P.

Neither mutant was co-immunoprecipitated with VAP-A, although levels of the CERT mutants were similar to the level of the wild-type CERT (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). These results indicated that the interaction of CERT with VAP-A is dependent on the FFAT motif. We previously showed that the mutation G67E in CERT destroys the PI4P binding activity of the PH domain and that the CERT(G67E) mutant cannot mediate ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide because of impaired Golgi targeting (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a larger amount of VAP-A was co-immunoprecipitated with CERT(G67E) than with the wild-type CERT control (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lane 6), suggesting that CERT(G67E) interacted with VAP-A more effectively than the wild-type CERT. Interaction of CERT with VAP-B—The human genome encodes two isoforms of VAP, VAP-A and VAP-B, at different gene loci (14Nishimura Y. Hayashi M. Inada H. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and VAP-A and VAP-B are suggested to form a homodimer and also a heterodimer (14Nishimura Y. Hayashi M. Inada H. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Wyles J.P. McMaster C.R. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29908-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We next examined whether CERT also interacts with VAP-B. In the extract of cells expressing both FLAG-tagged CERT and HA-tagged VAP-A, HA-VAP-A was clearly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-CERT by the anti-FLAG antibody, when compared with the control using the extract of cells expressing HA-VAP-A but not FLAG-CERT (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), being consistent with our previous results (Fig. 2A). HA-VAP-B was also significantly co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-CERT, compared with the FLAG-CERT-absent control (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). In our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, both VAPs were detected by Western blotting for the HA epitope with the anti-HA antibody. Nevertheless, the band of VAP-B in the co-immunoprecipitated fraction was fainter than that of VAP-A, whereas the band of VAP-B in the cell extract (input fraction) was intenser than that of VAP-A (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5). These results suggested that CERT could interact with VAP-B, but less efficiently than with VAP-A. It should also be noted that we could not observe significant co-immunoprecipitation of VAPs with CERT when the cell lysate was diluted more or when the widely used nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was employed in place of digitonin in our co-immunoprecipitation experiments unless cells were pretreated with a membrane-permeable chemical cross-linker (data not shown). These observations might reflect a weak and transient interaction of CERT with VAPs in cells. Mutation in the FFAT Motif Affects the Synthesis of SM in Intact Cells—The CHO mutant LY-A cell line is defective in the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide for the synthesis of SM, because of the mutation G67E in the endogenous CERT gene (3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). To minimize possible artifacts caused by extreme overproduction after transient transfection, we obtained stable transformants of LY-A cells with an expression plasmid encoding wild-type human CERT, CERT(G67E), or CERT(D324A) and analyzed these transformants. To compare expression levels, Western blotting of CERT was performed using anti-COL4A3BP antibody (Genway Biotech), which was raised by immunization of a chicken with the recombinant human CERT protein. Although the anti-CERT antibody was virtually mono-specific to the endogenous human CERT and its splicing variant CERTL in HeLa-S3 cells, they cross-reacted with an unknown protein with a Mr of ∼65,000 in addition to the endogenous hamster CERT and CERTL in CHO cells (Fig. 3A). Despite the difficulty with mono-specific detection of CERT in CHO cells, Western blotting showed that the levels of exogenously expressed human CERT are similar among the LY-A transformants designated LY-A/CERT, LY-A/CERT(D324A), and LY-A/CERT(G67E), and about five times the level of the endogenous CERT in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). For analysis of the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids, we performed metabolic labeling of lipids with radioactive serine in CHO cells. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into SM during2hof labeling in LY-A cells was ∼10% of the level in parental CHO-K1 cells. Although the rate at which SM was synthesized in LY-A/CERT cells was near the parental level, the rate in LY-A/CERT(D324A) cells was ∼35% of the parental level, indicating that CERT(D324A) was less active than the wild-type CERT in the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide in CHO cells (Fig. 3B). The amount of SM produced in LY-A/CERT(G67E) cells was ∼20% of the parental level, like in non-transfected LY-A cells. De novo synthesis of sphingoid bases appears to be down-regulated when the consumption of ceramide is inhibited, although its mechanism is unknown. Thus, for a more specific analysis of the conversion of ceramide to SM, we also performed metabolic labeling with radioactive sphingosine as a precursor, which bypasses the synthesis of sphingoid bases to label complex sphingolipids. When cells were incubated with [3H]-sphingosine for 2 h, slightly less [3H]SM was produced in LY-A/CERT(D324A) than in LY-A/CERT cells, although more [3H]ceramide accumulated in the LY-A/CERT-(D324A) cells. Again, LY-A/CERT-(G67E) cells showed a more severe deficiency of [3H]SM formation, like nontransfected LY-A cells. The activity of SM synthase in LY-A cells is similar to or slightly higher than that in parental CHO-K1 cells (1Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the mutation D324A in the FFAT motif of CERT impairs the ER-to-Golgi ceramide trafficking function of CERT. Although we failed to obtain stable LY-A transformants with the CERT ΔFFAT mutant, we could examine the activity of the mutant protein in semi-intact cells as shown below. Of note, when cells were labeled with [14C]serine, the levels of [14C]ceramide and [14C]GlcCer produced in LY-A cells were ∼100 and ∼60%, respectively, of these in LY-A/CERT cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, when labeled with [3H]sphingosine, LY-A cells produced 2.5 times more [3H]ceramide, and 1.2-1.5 times more [3H]GlcCer and [3H]GM3 than LY-A/CERT cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that wild-type CERT is not essential for the synthesis of GlcCer. The mild reduction of [14C]serine-derived GlcCer in LY-A cells is probably due to down-regulation of de novo synthesis of sphingoid bases. But there is another mutually nonexclusive possibility; de novo synthesis of GlcCer would partially depend on CERT, so that the formation of [14C]serine-derived GlcCer might be mildly reduced in LY-A cells. In both cases, a ceramide flow without wild-type CERT likely has a capacity of attaining the enhanced formation of [3H]sphingosine-derived glycosphingolipids. Effects of the Mutations in FFAT Motif on ER-to-Golgi Trafficking of Ceramide within Semi-intact Cells—The trafficking of ceramide from the ER to the site where SM is produced de novo can be reconstituted within semi-intact CHO cells consisting of perforated cells, isolated cytosols, and other supplements such as ATP (2Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the reconstitution system, the trafficking of ceramide in LY-A cells recommenced when the LY-A cytosol was replaced with parental CHO-K1 cytosol or purified CERT was added to the LY-A cytosol (2Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). We examined whether various recombinant CERT proteins purified from a bacterial expression system could restore the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide in semi-intact LY-A cells. When a small amount (2 ng/assay) of purified wild-type CERT was added to the reconstituted LY-A cells, the level of ceramide-to-SM conversion was almost identical to the level attained by using the CHO-K1 cytosol in place of the LY-A cytosol. In contrast, 2 ng of CERT(D324A) or CERT ΔFFAT restored the ceramide-to-SM conversion to only 25% or less of the wild-type level (Fig. 4A). CERT(G67E) showed even less activity. Western blotting using anti-CERT antibody showed that the level of exogenously added human CERT when a small amount was used in the reconstitution system is comparable with the level of endogenous CERT in the CHO cytosol and HeLa cell lysate (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Based on these findings together with the results of metabolic labeling in intact cells, we concluded that not only the PI4P-recognizing PH domain but also the VAP-binding FFAT motif is i"

https://openalex.org/W2158564117,"Bilaterian animals have a Hox gene cluster essential for patterning the main body axis, and a ParaHox gene cluster. Comparison of Hox and ParaHox genes has led workers to postulate that both clusters originated from the duplication of an ancient cluster named ProtoHox, which contained up to four genes with at least the precursors of anterior and posterior Hox/ParaHox genes. However, the way in which genes diversified within the ProtoHox, Hox and ParaHox clusters remains unclear because no systematic study of non-bilaterian animals exists. Here we characterize the full Hox/ParaHox gene complements and genomic organization in two cnidarian species (Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata), and suggest a ProtoHox cluster simpler than originally thought on the basis of three arguments. First, both species possess bilaterian-like anterior Hox genes, but their non-anterior genes do not appear as counterparts of either bilaterian central or posterior genes; second, two clustered ParaHox genes, Gsx and a gene related to Xlox and Cdx, are found in Nematostella vectensis; and third, we do not find clear phylogenetic support for a common origin of bilaterian Cdx and posterior genes, which might therefore have appeared after the ProtoHox cluster duplication. Consequently, the ProtoHox cluster might have consisted of only two anterior genes. Non-anterior genes could have appeared independently in the Hox and ParaHox clusters, possibly after the separation of bilaterians and cnidarians."

We screened a library of extracts from 50 Chinese herbal plants using a calcium-imaging assay to find compounds active on TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels. An extract from the plant Andrographis paniculata potently activated TRPV4 channels. The extract was fractionated further, and the active compound was identified as bisandrographolide A (BAA). We used purified compound to characterize the activity of BAA on certain TRPV channel subtypes.

Presumably, the assembly of four polypeptide subunits into a pore permeable to cations forms TRP channels. The pore opens and closes (gates) to allow cations to cross the membrane, and gating is usually controlled by one or more stimuli (e.g. ligand binding). Many TRP channels including TRPV4 are involved in sensing properties of the extracellular or intracellular environment (e.g. temperature, acidity, osmolarity, etc.). These characteristics provide a general description of TRP channels; however, a universal function for the TRP channel superfamily has yet to be found. TRPV4 is one of six members of the vanilloid TRP subfamily; the first member of this group of channels is TRPV1, a channel gated by multiple stimuli including capsaicin, protons, heat, and anandamide (1Caterina M.J.

TRPV4 is most closely related to TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 as determined by sequence homology. In addition these four channels are functionally similar because they are all activated by increases in temperature. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are notably different from the other four TRPV channels as determined by sequence homology and channel function; both TRPV5 and TRPV6 are highly calcium-selective in contrast to most other TRP channels (4Nilius B.

Similar to TRPV1, TRPV4 can be activated by a wide range of stimuli including low osmolarity solutions; heating to warm temperatures; metabolites of arachidonic acid (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids) and 4-α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4αPDD), a synthetic phorbol ester often used as a negative control for phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (6Strotmann R.

For example, TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin, the “hot” ingredient in chili peppers; TRPV3 is activated by camphor from an evergreen tree, carvacrol in oregano, and eugenol in thyme (16Moqrich A.

These are several prominent examples, but other compounds with activity on TRP channels also have been described. To search for novel compounds active on TRP channels, we used the Starr collection, a library of prefractionated extracts of 50 plants used in traditional Chinese medicine, which was assembled by the Osher Institute at Harvard Medical School. We used a calcium-imaging assay to screen the library for activity on TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels. Extracts active in the calcium-imaging screen were analyzed further in an electrophysiology assay. Extracts displaying activity in the electrophysiology assay were purified, chemically analyzed, and tested to identify the active compound in the extract. We show that a compound called bisandrographolide A (BAA) contained in extracts of the plant Andrographis paniculata activates TRPV4 channels. We speculate about the possibility that activation of TRPV4 by BAA might play a role in some of the reported effects of Andrographis extract in traditional medicine. Cell Culture—HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in media containing 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2. 308 cells from a mouse keratinocyte cell line were maintained at 37 °C in medium containing 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2. We received the 308 keratinocytes from S. H. Yuspa at the National Cancer Institute; this cell line is a papilloma-derived keratinocyte cell line from adult BALB/c mouse skin (21Yuspa S.H.

Calcium Imaging—35-mm dishes of HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of either human TRPV3 or mouse TRPV4 cDNA and 0.25 μg of dsRed2 cDNA (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h transfected cells were subcultured into 96-well plates. 48-72 h after transfection cells were loaded with the calcium indicator dye Fluo-4. 5 μm Fluo-4 AM (acetoxymethyl ester) (Molecular Probes) and 0.2% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) dissolved in Opti-mem (Invitrogen) were added to cells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 45 min. Cells were rinsed twice with a standard extracellular saline solution (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15-30 min. Calcium imaging was performed on an Olympus microscope with a cooled Hamamatsu charge-coupled device camera. 10-50 transfected cells in the field were selected by red fluorescence, and average Fluo-4 fluorescence was measured in these cells over time. Images were recorded at 3-s intervals. Cells that did not remain in the field for the duration of the experiment were eliminated from analysis. The first five points in the experiment were averaged to find the base-line fluorescence (Fbaseline), and ΔF/F ((Ft - Fbaseline)/Fbaseline) was calculated for each cell at all time points. Average ΔF/F of all cells in the field was calculated and plotted versus time. Error bars are means ± S.E. Electrophysiology—35-mm dishes of HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg (Figs. 1 and 5) or 3 μg (Fig. 4) of mouse TRPV4 cDNA or 1 μg of rat TRPV1, rat TRPV2, or human TRPV3 (Fig. 2) using Lipofectamine 2000. Channel DNA was cotransfected with 0.25 μg of either eGFP or dsRed2 cDNA as a marker for transfection. After 6-12 h transfected cells were subcultured onto glass coverslips, and recordings were made 24-72 h after transfection. We visualized eGFP- or dsRed2-positive cells with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, ×40, N.A. 0.9) and recorded currents using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments). During voltage ramps, currents were sampled at 10 kHz, and the recordings were filtered at 2 kHz. For all experiments the membrane potential was held at -60 mV. Borosilicate glass pipettes with resistances of 2-4 megohms were used for recording. For recording HEK293T cells, the bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. For recording 308 cells we used a low chloride bath solution containing 135 mm sodium gluconate, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsMES, 2 mm calcium gluconate, 1mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. For recording cell-free patches we used a nominally Ca2+-free external solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. In all recordings measuring TRPV4 currents, the pipette solution contained 100 mm CsMES, 10 mm CsCl, 3 mm MgATP, 0.2 mm NaGTP, 10 mm Cs4BAPTA, 80 μm CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 20 mm mannitol, pH 7.3. Free [Ca2+] in the pipette solution was ∼1nm as calculated by MaxChelator. For measurement of TRPV1, TRPV2, or TRPV3 currents the pipette solution contained 100 mm CsMES, 4 mm CsCl, 3 mm MgATP, 0.2 mm NaGTP, 10 mm Cs4BAPTA, 3.2 mm CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 20 mm mannitol, pH 7.3. Free [Ca2+] in the pipette solution was ∼100 nm as calculated by MaxChelator. Junction potentials were corrected in all experiments.FIGURE 5Andrographolide does not activate TRPV4 channels.

Final Me2SO concentrations were 0.1-0.5%. Continuous perfusion during BAA experiments was not feasible because the quantity of BAA was limited. For these experiments we diluted BAA to the indicated concentration and added 500 μl of solution directly to the bath; bath volume was ∼250 μl. Plant Material—Fifty herbs that are used widely in traditional Chinese medicine were selected and obtained by Dr. David Eisenberg and his colleagues at the Osher Institute at Harvard Medical School. Extraction and Prefractionation—Extraction and prefractionation steps were performed at the Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio) in Costa Rica. Gram quantities of each of the Chinese medicinal plants were extracted using methanol with grinding. The extract from each plant was evaporated in a minimum volume of methanol and adsorbed onto Diaion HP20 (Mitsubishi Chemical). The resin was washed with deionized water and extracted with ethanol. This solution was adjusted to 20% aqueous ethanol and loaded onto a 500-ml RP-C18 column, where it was separated into 48 fractions. Fractions of sufficient weight, as judged by evaporative light-scattering detection, were evaporated, reconstituted in Me2SO, arrayed in 96-well plates, and shipped to the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology-Longwood at Harvard Medical School for integration into their screening platform. Isolation and Characterization of BAA—The active fraction from Andrographis was separated by HPLC on an Agilent 1100 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies) using a semipreparative Discovery HS-C18 column (Supelco, 250 × 10 mm, 5-mm particle size) with an acetonitrile-water gradient to afford 0.4 mg of pure, active compound. One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional (double quantum filtered 1H-1H COSY (dqfCOSY), 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)) NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Oxford NMR AS500 spectrometer with standard pulse sequences operating at 500 MHz. CD3OD was used as solvent. Offline processing was conducted using Mestre-C NMR software (Mestrelab Research). The NMR data revealed a diterpene dimer with the bisandrographolide carbon skeleton shown in Fig. 1E. 1H chemical shifts were identical to literature values for BAA (22Matsuda T. Kuroyanagi M. Sugiyama S. Umehara K. Ueno A. Nishi K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1994; 42: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). The liquid chromatography mass spectrum (LC/MS) of the active compound was obtained using a Micromass Platform LC-Z spectrometer equipped with a Waters 2690 LC system and Waters 2690 photodiode array detector, was processed using MassLynx software (Waters Corporation), and revealed a molecular ion [M + 1]+ of 665.53, consistent with BAA. We screened a library of extracts from 50 plants used in traditional Chinese medicine using a Ca2+-imaging assay. The assay could detect compounds that opened or blocked TRPV3 channels and those that opened TRPV4 channels. Each extract at ∼10 μg/ml was added to HEK293T cells transfected with either TRPV3 or TRPV4 cDNA and loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4. Extracts that specifically altered Ca2+ influx in the Ca2+-imaging screen were tested further in an electrophysiological assay to verify activity. Although one extract displayed blocking activity for TRPV3 in the Ca2+-imaging assay, the effect could not be repeated in the electrophysiology assay. Several fractions stimulated Ca2+ influx in TRPV4-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 2). In the electrophysiology assay 10 μg/ml fraction H11 from the Starr collection caused activation of a large current in HEK293T cells overexpressing TRPV4 channels (Fig. 1, A and B). NMR analysis showed that fraction H11 contained several compounds; H11 was separated further by reverse phase HPLC, and the fractions were tested in the electrophysiology assay to identify a single active compound. This compound was identified as bisandrographolide A by NMR and mass spectrometry (Fig. 1E). No other compounds in fraction H11 activated TRPV4 current. We applied purified BAA to TRPV4-expressing cells to confirm that the compound activated TRPV4 channels similar to fraction H11 (Fig. 1, C and D). We also obtained a dose-response curve for activation of TRPV4 channels by BAA. Fig. 1F shows the average maximum inward current density measured at -110 mV plotted against concentration of BAA; data are fitted with a Hill equation (EC50 = 950 nm BAA, Hill coefficient = 1.4). A dose-response curve plotting average I/Imax (current normalized to the maximum inward current measured at -110 mV in each experiment) against the concentration of BAA yielded a similar result: EC50 = 790 nm BAA, Hill coefficient = 1.8 (data not shown). To determine whether the activity of BAA was specific for TRPV4, we applied BAA to other closely related vanilloid TRP channels. As shown in Fig. 2, BAA did not activate TRPV1, TRPV2, or TRPV3 channels overexpressed in HEK293T cells even though these channels were robustly activated by known agonists (100 nm capsaicin, 500 μm 2-APB, or 100 μm 2-APB, respectively; n = 5 for each experiment). In addition, we tested whether the compound could block activation of TRPV1, TRPV2, or TRPV3 channels. However, we did not observe blocking after application of 5 μm BAA (data not shown). We did not test other TRP channel subtypes. To test whether BAA activates endogenously expressed TRPV4 channels similar to heterologously expressed channels, we investigated currents in 308 cells, a mouse keratinocyte cell line previously shown to express both TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels (23Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We could stimulate large TRPV4 currents after the addition of 1 or 10 μm 4αPDD in approximately half of the cells recorded (n = 7 of 16 cells); current activated by 10 μm 4αPDD in a 308 cell is shown in Fig. 3A. All recordings from 308 cells were performed in a low chloride bath solution to decrease the magnitude of a very large Ca2+-activated chloride current that was activated as a result of Ca2+ influx through open TRPV4 channels. The 4αPDD-activated current most likely resulted from the opening of homomeric TRPV4 channels. Western blots (not shown) confirmed a previous study demonstrating that TRPV4 and TRPV3 subunits do not coassemble to form heteromeric channels (24Hellwig N. Albrecht N. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 23Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Similar to the action of 4αPDD, when 5 μm BAA was applied to 308 cells, large TRPV4 currents were recorded in approximately half of the cells (Fig. 3B, n = 6 of 11 cells). Although the time to peak current shown in the figure was rather slow, the current began to activate shortly after application of BAA. Also, the time to peak TRPV4 current varied a great deal from cell to cell even when measured from heterologously expressed TRPV4 channels. We note that the reversal potential of the current activated by BAA is shifted slightly to the left of 0 mV. We believe this effect was due to activation of residual chloride current by Ca2+ entering through TRPV4 channels during prolonged activation. These results support the hypothesis that BAA is an effective activator of endogenous TRPV4 channels. To determine whether this compound activates TRPV4 in a membrane-delimited manner, we applied 5 μm BAA to cell-free outside-out patches excised from HEK293T cells overexpressing TRPV4 cDNA (Fig. 4). These experiments were performed in an external solution with no added Ca2+ to slow inactivation of the current. 5 μm BAA can activate a substantial current in excised patches with properties similar to whole-cell currents under similar conditions. The reversal potential, rectification of the current through the channel, and the time course of activation are similar to TRPV4 current measured in whole cells bathed in nominally Ca2+-free external solution. We note that the reversal potential of the current in Fig. 4A is also shifted to the left of 0 mV. In this instance we attribute the shift to the lack of external Ca2+. The ability of BAA to activate TRPV4 in patches suggests that the action of BAA does not require signaling through soluble internal factors. The most abundant compound isolated from A. paniculata is andrographolide (Fig. 5A), the monomer of BAA. Andrographolide has been shown previously to block NF-κB activation with an IC50 of ∼10 μm and to display anti-inflammatory properties in mouse models of inflammation (25Xia Y.F. Ye B.Q. Li Y.D. Wang J.G. He X.J. Lin X. Yao X. Ma D. Slungaard A. Hebbel R.P. Key N.S. Geng J.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4207-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We applied high concentrations of andrographolide to TRPV4-expressing cells to determine whether andrographolide has activity similar to BAA. However, application of 0.1-1 mm andrographolide did not activate TRPV4 channels, although a large TRPV4 current could be elicited by the agonist 4αPDD (Fig. 5, B and C). High concentrations of andrographolide also did not activate or block activation of TRPV1, TRPV2, or TRPV3 channels (data not shown). In this study we have identified a novel activator of TRPV4 channels from the plant A. paniculata used in traditional medicine in many regions of Asia. The compound, bisandrographolide A, has an EC50 of ∼790-950 nm for TRPV4 activation and is not active on other closely related members of the vanilloid TRP subfamily (TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3) at concentrations that fully activate TRPV4 channels. We have shown that BAA activated endogenous TRPV4 channels in keratinocytes. We also demonstrated that BAA activated TRPV4 channels in cell-free outside-out patches, suggesting that activation is membrane-delimited and not dependent on diffusible internal factors. Furthermore, we tested the activity of the monomer andrographolide on TRPV channels, and found that andrographolide neither activated nor blocked TRPV1, -V2, -V3, or -V4 channels. TRPV4 is a nonselective cation channel that can be activated by a wide range of stimuli, like several other transient receptor potential channels. Activation causes opening of a pore that allows Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ions to cross the membrane. The resulting increases in internal free [Ca2+] and changes in transmembrane voltage potentially can affect cell signaling. TRPV4 has been implicated in osmoregulation, nociception, regulation of vascular tone, and heat sensation. The plant A. paniculata is used in traditional medicine in various parts of Asia for a wide array of ailments. Extracts are typically used as an anti-inflammatory agent or immunostimulant. Indications include upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, fever, tonsillitis, snakebite, and many others (26NiceData SoftwareTraditional Chinese Medicines Database, Version 2.1. CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA2004Google Scholar). How the extract is used seems to vary widely depending on the region. Extracts of Andrographis are used as an herbal remedy for the common cold in Sweden where pills with a standardized amount of Andrographis extract and another herb (Eleutherococcus senticosus) are made and sold under the name Kan Jang. Because of the widespread use of Andrographis extract in traditional medicine, there have been a relatively large number of studies investigating the effects of Andrographis extract as well as compounds purified from the extract. Many articles have focused on andrographolide, the most abundant compound in Andrographis. In one study, andrographolide was shown to inhibit NF-κB activation and reduce inflammatory response in a variety of mouse models (25Xia Y.F. Ye B.Q. Li Y.D. Wang J.G. He X.J. Lin X. Yao X. Ma D. Slungaard A. Hebbel R.P. Key N.S. Geng J.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4207-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This mechanism may account for some of the anti-inflammatory effects of Andrographis. In addition to andrographolide, many other compounds have been identified in Andrographis extract. BAA was first identified in 1994 in a screen of naturally occurring substances that induce differentiation of mouse myeloid leukemia (M1) cells (22Matsuda T. Kuroyanagi M. Sugiyama S. Umehara K. Ueno A. Nishi K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1994; 42: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These authors identified 18 compounds found in methanol extracts of Andrographis paniculata, including BAA and three other andrographolide dimers; they also showed that BAA and two stereoisomers stimulated phagocytosis and inhibited growth in M1 cells, suggesting that these compounds can induce differentiation of these cells (22Matsuda T. Kuroyanagi M. Sugiyama S. Umehara K. Ueno A. Nishi K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1994; 42: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although several other compounds found in the Andrographis extract had similar effects on M1 cells, BAA and its stereoisomers had the strongest effects (22Matsuda T. Kuroyanagi M. Sugiyama S. Umehara K. Ueno A. Nishi K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1994; 42: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Many experiments on Andrographis have focused on its antiinflammatory and immunostimulant properties; however, there have been a small number of studies on the cardiovascular effects of Andrographis. These studies were prompted by the use of Andrographis extract for hypertension in Malaysian traditional medicine. The authors found that administration of Andrographis extract transiently reduced the blood pressure of rats. Furthermore, they found that administration of pure andrographolide did not produce a similar reduction in blood pressure, suggesting that other compounds were eliciting the effect (27Zhang C.Y. Tan B.K. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1996; 23: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Zhang C.Y. Tan B.K. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1997; 56: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further studies by this group investigated how 14-deoxyandrographolide and 14-dideoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide, two compounds also found in Andrographis extract, might be responsible for the observation (29Zhang C. Kuroyangi M. Tan B.K. Pharmacol. Res. 1998; 38: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Zhang C.Y. Tan B.K. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1998; 25: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Zhang C.Y. Tan B.K. Phytother. Res. 1999; 13: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on our results and several other studies on the role of TRPV4 in the vascular system, it is possible that activation of TRPV4 by BAA also might contribute to the observed reduction in blood pressure. A recent article suggests that TRPV4 activation may result in smooth muscle hyperpolarization and arterial dilation (32Earley S. Heppner T.J. Nelson M.T. Brayden J.E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The experiments from Earley et al. (32Earley S. Heppner T.J. Nelson M.T. Brayden J.E. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) support the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through TRPV4 channels in arterial smooth muscle cells increases the number of Ca2+ sparks that activate large conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channels, and the resulting increase in potassium current causes hyperpolarization and arterial dilation. Andrographis extract containing BAA presumably could act on vascular smooth muscle by the same mechanism to cause arterial dilation and a decrease in blood pressure. According to a data base of information on compounds found in plants used in traditional Chinese medicine (26NiceData SoftwareTraditional Chinese Medicines Database, Version 2.1. CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA2004Google Scholar), Andrographis also is used to treat snake bite and eczema, two conditions relating to the skin. Unfortunately there is little research on the efficacy of Andrographis extracts for treating these conditions. There are, however, some hints that TRPV4 might play a role in skin function. TRPV4 is highly expressed in skin, particularly in keratinocytes (10Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Delany N.S. Hurle M. Facer P. Alnadaf T. Plumpton C. Kinghorn I. See C.G. Costigan M. Anand P. Woolf C.J. Crowther D. Sanseau P.

BMC Womens Health. 2005; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As shown previously (35Chung M.K. Lee H. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21569-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) as well as in our experiments, very large currents can be elicited in keratinocytes by TRPV4 agonists. The Ca2+ influx through TRPV4 channels could play a role in skin function, because it is known that Ca2+ signaling plays an important role in the proliferation and terminal differentiation of keratinocytes (36Lansdown A.B. Wound Repair Regen. 2002; 10: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, there is some evidence that epoxyeicosatrienoic acid signaling may be involved in keratinocyte cornification (37Ladd P.A. Du L. Capdevila J.H. Mernaugh R. Keeney D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35184-35192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that TRPV4 is present in mouse and human skin, we do not know enough about its functional role to speculate further on how activation of the channel could affect injury to the skin. Our experiments show that TRPV4 is activated by BAA, a compound contained in extracts of the herbal medicine A. paniculata, with an EC50 of 790-950 nm. Andrographis extract is used as a traditional medicine in various parts of Asia for a wide variety of illnesses. It is possible that activation of TRPV4 by BAA could play a role in some of the effects of Andrographis extract that have been reported previously. S. H.

https://openalex.org/W2017092095,"The protein Ser/Thr phosphatase family contains three enzymes called PP2A, PP4, and PP6 with separate biological functions inferred from genetics of the yeast homologues Pph21/22, Pph3, and Sit4. These catalytic subunits associate with a common subunit called α4 (related to yeast Tap42). Here, we characterized recombinant PP6 and PP2A catalytic monomers and α4·phosphatase heterodimers. Monomeric PP6 and PP2A showed identical kinetics using either p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) or 32P-myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrates, with matching Km and Vmax values. Using pNPP as substrate, PP6 and PP2A gave the same IC50 with active site inhibitors okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, calyculin A, and cantharidin. However, with MBP as substrate, PP6 was inhibited at 5-fold lower concentrations of toxins relative to PP2A, suggesting PP6 might be a preferred in vivo target of toxins. Heterodimeric α4·PP6 and α4·PP2A were starkly different. With MBP as substrate the α4·PP2A heterodimer had a 100-fold higher Vmax than α4·PP6, and neither heterodimer was active with pNPP. Thus, these phosphatases are distinguished by their different responses to allosteric binding of the common regulatory subunit α4. Transient expression of α4 differentially increased or decreased phosphorylation of endogenous phosphoproteins, consistent with opposing effects on PP2A and PP6."

However, the relative importance of the major platelet PKC isoforms and their downstream effectors in platelet signaling and function remain unclear.

Analysis of PKCδ phosphorylation and translocation to the membrane following activation by both collagen and thrombin indicates that it is positively regulated by αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Moreover, PKCδ triggers activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK)/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and the p38 MAPK signaling.

Platelets are required for normal hemostasis but are also actively involved in thrombosis, restenosis, and inflammatory reactions. Platelet interactions with other components of the blood and with the vascular wall represent a fundamental aspect of platelet function. These interactions are primarily mediated by specific cell adhesion molecules that induce adhesion to other platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix, leading to platelet activation and amplification of the thrombo-inflammatory reactions (1Frojmovic M.M.

This in turn induces platelet signaling and activation, which lead to aggregation through αIIbβ3 binding to fibrinogen (8Hato T. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Michelson A.D. Platelets.

Platelet signaling may be induced by the adhesion process itself or by several agonists leading to granule secretion and activation (9Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb.

Furthermore, collagen, the most abundant protein of the extracellular matrix, promotes the adhesion and activation of platelets through its binding to platelet integrin α2β1 and GPVI (14Morton L.F.

The conventional PKC isoforms (PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ) are regulated by both DAG and Ca2+, the novel isoforms (PKCδ, PKCϵ, PKCθ, and PKCη) are insensitive to Ca2+, and the atypical isoforms (PKCζ and PKCι/λ) are Ca2+- and DAG-insensitive (23Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Even though PKCs share a high degree of homology, it is believed that particular PKC isoforms have unique and specific functions within different cell types (24Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In platelets, multiple PKC isoforms are expressed (25Murugappan S. Tuluc F. Dorsam R.T. Shankar H. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol.

Commun. 1993; 191: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and it is presumed that each individual isoform plays one or more distinct roles. Indeed, several studies have underlined a role for PKCs in platelet function, such as aggregation and secretion of granular contents (29Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Siess W. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 309-318PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gerrard J.M. Beattie L.L. Park J. Israels S.J. McNicol A. Lint D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Blood. 1989; 74: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of individual PKC isoforms in platelet function remains to be elucidated. For instance, although it is well established that collagen-induced platelet activation and aggregation through GPVI is mediated by tyrosine kinase Syk and activation of PLCγ2 (32Blake R.A. Schieven G.L. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 33Yanaga F. Poole A. Asselin J. Blake R. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Law C.L. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), there is limited information concerning the roles of specific PKC isoforms and their downstream effectors in this process. This study was therefore undertaken to examine the role of PKCs, in particular PKCδ, in platelet activation and aggregation. Using thrombin and collagen, two physiological and potent platelet activators, we were able to show that PKCδ is essential for collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and activation of integrin αIIbβ3. This study also shows that PKCδ is positively regulated by αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling and is involved in the release of TxA2 through the MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, which is required for collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet activation and aggregation. Materials—All of the cell-permeable signaling inhibitors were from Calbiochem. The TP receptor (TxA2 receptor) antagonist SQ29548 was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The αIIbβ3 receptor antagonists Reopro and Aggrastat came from Centocor (Horsham, PA) and Merck (Whitehouse, NJ), respectively. Phospho-specific antibodies for PKCδ, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK came from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). The PKCδ isoform-selective antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), whereas the anti-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 antibodies were from cell signaling. Rottlerin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) is a cell-permeable PKC inhibitor that selectively inhibits PKCδ (IC50 = 3-6 μm) 5-10-fold more potently than α and β and 13-33-fold more potently than ϵ, ζ, and η. In platelets, its widely used at 5-10 μm as a specific inhibitor of the novel PKCδ (25Murugappan S. Tuluc F. Dorsam R.T. Shankar H. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2360-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24533-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Preparation of Human Platelets—Venous blood was drawn from healthy volunteers, free from medication known to interfere with platelet function for at least 10 days before the experiment, in accordance with the guideline of the ethical committee of the Montreal Heart Institute. The platelets were prepared as previously described (35Theoret J.F. Bienvenu J.G. Kumar A. Merhi Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 658-664PubMed Google Scholar, 36Caron A. Theoret J.F. Mousa S.A. Merhi Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 40: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the platelets were obtained by series of differential centrifugations and adjusted to a final concentration of 250 × 106/ml using an automated cell counter in which purity exceeded 99%. The platelets were allowed to stand at 37 °C for 30 min before further experiments. Platelet Aggregation—Aggregation of washed platelets was monitored on a four-channel optical aggregometer (Chronolog Corp., Havertown, PA) (35Theoret J.F. Bienvenu J.G. Kumar A. Merhi Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 658-664PubMed Google Scholar, 36Caron A. Theoret J.F. Mousa S.A. Merhi Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 40: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The platelets were preincubated with inhibitors for 5 min at 37 °C. The samples were then stimulated under continuous stirring (1000 rpm) at 37 °C. Platelet aggregation was recorded and measured 5 min after the addition of the agonists. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—The platelets were stimulated for the appropriate time with stirring at 37 °C in the presence or absence of inhibitors; the reaction was terminated by the addition of a 4 × SDS-Laemmli sample buffer and then boiled for 10 min. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 8-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, washed, and labeled with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature. Following additional washing steps, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Subcellular Fractionation of Platelets—The platelet reactions were terminated by the addition of an equi-volume of ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and the samples were allowed to stand on ice for 30 min. The platelet lysates were subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C to separate the soluble from the insoluble membrane fractions. The pellets (insoluble Triton X-100 membrane fractions) were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting as described above. Flow Cytometry—αIIbβ3 activation and P-selectin translocation were assessed by flow cytometry, as described previously (35Theoret J.F. Bienvenu J.G. Kumar A. Merhi Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 658-664PubMed Google Scholar, 36Caron A. Theoret J.F. Mousa S.A. Merhi Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2002; 40: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), using monoclonal antibodies against P-selectin (clone AK4 phycoerythrin-conjugated; Santa Cruz) and the active form of αIIbβ3 (clone PAC-1 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated; Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, Canada). The platelets (250 × 106/ml) were preincubated with inhibitors for 5 min at room temperature prior to cell stimulation. The samples were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4°C, washed, and labeled with saturating concentration of monoclonal antibody for 30 min. αIIbβ3 activation was determined by incubating PAC-1 antibody in platelet suspension prior to activation. All of the samples were analyzed on an Altra flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, Canada). Nonspecific labeling was excluded using appropriately labeled isotype-matched control IgG. The platelets were identified and gated by their characteristic forward and side scatter properties, and 20,000 platelets were analyzed from each sample. Confocal Immunofluorescence and Imaging—The platelets from the above experiments were fixed with 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice, and allowed to immobilize on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips overnight. Adhered platelets were subsequently blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with wheat germ agglutinin with Alexa 488 in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The coverslips were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 2% normal donkey serum, incubated with polyclonal anti-PKCδ for 3 h, washed, labeled with anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 555 secondary antibody for 1 h, and mounted on microscopic slides. A series of fluorescent confocal images (Z stacks) were acquired with a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Anti-rabbit (donkey) Alexa 555 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and wheat germ agglutinin with Alexa 488 were visualized using a 543-nm helium-neon laser line and a 488-nm argon laser line, respectively. A 100×/1.3 Plan-Neofluar objective (Zeiss) was used for magnification. Voxel size is 30 × 30 × 150 nm (X, Y, and Z). Z stacks were deconvolved with the Huygens Pro 2.6.5a software (Scientific Volume Imaging). Deconvolved Z stacks were saved in .tif image file format series and transferred to the LSM510 software. Thromboxane A2 Measurement—The platelets were prepared as described above, pretreated with antagonists or with vehicle solution, and stimulated under stirring conditions at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equivolume of ice-cold EDTA solution (10 mm) containing 10 μm of indomethacin, and the samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Thromboxane B2, the stable metabolite of TxA2, was measured using a correlate-EIA thromboxane B2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data Analysis—The experiments were performed at least three times on different donors. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons of multiple treatments in the same individuals were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni t test for multiple comparisons, whereas treatment groups composed of different individuals were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. The values with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Role of PLC in Platelet Activation and Aggregation—Collagen activates platelets via a tyrosine kinase-dependent cascade that culminates in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. Activation of PLCγ leads, in turn, to the generation of second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and DAG, which mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and activate certain PKC isoforms, respectively (14Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Santoro S.A. Walsh J.J. Staatz W.D. Baranski K.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it was important that we first confirm the relative role of PLC in collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet activation and aggregation. As depicted in Fig. 1, collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet activation (αIIbβ3 activation and P-selectin translocation) and aggregation were inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, by the PLC inhibitor U73122. The responses to collagen, but not to thrombin, were completely blocked by PP1 and Piceatannol, which selectively inhibit Src and Syk, respectively (data not shown). These results indicate that platelet activation and aggregation, in response to both collagen and thrombin, occur in a PLC-dependent manner. Implication of PKCs in Platelet Activation and Aggregation—Because PLC is involved in platelet function and PKCs are downstream effectors, we sought to evaluate the specific role of individual PKC isoforms in platelet function. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, aggregation of platelets induced by collagen and thrombin was completely inhibited by the wide spectrum PKC inhibitor, chelerythrin. However, platelet aggregation was not affected by the PKCα and PKCβ inhibitors HBDDE and Hispidin, respectively, or by Gö6976, an inhibitor of both the conventional PKCα and β isoforms. In contrast, collagen-induced platelet aggregation was completely blocked by a selective PKCδ inhibitor (Rottlerin), whereas aggregation of platelets by thrombin remained unaffected by Rottlerin. In addition, activation of αIIbβ3 in response to collagen was completely prevented by PKCδ inhibition, whereas the response to thrombin was less affected (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, P-selectin translocation was slightly reduced by Rottlerin but only in response to thrombin. These results clearly indicate that activation of PKCδ is essential for collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet function. Phosphorylation of PKCδ and Regulation by αIIbβ3—Having shown that PKCδ is essential for collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet activation and aggregation, we next evaluated its phosphorylation as an index of its activation. As expected, both collagen and thrombin were able in a time-dependent manner to phosphorylate PKCδ (Fig. 3A). However, PKCδ appears to be phosphorylated more rapidly by thrombin than by collagen, that is, 30 s after stimulation by thrombin as compared with 60 s by collagen. As shown in Fig. 3B, pretreatment of platelets with U73122 completely prevented the phosphorylation of PKCδ by both collagen and thrombin, indicating that PLC is responsible for the activation of PKCδ. Surprisingly, Rottlerin, which selectively inhibits PKCδ, prevented its phosphorylation by collagen but not by thrombin. Because the results obtained with the phosphorylation state of PKCδ mainly correspond with those obtained with the activation and aggregation of platelets, we presumed that αIIbβ3 might regulate or be involved in the phosphorylation of PKCδ. To support this possibility, we showed that the blockade of αIIbβ3 using Reopro (a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to αIIbβ3) or Aggrastat (a non-peptide antagonist of αIIbβ3) was able to completely abolish the phosphorylation of PKCδ (Fig. 3B) induced by both collagen and thrombin. These results indicate that αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling may positively modulate the phosphorylation of PKCδ. Translocation of PKCδ to Cell Membrane and Regulation by αIIbβ3—One particular and important aspect of PKC activation is the intracellular redistribution of the enzyme from the cytosol to the cell membrane. We studied this mechanism using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation of platelets into soluble and membrane fractions (Fig. 4). We found that in resting platelets, PKCδ is distributed across the cytosol of the cell and redistributed to the membrane after activation by collagen and thrombin. We also found that in platelets pretreated with Rottlerin, U73122, or Reopro, PKCδ was incapable of translocating to the platelet membrane upon activation by collagen. In contrast, thrombin-induced translocation of PKCδ was not affected by Rottlerin but was inhibited by U73122 and Reopro (Fig. 4). Thus, the phosphorylation and translocation of PKCδ to platelet membrane, both events being required for full enzymatic activation, require the engagement of αIIbβ3. Activation of the MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK Pathways by PKCδ—In platelets, both thrombin and collagen can activate MAPK signaling pathways, and it is presumed that the PKC family may be involved in this process (37Papkoff J. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Forsman J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 463-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK pathways may be important downstream effectors of PKCδ involved in platelet activation and aggregation. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, pretreatment with the MAPK kinase inhibitors, U0126 for MEK/ERK and SB202109 for p38, dose-dependently inhibited collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and activation of αIIbβ3 (Fig. 5B). The same results were obtained using two other MEK/ERK and p38 inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580, respectively (data not shown). Furthermore, we assessed the phosphorylation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 upon platelet activation. Fig. 6A shows that both agonists were able to time-dependently phosphorylate MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38. However, thrombin appears to phosphorylate these MAPKs faster than collagen, as observed with the phosphorylation of PKCδ. As expected, U0126 was able to prevent the phosphorylation of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, whereas SB202109 prevented the phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 6B). In addition, U73122 and Rottlerin inhibited the phosphorylation of these kinases, indicating that PLC and PKCδ are involved in this signaling cascade. In contrast, Reopro slightly affected the phosphorylation state of these MAPKs. Thus, it appears that the MEK/ERK and p38 signaling pathways are important downstream effectors of PKCδ in platelets.FIGURE 6PKCδ triggers activation of the MEK/EKR and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. A, time-dependent phosphorylation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 by collagen and thrombin. Washed platelets were stimulated with collagen or thrombin under stirring at 37 °C; the lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p44/42 (ERK1/2), anti-phospho-MEK1/2, and anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. Measurement of total kinase levels was obtained with selective MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 antibodies. B, effects of U0126 (U0, 50 μm), SB202109 (SB, 50 μm), Rottlerin (Rott, 10 μm), U73122 (U, 5 μm), and Reopro (Reo, 100 nm) on collagen- and thrombin-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 or p38. U0/SB indicates that U0 was used for phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 inhibition, whereas SB was used for phospho-P38 inhibition. The blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the results are depicted as the relative percentages of phosphorylation. B, base line; CTL, control.

Blood. 1994; 83: 885-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that thrombin-induced platelet aggregation seems to be less dependent upon these mediators. It was therefore important that we determine the role of TxA2 and ADP secretion in collagen-and thrombin-induced PKCδ signaling. As expected, we were first able to confirm the importance of TxA2 in collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 7A) and activation of integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig. 7B), using the TxA2 receptor antagonist SQ29548 and the COX inhibitor indomethacin. Moreover, the ADP scavenger apyrase also diminished collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet aggregation (Fig. 7A). Given that the secretion of TxA2 appears to be essential for collagen-induced platelet activation and aggregation, we next investigated the role of PKCδ and the other signaling mediators involved in this process. As depicted in Fig. 7C, both collagen- and thrombin-induced TxA2 generation were completely blocked by PLC, PKCδ, MEK/ERK, and p38 inhibitors. However, blockade of the integrin αIIbβ3 receptor with Reopro showed little or no effect on the secretion of TxA2 by platelets. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that PKCδ, in addition to its upstream and downstream effectors, PLC and the MEK/ERK/p38 pathways, respectively, are essential for collagen- and thrombin-mediated TxA2 generation. However, the secretion of TxA2 is necessary for the activation of αIIbβ3 and the aggregation of platelets only in response to collagen but not to thrombin. In platelets, the PKC family is an important signaling mediator required for activation, secretion of granule contents, and aggregation. In the current study, we examined the role of individual PKC isoforms in platelet activation and aggregation induced by physiological agonists such as collagen and thrombin. The major findings are: 1) activation of PKCδ is essential for collagen-induced but not thrombininduced platelet activation of αIIbβ3 and aggregation; 2) the activity of PKCδ, as measured by its phosphorylation and translocation to the platelet membrane upon activation by both collagen and thrombin, is positively regulated by αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling; and 3) PKCδ triggers activation of the MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades and the subsequent release of TxA2, which are essential for collagen-induced but not thrombin-induced platelet activation and aggregation. It is well established that collagen supports the adhesion and activation of platelets at sites of vascular injury via α2β1 and GPVI (43Saelman E.U. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Hese K.M. de Groot P.G.

The ligand binding preference for most siglecs has been characterized using the common capping structures found on N- and O-glycans (15Blixt O. Collins B.E. van den Nieuwenhof I.M. Crocker P.R.

One potential target for siglec binding are gangliosides; that is, glycolipids, which consist of a ceramide linked to a sialylated glycan. All share a common lacto-ceramide core (Galβ(1,4)Glcβ(1-1′)Cer). Diversity is generated by the addition of other neutral sugars and sialic acid in different linkages (and modification of sialic acid itself) (16de Graffenried C.L. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin.

We now present the crystal structure of Siglec-7 in complex with a GT1b ganglioside analog. This structure reveals for the first time how Siglec-7 can form intimate associations with a complex oligosaccharide ligand, leading to a dramatic conformational change in the protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthesis of GT1b—The GT1b analog (see Fig. 1A) was synthesized from the lactose derivative 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl 2,6-di-O-benzyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-2,3,6-tri-O-benzyl-b-d-glucopyranoside using the reaction scheme described by Ishida et al. (28Ishida H.-K. Ohta Y. Tsukada Y. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 246: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).FIGURE 1Binding of the GT1b analog by Siglec-7. A, schematic representations of GT1b ganglioside (top) and the GT1b analog (bottom) are shown. Sugars not seen in the electron density are in red. B, the V-set domain of Siglec-7 was co-crystallized with a GT1b analog. For five of the seven sugar residues there was clearly defined in the electron density. A stereo image of the unbiased |Fo| - |Fc|, φcalc map contoured at 2.5 σ (gray meshwork) is shown. C, a stereo image of the glycan binding site surface. The ligand binding site is very open, and GT1b lies exposed to the solvent. The C-C′ loop forms a convex shelf (marine blue), forming the base of the binding site over which the terminal of the glycan lies. The only portion of the ligand that is buried to any significant degree is the trimethylsilyl group that lies in a hydrophobic cup (green). Arg-124, the essential anchor-residue, is blue. D, the network of potential hydrogen bonds (as defined by WHATIF, Table 2) are shown as black-dashed lines. Several water molecules are stably associated with the ligand and are shown as orange spheres. E, the human CD33-related siglecs were aligned using ClustalW (58Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) and annotated using aln2als (courtesy of Charlie Bond, University of Dundee). The CD33-related siglecs share between 50 and 80% sequence identity in their extracellular domains. Residues showing 100% sequence conservation are shaded in black;ata lower cutoff of 75% identity the shading is gray. The secondary structure, as defined by the liganded form of Siglec-7, is depicted by arrows (β-sheets) and cylinders (α-helices) lying above the alignment. Residues of importance are highlighted by symbols lying beneath the alignment: ★, essential Arg; •, direct interaction with glycan;▵, hydrophobic pocket residues which interact with the trimethylsilyl group; ▿, position equivalent to Trp-85 in Siglec-7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression and Purification of Siglec-7 V-set Domain—The overexpression of the Siglec-7 V-set domain has previously been described (26Alphey M.S.

The V-set domain was expressed as a secreted protein from a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary Lec1 cell line (29Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The media was passed over a sheep anti-Siglec-7 polyclonal antibody affinity column and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The eluate was diluted with 1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5. Deglycosylation was performed using 0.5 units of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science)/mg of protein at 37 °C for 16 h. A gel filtration step was performed using a Superdex 75 26/60 (GE Healthcare) column in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl.Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of the GT1b analog. Crystallization was performed using sitting drop vapor diffusion (crystallization platforms were purchased from Douglas Instruments) screening with Crystal Screens I and II (Hampton Research) at 20 °C. Crystals grew in Crystal Screen I, condition 28 (200 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000) and were cryoprotected with 10% glycerol before freezing under a stream of nitrogen gas. Data were collected to 1.85 Å at beamline ID14-EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at 100 K.Structure Determination and Refinement—Data were processed and scaled by the HKL suite of programs (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). Molecular replacement was performed using AMoRe (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

After model refinement and inclusion of waters, the five sugar residues and the trimethylsilyl group of the GT1b analog were built into good quality |Fo| - |Fc|, φcalc density in the binding site (see Fig. 1B). Ligand coordinates and topology were generated using PRODRG (36Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). The final model has an R-factor of 19.5% and an Rfree of 23.4%, with all non-glycine residues in the most favorable and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (see Table 1 for statistical analysis).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionWavelength (Å)0.9756Resolution (Å)15-1.85(1.92-1.85)Space groupP3221Unit cell (Å)A46.02B46.02C106.47ReflectionsObserved42,394Unique11,626Redundancy3.6 (2.3)Rmerge0.073 (0.52)I/σI25.5 (2.3)Completeness (%)99.3 (98.4)Rfree reflections551Rcryst (%)19.5Rfree (%)23.4RefinementTotal number of atomsProtein971Water54N-Linked glycan14GT1b82〈B 〉 Protein24.39〈B 〉 Water29.61〈B 〉 N-Linked glycan35.01〈B 〉 GT1b28.25Root mean square deviation from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.011Bond angles (°)1.5Main chain B (Å2)1.3 Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of Chimeras—Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on a Siglec-7-Fc chimeric construct in a modified pEE14 plasmid. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were cultured for a further 5 days in X-VIVO 10 serum-free media (BioWhittaker), and the supernatant was harvested. Siglec-7-Fc concentration was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and correct folding was confirmed by ELISA using anti-Siglec-7 monoclonal antibodies (7.7a and 7.5a (18Nicoll G.

The plates were washed 3 times in PBA (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm sodium azide) and blocked with 5% milk powder in PBA. 0.9 μg/ml Siglec-7-Fc fusion proteins were precomplexed with a 1/2000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, and 50 μl/well was added to the each well. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature the plates were washed extensively; the final washes were with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. 100 μl of 10 μm fluorescein diphosphate (Molecular probes) was added to each well, and fluorescence measurements were taken at intervals between 5 and 30 min using a Cytofluor (PerSeptive Biosystems) plate reader.For competition assays, 96-well plates were coated with GT1b ganglioside at 2.5 μg/ml. Precomplexed Siglec-7-Fc (1 μg/ml) was incubated in the presence of either the GT1b analog or GD3 oligosaccharide for 15 min before the addition to GT1b-coated wells.RESULTSOverall Structure—The Siglec-7 V-set domain was expressed as a secreted protein from N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I mutant cell line, Chinese hamster ovary Lec1 (29Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The resulting N-linked glycosylation, at Asn-105, is a homogenous high mannose structure (GlcNAc2Man5) that can be removed by endoglycosidase H digestion, leaving one GlcNAc residue. Deglycosylated Siglec-7 was co-crystallized with a GT1b analog, in which a 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group replaces the ceramide portion. The complex crystallized in a hexagonal space group, as opposed to the tetragonal forms previously seen with the glycosylated, unliganded forms. Synchrotron data were collected, and the complex was solved using molecular replacement. The structure was refined to 1.85 Å, with overall good statistics (see Table 1 and “Experimental Procedures”).The structure of unliganded Siglec-7, as described previously (26Alphey M.S. Attrill H. Crocker P.R. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3372-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is an Ig-like fold; that is, a β-sandwich formed by two β-sheets (strands A′GFCC′ and ABED). The glycan binding site is solvent-exposed, lying on the A′GFCC′ face. Excellent quality |Fo| - |Fc|, φcalc density was seen in the binding site for the GT1b analog, allowing 5 sugar residues and the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl group to be accurately modeled (Fig. 1B). Five (underlined) of the seven sugars of the GT1b analog, Neu5Acα(2,3)Galβ (1,3)GalNAcβ(1,4)[Neu5Acα(2,8)Neu5Acα (2,3)]Galβ(1,4)Glcβ1-(CH2)2Si(CH3)3, are clearly defined in the electron density; the α(2,3)-linked sialic acid branch is not well defined.Examination of the gross anatomy of the GT1b binding site (Fig. 1C) reveals that the site is solvent-exposed; the top edge of the binding site (as defined by the primary sialic acid) is open; the binding face slopes outward from this point and is closed off at the base by a shelf formed by the C-C′ loop (Fig. 1C; see also Fig. 3D). A slight bowl-like character is created by Tyr-136 and Lys-135, which extend from the surface of the protein on the left-hand side of the binding site and the C-C′ loop shelf. The ligand lies across the surface of the binding face, burying a total surface area of 420 Å2 (calculated by AreaIMol, CCP4 suite), lying at its branch point extended across the C-C′ loop shelf. The only portion of the ligand significantly buried is the trimethylsilyl group, which lies in a hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 3Ligand-induced conformational changes. Upon ligand binding two conformational changes occur. A, a stereo image shows a superimposition of the unliganded structure (PDB code 1OVS) and the GT1b complex. The regions in which a conformational shift is observed are shown with orange carbons for the apo form and cyan for the liganded. Panels B and C show the electrostatic surface potential of the apo and liganded forms, respectively (calculated using Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver countoured at -5kTto +5 kT; basic regions are colored blue, and acidic regions are red (59Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5753) Google Scholar). The C-C′ loop in the unliganded structure lies in an extended conformation, with a concave shape, giving the binding site a bowl-like character (A and highlighted with a dotted line in B). Upon the binding of GT1b, a major shift o ccurs in this loop, in particular, Trp-74, which lies under the loop, stacking against Arg-67 (A and B), is rotated so that it lies over the loop, becoming sandwiched between Ile-72 and the Glc of the ligand (A and C). In the liganded structure the C-C′ loop presents a hydrophobic convex shelf-like surface (highlighted by a dotted line in C) to the binding site over which the glycan branch point lies. In the C′-D loop region a further conformational change occurs. Trp-85, which lies across the surface, a point into a hydrophobic pocket (A and B), is displaced by the trimethylsilyl group, which buries itself in the pocket (A and C). Trp-85 flips out, becoming fully solvent exposed, causing the C′-D loop to adopt a helical conformation. As a result a large hydrophobic patch opens up on this side of the binding site (C). Whether this conformational change is artifactual, occurring because it is more energetically favorable to hide the trimethylsilyl group and expose the Trp to the solvent, or whether this may mimic some aspect of ganglioside binding (i.e. the ceramide head) is unclear. D, inhibition of binding of Siglec-7-Fc to GT1b by GT1b analog or GD3 oligosaccharide. Siglec-7-Fc was precomplexed with anti-Fc alkaline phosphatase and incubated with the indicated concentrations of each inhibitor before its addition to GT1b-coated microwells. The experiment was performed in triplicate at each dilution of inhibitor. The data were plotted using the Origin 7.5 graph package, and IC50 values obtained using one site competition model in non-linear curve fitting. IC50 values were not found to be significantly divergent, indicating that the trimethylsilyl group is not a major determinant in the binding of the analog. 2.5 mm of lactose (data not shown) did not significantly hinder binding, showing that this interaction is sialic acid-dependent. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction between GT1b and Siglec-7—The ligand occupies a large area of the binding face of Siglec-7, and each sugar moiety makes a number of contacts with the protein. The GT1b analog makes 10 direct hydrogen bonds with the protein, seven water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and a number hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1D). These interactions are summarized in Table 2. The ligand is held in a “bent” conformation (Fig. 1, B-D); the terminal sialic acid and the glucose at reducing end of the molecule, separated by two sugar residues, are only 3.8 Å apart at their closest points (C6 of Glc and O1A of Neu5Ac). This geometry is supported by interactions with the protein and by five intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1D and Table 2). The conformation of the primary sialic acid allows hydrogen bonding between the C8 hydroxyl and the C1 carboxyl group. Such a conformation has been accessed in molecular dynamics simulations (37Suresh M.X. Veluraja K. J. Theor. Biol. 2003; 222: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 38Vasudevan S.V. Balaji P.V. J. Mol. Struct: THEOCHEM. 2002; 583: 215-232Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

A key salt bridge is formed between the sialic acid carboxylate and the guanidinium group of Arg-124; mutation of this strictly conserved Arg (Fig. 1E) or desialylation of the ligand abolishes binding (19Angata T. Varki A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 39Crocker P.R. Vinson M. Kelm S. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All substituents on the primary sialic acid interact, directly or indirectly, with the protein (Fig. 1D).The subterminal sialic acid (Neu5Ac2) is orientated with it C1 carboxylate facing away from the binding site. Neu5Ac2 makes only one direct hydrogen bond with Siglec-7 via its N-acetyl oxygen to Lys-135. This residue also lies within hydrogen bonding distance of the Neu5Ac1 C9-OH and may, therefore, bridge these sugars. Additional contacts are made via bridging water, between Asn-133, and the N-acetyl oxygen and the C7 hydroxyl of Neu5Ac2. The branch-point galactose (Gal) makes no direct hydrogen bonds with Siglec-7 but interacts with Trp-74 via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. The only portion of the Neu5Acα(2,3)-linked branch for which there is electron density is the GalNAc residue, which also interacts with Trp-74.Glucose (Glc) interacts in two ways with Trp-74 anchoring the reducing end of the glycan; a hydrophobic stacking interaction with the Glc pyranose ring and the tryptophan indole ring and a hydrogen bond between the sugar C6 hydroxyl and head group amide of Asn-133. Trp-74 lies in the C-C′ loop, a region with exceptionally high sequence divergence (Fig. 1E) thought to be responsible for directing Siglec-7 ligand specificity (22Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S. Crocker P.R. Hashimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6324-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).The hydrophobic trimethylsilyl group is held in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Tyr-64, Phe-66, Pro-77, and Val-87, which is exposed by the displacement of Trp-85 (discussed below). In all CD33-related siglecs the hydrophobic residues that form the pocket are conserved. The displaced tryptophan, however, is only present in Siglec-7; in the majority of CD33-related siglecs this is an arginine (Fig. 1E).Glycan Conformation—With the ability to combine different monosaccharides in various linkages and to create branched structures, the information coding potential of the glycome is enormous (40Feizi T.

https://openalex.org/W2151492695,"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-related protein WAVE2 promotes Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization downstream of Rho-GTPase activation. The Abelson-interacting protein-1 (Abi-1) forms the core of the WAVE2 complex and is necessary for proper stimulation of WAVE2 activity. Here we have shown that the Abl-tyrosine kinase interacts with the WAVE2 complex and that Abl kinase activity facilitates interaction between Abl and WAVE2 complex members. We have characterized various interactions between Abl and members of the WAVE2 complex and revealed that Abi-1 promotes interaction between Abl and WAVE2 members. We have demonstrated that Abl-dependent phosphorylation of WAVE2 is necessary for its activation in vivo, which is highlighted by the findings that RNA interference of WAVE2 expression in Abl/Arg–/– cells has no additive effect on the amount of membrane ruffling. Furthermore, Abl phosphorylates WAVE2 on tyrosine 150, and WAVE2-deficient cells rescued with a Y150F mutant fail to regain their ability to ruffle and form microspikes, unlike cells rescued with wild-type WAVE2. Together, these data show that c-Abl activates WAVE2 via tyrosine phosphorylation to promote actin remodeling in vivo and that Abi-1 forms the crucial link between these two factors."

https://openalex.org/W2014406604,"RuvABC is a complex that promotes branch migration and resolution of Holliday junctions. Although <i>ruv</i> mutants are hypersensitive to UV irradiation, the molecular event(s) that necessitate RuvABC processing <i>in vivo</i> are not known. Here, we used a combination of two-dimensional gel analysis and electron microscopy to reveal that although <i>ruvAB</i> and <i>ruvC</i> mutants are able to resume replication following arrest at UV-induced lesions, molecules that replicate in the presence of DNA damage accumulate unresolved Holliday junctions. The failure to resolve the Holliday junctions on the fully replicated molecules correlates with a delayed loss of genomic integrity that is likely to account for the loss of viability in these cells. The strand exchange intermediates that accumulate in <i>ruv</i> mutants are distinct from those observed at arrested replication forks and are not subject to resolution by RecG. These results indicate that the Holliday junctions observed in <i>ruv</i> mutants are intermediates of a repair pathway that is distinct from that of the recovery of arrested replication forks. A model is proposed in which RuvABC is required to resolve junctions that arise during the repair of a subset of nonarresting lesions after replication has passed through the template."

Here we tested the in vivo role of the mouse Ren-1c enhancer. In renin-expressing As4.1 cells stably transfected with Ren-1c promoter with or without enhancer, expression of linked β-geo reporter, stable expression, and colony formation were dependent on the presence of the enhancer. We then generated mice carrying a targeted deletion of the enhancer (REKO mice) and found marked depletion of renin in renal juxtaglomerular and submandibular ductal cells, as well as hyperplasia of macula densa cells.

Growth of Kir2.1-expressing yeast in media with low K+ concentration is a function of K+ uptake via Kir2.1 channels. Therefore, the host strain was transformed with a human cDNA library, and cDNA clones that rescued growth at low K+ concentration were selected. One of these clones was identical to the protein of unknown function isolated previously as γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-interacting factor 1 (GRIF-1) (Beck, M., Brickley, K., Wilkinson, H., Sharma, S., Smith, M., Chazot, P., Pollard, S., and Stephenson, F. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 30079-30090). GRIF-1 specifically enhanced Kir2.1-dependent growth in yeast and Kir2.1-mediated 86Rb+ efflux in HEK293 cells. Quantitative microscopy and flow cytometry analysis of immunolabeled surface Kir2.1 channel showed that GRIF-1 significantly increased the number of Kir2.1 channels in the plasma membrane of COS and HEK293 cells. Physical interaction of Kir2.1 channel and GRIF-1 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK293 lysates and yeast two-hybrid assay. In vivo association of Kir2.1 and GRIF-1 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation from brain lysate. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that an N-terminal region of GRIF-1 interacts with a C-terminal region of Kir2.1. These results indicate that GRIF-1 binds to Kir2.1 and facilitates trafficking of this channel to the cell surface.

Electrical activity in excitable tissues largely relies on tight control of K+ channel expression. The physiological relevance of changes in K+ channel expression has been demonstrated in a variety of normal and pathological states in heart, brain, and pancreas. It has been found that K+ channel protein synthesis, assembly, trafficking, and turnover all contribute to the steady state density of K+ channels on the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 1Deutsch C. Neuron. 2003; 40: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are just beginning to emerge. Mutation studies identified determinants in K+ channel proteins that affect their cell surface expression. Although some of these determinants arrest K+ channel surface delivery by protein misfolding (2Anderson C. Delisle B. Anson B. Kilby J. Will M. Tester D. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Ackerman M. January C. Circulation. 2006; 113: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), others encode information on K+ channel processing through the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref. 3Griffith L. Curr.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) signals identified in inwardly rectifying K+ channels. It is presumed that these determinants interact with their cognate protein trafficking receptors to facilitate delivery of K+ channels to the cell surface. For example, current candidates for such partners include the vesicle coat protein COPI and 14-3-3, which responds to arginine-based folding/trafficking signals in Kir channels (8Michelsen K. Yuan H. Schwappach B. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Shikano S. Coblitz B. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further understanding of K+ channel trafficking signals critically depends upon identification and analysis of their specific binding partners. The majority of proteins that govern K+ channel surface expression were discovered on the basis of their physical interaction with K+ channels. Examples include GM130 (10Roti E. Myers C. Ayers R.

However, a broader scope of K+ channel partners may be revealed by functional cloning. This approach can be based on the expression of functional mammalian Kir2.1 channels in yeast; the Kir2.1 channel complements the K+ transport defect in mutant yeast lacking the endogenous K+ transporters TRK1 and TRK2 and so allows growth at low K+ concentrations (16Tang W. Ruknudin A. Yang W. Shaw S. Knickerbocker A. Kurtz S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, Kir2.1-dependent growth of the Δtrk1 trk2 yeast strain at selective K+ concentrations can be used for screening for factors that up-regulate Kir2.1-dependent K+ uptake. This approach was used for identification of structural (17Minor D.J. Masseling S. Jan Y. Jan L.

We then show that GRIF-1 is a binding partner of Kir2.1 that facilitates trafficking of this channel to the cell surface in mammalian cells. Yeast Strains—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain SGY1528 with disrupted native K+ transporters TRK1 and TRK2 originates from Ref. 16Tang W. Ruknudin A. Yang W. Shaw S. Knickerbocker A. Kurtz S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and has the following genotype: MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 trk1::HIS3 trk::TRP1. The Kir2.1 channel was transformed into SGY1528 strain using a multicopy vector pYMet-Kir2.1 (17Minor D.J. Masseling S. Jan Y. Jan L. Cell. 1999; 96: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), a derivative of pYES (Invitrogen). Kir2.1 is transcribed under control of methionine-repressible promoter. For library screening we used the SGY1528 derivative named iKir2.1 that expresses chromosomally integrated Kir2.1 fused to Met25 promoter and URA3 selective marker. To construct this strain, pYMet-Kir2.1 plasmid was excised of 2-micron DNA by EcoRV digestion, self-ligated, and transformed into SGY1528. Ura+ transformants were selected, and Kir2.1 integration was verified using the following criteria: 1) growth on the medium with 2 mm KCl, but not on less then 1 mm KCl; 2) methionine repression of Kir2.1-dependent growth; and 3) stability of the growth rescue after cultivation in nonselective conditions (rich YEPD medium, supplemented to 100 mm KCl). The presence of Kir2.1, URA3, and Met25 promoter after nonselective growth was verified by PCR. Yeast Cultivation—K+-free medium contained 2% glucose, 0.16% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, sodium, and ammonia, 8 mm H3PO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% vitamin mix, 0.1% trace elements mix, 0.2% adenine, de-ionized water (adapted from Ref. 16Tang W. Ruknudin A. Yang W. Shaw S. Knickerbocker A. Kurtz S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The media were adjusted to pH 6.5 with arginine base and sterilized by filtering. KCl was added to desired concentration. For preparation of plates with low [K+] agarose instead of agar was used. Yeast medium ingredients were from Qbiogene. Yeast transformation was performed using the alkali cation method (Qbiogene). For growth assay, logarithmic cultures with starting density of OD600 = 0.05 were incubated at 30 °C in a shaker incubator for 48 h. Culture growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at λ = 600 nm. Screening of cDNA Library—Host strain iKir2.1 was transformed with a library of human brain cDNA in pGAD vector (Stratagene). Transformants were selected on medium lacking uracil and leucine supplemented to 100 mm KCl and replica plated on medium without uracil, leucine, and methionine supplemented to 0.5 mm KCl. cDNA clones from growing colonies were extracted and tested for a connection with the Kir2.1 channel. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—C-terminal fragments of Kir2.1 were fused to GAL4 activation domain in pGADT7 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). GRIF-1 fragments were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain on pGBKT7 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). Kir2.1 and GRIF-1-containing plasmids were co-transformed into YRG-2 strain (Stratagene) of the following genotype: MATα ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3 112 gal4-542 gal80-538 LYS2::UASGAL4. Transformants were selected on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Growth of transformants on the plates without histidine was interpreted as interaction of the test proteins. Cell Lines—COS and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 0.02 glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Kir2.1 and GRIF cDNA in pCDNA3 vector were transfected into COS and HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine reagent. HEK293 cell line stably expressing Kir2.1 channel tagged with the HA epitope was a gift of Dr. Min Li. Stable HEK293 transfectants were maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. 86Rb+ Flux Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1-HA channels were plated on polylysine-coated plates and transformed with GRIF-containing and control plasmids. 24-48 h after transfection cells were loaded with 86Rb+ for 4 h by incubation with 1 μCi/ml 86RbCl. Prior to 86Rb+ measurements cells were washed two times with 86Rb+-free medium. Then medium was collected at 1-40 min time points, and the amount of released 86Rb+ was measured by scintillation counting. At 40 min, the cells were lysed with 1% SDS, and residual radioactivity in cells was determined. Quantitative Microscopy—COS cells were co-transfected with Kir2.1 channel tagged with GFP at the N terminus and extracellular HA epitope (GFP-Kir2.1-HA, gift from Dr. Nikolaj Klocker) and GRIF-containing or control plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, live cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS (NGS) and incubated with primary rat anti-HA antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:500 in 10% NGS. Following wash with PBS cells were incubated with the goat anti-rat antibody conjugated with Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs) diluted 1:1000 in 2% NGS. Incubations with antibodies were performed at room temperature for 30 min; PBS washings were performed three times for 5 min each. The cells were visualized at 40× magnification with inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The cells were illuminated with 488- and 543-nm light. GFP and Texas Red signals, corrected to background, were quantified in captured images of individual cells using SimplePCI software. Flow Cytometry—HEK 293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 channel tagged with extracellular HA epitope were transiently transfected with GRIF-containing or control plasmids. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and harvested by incubation with 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS for 5-10 min at room temperature. Following wash with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, and 2% fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody 3F10 diluted 1:500 on ice for 1 h. The cells then were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with Cy2-labeled goat anti-rat antibody diluted 1:1000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 15 min on ice. Finally, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fluorescence was measured by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The percentage of fluorescent cells was analyzed using CELLQUEST software (Becton Dickinson). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—HEK293 cells were plated in 100-mm culture dish at the density of 3×106/dish and the next day co-transfected with Kir2.1 and FLAG-tagged GRIF constructs. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 500 μl/dish radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.2) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with 30 μl anti-FLAG resin (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were aspirated, and the pellets were gently rinsed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted with 50 μl of 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in lysis buffer, mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Following electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-Kir2.1 antibody (Alomone) diluted 1:1000. After double washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Western blots were developed using high sensitivity Pierce ECL kit. Complexes of GRIF-FLAG with the Kir2.1 C terminus tagged with Myc were precipitated using anti-FLAG resin as above and probed with anti-Myc antibody (Abcam) diluted 1:3000 for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells transfected with GRIF497-X-press and Kir2.1 C terminus tagged with Myc were lysed as above. Clarified lysates were incubated with 2 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-X-press antibody (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C, and immunocomplexes were captured using 50 μl/sample protein A/G Plus-agarose reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, mixed with Laemmli buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 95 °C for elution. The eluates were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Abcam) diluted 1:3000. For immunoprecipitation of native Kir2.1 and GRIF proteins, the brain was harvested from two adult mice and immediately homogenized in 5 ml of Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (15Leonoudakis D.

Homogenate was lysed in buffer D supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C and clarified with centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of affinity-purified anti-Kir2.1/2.2 antibodies or control preimmune rabbit IgG (kindly provided by Dr. Carol Vandenberg) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes captured on 30 μl of protein A-agarose were collected by sedimentation and dried by aspiration. The pellets were gently washed three times in buffer D using centrifugation at 800 × g at room temperature and subjected to immunoblotting. Anti-GRIF-1 antibody (a gift from Prof. Anne Stephenson) was used as in Ref. 21Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P. Pollard S. Stephenson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. Immunofluorescent Cell Staining—COS cells were plated on glass cover-slips and transfected with epitope-tagged GRIF-1-FLAG and Kir2.1-HA constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized by incubation in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and blocked with 20% NGS in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:400 and mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (Roche Applied Science) in 20% NGS overnight at 4 °C. Following wash with PBS cells were incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody (Upstate) diluted 1:500 in 5% NGS, washed with PBS, incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Cy3 diluted 1:500 (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs) in 5% NGS, and washed with PBS. Incubations with secondary antibodies were performed for 30 min at room temperature. PBS washes were performed three times for 5 min each at room temperature. The specimens were mounted in mounting medium (Invitrogen) and observed with fluorescent inverted microscope Olympus under 40× magnification in 488- and 543-nm light. No cross-reactivity was detected between 12CA5 antibody and anti-rabbit FITC conjugate or rabbit anti-FLAG antibody and anti-mouse Cy3 conjugate. Isolation of GRIF-1 as an Enhancer of Kir2.1-dependent Yeast Growth—Growth of a yeast Δtrk1 trk2 double mutant at low K+ concentration is rescued by expression of mammalian Kir2.1 channels (Fig. 1A). Kir2.1 expressed from a single chromosomally integrated copy restores growth at 2 mm KCl but not at 0.5 mm KCl (Fig. 1A, sector 3). In contrast, transformation with a 2 micron-based multicopy Kir2.1 plasmid enables growth at 0.5 mm KCl (Fig. 1A, sector 2). Using this dosage effect, we sought to identify mammalian cDNAs that enable single copy Kir2.1-dependent growth at 0.5 mm KCl and thus are likely to encode positive regulators of Kir2.1. The single copy Kir2.1 strain, iKir2.1, was transformed with a human cDNA yeast expression library, and transformants able to grow at 0.5 mm KCl were selected. To confirm cDNA dependence of the growth phenotype, library plasmids were rescued from yeast transformants in Escherichia coli, and their ability to confer yeast growth at 0.5 mm KCl was tested upon retransformation into the iKir2.1 strain. One of the confirmed cDNAs, KP39, promoted growth at 0.5 mm KCl (Fig. 1, A, compare sector 4 with sector 3; and B, left panel). However, KP39 did not increase growth at 0.5 mm KCl of the Δtrk1 trk2 strain in the absence of Kir2.1 (Fig. 1A, sector 5). Likewise, it did not improve growth at a high, nonselective K+ concentration (Fig. 1B), a condition in which Kir2.1 is not necessary for growth. Therefore, the KP39-encoded protein does not generally increase growth. Rather, the facilitation of growth by KP39 is coupled to Kir2.1 channel function. Sequencing of KP39 identified a 1491-bp cDNA fragment exactly corresponding to the 5′ half of the open reading frame of a known gene ALS2CR3. The ALS2CR3 gene maps to the 2q33-2q34 human chromosome locus associated with human juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (22Hadano S. Yanagisawa Y. Skaug J. Fichter K. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B. Scherer S. Nicholson D. Rouleau G. Ikeda J. Hayden M. Genomics. 2001; 71: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A causal relationship between ALS2CR3 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has not been established, and the function of this gene in humans remains unknown (22Hadano S. Yanagisawa Y. Skaug J. Fichter K. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B. Scherer S. Nicholson D. Rouleau G. Ikeda J. Hayden M. Genomics. 2001; 71: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A rat ortholog of ALS2CR3 protein has been identified in yeast two-hybrid system as GABA-receptor interacting factor-1 (GRIF-1, also named TRAK2) (21Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P. Pollard S. Stephenson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). KP39 contains the first 497 codons of the ALS2CR3 open reading frame, and its deduced amino acid sequence is 86.6% identical with the N-terminal half of rat GRIF-1. Thus, we now refer to KP39 as hGRIF497. Functionally, the full-length rat GRIF-1 cDNA was indistinguishable from hGRIF497 in its ability to enhance Kir2.1-dependent yeast growth (Fig. 1, A, sector 6, and C). GRIF-1 Increases Kir2.1-mediated 86Rb+ Efflux in Mammalian Cells—To examine effects of GRIF-1 expression on Kir2.1 function in mammalian cells, we used the 86Rb+ flux assay. Because hydrated Rb+ ion is similar in permeability to K+, 86Rb+ flux can be used as an indicator of K+ channel activity. HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 were transiently transfected with GRIF-1 constructs or corresponding empty vectors. The cells were then loaded with 86Rb+ and washed, and the time course of 86Rb+ release was determined. In these assays, channel activity is revealed in the initial rate of release. As seen in Fig. 2A, initial efflux of 86Rb+ from cells transfected with full size GRIF-1 or hGRIF497 fragment occurs faster than from vector-transfected cells. Measuring 86Rb+ efflux from multiple independent transfections proved the statistical significance of this difference (Fig. 2B). Overall, GRIF-1 expression in 40% of the cells increased total Kir2.1-mediated 86Rb+ flux by 12% ± 1.7%. Thus, channel activity was increased by ∼30% by GRIF-1. In contrast, transfection of GRIF-1 constructs into HEK293 cells that do not express Kir2.1 had no effect on the background 86Rb+ efflux, which was ∼10% of that in Kir2.1-transfected cells (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that GRIF expression increases Kir2.1 channel activity. GRIF-1 Increases Surface Expression of Kir2.1—To address the mechanism of GRIF-enhanced K+ flux, we examined surface expression of Kir2.1 with or without ectopic expression of GRIF constructs. HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 channel with HA epitope at the first extracellular loop were transiently transfected with full size GRIF-1, hGRIF497 or empty vectors, immunostained for surface HA epitope, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 3A shows that GRIF-1 and hGRIF497 each increase mean surface channel immunofluorescence. With both GRIF constructs, surface density of Kir2.1 channels was elevated by ∼30% (Fig. 3B), which agrees with the increase of 86Rb+ efflux in this cell line. Additionally, we examined the GRIF effect on Kir2.1 surface expression using quantitative microscopy. COS cells were transiently co-transfected with GRIF-1 or corresponding empty vector, as well as with Kir2.1 tagged with extracellular HA epitope and GFP at the N terminus. Live transfected cells were immunolabeled with anti-HA antibody and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody to mark surface channels. Red and green fluorescence corresponding to surface and total Kir2.1 signals, respectively, in individual cells were measured using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The Texas Red signal was then normalized by the GFP signal to yield a measure of Kir2.1 surface expression. As shown in Fig. 3C, cells transfected with GRIF-1 had a significantly stronger surface Kir2.1 signal. Notably, total cellular Kir2.1 channel protein expression, measured by GFP-Kir2.1 fluorescence (Fig. 3D) and Western blot (Fig. 4A), was not affected by GRIF. Thus, full-length GRIF-1 and the N-terminal half of GRIF-1 each increase surface localization of Kir2.1 in two different cell lines without affecting total Kir2.1 protein expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GRIF-1 increases K+ transport through Kir2.1 by increasing surface expression of this channel.FIGURE 4GRIF-1 is physically associated with the Kir2.1 channel. A, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of GRIF-1-FLAG and Kir2.1 from HEK293 lysates. Lysates were precipitated on anti-FLAG resin and probed with anti-Kir2.1 antibody. B, co-immunoprecipitation of GRIF-1 with C terminus of Kir2.1. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Kir2.1 (180-428)-Myc and GRIF-1-FLAG. The lysates were precipitated on anti-FLAG resin and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-Myc antibody. C, co-immunoprecipitation of GRIF-1 N-terminal fragment with C terminus of Kir2.1. Kir2.1 (180-428)-Myc was co-transfected with GRIF (1-497)-X-press. The lysates were precipitated using anti-X-press antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. D, yeast two-hybrid analysis of Kir2.1-GRIF interaction. Yeast strain YRG-2 was co-transformed with C terminus of Kir2.1 fused to GAL4 AD and GRIF-1 and hGRIF497 fused to GAL4 BD. Control fusions SV40-AD and p53-BD interact in yeast two-hybrid assay. Growth of transformants on media without histidine indicates protein-protein interaction. E, co-immunoprecipitation of native brain Kir2 channels and GRIF-1.

To test this possibility, we examined GRIF-1/Kir2.1 association with co-precipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. For the co-precipitation assay, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pair-wise combinations of epitope-tagged Kir2.1 and GRIF-1 constructs. GRIF proteins were affinity-purified or immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the presence of Kir2.1 protein was examined by Western blotting. Fig. 4A shows that full-length Kir2.1 co-precipitated with full-length GRIF-1. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Kir2.1 (amino acids 180-428) was sufficient for this association (Fig. 4B). This domain also co-immunoprecipitated with the N-terminal half of GRIF-1 (Fig. 4C). Thus, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that GRIF-1 associates with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Kir2.1 and that the N-terminal half of GRIF-1 is sufficient for this association. To confirm data obtained using immunoprecipitation, we used the y"
https://openalex.org/W2088885434,"The heterodimeric actin-capping protein (CP) regulates actin assembly and cell motility by binding tightly to the barbed end of the actin filament. Here we demonstrate that myotrophin/V-1 binds directly to CP in a 1:1 molar ratio with a Kd of 10-50 nm. V-1 binding inhibited the ability of CP to cap the barbed ends of actin filaments. The actin-binding COOH-terminal region, the “tentacle,” of the CP β subunit was important for binding V-1, with lesser contributions from the α subunit COOH-terminal region and the body of the protein. V-1 appears to be unable to bind to CP that is on the barbed end, based on the observations that V-1 had no activity in an uncapping assay and that the V-1·CP complex had no capping activity. Two loops of V-1, which extend out from the α-helical backbone of this ankyrin repeat protein, were necessary for V-1 to bind CP. Parallel computational studies determined a bound conformation of the β tentacle with V-1 that is consistent with these findings, and they offered insight into experimentally observed differences between the α1 and α2 isoforms as well as the mutant lacking the α tentacle. These results support and extend our “wobble” model for CP binding to the actin filament, in which the two COOH-terminal regions of CP bind independently to the actin filament, and bound CP is able to wobble when attached only via its mobile β-subunit tentacle. This model is also supported by molecular dynamics simulations of CP reported here. The existence of the wobble state may be important for actin dynamics in cells.

Myotrophin is a 12-kDa protein identified in hypertrophied rat hearts (1Sen S. Kundu G. Mekhail N. Castel J. Misono K. Healy B. J. Biol.

Myotrophin was named for its ability to stimulate hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes when added to cells in culture (1Sen S. Kundu G. Mekhail N. Castel J. Misono K. Healy B. J. Biol.

Myotrophin was found to be identical to the protein V-1 (4Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Luoh S.M. Wood W.I.

V-1 expression correlates with morphogenetic changes of cerebellar differentiation. V-1 is expressed in many vertebrate cells and tissues (6Anderson K.M. Berrebi-Bertrand I. Kirkpatrick R.B.

We will refer to the myotrophin/V-1 protein as V-1 for simplicity.Structurally, V-1 is a small ankyrin repeat protein. A solution structure of V-1 shows two full ankyrin repeat motifs in tandem, with additional incomplete repeats at the amino and carboxyl termini (11Yang Y. Nanduri S. Sen S. Qin J. Structure. 1998; 5: 619-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Yang Y. Rao N.S. Walker E. Sen S. Qin J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An ankyrin repeat consists of a β hairpin loop followed by a pair of anti-parallel α helices connected by a short turn sequence (13Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 6: 1435-1448Crossref Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Tandem repeats stack on each other, based on hydrophobic interactions between the helices. The loops protrude from this structural backbone, and their more variable sequences impart specificity to interactions with other proteins.V-1 was found to bind and inhibit actin-capping protein, known as CapZ (14Taoka M.

Capping protein binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments with high affinity (Kd < 1nm), which prevents the addition and loss of actin monomers at the end (15Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Trends Biochem.

CP is a key component of the dendritic nucleation model (16Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 4: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3230) Google Scholar), and CP is necessary for reconstitution of actin-based motility from pure proteins in vitro (17Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 6753: 613-616Crossref Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In yeast, Drosophila, Dictyostelium, and mouse cells, loss of CP results in abnormalities of actin assembly, morphogenesis, and motility (15Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 8: 418-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar).CP is an α/β heterodimer (molecular mass of α ∼36 kDa, β ∼32 kDa). Vertebrates have two major isoforms of each subunit. In striated muscle cells, the β1 isoform is found at the Z-line, the β2 isoform is found elsewhere, and the two β isoforms cannot functionally substitute for one another (18Hart M.C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 6: 1287-1298Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Non-muscle cells generally express only the β2 isoform (19Schafer D.A. Korshunova Y.O. Schroer T.A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 2: 453-465Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal regions of the α and β subunits are on the surface of the protein (20Yamashita A. Maéda K. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2003; 7: 1529-1538Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and both contribute to high affinity capping of the barbed end of actin (21Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maéda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In previous work, CP was pulled down by TAP-tagged V-1 expressed in cultured 293T cells (14Taoka M.

The α subunit was the α1 isoform, and the β isoform was not determined. In those studies, purified V-1 was found to bind and inhibit recombinant CP α1β1 (14Taoka M. Ichimura T. Wakamiya-Tsuruta A.

In this study, we investigate the interaction of V-1 with CP, including a structure-function analysis with mutational and computational approaches. The results have relevance to our understanding of how CP binds to the barbed end of the filament.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, General Procedures, Peptides, and Proteins—Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen, Roche Applied Science, or New England Biolabs.

The concentration of GST-V-1 was determined by absorbance at 280 with a calculated extinction coefficient of 50,570 m-1 cm-1. GST-V-1 on glutathione-agarose beads was cleaved with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The V-1 protein was tested for purity by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was calculated by absorbance at 280 nm with a calculated extinction coefficient of 9520 m-1 cm-1. Purified GST-V-1 and thrombincleaved V-1 inhibited CP in a similar manner in functional assays. Cleaved V-1 was used in all of the functional and physical assays described here, except the uncapping assays, which were done with GST-V-1 protein. V-1 mutant proteins were purified similarly, and their folding was tested by circular dichroism spectroscopy as described (25Mosavi L.K. Minor D.L.J. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A mouse CP α2β2 expression plasmid, pBJ 1603, was constructed using a similar strategy (26Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J.

Primers included restriction enzyme sites for NdeI/HindIII and NdeI/PvuI. The PCR-amplified α2 sequence was inserted between the NdeI and the HindIII sites of the vector, and β2 was inserted between the NdeI and PvuI sites. Each subunit had a separate ribosomal binding site to maximize translational efficiency. PCR-induced single base errors were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. Purified CP was stored at -20 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol.

The Kd value for CP binding to the barbed end was determined first, from a CP titration experiment. Next, with a constant CP concentration, a V-1 titration was performed. Those results were used to determine the Kd for V-1 binding to CP. Least-squares fitting by nonlinear regression was performed using Prism 4.0 (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA). In this analysis, the number concentration of actin filament barbed ends is assumed to be much less than the concentration of CP, so that free [CP] is set equal to total [CP].Tryptophan Fluorescence of CP Binding to V-1—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra for WT and mutant CP proteins were collected as described (32Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 14: 14382-14390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A continuous variation assay was done to determine the stoichiometry of CP α1β2 binding to V-1. The ratios of the two proteins were varied while maintaining the total protein concentration at 10 μm, which was well above the experimentally determined Kd of ∼40 nm.Molecular Simulations—The starting point for our computational work was the crystal structure of CP (Protein Data Bank code 1IZN) and the NMR structure of V-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1MYO). We first selected the COOH-terminal portion of the β1 subunit of CP, which corresponds to the peptide used in the experiments, and simulated the molecular dynamics of the peptide structure using Gromacs 3.2 (33Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (10817) Google Scholar). Following minimization and heating to 300 K, we performed 10 ns of NVT simulations with the OPLS/AA force field, SPC waters, Particle Mesh Ewald, Berendsen temperature coupling (NVT ensemble), and 2-fs time steps. Structures were written out every 10 ps, resulting in an ensemble of 1000 structures. Each of these peptide structures was then used in docking studies using AutoDock 3.0 (34Rosenfeld R.J.

Docking grid maps were created for 17 NMR V-1 structures in the Protein Data Bank file, and all 1000 tentacle structures were docked to each map, resulting in a total of 17,000 trajectories. The docking results were ranked by energy and clustered based on a root mean square deviation of 4 Å. The cluster analysis resulted in a single top-ranked structure, which was used in all subsequent analysis. In order to determine the interaction of V-1 with full-length CP α1β1, we used the β1 tentacle as a reference point and fit this top structure onto a CP α1β1 structure taken from a molecular dynamics simulation. The CP molecular dynamics simulation was performed using NAMD (35Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comput. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). Here we used the CHARMM27 force field, TIP3P waters, Particle Mesh Ewald, Berendsen temperature and pressure coupling (NPT ensemble), and 2-fs time steps. The heating was again performed in 50 K steps with α carbon constraints, equilibrated at 300K without constraints, followed by a 20-ns production trajectory. The simulation of the α tentacle-deleted protein (missing the 28 COOH-terminal residues of the α subunit, CPαΔC28) was carried out using exactly the same protocol.RESULTSMolecular Dynamics Simulation of CP—We used molecular dynamics to investigate the range of structures that CP might occupy in solution. Beginning with the x-ray crystal structure, we performed a 20-ns molecular dynamics simulation (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). For the full-length wild type protein, the position of the COOH-terminal α-helical region of the β subunit fluctuated to the highest degree, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The COOH-terminal α-helical region of the α subunit moved much less, remaining in position on the surface of the protein, primarily through the interactions of Trp279. The loop proximal to the helix and the COOH-terminal extension distal to the helix did show some movement, but the α-helix itself moved minimally. These results are further illustrated with plots of root mean square fluctuations in Fig. 2, C and D.FIGURE 1Molecular dynamics analysis of CP.

These mutants have been used in the past and are used here, below, to analyze how CP binds to the barbed end of the actin filament. Upon removal of the α subunit COOH-terminal region, fluctuations were significantly decreased in a region of the α subunit on the other side of the protein, near the COOH-terminal region of the β subunit, whereas the β subunit showed little change apart from the helix that contacts the α subunit COOH terminus. These results are illustrated in Fig. 2. This analysis is important for several reasons. The region of the α subunit exhibiting the change in dynamics is where most of the differences between the α1 and α2 isoforms are located, and this region is part of the contact site for V-1 predicted by our docking analysis. This correspondence is in line with experimental observations, described below, that the α1 and α2 isoforms have slightly different affinities and that the truncation of the α COOH terminus has a minor effect on the affinity for V-1. The mobility of the β subunit COOH terminus in the molecular dynamics simulation strongly suggested that its movements were independent of the rest of the protein. These points are addressed further under “Discussion.”V-1 Inhibits the Actin-capping Activity of CP—To investigate whether V-1 influences the capping activity of CP α1β2, which includes the major β isoform expressed in nearly all vertebrate cells and tissues, we performed seeded actin polymerization assays. CP α1β2 inhibited barbed end polymerization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The equilibrium dissociation constant for CP binding to barbed ends (Kcap) was 0.1 nm, consistent with previous results (21Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maéda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The addition of increasing concentrations of V-1 inhibited the capping activity of 2-4 nm CP, with complete inhibition at 500 nm V-1 (Fig. 3B). V-1 alone, without CP, had no effect. Kinetic modeling with a simple model of V-1 binding CP and completely inhibiting the ability of CP to cap the barbed end gave good fits (Fig. 3B, red lines), with a Kd of 40 ± 9 nm for the V-1·CP interaction (Table 1).FIGURE 3Inhibition of CP by V-1 in actin polymerization seeded growth assays.

Assays with CP α1β1 gave similar results, with a Kd of 45 ± 3nm (Fig. 3, C and D, Table 1). The α1 and α2 isoforms of CP are widely expressed, in a ratio that varies among cell and tissue types (27Hart M.C. Korshunova Y.O. Cooper J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 2: 120-132Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CP α2β2 capped actin with a Kcap of 0.2 nm (Fig. 3E). V-1 inhibited the capping activity of CP α2β2, and kinetic modeling gave a Kd of 153 ± 20 nm (Fig. 3F, Table 1).In addition to actin polymerization growth assays, we tested the binding affinity of V-1 for CP α1β2 with a steady-state polymerization assay. Increasing concentrations of CP caused the steady-state level of F-actin to decrease and plateau, characteristic of barbed end capping, which increases the critical monomer concentration to that of the pointed end (Fig. 4A). Increasing concentrations of V-1 reversed the effect of CP (Fig. 4B). The Kd for V-1 binding to CP was 10-30 nm in three experiments, based on fitting to the same simple reaction mechanism used for the kinetics assays.FIGURE 4V-1 inhibition of CP in a steady-state assay. Pyrene-actin fluorescence, which is proportional to the concentration of filamentous actin, is plotted. A, increasing concentrations of CP α1β2, in the absence of V-1, causes the F-actin level to fall, because the critical concentration rises to that of the pointed end.

The dramatic increase in the number of multidrug-resistant microorganisms has provided greater urgency to the search for new antibiotics against novel drug targets. Essential gene products involved in bacterial metabolism represent attractive targets for such compounds; however, exploitation of these targets in drug development has not been achieved. Among the potential metabolic targets, several genes have been identified in the aspartate biosynthetic pathway that are essential for the survival of Salmonella during infection (1Becker D. Selbach M. Rollenhagen C. Ballmaier M. Meyer T.F. Mann M. Bumann D. Nature. 2006; 440: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The aspartate pathway present in plants, bacteria, and fungi leads to the formation of the following four essential amino acids: threonine, lysine, methionine, and isoleucine (2Viola R.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Cohen G.N. Dautry-Varsat A. Biss-wanger H. Schmincke-Ott E Multifunctional Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1980: 49-121Google Scholar). This pathway also produces several important non-protein metabolites that includes dihydrodipicolinate, a precursor of dipicolinate that is the major component of bacterial spores (4Paidhungat M. Setlow B. Driks A. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5505-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and diaminopimelate, needed for cross-linking of the peptidoglycan polymers during bacterial cell wall synthesis (5Pavelka M.S. Jacobs W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6496-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). An additional product of this pathway, S-adenosylmethionine, is an essential methyl group donor that can serve, after decarboxylation, as a propylamine donor in the synthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine. S-Adenosylmethionine is also a precursor for two groups of quorum-sensing signaling molecules that have a critical role in the triggering of virulence factors in infectious organisms. Thus, proper functioning and regulation of this pathway is critical for the survival of all microorganisms. Because this pathway is completely absent in mammals, inhibitors that are designed to selectively block key enzymes in this pathway should show minimal reactivity with other human proteins.Among the genes that belong to this pathway, the asd gene that encodes for aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH) 2The abbreviations used are: ASADH, aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; MR, molecular replacement; DTT, dithiothreitol; ASA, l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 2The abbreviations used are: ASADH, aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; MR, molecular replacement; DTT, dithiothreitol; ASA, l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. has been identified as essential in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria such as Salmonella enterica (1Becker D.

ASADH catalyzes the production of aspartate-β-semialdehyde, the first branch point intermediate in the aspartate pathway, and the structure of the enzyme has been determined from several infectious Gram-negative bacteria (10Hadfield A.T.

The enzymes from these organisms show high sequence and structural homology, whereas a recently determined archaeal ASADH structure (13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) contains significant differences in its overall structure and in its coenzyme binding specificity. Insights into the mechanism of ASADH were obtained through the structural characterization of a tetrahedral intermediate in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme from Hemophilus influenzae (14Blanco J. Moore R.A. Viola R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12613-12617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, the structure of the putative acyl-enzyme derived from this intermediate has remained elusive.We have now determined the first structure of an ASADH from a Gram-positive bacterial species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (spASADH). The role of coenzyme binding in domain closure was determined by an examination of the apoenzyme and several coenzyme complex structures from this organism. In addition, soaking the substrate ASA into crystals of the NADP complex has led to the trapping and first structural characterization of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme Expression and Purification—The asd gene encoding ASADH was amplified from a S. pneumoniae genomic DNA template purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Nucleotide primers were designed to incorporate an NcoI restriction site that includes the ATG start codon and an XhoI site. Ligation of the PCR fragment into a pET 28a vector results in fusion of the asd gene to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This construct was verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing (MWG Biotec), and the enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Standard growth conditions (37 °C) were employed until an A600 of 0.7 was reached, at which point the temperature was reduced to 33 °C, and induction of ASADH expression was accomplished through the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell growth was continued for 5 h to allow maximum enzyme expression, and cells were then harvested by centrifugation. The soluble cell extract containing spASADH was passed through a TALON® Co2+ affinity matrix (BD Bio-sciences) for specific binding to the engineered hexahistidine tag on the C terminus of spASADH. Eluted spASADH was then dialyzed into a low ionic strength buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for further purification by anion exchange chromatography. Dialysis of the purified enzyme into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA was done prior to storage at -80 °C.Kinetic Characterization—Initial velocity kinetics of spASADH was determined at room temperature with a SPECTRAmax® 340PC384 Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). To measure the activity of spASADH, the reverse reaction was followed, with the increase in the absorbance of NADPH monitored at 340 nm. The reaction mixture consisted of 200 mm CHES, pH 9.0, and varying concentrations of sodium phosphate, NADP, and l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde (ASA) to a volume of 50 μl in a flat bottom 96-well plate. The enzyme was added to each well to a final volume of 150 μl to initiate the reaction. The Michaelis constants (Km) for each substrate were determined by holding two of the three substrates at fixed concentrations, while the other was varied by serial dilutions, ranging from 0.47 to 30 mm for phosphate, 0.03 to 2.0 mm for ASA, and 0.02 to 1.0 mm for NADP. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation with BASIC versions of the kinetics programs described by Cleland (15Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northhampton, MA). Titration of NADP, 2′,5′-ADP, and NAD in spASADH were carried out in 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm ammonium acetate, and 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 25 °C. Enzyme concentrations were in the range of 50-100 μm, with the concentration of NADP in the syringe between 1 and 2 mm. Each titration was performed in triplicate by the successive addition of 5-μl aliquots to a final coenzyme concentration of 100 μm. Data analysis was performed using Origin 7.0 as distributed from Microcal. Integrated titration curves were each fit to a one-site binding model and corrected for background heats of injection by subtracting reference data obtained by titrating the ligand into buffer.Crystallization and Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were identified by sparse matrix screening of spASADH at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Both index screens (Hampton Research) and JBScreen Basic (Jena Bioscience) yielded initial crystals for the apoenzyme. The optimized conditions for the apoenzyme crystals consisted of 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 50 mm magnesium or calcium acetate, and 12-13% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals grew rapidly within a few hours, but these crystals did not diffract x-rays beyond 5 Å. The enzyme was then exchanged into 50 mm citrate, pH 6, 100 mm ammonium acetate, and 2 mm DTT and crystallized under the same conditions with an additional 10 mm DTT. Treatment of the enzyme in this fashion gave less nucleation and slowed crystal growth to 2-3 days, resulting in a more ordered crystal lattice and higher diffracting crystals. Prior to flash freezing in liquid N2, the crystals were transferred in three incremental steps into the well solution plus 20% glycerol. An spASADH-NADP complex crystal was obtained by cocrystallizing the enzyme with 2 mm NADP. Single crystals of this complex did not grow under the apo crystallization conditions; instead a new crystal form was identified by grid screening. The NADP complex crystals were grown in 50 mm citrate, pH 6.0, 200 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm DTT, and 19-20% polyethylene glycol 8000. The spASADH-NADP-ASA complex crystals were obtained by soaking the NADP complex crystals with ASA for 45 min. Each of the NADP complex crystals was cryoprotected in the mother liquor with an additional 20% glycerol. Crystals of the 2′,5′-ADP complex were obtained by cocrystallization with 10 mm 2′,5′-ADP under similar conditions as the spASADH-NADP complex. Cryo-protection of the spASADH-2′,5′-ADP complex crystals was achieved by introducing 20% ethylene glycol into the mother liquor in three incremental steps. All of the diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku High-brilliance FR-E rotating anode x-ray generator with an Raxis IV image plate detector. D*trek was used for integration and scaling of all diffraction data using a σ cutoff of 2.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination, Refinement, and Analysis—The structure of apo spASADH was solved by MR using the program Phaser using data between 30 and 2.5 Å resolution with a final Z-score of 24.32. Initial attempts to find a replacement solution did not succeed with any of the ASADH structures that we had determined previously. Instead, homology models of several ASADHs (Protein Data Bank codes 1GL3, 1NWH, 1MB4, and 1YS4) were superimposed, and the nonhomologous regions were trimmed to generate an ensemble of ASADH search models containing only the conserved regions. This ensemble was then used to find the correct orientation of spASADH, because the use of any individual ASADH model had failed to yield a solution. The model of mjASADH (Protein Data Bank code 1YS4) with the highest sequence identity to spASADH was subjected to rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing refinement in CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) to obtain the initial electron density map. The structure of spASADH was built by a combination of manual building within Xfit (17McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) and automatic building with arp/Warp (18Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) to obtain the initial spAS-ADH model, followed by iterative rounds of simulated annealing refinement in CNS. The final model of apo spASADH was refined using TLS (19Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The coenyzme complex (spASADH-NADP) and the ternary complex with the coenzyme and substrate (spASADH-NADP-ASA) were subsequently solved by MR using the apo spASADH model as a template. The 2′,5′-ADP complex was isomorphous with the NADP complex structure and was solved by rigid body and restrained refinement in Refmac5. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure alignment and analysis and the structure figures were generated in Pymol. Analysis of domain movement between the apo spASADH and spASADH-NADP complexes was carried out with the Dyn-Dom web server using the default parameters. Surface area calculations were performed using Surface Racer 4.0 (21Tsodikov O.V. Record M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) with a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure of S. pneumoniae ASADH—The structure of apo spASADH was solved by MR using a combined ensemble of ASADH search models, each with less than 30% sequence identity to spASADH. An accurate structural alignment of the ASADH search templates and truncation of nonconserved regions was critical for the success of the MR protocol because none of the individual structures lead to a suitable solution. spASADH is assembled into a functional homodimer with a similar overall fold to the previously studied ASADHs (Fig. 1). Each monomer (358 residues) contains 13 β-strands and 8 α-helices that fold into two domains, an N-terminal Rossmann fold (residues 1-127, 330-358) and a C-terminal dimerization domain (residues 128-329). The N-terminal domain consists of five parallel β-strands enclosed by three α-helices. Two additional β-strands decorate the top of the Rossmann fold and are directly involved in coenzyme binding. The C-terminal domain is constructed primarily of six mixed β-strands that create the conserved dimer interface. A helical segment bridging the top of the β-sheet interface contributes additional interactions to further stabilize the ASADH dimer. The active site is centered at the N terminus of an α-helix positioned at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1B).Sequence and Structural Comparison among the ASADH Family—The ASADH family is diverse and can be divided into three branches consisting of the enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and Archaea/fungi. These branches were initially identified and partitioned through sequence alignments, and with representative high resolution structures now available from each branch (10Hadfield A.T. Kryger G. Ouyang J. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Blanco J. Moore R.A. Kalabeeswaran V. Viola R.E. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Blanco J. Moore R.A. Viola R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12613-12617Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), they have now been compared by structural alignments. spASADH is the first member of the Gram-positive bacterial ASADH branch that has been structurally characterized. spASADH is a good representative of the other Gram-positive bacterial ASADHs with greater than 40% sequence identity to these enzymes, although having less than 25% identity with any of the Gram-negative enzymes. Unexpectedly, this spASADH has slightly lower sequence homology to the Gram-negative enzymes than to the archaeal/fungal branch, with sequence identities from this comparison ranging from 18 to 30%. Alignment of the structures that have been determined from each branch of the ASADH family also shows that spASADH is most similar to the archaeal ASADH from Methanococcus jannaschii (mjASADH). The backbone r.m.s.d. between spASADH and mjASADH is only ∼0.7 Å, compared with >1.2-Å deviations from the three Gram-negative bacterial ASADHs that have been structurally characterized (Table 2).TABLE 2Summary of ASADH structure comparisonEnzyme formSequence identity to spASADHBuried dimer surfacer.m.s.d. to spASADH dimerr.m.s.d. to spASADH monomer%Å2% totalÅÅspASADH267317ecASADH243834231.331.04hiASADH223478211.311.23vcASADH243620221.241.24mjASADH271943130.760.72 Open table in a new tab In addition to overall sequence and structural comparisons, there are several conserved insertions and deletions that further differentiate the three ASADH branches. We have shown previously that mjASADH has three conserved insertions totaling 30 residues when aligned with the Gram-negative bacterial ecASADH (13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with each insertion located on the surface of the structure. In addition, a 48-amino acid deletion in mjASADH results in the complete removal of the helical subdomain (Fig. 1C), which makes a significant contribution to the dimer interface in ecASADH. Gram-negative bacterial ASADHs have the largest dimer interface, formed by a conserved hydrophobic β-sheet and complemented by this helical subdomain (Fig. 1A) creating over 3400 Å2 of buried surface area. The thermophilic mjASADH structure that is missing this helical subdomain has a much smaller dimer interface of less than 2000 Å2 (Table 2). This subdomain is present in spASADH, but a 16-residue deletion results in a single α-helix followed by an unstructured loop forming the top portion of the dimer interface (Fig. 1B) with about 2600 Å2 of buried surface area.Structural variations between these branches also occur along a stretch of residues on the surface that contains the binding pocket for NADP. ecASADH is representative of the Gram-negative ASADHs, with a highly flexible coenzyme binding loop in the absence of NADP that becomes ordered only in response to NADP binding (11Hadfield A.T. Shammas C. Kryger G. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Ouyang J. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14475-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, for the archaeal branch a 13-residue insertion in mjASADH leads to a reorientation of this loop by about 90°C causing it to drape over the coenzyme binding pocket (13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). spASADH has the same number of residues in this region as the Gram-negative bacterial enzymes, but two short β-strands (Fig. 1B) replace the loop observed in ecASADH. The structural differences in the coenzyme binding loop have been proposed to account for the observed differences in the bound coenzyme conformation between the Gram-negative and archaeal branches of the ASADH family (13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because the coenzyme binding region in spASADH is different from those in the other branches, it was unclear which coenzyme binding conformation will be adopted in Gram-positive ASADHs or if there is a bound coenzyme conformation that is unique to this branch.Catalytic Activity Differences between the ASADH Branches—The Gram-negative bacterial ASADHs are significantly more catalytically efficient than the Gram-positive or archaeal homologues. The catalytic turnover rates for the Gram-negative enzymes range from 600 s-1 for ASADH from E. coli to about 120 s-1 for the Vibrio cholerae enzyme (22Moore R.A. Bocik W.E. Viola R.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, the thermophilic mjASADH has a turnover of only 4 s-1, even when measured at 70 °C (13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This newly examined Gram-positive spASADH is also found to be much less efficient than the Gram-negative enzymes, with a turnover of only 2 s-1. These large differences in activity between the ASADH branches are quite unexpected because all of the essential functional amino acids in the active site are fully conserved throughout the ASADH family. However, the low overall sequence homology throughout the family and the presence of insertions and deletions in critical regions within the structure may help to explain the differences in catalytic efficiency. Although the binding sites for the amino acid substrate are essentially unchanged among the ASADHs, the residues that form critical interactions with NADP in the Gram-negative bacterial ASADHs are not conserved in the Gram-positive bacterial and archaeal ASADHs. In addition, several secondary structural elements that are missing or truncated in these newly examined ASADHs eliminate many of the interactions between the enzyme and NADP that were shown previously to be important for binding recognition in Gram-negative bacterial ASADH. These sequence alterations have important consequences for coenzyme conformation and binding specificity and are likely involved in the observed differences in catalytic efficiency.We have recently shown that there is a dual NADP/NAD coenzyme specificity in mjASADH (13Faehnle C.R. Ohren J.F. Viola R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1055-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the Gram-negative bacterial ASADHs are all highly specific for NADP. We now find that spASADH, as well as several other Gram-positive bacterial ASADHs, including those from S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, 3C. R. Faehnle and R. E. Viola, unpublished results. also exhibit similar dual coenzyme specificity, albeit with strong a preference for NADP. This expanded coenzyme specificity in Gram-positive and archaeal ASADHs can be attributed to a new set of interactions between the enzyme and NADP that take place in the context of an altered coenzyme binding conformation.NADP Binding Induces an “Opened” to “Closed” Transition—In order to investigate the protein movements that are caused by coenzyme binding, we have compared the apo spASADH structure to an enzyme-NADP complex obtained by cocrystallization. Binding of NADP to spASADH induces rotation of the N-terminal coenzyme binding domain toward the C-terminal dimerization domain. This domain closure can best be described by an opened to closed transition that is energetically driven by the interactions that are formed between NADP and amino acid functional groups from both the N- and C-terminal domains of the enzyme. Hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions each play a role in facilitating NADP binding and in stabilization of the closed catalytically active form of ASADH. The DynDom program (23Hayward S. Lee R.A. J. Mol. Graphics. 2002; 21: 181-183Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was used to characterize the NADP-induced domain closure, by identifying the regions that have moved along with the hinge bending residues capable of facilitating this movement. The moving region includes the majority of the N-terminal coenzyme binding domain (Fig. 2), whereas the fixed region contains residues that make up the C-terminal dimerization domain. The binding of NADP causes the moving domain to rotate by 8° around a hinge axis toward the fixed domain. Hinge bending regions are found in both the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2A) and include residues 72-74, 94-98, 106-107, 111-117, 121-125, and 329-336 (marked in green in Fig. 2C). Although a significant displacement of the C-α backbone occurs within the N-terminal domain, the active site of the apoenzyme is already preformed and undergoes only local movements in response to NADP binding.FIGURE 2NADP-induced domain closure in spASADH"

In the present study, we sought to compare the biologic properties of rAAV2/1, rAAV2/2, and rAAV2/5 transduction in polarized human airway epithelia using viruses purified by a newly developed common column chromatography method. Results demonstrated that apical transduction of human airway epithelia with rAAV2/1 was 100-fold more efficient than rAAV2/2 and rAAV2/5. This transduction profile in human airway epithelia (rAAV2/1 ≫ rAAV2/2 = rAAV2/5) was significantly different from that seen following nasal administration of these vectors to mouse lung (rAAV2/5 > rAAV2/1 ≫ rAAV2/2), emphasizing differences in transduction of these serotypes between these two species. In stark contrast to rAAV2/2 and rAAV2/5, rAAV2/1 transduced both the apical and basolateral membrane of human airway epithelia with similar efficiency. However, the overall level of transduction across serotypes did not correlate with vector internalization. We hypothesized that differences in post-entry processing of these serotypes might influence the efficiency of apical transduction. To this end, we tested the effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors to augment nuclear translocation and gene expression from the three serotypes. Augmentation of rAAV2/1 apical transduction of human polarized airway epithelia was 10-fold lower than that for rAAV2/2 and rAAV2/5. Cellular fractionation studies demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors more significantly enhanced rAAV2/2 and rAAV2/5 translocation to the nucleus than rAAV2/1. These results demonstrate that AAV1 transduction biology in human airway epithelia differs from that of AAV2 and AAV5 by virtue of altered ubiquitin/proteasome sensitivities that influence nuclear translocation.

Pattison J.R. Parvoviruses and Human Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 165-174Google Scholar). At least eight serotypes of the AAV family have been identified and evaluated as recombinant vectors (2Grimm D. Kay M.A. Curr. Gene. Ther. 2003; 3: 281-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and many more have been isolated and cloned from non-human primates (3Mori S. Wang L. Takeuchi T. Kanda T. Virology. 2004; 330: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and other species. While these various serotypes have very similar genomic organizations, their infectious tropisms vary greatly as a result of evolutionary diversity among capsid proteins. The identification of optimal AAV serotypes for a given tissue target has been an area of intense interest in gene therapy research (4Gao G. Vandenberghe L.H. Wilson J.M. Curr. Gene. Ther. 2005; 5: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 5Louboutin J.P. Wang L. Wilson J.M. J. Gene. Med. 2005; 7: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). AAV type 2 is the first primate AAV to be cloned and the most extensively studied (6Berns K.I. Giraud C. Adeno-associated Virus (AAV): Vectors in Gene Therapy (Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology). 218. Springer, Berlin1996Google Scholar, 7Ding W. Zhang L. Yan Z. Engelhardt J.F. Gene. Ther. 2005; 12: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) has been effectively developed into a highly promising vector system for gene therapy of various human genetic diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF) (8Romano G. Drug News Perspect. 2005; 18: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Flotte T.R. Curr. Gene. Ther. 2005; 5: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CF is a recessive genetic disease caused by a gene defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The CFTR defect most strongly affects the lung and leads to progressive and life-threatening bacterial lung infection. rAAV2-mediated CFTR gene transfer to the human CF lung has been extensively studied in clinical trials. Phase I and II trials for CF lung disease with rAAV2 have demonstrated a promising safety profile and persistence of viral DNA genomes in airway epithelia. However, CFTR gene expression in these trials was sufficiently low to preclude the detection of transgene-derived CFTR mRNA (10Aitken M.L. Moss R.B. Waltz D.A. Dovey M.E. Tonelli M.R. McNamara S.C.

Studies of rAAV2 transduction in vitro using polarized human airway epithelia models has revealed that the post-entry intracellular trafficking barriers and impaired processing of rAAV2 appear to be primarily responsible for the observed reduced transgene expression following apical infection of human airway epithelia (14Duan D. Yue Y. Yan Z. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similar findings demonstrating that rAAV2 has impaired nuclear transport and uncoating have also been described for primary murine hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts (16Zhong L. Li W. Yang Z. Qing K. Tan M. Hansen J. Li Y. Chen L. Chan R.J. Bischof D. Maina N. Weigel-Kelley K.A. Zhao W. Larsen S.H. Yoder M.C. Shou W. Srivastava A. Hum.

Qing K. Kwon H.J. Mah C. Srivastava A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that co-administration of proteasome inhibitors, such as tripeptidyl aldehyde or/and anthracycline compounds, resulted in a dramatic enhancement of transgene expression following rAAV2 apical infection of human polarized airway epithelia in vitro and of mouse lungs in vivo (14Duan D. Yue Y. Yan Z. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Modulating proteasome activity under these conditions did not result in increased virion uptake or reduced virion degradation. Furthermore, proteasome modulation did not appear to directly affect the efficiency of second strand synthesis in airway epithelia as judged by a comparison of self-complementary and full-length vector transduction (19Ding W. Yan Z. Zak R. Saavedra M. Rodman D.M. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7361-7366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rather, augmentation of transgene expression by proteasome inhibitor treatment was accompanied by an increase in capsid ubiquitination and enhanced nuclear uptake of virions in the infected cells (14Duan D. Yue Y. Yan Z. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F.

Virol. 2002; 76: 2043-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Treatment of human CF airway epithelia with proteasome inhibitors at the time of rAAV2 or rAAV5 infection also dramatically enhances CFTR gene delivery and the correction of CFTR-mediated short circuit currents (21Zhang L.N. Karp P. Gerard C.J. Pastor E. Laux D. Munson K. Yan Z. Liu X. Godwin S. Thomas C.P. Zabner J. Shi H. Caldwell C.W. Peluso R. Carter B. Engelhardt J.F. Mol.

Although proteasome inhibitor treatment may eventually be an effective adjunct method to enhance rAAV-mediated gene delivery in clinical trials, the identification of alternative rAAV serotypes less susceptible to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated blocks would be a preferred route to improving current clinical trials. It has been reported that rAAV type 1, 5, and 6 vectors transduce mouse lungs much more efficiently than type 2 vectors (22Zabner J. Seiler M. Walters R. Kotin R.M. Fulgeras W. Davidson B.L.

However, a recent report has demonstrated that rAAV2 and rAAV5 transduction biology in human and mouse polarized airway epithelia significantly differs, questioning the validity of using mouse models for testing the preclinical efficacy of various AAV serotypes (26Liu X. Yan Z. Luo M. Engelhardt J.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the species-specific differences in transduction with various AAV serotypes and the fact that rAAV1 biology of transduction has yet to be evaluated in human airway epithelia, we sought to directly compare the biological properties of rAAV1, rAAV2, and rAAV5 transduction in polarized human airway epithelia. These studies revealed that rAAV1 was 100-fold more effective at transducing human polarized airway epithelia from the apical membrane in comparison to the other serotypes. Interesting differences in the polarity of transduction from the apical and basolateral membranes between these three serotypes also exist. In contrast to rAAV2 and rAAV5, rAAV1 equally transduced both the apical and basolateral membranes of polarized human airway epithelia without polarity bias of virion entry. Studies comparing the extent of ubiquitin/proteasome-sensitive nuclear transport and transduction between these serotypes also suggest that higher levels of rAAV1 transduction in human airway epithelia might be the result of more efficient intracellular processing of this serotype. Recombinant AAV Vector Production—Since similar vector purity is paramount for studies comparing the biology of different AAV serotypes, we developed a uniform procedure for purification of rAAV2/2, rAAV2/1, and rAAV2/5 vectors using an adenovirus-free packaging system and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). Adenovirus helper plasmid pAD Helper 4.1, AAV2 helper plasmid pBS-HSP-RC2.3, and AAV5 helper pBS-HSP-R2C5 were provided by Targeted Genetics Inc. (Seattle, WA). AAV1 helper plasmid p5E18RXC1 was a kind gift from the Vector Core at the University of Pennsylvania. All the viral stocks were generated from the same AAV2 proviral plasmid pAV2-CMVluc-flag, which was also provided by Targeted Genetics Inc. The identical rAAV2 genome was encapsidated into different AAV serotype capsids to generate rAAV2 virus (AV2/2.Luc) and pseudotyped rAAV1 (AV2/1.Luc) and rAAV5 (AV2/5.Luc) viruses. Viruses were purified with a similar procedure by iodixanol discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (27Zolotukhin S. Byrne B.J. Mason E. Zolotukhin I. Potter M. Chesnut K. Summerford C. Samulski R.J. Muzyczka N. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), followed with HPLC on a PI-Porous ion-exchange column as described below. Viral titers were determined as DNase-resistant particles using a TaqMan PCR approach and were confirmed using slot blot hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe against the luciferase gene. pAD Helper 4.1 and pAV2-CMVluc-flag plasmids were co-transfected with one of the AAV helper plasmids (pBS-HSP-RC2.3, pBS-HSP-R2C5, or p5E18RXC1) into 293 cells. For a forty 150-mm plate preparation, the amount of each plasmid used in the transfection mixture was 1.5 mg of pAD Helper 4.1, 0.5 mg of pAV2-CMVluc-flag and 1.0 mg of AAV helper. The cells were harvested at 72 h post-transfection and lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing followed by sonication. The crude lysates were further incubated with DNase I for 30 min followed by 0.05% trysin, 1% deoxycholate for another 30 min. Before being loaded on iodixanol discontinuous gradients, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10min. The clarified supernatant was diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, to a final volume of 24 ml, and NaCl was also added to a final concentration of 1 m during the dilution. Using Beckman 36.2 ml OptiSeal centrifuge tubes, the preparation of iodixanol discontinuous gradients was adopted from methods described by Zolotukhin et al. (27Zolotukhin S. Byrne B.J. Mason E. Zolotukhin I. Potter M. Chesnut K. Summerford C. Samulski R.J. Muzyczka N. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) by underlaying 12 ml of clarified lysate with 9 ml of 15% iodixanol, 6 ml of 25% iodixanol, 5 ml of 40% iodixanol, and 4.2 ml of 54% iodixanol. For a forty 150-mm plate scale preparation, two tubes were needed. The loaded tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman VTi50 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 2 h at 18 °C. The rAAV band of ∼4–5 ml was located in the 40% iodixanol layer and was collected with a syringe inserted at the 40%/54% interface. The AAV-containing fractions were combined and diluted to 200 ml with loading buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl) and directly loaded on a 4.6 × 100-mm (column volume: 1.7 ml) anion-exchange Poros PI column (Applied Biosystem, Boston, MA) using a Beckman 2000 BioSys™ HPLC work station at the flow rate of 4 ml/min. After a brief wash with the loading buffer (A buffer), the column was eluted in a 15-column volume linear NaCl gradient from 20 mm to 1 m with high salt buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl) at the flow rate of 4 ml/min. AV2/1.Luc eluted from the column at the gradient of 50% B buffer; AV2/2.Luc at 45%; and AV2/5.Luc at 40%, as shown in Fig. 1A. The purity of viral preparations was assessed using a 10% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Cell Culture—293 cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin, and were maintained in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. CHO-K1 (ATCC catalog number CCL-61) cells were propagated in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12 medium (F12K) containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin, and maintained in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. Polarized human airway epithelia were generated as described previously from lung transplant airway tissue by growing airway epithelia on 12 mm Millicell membrane inserts (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) followed by differentiation at an air-liquid interface (28Karp P.H.

Chemicals—Tripeptidyl aldehyde inhibitor LLnL (N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucine, also called MG101) was purchased from Boston Biochem (Boston, MA) and dissolved in Me2SO as a 40 mm stock solution. Doxorubicin (also called adriamycin) was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a 500 μm stock solution. Iodixanol was purchased as 60% aqueous solution “Opti-Prep™” (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) and further diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 mm KCl to 15, 20, 40, and 55% (w/v) for use in gradient cushions during viral isolation. Virus Infections—293 cells and CHO cells were grown in 24-well plates to 70% confluence prior to infection with rAAV at a multiplicity of infection equal to 100 particles/cell. Viral infection was performed in 0.25 ml of serum-free medium. At 2 h post-infection, 0.25 ml of medium with 20% FBS was added to bring the final serum level to 10%. Viruses were left in the medium for an additional 22 h. At 24 h post-infection, luciferase assays were performed to quantify gene expression. rAAV infections of fully differentiated polarized human airway epithelia were performed as described previously (14Duan D. Yue Y. Yan Z. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 109 particles of rAAV were diluted in culture medium to 50-μl volume to infect each Millicell insert from either the apical or basolateral compartment for a 16-h period. Following infection, the medium and virus were removed, and cultures were returned to an air-liquid interface with fresh medium. When proteasome inhibitors were applied, chemicals were added directly to the viral inoculum when infection was initiated and left in the medium only during the infection period. Control wells not treated with proteasome inhibitors received an equivalent amount of vehicle using the same protocol. Luciferase assays were performed 3 days post-infection. In vivo gene delivery studies utilized 4-week-old C57BL6 mice infected with AV2/1.Luc, AV2/2.Luc, and AV2/5.Luc virus by nasal instillation as described previously (15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). rAAV vectors were diluted with PBS, and 30 μl of virus containing 6 × 1010 particles of rAAV was intranasally instilled in each mouse. Mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after infection, and the lungs were collected for luciferase expression assays. Assays for Internalization of rAAV—Fully differentiated human polarized airway epithelia were infected from the apical or basal membrane with 1010 particles of rAAV vector as described above. At 2 h post-infection, virus was removed from the epithelia by washing thoroughly with PBS. Each Millicell insert was put into a 50-ml conical tube containing 40 ml of PBS and washed by gently inverting the tube. This was repeated three times to ensure that all the non-specifically bound viruses were removed. After washing, the Millicell inserts were fed with fresh medium and put back into a 37 °C incubator for 5 min or 22 h. Low molecular weight Hirt DNA was then extracted from the rAAV infected epithelia as described previously (14Duan D. Yue Y. Yan Z. Yang J. Engelhardt J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 110 of the Hirt DNA preparation was used for viral genome quantification by PCR. Quantitative Analysis of rAAV Genome by TaqMan PCR—TaqMan PCR was used to quantify the physical titers of the viral stocks and the copies of viral genome in the Hirt DNA from rAAV-infected cells (29Ding W. Zhang L.N. Yeaman C. Engelhardt J.F. Mol. Ther. 2006; 13: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PCR primers and the TaqMan probe were designed with Primer Express V1.5 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The forward primer, P1 (5′-TTTTTGAAGCGAAGGTTGTGG-3′), and the reverse primer, P2 (5′-CACACACAGTTCGCCTCTTTG-3′), were designed to amplify a 73-bp fragment of the AV2Luc DNA. The TaqMan probe (5′-ATCTGGATACCGGGAAAACGCTGGGCGTTAAT-3′) was designed following the general principle outlined by the manufacturer. The TaqMan probe was synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA) and tagged at the 5′ end with 6-carboxyl-fluorescein as the reporter, and with Dark Hole Quencher 1 (BHQ1) at the 3′ end as the quencher. The 25-μl PCR mixture consisted of 5 μl of Hirt DNA sample (110 of the preparation), primers P1 and P2 (final concentration 300 nm), TaqMan probe (final concentration 100 nm), and 12.5 μl TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Bio-Rad). The PCR reaction was performed and analyzed using a Bio-Rad MyIQ™ PCR detection system and software. The reaction condition was set as one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min followed by a two-step PCR procedure consisting of 15 s at 95 °C and l min at 60 °C for 40 cycles. All standard dilutions, controls, and unknown samples were run in triplicate. The average value of the copy number was calculated according to a standard AAV2 vector dilution series. A standard curve for AV2Luc was accepted as linear when the slope fell between –3.0 and –3.4, and the coefficient of correlation was above 0.99. Subcellular Fractionation of rAAV Genomes—Human polarized airway epithelia were infected from the apical membrane with 2 × 1010 particles of rAAV vector as described above. The infections were performed in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors (40 μm LLnL and 5 μm doxorubicin) for 16 h. The Millicell inserts were then washed twice with medium to remove the viruses and were re-fed with proteasome inhibitor-free fresh medium and incubated for two more days. At 3 days post-infection, airway cells were trypsinized from the Millicell membrane, washed twice with 5 ml of PBS, and then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in 1 ml of PBS. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were then isolated from the cell pellet as described previously (15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Xiao W. Warrington Jr., K.H. Hearing P. Hughes J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11505-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The subcellular fractions were then digested with 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K at 56 °C for 60 min followed by heating at 95 °C for 15 min to inactivate proteinase K. TaqMan PCR was performed to quantify the copies of viral genome in each fraction. Purification of rAAV1, -2, and -5 Serotypes—With the goal of comparing transduction efficiencies (i.e. transgene expression) between AAV2/1, AAV2/2, and AAV2/5 vectors, it was critical to develop a similar strategy of purification for these three serotypes to avoid potential differences in transduction caused by variation in virus purity. Although CsCl fractionation has been adopted previously for this purpose, we have found this method insufficient to purify virus from cellular impurities. To this end, we developed a rapid and uniform purification procedure to produce high purity rAAV from these three serotypes. As shown in Fig. 1A, the three serotypes eluted from the HPLC ion-exchange column in the range of 40–50% NaCl with slight variations for each serotype. Coomassie Blue staining of 10% SDS-PAGE demonstrated three major capsid bands with no detectable impurities (Fig. 1B). The total recovery of rAAV DNase-resistant particles from the crude lysate was ∼60% (80% recovery from iodixanol fractionation and 75% recovery from HPLC ion exchange). The infectivity of AV2/1.Luc, AV2/2.Luc, and AV2/5 was tested on two different cell lines. The target cells were infected with rAAV at 100 viral DNase-resistant particles/ cell, and transgene expression was assessed at 24 h post-infection as shown in Fig. 1, C and D. Not surprisingly, the various serotype of rAAV demonstrated different transduction efficiencies in 293 cells and CHO-K1 cells. rAAV2/1 and rAAV2/2 efficiently infected both human and rodent cell lines. In contrast, rAAV2/5 transduced CHO cells more efficiently than 293 cells. rAAV2/1 Transduces Human Polarized Airway Epithelia from the Apical Basolateral Membranes Much More Efficiently than rAAV2/2 and rAAV2/5—It has been reported that gene delivery to mouse lung using rAAV1, rAAV5, and rAAV6 is significantly higher than with rAAV2 (15Yan Z.

However, recently the validity of predicting rAAV serotype specificity for transduction of human airway epithelia using in vivo mouse models has been questioned (26Liu X. Yan Z. Luo M. Engelhardt J.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This study uncovered species-specific differences in the efficiency of rAAV5 and rAAV2 transduction between human and mouse polarized airway epithelia that explain the greater efficiency of in vivo rAAV5 transduction in mouse lung; rAAV5 transduction of mouse lung and polarized airway epithelia is ∼75–100-fold greater than that with rAAV2, whereas human polarized airway epithelia are transduced with rAAV5 and rAAV2 with near equivalent efficiencies (15Yan Z. Zak R. Zhang Y. Ding W. Godwin S. Munson K. Peluso R. Engelhardt J.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Liu X. Yan Z. Luo M. Engelhardt J.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that inherent differences in tropism for these two serotypes exist in mouse and human airway epithelia. As part of the present study aimed at evaluating rAAV1 transduction in human airway epithelia, we sought to extend this type of interspecies comparison to all three serotypes tested. Consistent with a previous report comparing AAV1, -2, and -5 gene delivery in mouse lung (23Auricchio A. O'Connor E. Weiner D. Gao G. Hildinger M. Wang L. Calcedo R. Wilson J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 110: 499-504Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we observed that our methods of generating and purifying rAAV from these three serotypes also demonstrated that AV2/2 virus was the least efficient at expressing luciferase transgene in mouse lung, with 30- and 100-fold higher levels of transduction observed with AV2/1 and AV2/5 vectors, respectively (Fig. 2A). When these same viruses were tested on human airway epithelium (Fig. 2B), apical transduction with AV2/1 was 100-fold higher than with AV2/2 or AV2/5. As observed previously, AV2/2 and AV2/5 vectors transduced the apical surface of human airway epi"

By yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pulldown analysis we identified RGS2 as a novel TRPV6-associated protein. RGS proteins determine the inactivation kinetics of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by regulating the GTPase activity of Gα subunits. Here we demonstrate that TRPV6 interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of RGS2 in a Ca2+-independent fashion and that overexpression of RGS2 reduces the Na+ and Ca2+ current of TRPV6 but not that of TRPV5-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. In contrast, overexpression of the deletion mutant ΔN-RGS2, lacking the NH2-terminal domain of RGS2, in TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells did not show this inhibition. Furthermore, cell surface biotinylation indicated that the inhibitory effect of RGS2 on TRPV6 activity is not mediated by differences in trafficking or retrieval of TRPV6 from the plasma membrane. This effect probably results from the direct interaction between RGS2 and TRPV6, affecting the gating properties of the channel. Finally, the scaffolding protein spinophilin, shown to recruit RGS2 and regulate GPCR-signaling via Gα, did not affect RGS2 binding and electrophysiological properties of TRPV6, indicating a GPCR-independent mechanism of TRPV6 regulation by RGS2.

Based on sequence homology, the TRP family can be divided in seven main subfamilies: the TRPC (“canonical”) family, the TRPV (“vanilloid”) family, the TRPM (“melastatin”) family, the TRPP (“polycystin”) family, the TRPML (“mucolipin”) family, the TRPA (“ankyrin”) family, and the TRPN (“NOMPC”) family. TRPV6 is the most Ca2+-selective ion channel in the TRP superfamily with a Ca2+ selectivity of more than 100 times over monovalent cations (6Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 7Pedersen S.F. Owsianik G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 233-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Recently, the electrophysiological properties of TRPV6 have been studied extensively. When measured in heterologous expression systems, TRPV6 displays characteristic inward rectifying currents carried by Ca2+ or monovalent cations when Ca2+ is omitted from the extracellular solution. These inward currents are blocked by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent manner (8Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which is removed upon neutralization of a single negatively charged amino acid residue, Asp541, within the pore region. The pore diameter of TRPV6 was recently estimated at 5.4 Å by cystein scanning experiments (9Voets T. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15223-15230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Together with its closest relative, TRPV5, TRPV6 shares a common feature that is the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the currents. TRPV6 is predominantly expressed in placenta, pancreas, small intestine, and colon (6Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In these tissues TRPV6 plays a major role in Ca2+ transport (reviewed in Refs. 13den Dekker E. Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and 14Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 373-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). To date, screening and domain mapping of the carboxyl terminus of TRPV6 has revealed proteins associating with TRPV6 and subsequently the regulatory functions of these interacting proteins have been studied, e.g. Rab11a, NHERF4, S100A10 (15van de Graaf S.F.

Bindels R.J. Pfluegers Arch. 2006; 452: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of the channel via its intracellular NH2-terminal domain. At present, six ankyrin repeats have been predicted in this region (18Erler I. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Niemeyer B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34456-34463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ankyrin repeats have been shown to act as a scaffold in molecular recognition to mediate protein-protein interactions (19Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). These, or other regions in the NH2-terminal domain of TRPV6, may bind regulatory proteins interacting in pathways that mediate the Ca2+-transporting activity of the channel. The aim of this study was to identify regulatory proteins that interact with the NH2-terminal domain of TRPV6. To this end, we identified RGS2 as a novel binding partner of TRPV6 by yeast two-hybrid screening. RGS2 is a member of the RGS family of proteins that are able to terminate signaling of heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by enhancing the GTPase activity of active Gα subunits (20De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). To date, over 20 different RGS proteins have been identified, and their effector functions extend beyond negative regulation of GPCR signaling. RGS proteins can act as effector antagonists, binding to either the effector protein or the Gα subunit to prevent an operative physical interaction. They have also been shown to interact with a wide variety of auxiliary proteins, such as calmodulin, spinophilin (SPL), and 14-3-3 protein, which can influence their subcellular localization, stability, and function (21Abramow-Newerly M. Roy A.A. Nunn C. Chidiac P. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this respect, the finding of RGS2 as a protein interacting with TRPV6 may lead to altered channel activity by disturbances in protein trafficking or a direct effect at the cell surface. The putative role of RGS2 in active Ca2+ absorption was established by a comprehensive approach including pulldown assays, electrophysiological analysis, and cell-surface expression of RGS2 interacting with TRPV6. Constructs and cRNA Synthesis—The TRPV6, TRPV6 N-tail, and TRPV5 constructs were generated in pGEX 6p-2 and pCINeo/IRES-GFP vectors as described previously (22Nilius B. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G.

The coding sequence of wild-type RGS2 protein was amplified from total mouse kidney cDNA material using primers with a HA tag included and cloned into the PT7Ts vector as BglII-SpeI fragment, and subsequently into the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector as an NheI-XhoI fragment. RGS2 and ΔN-RGS2 (deletion of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS2: amino acids 1–82) were subcloned from the PT7Ts vector without the HA tag to the pGEX 6p-2 (Amersham Biosciences) vector using forward and reverse primers containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. pT7Ts constructs were linearized, and cRNA was synthesized in vitro as described previously (16van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In pCINeo/IRES-GFP, ΔN-RGS2 was obtained by in vitro mutagenesis of wild-type RGS2. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Rat-SPL (in pCMV-myc) and human-RGS2 (in pGex-KG) constructs were described previously (23Wang X. Zeng W. Soyombo A.A. Tang W. Ross E.M. Barnes A.P. Milgram S.L. Penninger J.M. Allen P.B. Greengard P. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast-two-hybrid experiments were performed as described previously (16van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In short, the N-tail of mouse TRPV6 was cloned in the pAS-1 yeast cloning and expression vector. Using this vector, the yeast strain Y153 was transformed to Trp prototrophy. Subsequently, yeast was transformed with a mouse kidney cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) present in the pACT2 vector, containing a leucine selection marker. Yeast cells were plated on Trp-Leu-His-selective medium containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Positive colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Subsequently, yeast DNA of positive colonies was isolated, and prey plasmids were rescued by electroporation into KC8 cells. Results were confirmed using purified library plasmids, and a negative control was performed by replacing the pAS-1 containing the N-tail of mouse TRPV6 with the pAS-1 containing the N-tail of rat γ-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from different mouse tissues using TRIzol and subjected to reverse transcription as described (24van Abel M. Hoenderop J.G. Dardenne O. St Arnaud R. Van Os C.H. Van Leeuwen H.J. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2102-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For RGS2 RT-PCR, the oligonucleotide primer sequences were as follows: forward primer with BglII restriction site, 5′-GAAGATCTGCCACCATGCAAAGTGCCAGTTCCTG-3′; reverse with SpeI restriction site, 5′-GGACTAGTTCATGTAGCATGGGGCTCCG-3′; β-actin, 5′-ACGATTTCCCTCTCAGCTGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTATGCCTCTGGTCGTACCAC-3′ (reverse). For SPL the following primers were used: forward primer, 5′-CTTAGGAACACCAAAGGCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTAGTCCTTGATGAGACGC-3′. PCR fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose. Pulldown Assays—RGS2 pGex-KG and HA-RGS2, HA-ΔN-RGS2, and empty pGex 6p-2 constructs were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). [35S]Methionine-labeled TRPV6 N-tail was prepared using a reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed for pulldown with GST, GST-HA-RGS2, or GST-HA-ΔN-RGS2 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16van de Graaf S.F.

After extensive washing, bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining and autoradiography. For pulldown with hRGS2, TRPV6/mock, SPL/mock, and TRPV6/SPL were transiently transfected in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and after 72-h extracts from lysed cells were adjusted to equal input concentrations and analyzed for pulldown with GST or GST-hRGS2 fusion proteins immobilized on gluthatione-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were washed extensively and pulled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Electrophysiology and Solutions—The full-length cDNAs encoding TRPV5, TRPV6, RGS2, and ΔN-RGS2 were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells and patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight-seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier controlled by the Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), as described previously (25Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cells were held at 20 mV, and voltage ramps of 450 ms, ranging from –100 to +100 mV, were applied every 5 s. Cell capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously using the automatic capacitance compensation of the Pulse software. Na+ current densities were obtained by dividing the current amplitude measured at –80 mV during the ramp protocols by the cell capacitance. Ca2+-dependent inactivation was studied using a 3-s voltage step to –100 mV from a holding potential of +70 mV. From this step protocol, Ca2+ peak values were extracted by dividing the current at –100 mV by the cell capacitance. The standard extracellular solution (Krebs) contained: 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The concentration of Ca2+ ranged between 1 and 10 mm. Divalent-free (DVF) solutions did not contain added divalent cations, whereas trace amounts of divalent cations were removed with 100 μm EDTA. The standard internal (pipette) solution contained: 20 mm CsCl, 100 mm Cs-aspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES/CsOH, pH 7.2. Cells were kept in a nominal Ca2+-free medium to prevent Ca2+ overload and exposed for a maximum of 5 min to a Krebs solution containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ before sealing the patch pipette to the cell. The analysis and display of patch clamp data were performed using Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Biotinylation—TRPV6, HA-RGS2, and empty pCINeo/IRES-GFP constructs were transfected transiently in HEK293 cells and subjected to cell surface biotinylation as described previously (26Chang Q. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Topala C.N. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Science. 2005; 310: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit antiserum against TRPV6 (1:2000) (11Nijenhuis T. Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2731-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—In all experiments, the data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In case of significance (p < 0.05), individual groups were compared using a Student's t test. Identification of RGS2 as a TRPV6-associated Protein—To identify proteins that interact with TRPV6, the NH2-terminal tail of TRPV6 was used to screen a library of mouse kidney cDNA by the yeast two-hybrid technique. RGS2 was identified as a positive clone and belongs to the R4 subfamily of regulator of G-protein signaling proteins (27Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction, the full-length cDNA sequence of RGS2 was re-analyzed in a yeast two-hybrid with the N-tail of TRPV6 as bait. The γ-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel (γENaC) was used as a negative control. TRPV6 and RGS2 displayed a strong interaction, whereas TRPV6 and γENaC did not interact (data not shown). The RGS2 Gene Is Ubiquitously Expressed—The expression of RGS2 in different mouse tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR. RGS2 was detected ubiquitously (Fig. 1, upper panel). All tissues expressed β-actin that was used as a positive control to confirm the integrity of the cDNAs (Fig. 1, lower panel). As negative controls, the primer sets for RGS2 and β-actin were screened in the absence of cDNA (depicted as H2O samples in Fig. 1). TRPV6 Interacts with the NH2-terminal Domain of RGS2—The interaction between TRPV6 and the binding domain of RGS2 was further established using GST pulldown assays. To this end, RGS2 and ΔN-RGS2 were expressed as GST fusion proteins immobilized on gluthatione-Sepharose 4B beads. Subsequently, these fusion proteins were tested for their interaction with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled N-tail of TRPV6 in the presence or absence of 1 mm Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 2, the N-tail of TRPV6 associated with GST-fused RGS2 in a Ca2+-independent fashion whereas no binding between the N-tail of TRPV6 and GST-fused ΔN-RGS2 or GST alone was observed, neither in the presence nor absence of Ca2+. RGS2 Inhibits Specifically TRPV6 Activity—To study the functional effect of RGS2 binding to TRPV6 the electrophysiological properties of the TRPV6 channel were investigated in the presence of RGS2. Steeply inward rectifying currents carried by Na+ could be measured in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPV6 and empty vector (mock) and in cells expressing both TRPV6 and RGS2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The current carried by Na+ was significantly reduced in cells expressing both TRPV6 and RGS2 (Fig. 3, B and C, n = 15 cells, p < 0.001). Likewise, RGS2 co-expression significantly reduced the Ca2+ current in response to a hyperpolarizing voltage step in TRPV6-expressing cells (Fig. 3, D and E, n = 15 cells, p < 0.001), while the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the currents remained unchanged. In addition, the inhibitory effect of RGS2 on TRPV6-mediated Na+ and Ca2+ currents was studied for its closest relative, TRPV5, during identical experimental conditions. In contrast to TRPV6, RGS2 had no significant effect on Na+ and Ca2+ currents recorded from TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Activity of TRPV5 is not affected by co-expressing RGS2. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TRPV5/mock (control (CTRL)) or TRPV5/RGS2 and analyzed using immunoblotting (A) and by whole-cell patch clamp. B, I/V relations measured from ramp protocol in nominally DVF solution in control (solid trace) or TRPV5/RGS2-transfected cells (dotted trace). C, average Na+ current density at –80 mV in nominally DVF solution was 495 ± 130 pA/pF for control cells compared with 600 ± 100 pA/pF for TRPV5/RGS2 co-expressing cells (n = 15 cells for each condition). D, averaged Ca2+ currents measured with 10 mm Ca2+ in the extracellular solution using the step protocol in control cells (solid trace) and TRPV5/RGS2-expressing cells (dotted trace). E, average density of the Ca2+ peak current measured as in D was 210 ± 50 pA/pF for control compared with 201 ± 35 pA/pF for cells co-transfected with TRPV5 and RGS2 (n = 15 cells for each condition).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TRPV6 Activity Is Inhibited by the NH2-terminal Domain of RGS2—To test the physiological significance of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS2 on TRPV6 activity, the electrophysiological properties of TRPV6-mediated currents in HEK293 cells co-expressing either RGS2 or ΔN-RGS2 were determined. Inward rectifying currents carried by Na+ could be measured in HEK293 cells co-transfected with TRPV6 and ΔN-RGS2 or RGS2 or with TRPV6 and mock (Fig. 5, A and B). The Na+ currents were significantly reduced in cells co-expressing TRPV6 with RGS2, whereas cells co-expressing ΔN-RGS2 and TRPV6 did not show this reduction (Fig. 5, B and C, n = 10 cells, p < 0.001). Likewise, RGS2 significantly reduced the Ca2+ current in response to a hyperpolarizing voltage step in TRPV6-expressing cells (Fig. 5, D and E, n = 10 cells, p < 0.001), whereas co-expression of ΔN-RGS2 with TRPV6 had no effect on the TRPV6-mediated current amplitude. RGS2 Does Not Affect TRPV6 Abundance at the Plasma Membrane—To investigate whether RGS2 influences trafficking of TRPV6, cell surface expression of TRPV6 in HEK293 cells co-expressing RGS2 and TRPV6 was examined using Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin. TRPV6 was detected in total cell lysates of TRPV6-expressing cells as well as in the biotinylated plasma membrane fractions of TRPV6 and TRPV6/RGS2 co-expressing cells (Fig. 6). TRPV6 expression in the biotinylated membrane fraction was not significantly altered by co-expression of RGS2. TRPV6 Is Independently Regulated from the Scaffolding Protein SPL—The effect of SPL on the interaction of RGS2 with TRPV6 was investigated by GST pulldown assay. Total cell lysates of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with TRPV6, SPL, or TRPV6 and SPL were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed for the interaction with RGS2. As indicated in Fig. 7, TRPV6 associated with RGS2 both in the presence or absence of SPL. Next, the electrophysiological properties of TRPV6-mediated currents were examined by whole-cell patch clamp in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPV6 and SPL or TRPV6 and mock. Co-expression of SPL and TRPV6 had no significant effect either on Na+ or Ca2+ currents (n = 12 cells for each condition) as depicted in Fig. 8.FIGURE 8Activity of TRPV6 is not affected by SPL. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TRPV6/mock (control (CTRL)) or TRPV6/SPL and analyzed by immunoblotting and by whole-cell patch clamp. Average Na+ current density measured at –80 mV from the ramp protocol was 344 ± 70 pA/pF for control and 335 ± 80 pA/pF for TRPV6/SPL co-expressing cells and average density of the Ca2+ peak current measured from the step protocol was 204 ± 35 pA/pF for control and 195 ± 40 pA/pF for TRPV6/SPL co-expressing cells (n = 12 cells for each condition).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present study demonstrates a novel regulatory function of RGS2 by direct inhibition of TRPV6 channel activity at the plasma membrane. This conclusion is based on the following experimental data. First, interaction of RGS2 with TRPV6 specifically inhibits both Na+ and Ca2+ currents through TRPV6 whereas no effect on TRPV5 activity was observed. Second, deletion of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS2 disrupts the binding with TRPV6 and restores the original electrophysiological properties of the channel. Third, RGS2 expression does not interfere with TRPV6 trafficking from and toward the plasma membrane (to mediate its inhibitory effect on channel activity). Fourth, the multidomain scaffolding protein SPL does not affect binding and electrophysiological properties of TRPV6 in the presence of RGS2. Therefore, our data indicate that TRPV6 activity is regulated by RGS2 without the involvement of GPCR signaling. We showed that the NH2-terminal tail of RGS2 is essential for the interaction with and the activity of TRPV6. The NH2-terminal domain has already been described to be an important regulatory site for RGS2. Together with the “RGS-box” domain, it is necessary for its effector protein interactions, e.g. GPCRs and/or auxiliary proteins such as SPL (23Wang X. Zeng W. Soyombo A.A. Tang W. Ross E.M.

In addition, the membrane-targeting sequence has also been predicted in this domain (30Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Kehrl J.H. Sinnarajah S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Patch clamp analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with TRPV6 or TRPV5 revealed that specifically TRPV6 activity is inhibited by co-expression of RGS2. Interestingly, an analogous inhibitory mechanism has only been found for calmodulin and TRPV6 (32Lambers T.T. Weidema A.F. Nilius B. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28855-28861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since both Na+ and Ca2+ currents through TRPV6 were inhibited by RGS2, and thus affecting not specifically the Ca2+ conductance of the channel, we expected a disturbed TRPV6 trafficking toward the cell surface. In contrast, cell surface biotinylation in TRPV6-expressing HEK293 cells demonstrated that RGS2 does not affect channel expression in the biotinylated fractions. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of RGS2 is presumably mediated directly at the plasma membrane. RGS2 needs to be recruited toward the cell surface to affect the gating properties of TRPV6. Roy et al. (33Roy A.A. Lemberg K.E. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) showed that G-proteins recruit RGS proteins toward the plasma membrane. In their study, the abundance of RGS2 and RGS4 proteins at the plasma membrane was enhanced when the number of G proteins was increased or when they interacted with their GPCR. Also SPL has been shown to be involved in RGS protein recruitment (23Wang X. Zeng W. Soyombo A.A. Tang W. Ross E.M. Barnes A.P. Milgram S.L. Penninger J.M. Allen P.B. Greengard P. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Investigating the role of SPL provided us with additional evidence for a direct effect of RGS2 on TRPV6 activity. Wang et al. (23Wang X. Zeng W. Soyombo A.A. Tang W. Ross E.M. Barnes A.P. Milgram S.L. Penninger J.M. Allen P.B. Greengard P. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showed that SPL is a scavenger of RGS2 which forms a SPL-RGS2 protein complex that regulates Ca2+ signaling by binding the third intracellular domain of GPCRs. In their study, the binding of RGS2 with the α-adrenergic receptor was investigated by GST pulldown analysis. The interaction between RGS2 and the α-adrenergic receptor was significantly increased in the presence of SPL. Furthermore, they observed that the inhibitory effect of RGS2 on Ca2+-activated Cl– currents in parotid duct cells was increased in the presence of SPL. For this reason, we anticipated that SPL could increase the inhibitory effect of endogenously present RGS2 on TRPV6 activity in HEK293 cells when acting via a Gαq-coupled GPCR. RGS2 expression was confirmed in HEK293 cells by RT-PCR (data not shown). First, it was demonstrated that SPL does not change TRPV6 expression (Fig. 7, top panel). Second, TRPV6-mediated Na+ and Ca2+ currents were not affected by SPL as well (Fig. 8). Therefore, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of RGS2 on TRPV6 activity is independently regulated of a GPCR but is rather mediated by direct interaction of RGS2 and TRPV6. In conclusion, we have identified RGS2 as a novel regulatory protein specifically inhibiting the activity of the epithelial Ca2+ channel TRPV6. Our findings may provide insight in the direct regulation of different TRP channels by interacted proteins at the plasma membrane. We thank Dr. K. M.

https://openalex.org/W2024750925,"Ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) are principal players in the regulation of cell growth and energy metabolism. Signaling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways mediates the activation of S6K in response to various mitogenic stimuli. The family of S6Ks consists of two forms, S6K1 and -2, that have cytoplasmic and nuclear splicing variants, S6K1 II and S6K1 I, respectively. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of both isoforms induced by mitogenic stimuli has been reported recently. Here we present the identification of protein kinase CK2 (CK2) as a novel binding and regulatory partner for S6K1 II. The interaction between S6K1 II and CK2β regulatory subunit was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen and further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of transiently expressed and endogenous proteins. The interaction between S6K1 II and CK2 was found to occur in serum-starved and serum-stimulated cells. In addition, we found that S6K1 II is a substrate for CK2. The localization of the CK2 phosphorylation site was narrowed down to Ser-17 in S6K1 II. Mutational analysis and the use of phosphospecific antibody indicate that Ser-17 is a major in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation site for CK2. Functional studies reveal that, in contrast to the wild type kinase, the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of S6K1 II (S17E) retains its cytoplasmic localization in serum-stimulated cells. Treatment of cells with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B revealed that the S17E mutant accumulates in the nucleus to the same extent as S6K1 II wild type. These results indicate that nuclear import of the S17E mutant is not affected, although the export is significantly enhanced. We also provide evidence that nuclear export of S6K1 is mediated by a CRM1-dependent mechanism. Taken together, this study establishes a functional link between S6K1 II and CK2 signaling, which involves the regulation of S6K1 II nuclear export by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-17."

https://openalex.org/W1967317016,"The γ subunit of the F1 portion of the chloroplast ATP synthase contains a critically placed dithiol that provides a redox switch converting the enzyme from a latent to an active ATPase. The switch prevents depletion of intracellular ATP pools in the dark when photophosphorylation is inactive. The dithiol is located in a special regulatory segment of about 40 amino acids that is absent from the γ subunits of the eubacterial and mitochondrial enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to probe the relationship between the structure of the γ regulatory segment and its function in ATPase regulation via its interaction with the inhibitory ϵ subunit. Mutations were designed using a homology model of the chloroplast γ subunit based on the analogous structures of the bacterial and mitochondrial homologues. The mutations included (a) substituting both of the disulfide-forming cysteines (Cys199 and Cys205) for alanines, (b) deleting nine residues containing the dithiol, (c) deleting the region distal to the dithiol (residues 224-240), and (d) deleting the entire segment between residues 196 and 241 with the exception of a small spacer element, and (e) deleting pieces from a small loop segment predicted by the model to interact with the dithiol domain. Deletions within the dithiol domain and within parts of the loop segment resulted in loss of redox control of the ATPase activity of the F1 enzyme. Deleting the distal segment, the whole regulatory domain, or parts of the loop segment had the additional effect of reducing the maximum extent of inhibition obtained upon adding the ϵ subunit but did not abolish ϵ binding.

The ATP synthase enzymes of the inner membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts and of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane couple the energy of a transmembrane electro-chemical proton gradient to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The general structural features of the enzyme are highly conserved from one organism to another. It is composed of an integral membrane-spanning H+-translocating segment (FO or factor O) and a peripheral membrane segment (F1 or factor 1), which contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The F1 segment is composed of five different single polypeptide subunits designated α to ϵ in order of decreasing molecular weight. The subunit stoichiometry is α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1. There are six nucleotide binding sites, one at each of the six interfaces between α and β subunits (1Girault G. Berger G. Galmiche J.M. Andre F. J. Biol.

Freshly isolated CF1 is a latent ATPase and can be activated in two ways. First, reduction of the only disulfide bond in the enzyme, formed between Cys199 and Cys205 of the γ subunit, gives rise to partial activation of CF1 (5Nalin C.M. Béliveau R. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3376-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, removal of the ϵ subunit also results in partial activation of the enzyme (6Richter M.L. Patrie W.J. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7371-7373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two effects are additive (7Richter M.L. Lampton J.D. McCarty Biggins J Progress in Photo-synthesis Research. III. Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1987: 57-60Google Scholar). Either removing ϵ from CF1 or reducing the γ disulfide results in exposure of several sites on γ within close proximity to the regulatory dithiol domain that are hypersensitive to trypsin. Concurrent with tryptic cleavage of γ at these sites is the complete loss of inhibition by the ϵ subunit (8Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G.

McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5910-5914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleaved enzyme, when isolated from thylakoids, is partially deficient in the ϵ subunit, indicating that ϵ binding is weakened (22Soteropoulos P. Suss K.-H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have led to the hypothesis that the ϵ subunit may bind in the immediate vicinity of the disulfide bridge on γ where its binding masks the disulfide bridge and the trypsin-sensitive sites on γ (9Hightower K.E. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4847-4851Google Scholar). To obtain a clearer picture of the relationship between ϵ and γ in regulation and coupling in CF1 we developed methods to reconstitute structurally altered γ subunits with isolated α3β3 hexamers resulting in functional α3β3γ core enzyme assemblies (23Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L.

In this study we have utilized this system to examine mutant γ subunits with structural changes within the dithiol-containing regulatory domain and within an additional loop segment (the extra loop) predicted by modeling studies to inter-act directly with the dithiol domain. The results identify potential structural requirements for dithiol regulation and provide new insight into how the ϵ subunit simultaneously couples proton movement to γ rotation and ATP synthesis while blocking the reverse reaction driven by ATP hydrolysis. Materials—CF1 and CF1 deficient in the δ and ϵ subunits, CF1(-δϵ), were prepared from fresh market spinach as described previously (6Richter M.L. Patrie W.J. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7371-7373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol.

Prior to use the proteins were desalted on Seph-adex G-50 centrifuge columns (26Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An α3β3 complex devoid of the γ subunit was isolated from CF1(-δϵ) as described previously (23Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The α3β3 subunit complex was recycled through the isolation procedure to ensure that trace amounts of contaminating γ subunit were removed. ATP (grade II) and antibiotics (ampicillin and tetracycline) were purchased from Sigma. Tryptone and yeast extract were obtained from Difco. Urea (ultrapure) was purchased from Fluka and hydroxylapatite from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of the highest quality reagent grade available. Production and Assembly of γ and ϵ Subunits—The atpG and atpE genes encoding the full-length γ and ϵ subunits, respectively, were cloned into pET expression vectors as described previously (27Chen Z.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 host cells for overexpression of the γ and ϵ proteins. Protein overexpression was induced by addition of isopropylthiogalactoside (28Cruz J.A. Harfe B. Radkowski C.A. Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies containing the γ protein were solubilized with urea, and the protein folded during slow dialysis and assembled with the isolated, native α3β3 complex as described previously (24Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13524-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unreconstituted subunits were separated from the reconstituted α3β3γ by anion-exchange chromatography (23Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ϵ protein was solubilized from inclusion bodies in 8 m urea and folded by the dilution method of Cruz and McCarty (28Cruz J.A. Harfe B. Radkowski C.A. Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cloned ϵ subunit was reconstituted with the α3β3γ complex using the same procedure for reconstituting the native ϵ subunit with CF1(-ϵ) (6Richter M.L. Patrie W.J. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7371-7373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of atpG Mutants—Mutant γ subunits were constructed by enzymatic amplification of the expression plasmid pET8c-γ.BB1 (24Sokolov M. Lu L. Tucker W. Gao F. Gegenheimer P.A. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13524-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using a pair of “inverse” primers with abutting 5′-ends. Deletions were generated with primers whose 5′ termini defined the endpoints of the deletion. Oligonucleotides were generated with the aid of the Primer Design program (SciEd Software). Primers (obtained from Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University) were 24-31 nucleotides long and were chemically phosphorylated at the 5′ termini. A mutant containing a deletion of γ amino acid residues 197-205 (γΔ197-205) was constructed using a forward primer with the base sequence corresponding to bases +616 to +640 and a reverse primer with the base sequence corresponding to bases +564 to 568 of the wild-type atpG gene. A second mutant containing alanine in place of both of the cysteines at positions 199 and 205 was prepared by substituting GCT in the forward primer for the two Cys codons TGC and TCT starting at positions +622 and +637, respectively. The reverse primer contained the sequence +591 to +615 of the atpC coding sequence. A third γ mutant containing a deletion of amino acid residues from 224 to 240 (γΔ224-240) was constructed with the forward primer, 5′-pTA CGA ATT CGA ACA AGA TCC TGC TC (bases from +721 to +745 with respect to the atpC coding sequence), and the reverse primer, 5′-pTA GCT TAC CTT CTT TTG TTG TGA GAC G (bases from +643 to +669 with respect to the atpC coding sequence). In this mutant, 51 bp (17 amino acid residues) were deleted relative to the wild-type template (pET8c-γ.BB1), and at the same time γLeu-241 was mutated to Tyr241. A fourth mutant with the entire region between residues 196 and 241 deleted (γΔ197-240) was constructed using the forward primer: 5′-pATG ATG TAC TAA TTC GAA CAA GAT (bases +715 to +739 with respect to the atpG coding sequence) and the reverse primer: 5′-pTT CGG CGG ATC CTT TTA CTT CTT C (bases +572 to +596 with respect to the atpG coding sequence). In this mutant 114 bp (38 amino acid residues) were deleted relative to the wild-type γ template and at the same time γGlu197-Ile198-Cys199 and Pro239-Ile240-Leu241 were mutated to Ser197-Ala198-Glu199 and Met239-Ser240-Tyr241, respectively. An N-terminal γ fragment containing residues 1-196 and a C-terminal fragment containing amino acid residues 206-322 were generated by restriction nuclease cleavage of pET8c-γ.BB1 using NcoI and SalI (the C-terminal fragment) and EcoR1 (the N-terminal fragment). In a series of additional mutants, residues 65-68, 65-73, 68-73, and 74-78 and the entire region 65-78 were deleted using abutting primers of 24 nucleotides in length. Plasmid DNA for PCR was prepared either by ethanol precipitation after phenol:chloroform extraction (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). PCR was carried out in 50 μl of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase reaction buffer also containing 60 ng of the pET8c-γ.BB1 plasmid as described in detail elsewhere (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 31Tucker W.C. Du Z. Hein R. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick gel-extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA was precipitated with ethanol and circularized by incubating 100-200 ng of the DNA with 3 units of T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI) in T4 DNA ligase buffer overnight at room temperature. The resulting plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli XL1-blue cells. Cloned plasmid was isolated and transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire sequence of each mutant γ gene was confirmed using the fluorescent dideoxy method (32Averboukh L. Douglas S.A. Zhao S. Lowe K. Mahler J. Pardee A.B. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other Procedures—ATPase activities were determined by measuring phosphate release (33Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 5 min at 37 °C. The assay mixture for calcium-dependent ATPase activity contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm CaCl2. That for magnesium-dependent ATPase activity contained 40 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 8), 4 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Na2SO3 (25Hu N. Mills D.A. Huchzermeyer B. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8536-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions on pre-cast NuPage® (Invitrogen) gels (4-20% acrylamide gradient). Mutations within the Dithiol Domain of the γ Subunit—The recently published (11Richter M.L. Samra H. He F. Giessel A. Kuczera K. J. Biomemb. Biophys. 2005; 37: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) modeled structure of the CF1 γ subunit shown in Fig. 1 was used as the basis for preparing several mutant forms of the γ subunit (Table 1), partially to examine the structural requirements for the regulatory function of this region of γ, and partially to probe the structural requirement for ϵ binding and inhibition. There are three recognizable sub-domains within the γ subunit as indicated in Fig. 1, a twisted helical domain formed by the extreme N- and C-terminal elements shown in blue, a central domain that links the two helical elements forming the twisted helical domain shown in green, and the regulatory dithiol-containing domain shown in red.A small loop structure, that is present in the chloroplast γ but not in the homologous mitochondrial subunit, is highlighted in cyan. Molecular dynamic studies predicted that the dithiol domain exists in a range of conformations between two extreme states; the fully open state, shown in Fig. 1, with the dithiol reduced, and a fully closed state with the dithiol oxidized to form a disulfide bridge and in which the regulatory domain has become more compact and has moved downward to come into close contact with the central domain (11Richter M.L. Samra H. He F. Giessel A. Kuczera K. J. Biomemb. Biophys. 2005; 37: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the open conformation is predicted to represent the activated state and the closed conformation the inactivated state (11Richter M.L. Samra H. He F. Giessel A. Kuczera K. J. Biomemb. Biophys. 2005; 37: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The model further predicts a close interaction between the dithiol domain and the extra loop in the closed state.TABLE 1Recombinant CF1 γ subunit constructsγ Structural elementMutant γ subunitaRecombinant γ mutants were reconstituted with native α3β3 and the assemblies purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the γC199A,C205A mutant, both of the dithiol cysteines were substituted for alanines.

Open table in a new tab In one mutant (γC199A/C205A) alanine was substituted for each of the two disulfide-forming cysteine residues at positions 199 and 205. In a second mutant (γΔ197-205), a small stretch of nine amino acids containing Glu197 through Cys205 was deleted. This sequence, containing the two disulfide-forming sulfhydryls, is unique to chloroplast F1 and is highly conserved among higher plant species. Both of these mutants were expected to result in permanent activation of the enzyme with loss of oxidoreductive regulation, without compromising the functional integrity of the γ subunit. In a third mutant (γΔ224-240), the 17-residue section containing Thr224 through Ile240 was deleted while at the same time Leu241 was changed to tyrosine. The rationale for the substitution came from an amino acid sequence alignment that indicated that organisms naturally missing the 17 amino acids have tyrosine in the equivalent position to Lys241 in CF1 γ. Thus the deletion mutant recreated a natural variant of the F γ subunit with respect to the central domain. Residues 224-240, which flank the dithiol-containing segment, are present in both higher plants and cyanobacteria but are missing in other organisms. In the fourth mutant, the entire regulatory domain, including Glu197 through Ile240, was deleted. At the same time, a short segment of six amino acids, Ser-Ala-Glu-Ser-Met-Ser, was incorporated back into the deleted region. The construct thus exactly matched the central section sequence of bovine MF1 γ in which the six amino acid segment acts as a connecting loop between the twisted helical domain and the central domain (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). In addition, two DNA fragments, one (γN) encoding the N-terminal residues of γ from 1 to 196, the other (γC) the C-terminal residues from 207 to 323, were constructed independently and individually overexpressed in the E. coli host. The mutant γ subunits were tested for their ability to assemble with the α3β3 complex to reconstitute a functional ATPase. All of the constructs, including the combined N- and C-terminal fragments, successfully assembled with the α and β subunits to produce stable complexes, which could be purified by anionexchange chromatography under identical conditions to those used to purify the assembly containing the wild-type γ subunit (Table 1). The gel-electrophoresis patterns of representative mutant γ assemblies are shown in Fig. 2. The relative staining densities qualitatively indicated that the mutant γ subunits had been assembled in the same ratio as the wild-type subunit with respect to the α and β subunits. Neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal fragment of γ alone could assemble with the α and β subunits to form an active enzyme. When un-reconstituted subunits were separated from stable α3β3γ complexes by ion-exchange chromatography (23Gao F. Lipscomb B. Wu I. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9763-9769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we found no evidence of an α3β3γ assembly formed in the presence of either γ fragment alone. However, when both N- and C-terminal fragments of γ were added together to the reconstitution mixture, a stable quaternary complex was produced (Fig. 2, lane 5), which eluted from DEAE-cellulose at the same salt concentration as the normal α3β3γ complex. The Ca2+- and the Mg2+-dependent ATPase activities of the mutant assemblies, immediately following isolation, were comparable to those of the wild-type assembly with the exception of the γγC199A/C205A and γΔ197-205 mutants, both of which were ∼60% higher than wild-type (Table 2). The assemblies were exposed to conditions that either promote oxidation (100 μm CuCl2, 30 min, room temperature) or promote reduction (10 mm DTT, 30 min at room temperature) of the γ disulfide (8Richter M.L. Snyder B. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5755-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The enzyme containing the wild-type γ subunit, possessing the two disulfide-forming thiols, was significantly activated by reduction with DTT as shown in Table 3. In contrast, the γC199A/C205A mutant and the γΔ197-205 mutant both exhibited maximal rates of ATPase activity without further activation by DTT, which is the expected consequence of permanently blocking formation of the γ disulfide bond. Interestingly, the Mg-ATPase activity of the γΔ197-205 mutant consistently showed a decrease (16 to 30% in different experiments) in activity following exposure to DTT, whereas the γC199A/C205A mutant did not. Exposure of the γΔ197-205 mutant to the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide, which would be expected to selectively alkylate the C-terminal Cys322 of γ under these conditions (7Richter M.L. Lampton J.D. McCarty Biggins J Progress in Photo-synthesis Research. III. Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1987: 57-60Google Scholar), blocked the DTT-induced inhibition (Table 3). The reason for this effect is unclear. The activity of the γΔ224-240 mutant under oxidizing conditions was similar to that of the reduced, fully activated wild-type enzyme and was not further enhanced by thiol-reducing conditions. Similarly, removal of the entire regulatory domain in the γΔ197-240 mutant resulted in an assembly with 90% of the activity of the reduced wild-type enzyme and was insensitive to thiol reducing conditions (Tables 2 and 3).TABLE 2ATPase activities of regulatory domain γ mutant enzyme assembliesProtein preparationaCore F1 enzymes were assembled with the wild-type γ mutants as indicated, purified, and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ATPase activitybErrors are standard deviations with n = 4.Mg2+Ca2+μmol per min per mg proteinα3β3γwild-type31.1 ± 4.019.5 ± 1.5α3β3γC199A,C205A53.4 ± 5.230.5 ± 1.5α3β3γΔ197-20554.7 ± 5.133.9 ± 1.5α3β3γΔ224-24052.5 ± 2.434.9 ± 2.1α3β3γΔ197-24045.15 ± 3.1530.6 ± 1.1α3β3γNγC23.9 ± 0.513.4 ± 0.4a Core F1 enzymes were assembled wi"

ACPSs are believed to be involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and are essential to the host organisms, as exemplified by dpj gene inactivation in E. coli by using mini-Tn10 transposons (10Takiff H.E. Baker T. Copeland T. Chen S.M. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ACPS-type PPTases can also modify apo-ACPs from PKSs in vitro but not the peptidyl carrier proteins from NRPS pathways. The second type of PPTases, the Sfp-type PPTases, is often approximately twice the size of the ACPS-type and can phosphopantetheinylate both ACPs and peptidyl carrier proteins. In bacteria, this type of PPTase genes has been found both clustered with PKS or NRPS gene clusters, such as sfp from the surfactin biosynthesis pathway in B. subtilis (11Nakano M.M. Marahiel M.A. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mta for myxothiazol biosynthesis in myxobacteria (12Silakowski B. Schairer H.U. Ehret H. Kunze B.

Du L. Edwards D.J. Toney M.D. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PPTase genes associated with PKS or NRPS gene clusters, such as sfp or mta, are often dispensable for polyketide or peptide biosynthesis, whereas the true physiological role for stand-alone PPTase genes, such as svp, remains to be established. Marahiel and co-workers (6Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Finking R. Solsbacher J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50293-50302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have recently suggested that the Sfp-type PPTases can also serve as PPTases for fatty acid biosynthesis in B. subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the absence of ACPS-type PPTases. Current evidence is also consistent with the belief that a single Sfp-type PPTase with broad substrate specificity exists in humans (15Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40067-40074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The third group of PPTases is found at the C-terminal domain of yeast FAS. They activate the apo-ACP domain in FAS in cis by self-phosphopantetheinylation (16Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Little is known about this type of PPTases because they have only recently been discovered. Bacterial aromatic PKSs, also known as type II PKSs, minimally consist of four enzymes for polyketide biosynthesis, including a holo-ACP, two ketoacyl-ACP synthase subunits KSα and KSβ (also known as chain length factor), and a malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase. They synthesize a broad range of aromatic polyketides, many of which have important pharmacological properties, such as the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and mithramycin and the antibiotic tetracycline. The post-translational modification of the apo-ACP to form the holo-ACP is essential for the proper function of type II PKS and must be catalyzed by a PPTase. Mutation of the conserved serine residue in the actinorhodin ACP (S42A) completely inactivated the PKS, confirming the conserved Ser as the site of phosphopantetheinylation (17Khosla C. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3237-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Some aromatic polyketide gene clusters do not contain PPTase genes, such as the ones for the biosynthesis of actinorhodin, tetracenomycin, doxorubicin, mithramycin, and tetracycline. To explain this curiosity, it has been suggested that the ACPS associated with the host FAS could modify both the FAS and PKS apo-ACPs (18Shen B. Topics Curr. Chem. 2000; 209: 1-51Crossref Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the relatively broad substrate specificity of ACPS toward ACPs, the successful interchange of the actinorhodin ACP gene with the ACP gene from the Saccharopolyspora erythraea FAS (17Khosla C. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3237-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), as well as the structure similarity of FAS ACPs and actinorhodin ACP established by an NMR study (19Crump M.P. Crosby J. Dempsey C.E. Parkinson J.A. Murray M. Hopwood D.A. Simpson T.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6000-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, putative Sfp-type PPTase genes are located in other type II PKS gene clusters, such as those for the biosynthesis of granaticin, griseorhodin, jadomycin, landomycin, medermycin, resistomycin, and simocyclinone (20Novakova R. Bistakova J. Homerova D. Rezuchova B. Kormanec J. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 297: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Ichinose K. Bedford D.J. Tornus D. Bechthold A. Bibb M.J. Revill W.P.

Soc. 2004; 126: 2298-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are dedicated to a particular biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, inactivation of the jadM PPTase gene caused a 95–97% decrease in jadomycin yield, which implies that no other PPTase in the organism was able to modify the jadomycin ACP efficiently in vivo (23Wang L. McVey J. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Substrate promiscuity or specificity of PPTases therefore has to be considered in any attempt to engineer polyketide or peptide biosynthetic machinery for structural diversity in heterologous hosts because effective PPTase-catalyzed modification of carrier proteins is crucial for functional overexpression of the PKS or NRPS gene clusters (28Gokhale R.S. Tsuji S.Y. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 1999; 284: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29Gross F. Gottschalk D. Muller R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). During an investigation of the biosynthesis of the antitumor antibiotic fredericamycin (FDM) A in Streptomyces griseus, we cloned and sequenced the fdm biosynthetic genes encoding a type II PKS and confirmed its function by gene inactivation and complementation in S. griseus and heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus (Fig. 1B) (30Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Among the genes identified within the fdm cluster, the deduced product of fdmW was found to have significant sequence similarity to known ACPS-type PPTases. We chose to address the role of fdmW in FDM biosynthesis and here report the results of in vivo and in vitro characterization of the FdmW PPTase. Our findings establish that FdmW is a PPTase dedicated to FDM biosynthesis, and FdmW therefore represents the first example of an ACPS-type PPTase identified from an aromatic polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster. General Procedures—E. coli DH5α, E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), E. coli TB1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), E. coli M15(pREP4) (Qiagen), and S. griseus ATCC49344 (30Wendt-Pienkowski E.

Plasmid preparation was carried out using commercial kits (Qiagen). Streptomyces chromosomal DNA was isolated according to literature protocols (35Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 1-41Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were from commercial sources, and DNA digestion and ligation followed standard methods (36Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1-170Google Scholar). For Southern analysis, digoxigenin labeling of DNA probes, hybridization, and detection were performed according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Automated DNA sequencing was provided by University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI), and the data were analyzed using PE Biosystems version 3.7 of Sequencing Analysis. Bioinformatics analysis, such as the sequence alignment and comparison, and the isoelectric point (pI) calculation was performed using the GCG package provided by BioComp research computing service in University of Wisconsin-Madison. Inactivation and Complementation of fdmW in S. griseus—The fdm biosynthetic gene cluster has been mapped to two overlapping cosmids, pBS4029 and pBS4030. To inactivate fdmW, a 5.6-kb PstI fragment containing fdmW from pBS4030 was first cloned into the same site of pSPORT1 to afford pBS4031. A 1.5-kb BamHI DNA fragment of the aac (3)IV apramycin resistance gene (35Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 1-41Google Scholar) was then inserted into the NotI site of fdmW in pBS4031 to afford pBS4032. The mutated fdmW::acc (3)IV gene was finally moved from pBS4032 as a 7.1-kb PstI fragment into PstI of pSET151 to yield pBS4033. pBS4033 was introduced into the S. griseus wild-type strain by transformation, and the double cross-over mutant SB4008 was obtained through an established protocol (30Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and then confirmed by Southern analysis. To construct the fdmW complementation construct, a 750-bp KpnI-XhoI fragment of the fdmW gene from pBS4031 was cloned into pSPORT1 at the KpnI-SalI sites to gain cloning sites. The fdmW gene was then excised as a PstI-HindIII fragment and ligated into the same sites of either pWHM1250 or pWHM3 to yield pBS4034 or pBS4035, respectively. The expression of fdmW in the former construct would be under the control of both ErmE* (35Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 1-41Google Scholar) and its native promoters, whereas that in the latter construct would be under the control of its native promoter only. pBS4034 and pBS4035 as well as pWHM3 as a negative control were introduced separately into the SB4008 mutant strain by transformation to generate, respectively, strains SB4009 (SB4008/pBS4034), SB4010 (SB4008/pBS4035), and SB4011 (SB4008/pWHM3). Production, isolation, HPLC, and mass spectrometry analysis of the fermentation culture of S. griseus wild-type and recombinant (i.e. SB4008, SB4009, SB4010, and SB4011) strains were carried out as described previously (30Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Overproduction and Purification of DEBS1-ACP1, FdmH, FdmW, LnmJ-ACP5, Svp, and TcmM—The DEBS1-ACP1 gene was amplified by PCR from plasmid pCK12, which harbors the full-length DEBS1 gene, using 5′-CCGGAATTCCATATGCTGTTCGAGC-3′ as a forward primer (the EcoRI site is underlined) and a reverse primer 5′-CGCGCAAGCTTGAGTTCGGCGGCCCAGGTG-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The resultant PCR product was sequenced to verify PCR fidelity, digested with EcoRI-HindIII, and cloned into the same sites of pSP72 to produce pBS4036. The DEBS1-ACP1 gene was finally excised as a 0.3-kb NdeI-HindIII fragment from pBS4036 and cloned into the same sites of pET28a to yield pBS4037. The latter resulted in the overproduction of DEBS1-ACP1 as a fusion protein with His6 tags at both the C and N termini. The fdmH gene was amplified by PCR from pBS4012 using a forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTCCATATGAGCACCATCAGCTTCAACGAC-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined) and a reverse primer 5′-GCGCGCAAGCTTGACCCCCGCCAGGCTGGT-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The resultant PCR product was sequenced to verify PCR fidelity, digested with EcoRI-HindIII, and cloned into the same sites of pSP72 to produce pBS4038. The fdmH gene was finally moved from pBS4038 as a 0.3-kb NdeI-HindIII fragment into the same sites of pET28a to afford pBS4039. The latter resulted in the overproduction of FdmH as a fusion protein with His6 tags at both the C and N termini. The fdmW gene was amplified by PCR from pBS4040, a pSPORT1-based plasmid with a 1,749-bp KpnI-XhoI DNA fragment containing fdmW gene subcloned from pBS4030, using a forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTCCATATGCAACCTGACGACGAGGGC-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined) and a reverse primer 5′-GCGCGCAAGCTTGGCCGCACCGACGACGAC-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The resultant PCR product was sequenced to verify PCR fidelity, digested with EcoRI-HindIII, and cloned into the same sites of pSP72 to yield pBS4041. The fdmW gene was finally cloned from pBS4041 as a 0.5-kb NdeI-HindIII fragment into the same sites of pET28a to yield pBS4042. The latter resulted in the overproduction of FdmW as a fusion protein with His6 tags at both the C and N termini. Alternatively, the fdmW gene was amplified from pBS4040 with the same forward primer but a different reverse primer with the fdmW stop codon 5′-GATAAGCTTTCAGGCCGCACCGACGACGAC-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The resultant PCR product was sequenced to verify PCR fidelity, digested with EcoRI-HindIII, and cloned into the same sites of pMal-c2x to generate pBS4043. The latter resulted in the overproduction of FdmW as an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein. To generate the N-terminal truncated FdmW, the following forward primer 5′-GATGAATTCCATATGATCGTGGGTGTGGGGATC-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined) and reverse primer 5′-GATAAGCTTTCAGGCCGCACCGACGAC-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined) were used for the PCR amplification. The resultant PCR product was sequenced to verify PCR fidelity, digested with EcoRI-HindIII, cloned into the same sites of pMAL-c2x to afford pBS4044. The latter resulted in the production of a truncated FdmW (i.e. deletion of 37 amino acids, QPDDEGAREW RRGPGGSGRF PWPLRLRARH PRPAPPR, at its N terminus) as an N-terminal MBP fusion protein. For overproduction of the DEBS1-ACP1 and FdmH proteins, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with pBS4037 and pBS4039, respectively. The resultant transformants were grown in LB at 37 °C for 5 h. A 2–5 ml portion of this culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of LB, and incubation continued at 37 °C until the A595 nm reached 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was then added, and incubation continued at 30 °C for 5 h. The cells were harvested, first treated with lysozyme, and then disrupted by sonication. DEBS1-ACP1 or FdmH was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-NTA in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The eluted protein fractions were collected, dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at –80 °C for in vitro assays. The isolated yield for DEBS1-ACP1 or FdmH was estimated to be 2 or 18 mg/liter, respectively. To obtain pure apo-FdmH for kinetic assays, the FdmH purified via Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography was further subjected to an anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (10 × 10 cm; Amersham Biosciences) to remove the small amount of holo-FdmH co-purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. The column was eluted with a 20-min linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing apo-FdmH were pooled, dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at –80 °C for in vitro assays. For overproduction of FdmW as a His6-tagged fusion protein, pBS4042 was similarly introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described above. Although FdmW was well produced, it was completely insoluble under all conditions tested. For production of FdmW and its truncated form as MBP fusion proteins, E. coli TB1 was transformed with pBS4043 or pBS4044, respectively. The resultant transformants were grown, induced, harvested, and disrupted, and the crude cell free extract was prepared as described above, except for the omission of imidazole in the buffer. Purification of the MBP fusion proteins on amylose resin was carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The fractions containing FdmW or the truncated FdmW were pooled, dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at –80 °C for in vitro assays. The isolated yields for FdmW and its truncated form as MBP fusion proteins were estimated to be 3 and 2 mg/liter, respectively. LnmJ-ACP5 (31Cheng Y. Tang G. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3149-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), Svp (13Sanchez C. Du L. Edwards D.J. Toney M.D. Shen B. Chem.

Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were overproduced and purified as described previously. The protein concentrations were determined based on the calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm: DEBS1-ACP1, 1,320 m–1 cm–1; FdmH, 3,840 m–1 cm–1; FdmW, 87,480 m–1 cm–1; truncated FdmW, 77,350 m–1 cm–1; LnmJ-ACP5, 5,960 m–1 cm–1; Svp, 34,615 m–1 cm–1; and TcmM, 2,980 m–1 cm–1. Phosphopantetheinylation of ACPs by Svp and FdmW in Vitro and Kinetic Analysis—The pH profile of FdmW was determined in 75 mm MES/sodium acetate (for pH 4.5–6.5) and 75 mm Tris·HCl (for pH 7.0–9.5) buffers. FdmW exhibited an optimal pH at approximately 8.0; thus all in vitro studies of FdmW were carried out at pH 8.0. For in vitro phosphopantetheinylation of ACPs, reaction mixtures contained 10–50 μm apo-ACPs (i.e. DEBS1-ACP1, FdmH, LnmJ-ACP5, or TcmM), 0.25 μm Svp or 0.2 μm FdmW, 250 μm CoA, 5 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 50 μl. The assays were initiated by the addition of CoA, incubated at 37 °C for 15–60 min, and terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm and then frozen immediately at –80 °C. To follow phosphopantetheinylation of the apo-ACPs by HPLC analysis, the samples were injected to an analytic Jupiter C-18 column (5 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex, Belmont, CA), eluted with a 20-min linear gradient from 15% CH3CN to 90% CH3CN in H2O with 0.1% CF3CO2H at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peaks corresponding to apo- and holo-FdmH were collected, lyophilized, and dissolved in H2O for electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, which was performed on an Aglient (Palo Alto, CA) 1000 HPLC-MSD SL instrument. For kinetic analysis, the reaction mixtures contained 2–320 μm apo-ACPs, 25 nm Svp or 20 nm FdmW, 250 μm CoA, 5 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 100 μl. The assays were initiated, incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and terminated and analyzed by HPLC as described above. The amount of converted holo-ACPs was calculated based on the peak abundance of the apo-ACPs and holo-ACPs under initial velocity conditions. Kinetic parameters were calculated by the standard nonlinear regression method. FdmW Is an Unusual ACPS-type PPTase by Sequence Analysis—The product of the fdmW gene was assigned to be a putative PPTase based on the significant sequence similarity with the ACPS-type PPTases from various Streptomyces species and other bacteria (Table 1). FdmW contains the two conserved motifs VGID and FAAKEAVAK found in the PPTase superfamily: (V/I)G(V/I)D and (F/W)XXKE(A/S)hhK (Fig. 2), in which Asp and Glu are involved in chelating the metal cofactor Mg2+, and Phe is essential for binding the phosphopantetheinyl moiety of holo-ACP as part of a hydrophobic pocket, as shown by the co-crystal structure of B. subtilis ACPS and ACP (37Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Matthew R. Hixon J. Stahk M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). FdmW also has some unusual characteristics compared with other ACPS-type PPTases. Although most of these enzymes are ∼120 amino acids in length, FdmW has a long N-terminal region upstream of its VGID motif, which is seen elsewhere only in putative ACPSs from B. melitensis (38DelVecchio V.G. Kapatral V. Redkar R.J. Patra G. Mujer C. Los T. Ivanova N. Anderson I. Bhattacharyya A. Lykidis A. Reznik G."
https://openalex.org/W2170695098,"This is the first report succeeding in the isolation and characterization of an enzyme and its gene involved in the phosphorylation of a steroid hormone. It has been demonstrated that ecdysteroid 22-phosphates in insect ovaries, which are physiologically inactive, serve as a “reservoir” that supplies active free ecdysteroids during early embryonic development and that their dephosphorylation is catalyzed by a specific enzyme, ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase (Yamada, R., and Sonobe, H. (2003), J. Biol. Chem. 278, 26365–26373). In this study, ecdysteroid 22-kinase (EcKinase) was purified from the cytosol of the silkworm Bombyx mori ovaries to about 1,800-fold homogeneity in six steps of column chromatography and biochemically characterized. Results obtained indicated that the reciprocal conversion of free ecdysteroids and ecdysteroid 22-phosphates by two enzymes, EcKinase and ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase, plays an important role in ecdysteroid economy of the ovary-egg system of B. mori. On the basis of the partial amino acid sequence obtained from purified EcKinase, the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding EcKinase was determined. The full-length cDNA of EcKinase was composed of 1,850 bp with an open reading frame encoding a protein of 386 amino acid residues. The cloned cDNA was confirmed to encode the functional EcKinase using the transformant harboring the open reading frame of EcKinase. A data base search showed that EcKinase has an amino acid sequence characteristic of phosphotransferases, in that it harbors Brenner's motif and putative ATP binding sites, but there are no functional proteins that share high identity with the amino acid sequence of EcKinase. This is the first report succeeding in the isolation and characterization of an enzyme and its gene involved in the phosphorylation of a steroid hormone. It has been demonstrated that ecdysteroid 22-phosphates in insect ovaries, which are physiologically inactive, serve as a “reservoir” that supplies active free ecdysteroids during early embryonic development and that their dephosphorylation is catalyzed by a specific enzyme, ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase (Yamada, R., and Sonobe, H. (2003), J. Biol. Chem. 278, 26365–26373). In this study, ecdysteroid 22-kinase (EcKinase) was purified from the cytosol of the silkworm Bombyx mori ovaries to about 1,800-fold homogeneity in six steps of column chromatography and biochemically characterized. Results obtained indicated that the reciprocal conversion of free ecdysteroids and ecdysteroid 22-phosphates by two enzymes, EcKinase and ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase, plays an important role in ecdysteroid economy of the ovary-egg system of B. mori. On the basis of the partial amino acid sequence obtained from purified EcKinase, the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding EcKinase was determined. The full-length cDNA of EcKinase was composed of 1,850 bp with an open reading frame encoding a protein of 386 amino acid residues. The cloned cDNA was confirmed to encode the functional EcKinase using the transformant harboring the open reading frame of EcKinase. A data base search showed that EcKinase has an amino acid sequence characteristic of phosphotransferases, in that it harbors Brenner's motif and putative ATP binding sites, but there are no functional proteins that share high identity with the amino acid sequence of EcKinase. In steroid metabolism, it is generally accepted that cytochrome P450-mediated reaction, referred to as phase I metabolism, converts hydrophobic compounds into more polar metabolites, whereas phase II metabolism involves an adduct formation via a conjugation reaction. Phase II metabolism, such as sulfation, glucuronidation, and fatty acyl esterification, leads to a change of polarity or to a charge modification of the given metabolite, thereby modulating biological activity or facilitating elimination. In mammals, the sulfation pathway can be thought of as a reversible process, comprising two enzyme systems: the sulfotransferases, which catalyze the sulfation reaction, and the sulfatases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate esters formed by the action of sulfotransferases. Much is now known concerning the function of these enzyme systems as well as the molecular structure of the relevant cDNA and genes comprising these systems (1Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M.

Ecdysteroids, which include the arthropod molting hormone, mediate a wide variety of developmental and reproductive events in insects (5Hagedorn H.H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 8. Pergamon, Oxford1985: 205-262Google Scholar). During the larval and pupal stages, ecdysteroids are synthesized in steroidogenic glands, known as the prothoracic glands (6Rybcznski R. Gilbert L.I. Iatrou K. Gill S.S. Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science. 3. Elsevier BV., Amsterdam2005: 61-123Google Scholar). The detailed ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway constituted by phase I metabolism is not fully clarified, but cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyzing the last four steps of the biosynthesis of 20-hydroxyecdysone (the principal molting hormone of arthropods) (i.e. CYP306a1 (25-hydroxylase), CYP302a1 (22-hydroxylase), CYP315a1 (2-hydroxylase), and CYP314a1 (20-hydroxylase)), have been identified and characterized in Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, and Aedes aeypti (7Chavez V.M.

The ovaries of most insect species have the capacity to accumulate ecdysteroid phosphates, which are physiologically inactive (21Makka T. Seino A. Tomita S. Fujiwara H. Sonobe H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2002; 51: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), in addition to the capacity to synthesize free ecdysteroids de novo (22Kappler C. Goltzene F. Lagueux M.

Sci. 1999; 16: 935-943Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the ecdystreoid phosphates that are accumulated in the ovaries are transferred to the eggs and function as a source of active free ecdysteroid before the prothoracic glands differentiate during embryonic development (24Lafont R. Koolman J. Hoffmann J.A. Porchet M. Biosynthesis and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer, Berlin1984: 196-226Google Scholar, 25Hoffmann J.A. Lagueux M. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I.

Recently, in B. mori eggs, a novel enzyme ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase (EPPase) 3The abbreviations used are: EPPase, ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase; EcKinase, ecdysteroid 22-kinase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; EST, expressed sequence tag. 3The abbreviations used are: EPPase, ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase; EcKinase, ecdysteroid 22-kinase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; EST, expressed sequence tag. (Fig. 1), which is specifically involved in dephosphorylation of ecdysteroid phosphates, was isolated, characterized, and revealed to be a vital enzyme that may control the “on/off switch” of embryonic development (27Yamada R. Sonobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26365-26373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Yamada R. Yamahama Y. Sonobe H. Zool.

The discovery of EPPase in B. mori eggs emphasizes the physiological significance of phase II phosphorylation reaction in the ovary-egg system of insects. However, detailed characterization of enzymes involved in the formation of ecdysteroid phosphates has not been carried out, although the occurrence of enzyme activity has been reported in the ovaries of Schistocereca gregaria (30Kabbouh M. Rees H.H. Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 57-64Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and B. mori (31Takahashi S.Y. Okamoto K. Sonobe H. Kamba M. Ohnishi E. Zool. Sci. 1992; 9: 169-174Google Scholar). We now report the purification, kinetic characterization, and cDNA cloning of an enzyme responsible for phosphorylation at the C-22 position of ecdysteroids in the mature oocytes of B. mori, named as ecdysteroid 22-kinase (EcKinase) (Fig. 1), and show that EcKinase belongs to a novel kinase family. Experimental Animals—The pupae of a hybrid race (kinshu x showa) of the silkworm B. mori, which have been programmed to lay diapause eggs (diapause egg-producing pupae), were mainly employed. In order to obtain pupae programmed to lay nondiapause eggs (nondiapause egg-producing pupae), the subesophageal ganglion, the source of diapause hormone, was removed soon after larval-pupal ecdysis (32Fukuda S. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1951; 27: 672-677Crossref Google Scholar, 33Sonobe H. Ohnishi E. Dev. Growth Differ. 1970; 12: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pupal-adult ecdysis in both types of pupae took place 12–13 days after the larval-pupal ecdysis at 23–24 °C. There was no appreciable difference in the growth rate of ovaries between both types of pupae. Chemicals—[23,24-3H]Ecdysone (2,112 GBq/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone were purchased from Sigma. Ecdysone 22-phosphate was synthesized chemically (34Yamada R. Sonobe M. Tatara A. Fujimoto Y. Sonobe H. Keller R. Dircksen H. Sedlmeier D. Vaudry H. Conference of European Comparative Endcrinologists. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy2002: 179-183Google Scholar). Other ecdysteroids, 2-deoxyecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, 22-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone, and 2,22-dideoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone, were extracted from B. mori ovaries and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as described previously (35Ohnishi E. Mizuno T. Ikekawa N. Ikeda T. Insect Biochem. 1981; 11: 55-159Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Ohnishi E. Hiramoto M. Fujimoto Y. Kakinuma K. Ikekawa N.

Preparation of Enzyme Solution—All operations were carried out at ∼4 °C. For subcellular fractionation, mature ovaries were excised from adult moths in insect Ringer's solution, and their chorions were removed using tweezers in a small volume of homogenization buffer: 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin. The ooplasm obtained did not contain follicle cells and nurse cells as observed by light microscopy. The ooplasm was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The resultant pellet (yolk granule fraction) was washed again with the same buffer solution and centrifuged, and the pellet was used as the yolk granule fraction. The supernatant was combined, homogenized, and used for differential centrifugation, the procedure of which is essentially the same as that described in our previous paper (38Horike N. Sonobe H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The homogenate was first centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The next resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The yolk granule fraction, 1,000 × g pellet, 10,000 × g pellet, 150,000 × g pellet, and the lipid layer obtained from centrifugation at 10,000 × g were sonicated in a small volume of homogenization buffer to an emulsion state. These emulsions and the final 150,000 × g supernatant (cytosol) were used for the enzyme assay. To determine changes in enzyme activity during ovarian development, ovaries during pupal-adult development were dissected and homogenized with ∼5 volumes of the homogenization buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged immediately at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was used as the enzyme source. For enzyme purification, mature ovaries (450 g) from diapause egg-producing pupae were employed. The ovaries were ground using an agate mortar in ∼2 volumes of homogenization buffer, and the homogenate was filtered through gauze to remove chorions. The filtrate was further homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The resultant supernatant was applied to column chromatography (see below). Enzyme Assay—The activity of ecdysone 22-kinase, which was subsequently named EcKinase (see “Results”), was measured using [3H]ecdysone as the substrate. The standard assay system for ecdysone 22-kinase activity contains the following in 100 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin: 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 740 Bq of [3H]ecdysone, and enzyme solution. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme solution, the reaction mixture was incubated at 35 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of methanol. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water and applied to a C18 cartridge (Varian). After washing with 4 ml of distilled water to remove ATP and any salts, ecdysteroids were eluted with 6 ml of methanol. The ecdysteroid fraction was dried, and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of 70% (v/v) chloroform/methanol and applied to a silicic acid cartridge (Varian). After washing with 5 ml of 70% chloroform/methanol to remove unreacted [3H]ecdysone, [3H]ecdysone 22-phosphate was eluted with 6 ml of 80% (v/v) methanol/water. The radioactivity of the [3H]ecdysone 22-phosphate fraction was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-5101; Aloka) to quantify ecdysone 22-phosphate formed. The recovery of radioactivity throughout the entire procedure was more than 90%. For the characterization of substrate specificity of ecdysone 22-kinase, 20-hydroxyecdysone, 2-deoxyecdysone, 2-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone, 22-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone, and 2,22-dideoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone were used in addition to ecdysone. Enzyme activity was assayed using the standard assay system for ecdysone 22-kinase activity by substituting the above mentioned ecdysteroids (20 μm) for the usual substrate, [3H]ecdysone. Following HPLC (see below), the reaction products were monitored at 254 nm and quantified using an on-line integrator D-2500 (Hitachi). The relative activity of the enzyme was expressed by defining the amount of ecdysone 22-phosphate produced in the control assay as 100%. For the identification of the products of enzyme reactions, the ecdysteroid phosphate fraction was divided into two portions. One portion was used to compare retention times with those of authentic ecdysteroid phosphates by HPLC (see below). The remainder was used in EPPase hydrolysis; the retention times of free ecdysteroids liberated after EPPase hydrolysis were compared with those of authentic free ecdysteroids. A competition assay was performed by adding ecdysteroids at a concentration of 100 μm as a competitor into the standard assay system. The radioactivity of [3H]ecdysone 22-phosphate produced was compared with the control without the competitor. The inhibitory effect was expressed as a percentage of control. The activity of the recombinant EcKinase was measured using the standard assay system by substituting 20 μm ecdysone for the usual substrate, [3H]ecdysone. The ecdysteroid fraction in the reaction mixture was applied to HPLC (see below), and the effluent was monitored at 254 nm. Protein Assay—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215535) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol with bovine serum albumin as a standard. HPLC Analysis of Ecdysteroids—Ecdysteroid phosphates and free ecdysteroids liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis (see below) were identified using HPLC (LC-10A system; Shimazu) equipped with a reverse-phase column (4.6 × 250 mm; Wakosil 5C18; Wako, Japan). The column was eluted with a 50- or 60-min linear gradient of methanol in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, changing from 0 to 70% (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40°. Quantification of Ecdysteroid Phosphates in Ovaries—Ecdysteroids were extracted from ovarian homogenate by adding 4 volumes of methanol, and ecdysteroid phosphates were separated from free ecdysteroids as described previously (37Kamba M. Mamiya Y. Sonobe H. Fujimoto Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 395-402Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To enhance the sensitivity to radioimmunoassay using the antiserum N6 (40Nakatsuji T. Sonobe H. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2004; 135: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), ecdysteroid phosphates were hydrolyzed to free ecdysteroids, using a digestive enzyme preparation from Helix pomatia (see below). The radioimmunoassay was conducted as described previously (41Sonobe H. Kamba M. Ohta K. Ikeda M. Naya Y. Experientia. 1991; 47: 948-952Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ecdysteroid quantity was expressed in terms of ecdysone equivalents. Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Ecdysteroid Phosphates—Ecdysteroid phosphates were hydrolyzed to free ecdysteroids by recombinant EPPase (27Yamada R. Sonobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26365-26373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or the H. pomatia digestive enzyme preparation (Nakarai Tesque). The former specifically catalyzes the dephosphorylation of ecdysteroid 22-phosphate, whereas the latter contains nonspecific phosphatase activity. The procedures of each enzymatic hydrolysis have been described previously (27Yamada R. Sonobe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26365-26373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Yamada R. Yamahama Y. Sonobe H. Zool.

Purification Procedures of Ecdysone 22-Kinase—All of the purification procedures were carried out at ∼4 °C. An aliquot of the 150,000 × g supernatant prepared from mature ovaries (see “Preparation of Enzyme Solution”) was loaded onto a blue Sepharose 6 FF column (26 × 75 mm; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. Stepwise elution was performed using the same buffer, containing 2 m KCl at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The active fraction was applied to a chelating Sepharose FF column (26 × 75 mm; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 m KCl. Stepwise elution was performed using the same buffer, containing 100 mm histidine at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The active fraction was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (26 × 600 mm; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The active fraction was concentrated to about 50-fold, and the buffer was changed to 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.). The enzyme solution was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 0–100 mm NaCl in the same buffer for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fraction was concentrated to about 100-fold, and the buffer was changed to 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. The enzyme solution was applied to a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (Type 1, 7 × 52 mm; Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5. Elution was performed by changing the equilibration buffer linearly to 200 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fraction was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and applied again to the Mono Q HR 5/5 column pre-equilibrated with 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of 0–100 mm NaCl for 45 min. The purity was analyzed using HPLC equipped with a reverse-phase column (CAPCELL PACK C18, 2 × 250 mm; Shiseido Fine Chemicals) pre-equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed using a 30-min linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C. The effluent was monitored at 280 nm. The purity was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using a 10% gel. Several standard proteins (e.g. myosin (205 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa)) were used to estimate the molecular mass of purified ecdysone 22-kinase. The proteins were visualized by silver staining. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—In order to analyze the internal amino acid sequence of purified ecdysone 22-kinase, 500 pmol of purified enzyme were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested with lysylen-dopeptidase. The resultant peptides were applied to reverse-phase HPLC using a TSK gel ODS-80Ts (2.0 × 250 mm; TOSOH) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a 90-min linear gradient of 0–90% acetonitrile in 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Among the peptides obtained, four peptides, named K54, K71, K75-1, and K75-2, were applied to an amino acid sequencer (see below), and one peptide, named K94, was digested again with trypsin. The digests were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Symmetry C18 column (1.0 × 150 mm; Waters) pre-equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed with a 100-min linear gradient of 2–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. Two fragments obtained, named K94-T1 and K94-T2, were applied to an amino acid sequencer. All amino acid sequence analyses were performed using a Procise 494 cLC protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). Isolation of EcKinase cDNA—The 12–40-h-old diapause eggs of strain p50T were collected, and total RNA was prepared using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Construction of the full-length cDNA library, named fdpe, was carried out by Hitachi Instruments Service Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Sequences from the 5′-end of each cDNA were determined, and the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were compiled into a local data base. One EST clone, which is expected to encode the amino acid sequences of six peptides obtained from purified EcKinase, was searched by means of standard BLAST analysis, and the full length of its nucleotide sequence was determined. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—Total RNA was prepared from mature ovaries by the same method as described above. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification Kit (Clontech) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Two gene-specific primers, R1 (5′-TCGGTGTCGTACACGCTGTTGATG-3′) and R2 (5′-CATGAGGTTGCAGGTCCTGTAGTC-3′), were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of one EST clone, named fdpeP12_F_I09. The 5′-end of EcKinase cDNA was amplified by two rounds of PCR. In the first PCR, amplification was performed with R2 and a 5′-adapter primer, UPM (Clontech), using the first-strand cDNA as a template. PCR was carried out as follows: first denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; five cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 2 min; five cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 66 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 2 min; and final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. In the second round of PCR, amplification was performed with R1 and a 5′-nested adapter primer, NUP (Clontech), using PCR product obtained in the first PCR as a template. The following program was used for PCR amplification: first denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; five cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 68 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 2 min; five cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 66 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 2 min; 20 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 2 min; and final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Detection of EcKinase Transcript—Total RNA was prepared from mature ovaries and 72-h-old diapause eggs according to the same methods as described above. Each first-strand cDNA was synthesized with random hexamer using Ready-to-Go RT-PCR Beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were designed to detect the expression of EcKinase and elongation factor 2 as an internal control: F1 (5′-AAGCACTGGTGCTGGAGGACCTG-3′) and R3 (5′-TGCTGGCTCCTGTCATCCACTATC-3′) for EcKinase, EF2-F (5′-GTCGTACCGTGAGACCGTAGCTG-3′) and EF2-R (5′-CAATGTCCTCTGGCAGACCATCAG-3′) for elongation factor 2. The first strand cDNA was used as templates, and each PCR amplification was conducted by the following program: first denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s; 45 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 64 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; and final extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s. PCR products were electrophoresed by an 1.5% agarose gel and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Construction of the EcKinase Expression Plasmid—In order to avoid the artificial effects of additional sequences, such as His tag and/or some epitope tags, which are encoded in commercial expression plasmids, on biological activity of the recombinant enzyme, we constructed the expression plasmid to express the whole open reading frame of EcKinase without artificial sequences according to the following strategy. The forward primer (EF, 5′-AAGCTTGACATGACGGACACCGAGGAGCG-3′) contained the HindIII site (italicized in the primer sequence) and 23 residues (nucleotide positions 29–51 in Fig. 10), including the initiation Met codon (boldfaced in the primer sequence). The reverse primer (ER, 5′-GAATTCTCAGATGAGACCCCAGCGGACGT-3′) contained the EcoRI site (italicized in the primer sequence) and 23 residues (nucleotide positions 1,170–1,192 in Fig. 10), including the stop codon (boldfaced in the primer sequence). Using these primers, PCR was conducted with the EST clone, fdpeP12_F_I09, as the template. The amplified cDNA insert was subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO plasmids (Invitrogen), and the sequence fidelity was confirmed. Subsequently, the insert was released from pCR2.1-TOPO by HindIII/EcoRI digestion and then ligated into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the expression plasmid pIB/V5-His (Invitrogen).

The bimodal transport of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (MT), reported previously by us, likely represents one mode of non-canonical protein targeting to MT. Herein, we have studied the mechanism of mouse MT-CYP1A1 targeting to gain insight into the regulatory features and evolutionary conservation of bimodal targeting mechanism. Mouse MT-CYP1A1 consists of two NH2-terminal-truncated molecular species, +91A1 and +331A1. Mutations Pro-2 → Leu and Tyr-5 → Leu, which increase the signal recognition particle (SRP) binding, diminished MT targeting of the protein in intact cells. By contrast, mutations Leu-7 → Asn and Leu-17 → Asn, which decreased SRP-binding affinity, enhanced MT targeting, thus suggesting that SRP binding is an important regulatory step that modulates bimodal targeting. Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of nascent chains at Thr-35 vastly decreased affinity for SRP binding suggesting an important regulatory step. In support of these results, COS cell transfection experiments show that phosphomimetic mutation Thr-35 → Asp or induced cellular PKC caused increased CYP1A1 targeting to MT and correspondingly lower levels to the endoplasmic reticulum. Results suggest evolutionary conservation of chimeric signals and bimodal targeting of CYP1A1 in different species. The mouse MT-CYP1A1 is an extrinsic membrane protein, which exhibited high FDX1 plus FDXR-mediated N-demethylation of a number of tricyclic antidepressants, pain killers, anti-psychotics, and narcotics that are poor substrates for microsomal CYP1A1.

Recent studies from our laboratory showed that different xenobiotic-inducible CYPs such as rat CYP1A1, CYP2E1, and CYP2B1 and others that are widely recognized as microsomal proteins (MC-CYPs) are also targeted to varying degrees to mitochondria (9Addya S.

These studies led to the concept of a new family of chimeric non-canonical-targeting signals, which function both as ER-targeting and MT-targeting signals, under different physiological conditions. We proposed that bimodal targeting of these CYP proteins is facilitated by the cryptic MT-targeting signal domain (residues 29-40), located between the transmembrane helical domain (residues 1-30) and the Pro-rich domain (residues 39-44) in various members of the CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 families. We have also shown that the cryptic MT-targeting signals of different CYPs are activated by two distinct mechanisms: (a) endoproteolytic cleavage of the NH2-terminal 4th and 32nd amino acids of the protein by a cytosolic endoprotease, which exposes the MT-targeting signal, as reported for rat CYP1A1 (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and (b) protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of the nascent chains at Ser-128 in CYP2B1 or Ser-129 in CYP2E1, which activates the cryptic MT-targeting signal. Activation of a cryptic signal by either of the two mechanisms causes vastly diminished ER targeting, increased MT targeting, increased affinity of the nascent protein for binding to cytosolic HSP70/HSP90 chaperones, and increased binding to the mitochondrial outer-membrane and inner-membrane translocator proteins, TOM and TIM, respectively (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

However, the precise mechanism, by which CYP and amyloid precursor proteins that are normally translated on the ER-bound ribosomes end up in the soluble protein pool and become candidates for MT translocation, remains unclear. In the present study we have purified and characterized MT-CYP1A1 from livers of BNF-treated mice with three specific objectives: (a) to study the factors that regulate SRP binding to nascent chains and proteolytic processing of CYP1A1 for bimodal targeting to the ER and MT; (b) to provide further supporting evidence for our hypothesis on the occurrence of chimeric signals that drive the bimodal protein targeting; and (c) to determine the evolutionary conservation of the endoproteolytic-processing mechanism for the activation of the cryptic MT-targeting signal in another animal besides the rat. Our results show that the mouse MT-CYP1A1 is truncated just beyond the 8th and 32nd amino acids and the processing site close to residue 32 is conserved in many species. Mutational analysis indicates that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of a newly identified target site at Thr-35 not only modulates SRP-binding affinity of nascent chains but also determines the level of ER or MT targeting of CYP1A1. The nascent polypeptide pool that escapes SRP binding essentially becomes the substrate for endoprotease processing and activation of cryptic mitochondrial-targeting signal. The results also show that mouse MT-CYP1A1 actively metabolizes erythromycin, as well as a number of psychotropic drugs, including anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anesthetics in an FDX1 plus FDXR-supported system, thus exhibiting substrate specificity quite distinct from the full-length MC-CYP1A1 (ER-associated). Treatment of Animals and Tissue Fractionation—All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of vertebrate animals. Swiss-Webster mice (30 g, Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc., Indianapolis, IN) received intraperitoneal injections of BNF (80 mg/kg body weight in corn oil) once daily for 5-10 days, as described (12Niranjan B.G. Wilson N.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12495-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control mice received equivalent volumes of corn oil. Animals were killed by CO2 asphyxiation 24 h after the last injection and perfused transcardially with ice-cold saline. The livers were then rapidly removed and rinsed with saline, and the liver mitochondria were isolated as described before (12Niranjan B.G. Wilson N.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12495-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were homogenized in 10 volumes of sucrose-mannitol buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin). Mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation were sedimented through a discontinuous sucrose gradient (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), washed twice, and resuspended in the above buffer at a concentration of 45-50 mg/ml. In some experiments, mitochondria were treated with digitonin (Calbiochem) at a final concentration of 75 μg/mg of protein at 4 °C. The resultant mitoplast pellet was washed twice and resuspended in sucrose-mannitol buffer containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purity of the mitochondrial preparation was checked routinely by assaying the marker enzyme activities and by immunoblot analysis, as described before (13Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CYP content of mitoplasts was measured by the sodium dithionite-reduced CO-binding difference spectrum (15Matsubara T. Koike M. Touchi A. Tochino Y. Sugeno K. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 76: 596-603Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar) in a buffer system containing 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% sodium cholate (w/v), and 0.06% Triton N-101 (v/v). Solubilization and Purification of Mouse Liver MT-CYP1A1—Mitoplasts were suspended in 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, at a final concentration of 20 mg of protein/ml and sonicated for 3 min (30-s pulse followed by 60 s of standing on ice) at setting 6 of a Branson sonifier. CYP protein was solubilized by adding sodium cholate to a final concentration of 0.5% and fractionated with PEG, as described previously (16Raza H. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9533-9541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 0-20% PEG precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was suspended in 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% sodium cholate. The proteins were dissolved by homogenization with a glass homogenizer, followed by stirring the suspension for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized protein fraction (10 mg of protein/ml) was subjected to OAA column chromatography, as described (16Raza H. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9533-9541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was first washed until the A280 of the eluant reached <0.05, and the protein bound to the column was eluted successively with ten column volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton N-101. Fractions rich in CYP (>0.1 A at 417 nm) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through Amicon filters. The concentrated samples were dialyzed overnight against three changes of buffer containing 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.7, 20% glycerol, 0.5% sodium cholate, and 0.06% Triton N-101, and subjected to further purification by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (16Raza H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10705-10713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified using a 5′ primer containing a HindIII site and a 3′ primer containing an XbaI site, cloned into the pCMV4 mammalian expression vector and the pGEM7zf bacterial plasmid vector. Deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification of specific cDNA regions and cloning into the appropriate vectors. The various point mutations at the ER-targeting and MT-targeting signal domains were generated by overlap PCR. All constructs were engineered to contain an ATG codon preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence, as previously described (18Kozak M.

In vitro translation products were generated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of added [35S]Met (40 μCi/50 μl reaction, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The import assays were carried out in 200-μl final volumes using 100 μg of mitochondrial protein, as described before (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J.

Mitochondrial proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 75 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and fluorography. Transient Transfection of COS Cells with CYP1A1 cDNAs—Various cDNAs cloned in pCMV4 vector were transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGENE 6, a non-liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Cells from 10 plates (100 mm), after 60-70 h of transfection, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4) plus 150 mm NaCl) and homogenized in the Sucrose-Mannitol buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture, with a Teflon-fitted glass homogenizer (∼40 strokes). Isolation of mitochondria by differential centrifugation and further purification by sucrose density banding, as well as isolation of microsomes, were described before (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G.

Isolation of Rat Cytoplasmic Fraction Rich in Endoprotease—Rat liver cytoplasmic fraction was isolated by homogenization of tissue slices in sucrose-mannitol buffer and differential centrifugation as described above. The cytosolic fraction (120,000 × g supernatant) was adjusted to 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and subjected to (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Protein precipitating between 30 and 50% (NH4)2SO4 saturation was dissolved in 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) containing 15 mm NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer. Insolubles were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 20% with glycerol and stored in aliquots in -75 °C. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis of Proteins—Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis, as described (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). In some experiments, proteins were also subjected to high resolution gradient (10-16%) SDS-PAGE, for resolving different CYP1A1 forms, as described (9Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The conditions of protein blotting and immunodetection of protein bands were as described (13Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against purified rat liver mitochondrial CYP1A1 or mouse monoclonal CYP1A1 (Amersham Biosciences), were used. Protein estimation was carried out by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoblots were stripped and redeveloped with antibodies to microsome specific marker proteins (calreticulin or POR) and mitochondria specific marker proteins (TIM 44 or cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CcO1) for assessing loading levels and also the extent of cross-contamination. NH2-terminal Sequencing—The DEAE-Sepharose-purified CYP1A1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10-16% gradient and transblotted to Sequi-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The amino acid sequencing was carried out by the phenylthiohydantoin derivatization procedure in a Beckman LH 3600 gas-phase sequencer. Immunoprecipitation of Proteins—Partially purified MT- and MC-CYP1A1 (15 μg each) and total MC or MT protein from 10 days of BNF-induced livers (200 μg each) solubilized in 1.5% sodium cholate were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with the CYP-1A1 antibody (3 μg) in final volumes of 200-400 μl. The immune complexes were collected onto Protein A-Agarose beads and washed extensively (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were extracted from the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer devoid of β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE for further analysis. Protease Protection Assay—Freshly isolated mitochondria and microsomes were subjected to Pronase digestion as described (13Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J.

Mitochondria and microsomes were suspended at 10 mg of protein/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and subjected to trypsin digestion (30 μg/mg of protein) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10× molar excess of trypsin inhibitor and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. Membrane Integration Assay—Extraction of mitochondrial and microsomal proteins with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11), separation of soluble and insoluble protein fractions, and immunoblot analysis of proteins were carried out as described (13Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5898-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in the presence of 2 units of unwashed canine pancreatic ER membranes/25 μl of reaction (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G.

Reactions were stopped by adding 1 mm cycloheximide, and membranes were extracted with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH11) for 1 h on ice and fractionated into soluble (200,000 × g supernatant) and insoluble membrane (200,000 × g pellet) fractions, as described (23Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both the membrane pellet and the soluble protein fractions were resuspended in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7) containing 2% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the cDNA constructs as described above. The cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde 60 h post-transfection and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with primary CYP1A1 (anti-rabbit) and CcO1 (anti-mouse) antibodies at 1:100 dilutions each, for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then labeled with 1:100 dilution of Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse goat IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), respectively (1:100 dilution each). Coverslips were washed repeatedly with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound antibodies and were mounted on slides using Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Slides were viewed through a Zeiss Meta 510 confocal microscope. Metabolism of Xenobiotic Substrates—The N-demethylation of various substrates was measured by assaying the rate of formaldehyde formation (24Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 25Boopathi E. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Fang J.K. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34415-34423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reactions with mitoplasts and microsomes were carried out in 500-μl final volumes in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μg of mitochondrial or microsomal protein, and 100 μm substrate. Purified FDX1 (0.1-0.2 nm) plus FDXR (0.01-0.02 nm) were added in some reactions with mitoplast preparations, as indicated. Reconstitution of enzyme activity with purified MT-CYP1A1 was carried out essentially as described before (16Raza H. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9533-9541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in dilauryl-phosphatidylcholine vesicles, using the same buffer system described above for intact membranes. The final reaction volume was 200 μl, and contained 50 pmol of CYP, 0.2 nmol of FDX1, 0.02 nmol of FDXR, or 0.1 nmol of POR and 100 μm substrate. After 3 min of preincubation at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADPH, and the reaction was continued at 37 °C for another 20 min in a shaking water bath. Reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 volume of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v). The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at room temperature. An aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of Nash reagent (250 or 100 μl) and further incubated at 55 °C for 15 min. The reaction product, formaldehyde, was measured according to the method of Nash (24Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). A notable drawback of this assay is a generally high background value, which can be controlled by using freshly prepared Nash reagent and limiting the heating step during color development to 55 °C for 15 min. Typically, we obtained A412 values in the range of 0.01-0.014 for control samples without added enzyme, and all significant N-demethylation activities reported here correspond to >3.5-fold of this background reading. Localization of NH2-terminal Truncated Forms of CYP1A1 in Mouse Liver Mitochondria—Localization of CYP1A1 in BNF-treated mouse liver mitochondria was ascertained by limited protease digestion of MT and MC preparations. Immunoblot in Fig. 1A shows that both MT and MC from untreated mouse liver contain undetectable CYP1A1. These same fractions from 10 days of BNF-treated mouse livers show a distinct 54-kDa band. Quantification of immunoblots indicates that the MT-CYP1A1 content at this stage of BNF induction is ∼20-25% more than the MC-CYP1A1 content (results not shown). Fig. 1A also shows that the MT-CYP1A1 is relatively r"
https://openalex.org/W2012681252,"Recently, we identified constitutively activating mutations at positions Asp-403, Glu-404, and Asn-406 in the third extracellular cysteine box (C-b3) of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. We hypothesized that this region could act as a molecular interface between the extracellular and serpentine domain. In this study we present a model for properties of potential interaction partners for this region. Moreover, we show that Pro-400 and Pro-407 adjacent to this epitope are also important for stabilizing the partially active, basal conformation of the wild-type (WT) thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. Furthermore, the mutation K291A in the second extracellular cysteine box (C-b2) was identified as a new constitutively activating mutation that releases the basal conformation of the WT receptor like the known tryptic cleavage in its close vicinity. Taken together, we provide an activation scenario at the C-b2/C-b3 unit. Three anchor fragments (anchors I-III) most likely constrain the basal conformation. The three anchor fragments are tightly packed. A disulfide bridge holds the C-b2/C-b3 portions in close positions. Independent of the type of conformational interference such as side chain modifications, tryptic cleavage, or hormone stimulation that act on the constrained C-b2/C-b3 WT conformation, it will always release one of the anchor fragments. Subsequently, this results in a conformational displacement of the C-b2/C-b3 portions relative to each other, inducing receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1966739833,"To decipher the global network of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated signaling pathway, a large scale proteomic analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was conducted. Here, we focus on characterizing a novel protein, CFBP (CIN85/CD2AP family binding protein), identified in the study. CFBP was found to be phosphorylated at tyrosine 204 upon EGF stimulation, and the CIN85/CD2AP family was identified as a binding partner. A proline-rich motif of CFBP is recognized by one of the three Src-homology 3 domains of CIN85/CD2AP, and the affinity of the interaction is regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of CFBP. They co-localize in actinenriched structures, and overexpression of CFBP induced morphological changes with actin reorganization. Furthermore, CFBP accelerated the EGF receptor's down-regulation by facilitating the recruitment of Cbl to the CD2AP/CIN85 complex. Two spliced variants of CFBP lacking either exon 5 or 8 are also expressed, and the variant lacking exon 5 without the proline-rich motif lacks the ability to bind to the CIN85/CD2AP family. The CFBP protein seems to play a key role in the ligand-mediated internalization and down-regulation of the EGF receptor.

Proteomics is a powerful tool for discovering a whole range of protein molecules involved in specific biological phenomena. In the field of growth factor receptors, which are often directly linked to disease, many groups have applied the technique to identify novel molecules and posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, involved in the signaling pathway downstream of the receptors (1Aebersold R. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5630) Google Scholar). To obtain a complete picture of the growth factor receptor-mediated signaling pathways, it is not only necessary to understand the cellular signal transduction networks, but it is also important to develop more effective and safer drugs against signaling-related disease. The EGF 3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; SH3, Src homology 3; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. receptor is well known for being involved in the generation or development of various human cancers, and its antagonists have been used to develop effective drugs for cancer (2Hynes N.E. Lane H.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). The signaling network downstream of the EGF receptor has been studied extensively in the pre- and post-genomic era; several groups have applied the proteomic approach and have found many new connections to known proteins as well as identifying new molecules (3Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 4Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M.

Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 356-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The strategy of these proteomic studies features the same approach; anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was used to isolate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from EGF-stimulated cell lysates, and the isolated proteins separated and visualized by SDS-PAGE were identified by mass spectrometry combined with a data base search. The identified proteins can be considered to be either tyrosine-phosphorylated themselves or bound to the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The site of phosphorylation can then be analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (6Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6587-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). More recently, Rush et al. (4Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) have reported a new approach in which total protein is first digested with protease, and tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides rather than proteins are isolated by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Although this approach enables the identification of a much larger number of tyrosine-phosphorylated sites, non-phosphorylated proteins forming complexes with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins escape detection. Since not only protein phosphorylation but also protein-protein interactions play important roles in signaling (7Johnson S.A. Hunter T. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the conventional approach in which the signaling complexes are isolated should bring additional knowledge about the component proteins. In fact, adaptor proteins in growth factor receptor-mediated signaling play key roles, serving as scaffold proteins for recruiting essential partners to the appropriate complex (8Szymkiewicz I. Shupliakov O. Dikic I. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and such protein-protein interactions are often regulated by protein phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications (9Yamauchi E. Nakatsu T. Matsubara M. Kato H. Taniguchi H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Matsubara M. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Taniguchi H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To obtain a more complete picture of the growth factor signaling, it will be of prime importance to analyze both the secondary modifications and the interacting proteins. In the present study, we have reanalyzed the protein complex isolated by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The main differences are the use of the combination of different antibodies, scale-up of the amount of samples analyzed, and application of the newest sensitive mass spectrometric analyses. This strategy has enabled us to detect not only the major component proteins but also the less abundant proteins that are not visible even in silver-stained gels. We have currently identified over 150 polypeptides as downstream molecules of the EGF receptor, which include both well known and previously unknown proteins in this signaling pathway. Understanding the function of each novel protein will make it possible to better understand the remaining steps in the pathway. In this report, we have selected a novel protein containing no known functional domains. This protein composed of 273 amino acid residues is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation. During the screening of binding partners to the protein, we identified CD2AP (CD2-associated protein), which contains several structural domains involved in protein-protein interactions. CD2AP has been known as a key regulator maintaining the integrity of kidney glomerular filtration and cytoskeletal polarization in T cells (11Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S.

Winkler C.A. Kopp J.B. Miner J.H. Unanue E.R. Shaw A.S. Science. 2003; 300: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). A protein structurally related to CD2AP, CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa), was identified as a scaffold protein that functions to down-regulate the growth factor receptor in cooperation with proto-oncogene product Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (13Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We report here that CFBP interacts and co-localizes with CIN85/CD2AP family proteins and functions as a key component in EGF receptor internalization and down-regulation mediated by the CIN85-Cbl complex. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7, HeLa, human embryonic kidney HEK293, HEK293T, and A431 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. For maintaining the NIH3T3 cells, 10% calf serum was used in substitution of fetal bovine serum. Transfection of a plasmid into COS7, HeLa, or HEK293T cells was carried out by electroporation using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad). For establishing a stable cell line of A431, transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Before EGF stimulation, cells cultured for 48 h after transfection were serum-starved for 16 h, and 50 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) dissolved in serum free medium was added. cDNA Cloning and Vector Constructions—For cloning of the CFBP cDNA, the HeLa cDNA library was screened by PCR with two primers (HindIII 5′-ATGGATCCCGTACCCGGG-3′ and EcoRI 5′-CTATGAGACGCTGGGGGGCAG-3′), which were designed based on the sequence (gi|24308440) in the NCBI data base. Full-length human CD2AP and EGF receptor cDNAs were cloned from the HeLa cDNA library by PCR. The amplified products were first subcloned into a TOPO™ TA cloning vector, pCR®2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI Prism 3100-Avant genetic analyzer. The EGF receptor cDNA was inserted into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). CFBP and CD2AP cDNAs were subcloned into a pCMV-FLAG6a (Sigma) expression vector in frame and expressed as FLAG-tagged protein with the tag at the N terminus. Human FLAG-tagged CIN85 construct was provided by Dr. I. Dikic (University of Hospital of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Germany) and Dr. S. Kajigaya (National Institutes of Health). The DNA fragments of CFBP, CD2AP, and CIN85 used for the construction of deletion mutants were made by using PCR or suitable restriction enzyme digests. After checking their DNA sequences, the constructs were subcloned into a pCMV-FLAG6 series vector to express as N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins into a pGEX4T vector (Amersham Biosciences) or to express as gultathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins or subcloned into a pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to express as N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins. Point mutations or deletions were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. FLJ00022 cDNA provided by Dr. T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan) was subcloned into pCMV-FLAG6a to express as N-terminal FLAG-tagged protein. Human HA-tagged c-Cbl construct was provided by Dr. J. E. van Leeuwen (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Antibodies—Three kinds of rabbit polyclonal anti-CFBP antibodies were used in this study. Anti-CFBP(His) antibody and anti-CFBP(GST) were raised against a CFBP fragment containing residues 102-213 and 135-273, which were bacterially produced as His-tagged protein using pET vector (Novagen) and GST fusion protein, respectively. Anti-CFBP(C-ter) was raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide, which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal 13 residues of CFBP. These antibodies were purified through HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with each immunizing antigen. Phosphorylation site-specific antiserum was raised against the phosphopeptides having an additional cysteine residue at the amino-terminal end of the amino acid sequence of CFBP: CLRRNDSIpYEASSLY (amino acids 197-210; where pY indicates phosphotyrosine). The phosphopeptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. The phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were purified from antisera by successive column chromatographies with the use of affinity resins coupled with each phosphopeptide and non-phosphopeptide. All CFBP antibodies used in this study were tested for their specificities of use in immunoprecipitation (anti-CFBP(C-ter)), immunoblotting (anti-CFBP(His), anti-CFBP(C-ter), and anti-CFBP(GST)), and immunofluorescence studies (anti-CFBP(His) and anti-CFBP(C-ter)). Other antibodies were obtained commercially from various suppliers: anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), anti-CD2AP antibody (SC-9137; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Cbl antibody (SC-1651; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CIN85 antibody (Calbiochem), anti-EGF receptor antibody (SC-03; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma), and anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—To assess the relative expression levels of CFBP transcripts, a reverse transcription-PCR assay was performed on each panel of eight different human culture cell and tissue cDNAs (human tissue and cell line MTC panel; Clontech) using the following primers: 5′-ATGGATCCCGTACCCGGG-3′ and 5′-CTATGAGACGCTGGGGGGCAG-3′. The normalized cDNA was amplified under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; 30 or 50 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were electro-phoresed in 1.5% agarose gels or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing ethidium bromide. Cloning of the A431 Stable Cell Line—Full-length CFBP cDNA was inserted into a pcDNA3-based N-terminal FLAG-tagged vector (gift from Dr. U. Kikkawa, Kobe University, Japan) in frame. A431 cells were transfected with the empty vector or the resulting plasmid. Cells resistant to G418 were isolated in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 (WAKO) and cloned. Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—The mammalian expression vector pSUPER-Retro-puro (Oligoengine) was used for expression of siRNA in HeLa cells. The targeted sequence of human CFBP was 5′-AAGACAGTGCCTGGATACCTT-3′ (from nucleotide 385 to 405), and a resulting plasmid for knockdown of CFBP was named pSuper-CFBP. The empty pSuper vector was used as a control. Transfection of pEGFP and either pSuper or pSuper-CFBP into HeLa cells was carried out by electroporation. HeLa cells were stably infected with an amphotropic receptor. The packaging cells (AmphoPack™-293 cell line; Clontech), were transfected with the appropriate retroviral RNA interference construct by electroporation. Culture supernatants were collected after 48 h post-transfection and centrifuged. HeLa cells were infected with the viral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) for 12 h, after which the medium was changed. Following infection, cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblot Analysis, and GST Pulldown Assay—The following procedures were carried out at 0-4 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was used as a whole cell lysate. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the whole cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with an appropriate antibody. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added. For the in vitro binding assay by GST pulldown, bacterially expressed GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Then the resulting mixture was rotated at 4 °C for an additional 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. The samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis was carried out with primary antibodies as described in the figure legends. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of FLAG-CFBP and Its Binding Protein—293T cells (1 × 108 cells) transiently expressing FLAG-tagged CFBP were lysed with lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with FLAG affinity gel (50-μl bed volume) (Sigma) for 2 h. The gel was applied to an empty mini-column (Bio-Rad) and washed with lysis buffer several times. FLAG-CFBP was eluted with 45 μl of 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. The eluate was neutralized with 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. All visible bands with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were subjected to MS/MS analysis after in-gel digestion with trypsin. In-gel Digestion with Trypsin—Each gel slice was cut into small pieces and put into a new tube. The gel pieces were destained by rinsing in 50% acetonitrile containing 25 mm NH4HCO3. Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. Gel pieces were washed with 50% acetonitrile and dried in a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac; Thermo Savant). Gel pieces were rehydrated with 15 μl of trypsin solution (10 ng/μl in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 5 mm CaCl2). In-gel digestion was performed at 37 °C overnight. Resulting peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Extracts were dried in a vacuum concentrator and redissolved in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The peptide mixtures obtained were subjected to LC/MS and data-dependent LC/MS/MS analyses. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a Q-Tof-type hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass) interfaced on-line with a capillary high pressure liquid chromatograph (Waters-Micromass modular CapLC, Micromass) (6Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The linear gradient of acetonitrile produced was split at a 1:10 ratio, and a slow flow of ∼100 nl/min was injected into a nano-LC column (PepMap C18, 75 μm × 150 mm; LC Packings). The column eluate was directly injected into a self-constructed nanospray ion source with a tapered stainless capillary. The LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a data-dependent mode; peptide peaks above a certain threshold were subjected automatically to collision-induced dissociation. Peak lists obtained from the MS/MS spectra were used to identify proteins using the Mascot search engine (Matrix science). Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—For expression of the GFP-fused CFBP in cultured cells, the full-length CFBP cDNA was inserted into a pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) in frame. HEK293T, COS7, HeLa, and A431 cells with or without transfection were fixed with 5% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min, and washed with PBS again. Following a blocking step with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, the primary antibodies as described in the figure legends were applied for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa fluorescent dyes (Molecular Probes) for 45 min. If necessary, cells were treated with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and the cell nuclei were stained with 2 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) simultaneously. Finally, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted onto microscope slides with ProLong Antifade reagents (Molecular Probes). Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope using a 40 × 1.0 numerical aperture PlanApo objective (Zeiss Axioskop; Carl Zeiss Inc.). Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Identification of CFBP as a Novel Component of EGF Signaling—To identify proteins acting downstream of the EGF receptor, total protein was isolated using column chromatography packed with three different anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies from the lysate of EGF-stimulated A431 cells, which express large amounts of EGF receptor. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the whole lane was cut out to pieces of equal size regardless of the presence of bands visible by silver staining (15Kikuchi M. Hatano N. Yokota S.

Even from pieces without stained bands, many proteins were identified with confidence. Consequently, over 150 proteins, including not only well studied proteins but also several previously unidentified ones, were detected. 4Y. Murata and H. Taniguchi, manuscript in preparation. In the present study, we focus on the functional characterization of one of the newly identified molecules, named CFBP, in the EGF signaling pathway. Its cDNA has been cloned in the human full-length cDNA sequencing projects, and the nucleotide sequence is available in the public data base. Based on the sequence information, we cloned the CFBP cDNA from the HeLa cDNA library using PCR. In addition to the full-length cDNA, an alternatively spliced variant lacking exon 8 was also obtained. CFBP is composed of 273 amino acid residues, and no significant homology to other proteins of known functions or to known functional domains was detected (Fig. 1A). To assess the expression of two CFBP mRNA species, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using the wide variety of cDNA libraries derived from human tissues and cultured cells. Both sizes of mRNA were expressed ubiquitously except in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, although CFBP was originally identified by mass spectrometric analysis from the lysates of A431 cells stimulated with EGF, the transcriptional level of the CFBP in A431 cells was unexpectedly low. This issue prompted us to conduct a more detailed analysis of the expression of CFBP in A431 cells. When extensive PCR using the A431 cDNA library as a template with 50 cycles was carried out, another small fragment of 400 bp in addition to the two splice variants was detected (Fig. 1C). This fragment was identified as another spliced variant lacking exon 5 by sequencing. Schematic structures of CFBP isoforms are shown (Fig. 1D). CFBP Interacts with CD2AP/CIN85—To gain insights into the function of CFBP, we analyzed proteins co-precipitated with CFBP by immunoaffinity purification. HEK293T cells transfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged CFBP were lysed with the buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with an anti-FLAG affinity gel. Proteins eluted with glycine buffer were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. In addition to CFBP, a protein of ∼80 kDa was detected only in the immune complex from the transfected cells (Fig. 2A). These bands were cut out from the gel and in-gel digested with trypsin. The resulting extracted peptides were analyzed to identify their amino acid sequences using tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Five independent peptides derived from CD2AP were detected. The primary structure of CD2AP is shown in Fig. 2B together with the identified peptides. The association of CFBP with CD2AP in cells was confirmed further by an immunoprecipitation study using their specific antibodies. CD2AP was detected in the immune complex precipitated with the anti-CFBP(C-ter) antibody from the lysate of HEK293 cells, demonstrating that the endogenous CFBP and CD2AP are associated in cultured cells derived from human kidney (Fig. 2C). The degree of association was elevated upon EGF stimulation. Moreover, a protein structurally related to CD2AP, CIN85, was also bound to CFBP in HEK293 cells. Although CIN85 was not detected as a binding protein to CFBP by MS/MS analysis, the result of immunoblot analysis revealed that endogenous CIN85 could be bound to CFBP. These results were confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-CD2AP and anti-CIN85 antibodies (Fig. 2D). A Proline-rich Motif in CFBP Is the Binding Site for the SH3 Domain of CD2AP—To analyze the binding mechanisms of CFBP and CD2AP in detail, several constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells, and the interaction was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Reexamination of the CFBP sequences suggested a proline-rich region (amino acid residues 155-160) as a likely candidate for the binding site to CD2AP. The PVPKPR sequence in CFBP shows a good match to the PX(P/A)XXR sequence that has been recently identified as the target of the SH3 domain of CD2AP/CIN85 (16Kurakin A.V. Wu S. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34102-34109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K. Kowanetz M. Husnjak K. Taylor J.D. Soubeyran P. Engstrom U. Ladbury J.E. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39735-39746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Accordingly, several deletion mutants lacking the proline-rich region were constructed (Fig. 3A). HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged CFBP cultured in the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were harvested, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-CD2AP antibody. FLAG-CFBP was found in the immune complex obtained with anti-CD2AP antibody from the lysate of HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-CFBP, demonstrating that endogenous CD2AP associates with FLAG-tagged CFBP (Fig. 3B). Next, the reciprocal experiment was carried out with various deletion mutants expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3C). Wild type (CFBP-L) and a spliced variant (CFBP-S) still bound to endogenous CD2AP and CIN85. On the other hand, another spliced variant lacking exon 5 (CFBP-L Δex5) and the deletion mutant lacking the proline-rich motif (CFBP-S ΔPro) lost the ability to bind to CD2AP and CIN85. We conclude that CFBP binds to the CD2AP/CIN85 family through the proline-rich motif containing a proline-arginine motif. Since the spliced variant lacking the proline-rich region (CFBP-LΔex5) in A431 cells did not bind to CD2AP, there seems to be a functional difference among the splicing variants. Interestingly, FLJ00022, a homologous protein of CFBP (34% identity) in which the tyrosine phosphorylation site is conserved but which lacks the PX(P/A)XXR sequence, failed to bind to CD2AP (Fig. 3C). Reverse experiments were performed to identify the binding site for CFBP in CD2AP. The proline-rich sequence is a well known binding site for the SH3 domain, and the design of the constructs (Fig. 3D) was facilitated by recent studies on the binding proteins to CD2AP/CIN85 (4Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells expressing the FLAG-tagged CD2AP derivatives and GFP-fused CFBP-S were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was carried out using the anti-FLAG antibody. It is clear that the deletion of the most N-terminal of the three SH3 domains of CD2AP (referred to as SH3A, with the second and third domains being referred to as B and C, respectively) abolished the binding (Fig. 3E). The SH3A domain might be involved in the binding of CFBP in HEK293 cells. Next, to clarify whether the SH3 domains of CD2AP/CIN85 directory bind to CFBP, GST pull-down assays with the isolated SH3 domains of CD2AP/CIN85 were carried out. Although all SH3 domains of CD2AP/CIN85 were able to bind directly to CFBP to some extent, the SH3A domain of each molecule had the highest binding affinity to CFBP in vitro (Fig. 3F). Identification of the Tyrosine Phosphorylation Site of CFBP That Is Related to the Binding Affinity to CD2AP/CIN85— Since CFBP was originally identified in the immune complex of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, it should be either tyrosine-phosphorylated itself or associated with another tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. The results shown above suggest that the binding of CFBP to the CD2AP/CIN85 family might be regulated by their tyrosine phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. Because immunoprecipitated endogenous CFBP from EGF-stimulated HEK293 cells was blotted by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, CFBP is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein response to EGF stimulation (Fig. 4A). To identify the tyrosine phosphorylation sites, wild-type and mutant CFBPs lacking tyrosine residues were expressed in cells, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed"

Previous work has shown that the Shal potassium channel subfamily underlies the predominant fast transient outward current in Drosophila neurons (Tsunoda, S., and Salkoff, L. (1995) J. Neurosci. 15, 1741–1754) and the fast transient outward current in mouse heart muscle (Guo, W., Jung, W. E., Marionneau, C., Aimond, F., Xu, H., Yamada, K. A., Schwarz, T. L., Demolombe, S., and Nerbonne, J. M. (2005) Circ. Res. 97, 1342–1350). We show that Shal channels also play a role as the predominant transient outward current in Caenorhabditis elegans muscle. Green fluorescent protein promoter experiments also revealed SHL-1 expression in a subset of neurons as well as in C. elegans body wall muscle and in male-specific diagonal muscles. The shl-1 (ok1168) null mutant removed all fast transient outward current from muscle cells. SHL-1 currents strongly resembled Shal currents in other species except that they were active in a more depolarized voltage range. We also determined that the remaining delayed-rectifier current in cultured myocytes was carried by the Shaker ortholog SHK-1. In shl-1 (ok1168) mutants there was a significant compensatory increase in the SHK-1 current. Male shl-1 (ok1168) animals exhibited reduced mating efficiency resulting from an apparent difficulty in locating the hermaphrodite vulva. SHL-1 channels are apparently important in fine-tuning complex behaviors, such as mating, that play a crucial role in the survival and propagation of the species."

A mimic-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine can be a viable alternative to carbohydrate-based antigens if the diversity of epitopes found on gp120 can be recapitulated. To improve existing mimics, an attempt was made to study the structural correlates of the observed polyspecificity of carbohydrate mimetic peptides based on the Y(P/R)Y motif in more detail. A carbohydrate mimetic peptide, D002 (RGGLCYCRYRYCVCVGR), bound a number of lectins with different specificities. Although this peptide reacted strongly with both lotus and concanavalin A (ConA) lectins, it bound to lotus stronger than ConA. By varying the central motif RYRY, five versions were produced in multiple antigen peptide format, and their avidity for lotus and ConA lectins was tested by surface plasmon resonance. Although the kinetic parameters were similar, the version based on the sequence YPYRY had an optimal affinity for both lectins as well as improved avidity for wheat germ agglutinin and phytohemagglutinin. Thus, as far as lectin specificity is concerned, YPYRY had improved multiple antigenic properties. Both RYRY and YPYRY precipitated antibodies from human IgG for intravenous use that bound to gp120 in vitro and immunoprecipitated gp120 from transfected CHO-PI cells. Thus, Y(P/R)Y motifs mimic multiple carbohydrate epitopes, many of which are found on HIV, and preimmune human IgG antibodies that bind to HIV carbohydrates cross-react to a comparable extent with both RYRY and YPYRY carbohydrate mimetic peptides.

In its native quaternary conformation Env exposes mostly its glycosylated surface. The latter represents a diverse array of glycans, dominated by N-linked structures (high mannose, complex, or hybrid structures) and sialosyl residues (2Lifson J. Coutre S. Huang E. Engleman E. J.

This notion is further supported by the existence of a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2G12 with protective activity against viral challenge in animal models (10Ferrantelli F.

Such an antibody response could be a viable strategy for a vaccine if it could induce broadly reactive anti-HIV responses (12Wang L.X. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2006; 9: 194-206PubMed Google Scholar). However, targeting a set of carbohydrate structures as diverse and variable as the ones found on Env of HIV maybe daunting. It will require a multivalent vaccine approach to induce antibodies with polyreactivity for the diverse glycoforms of Env (13Dudkin V.Y. Orlova M. Geng X. Mandal M. Olson W.C. Danishefsky S.J. J. Am.

Using peptide mimics of carbohydrates as immunogens offers the possibility of designing T-cell-dependent immunogens for eliciting stronger, long term carbohydrate-reactive antibody responses (16Agadjanyan M.

Peptide mimics are also easier to synthesize and modify than carbohydrate antigens. We have observed that similar structural motifs can mimic Env-associated mannose and fucosylated lactosamines (22Cunto-Amesty G. Dam T.K. Luo P. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Brewer C.F. Van Cott T.C.

A similar motif, YRY, was initially implicated in the mimicry of the major C polysaccharide, a 2-9 sialic acid (major C polysaccharide) of Neisseria meningitidis (26Westerink M.A. Giardina P.C. Apicella M.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have further optimized mimotopes on the basis of YRY (e.g. in peptide 911YRYRYGRYRSGSYRYRYGRYRSGS), in terms of binding to concanavalin A (ConA) and eliciting anti-mannose antibodies (22Cunto-Amesty G. Dam T.K. Luo P. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Brewer C.F. Van Cott T.C. Kieber-Emmons T. J. Biol.

Recently, we demonstrated that the YRY containing cyclic peptide D002 (RGGLCYCRYRYCVCVGR) is a mimic of oligomannose antigens that elicit antibodies reactive to oligomannose-9, and serum of D002 immunized mice was able to suppress the binding of HIV gp120 to human dendritic cells (27Pashov A.

At the same time, the peptides 105 (GGIYYPYDIYYPYDIYYPYD) and 107 (GGIYYRYDIYYRYDIYYRYD) have been found to mimic a large variety of fucosylated lactosamines (16Agadjanyan M. Luo P.

Carbohydrate mimetic peptides based on the YYRY and the YYPY motifs conjugated to proteasomes elicit antibodies that bind Env of HIV-1 and inhibit HIV infection of target cells (16Agadjanyan M.

Thus, mimicry of diverse carbohydrate antigens is built on a small set of amino acids. Most probably these residues interact with carbohydrate-binding sites on antibodies and lectins through a degenerate alphabet of simple bonding patterns, mostly of hydrogen bonds and π -stacking, that are common with carbohydrate antigens. Therefore, refining the specificity of the mimotopes with respect to the target structures (but not for the templates) may be impossible (29Harris S.L. Craig L. Mehroke J.S. Rashed M. Zwick M.B. Kenar K. Toone E.J. Greenspan N. Auzanneau F.I. Marino-Albernas J.R. Pinto B.M. Scott J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2454-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and it may be advisable rather to use a controlled level of degeneracy of recognition to provide structures that elicit a repertoire of antibodies of predetermined polyspecificity (multiple antigen mimotopes (MAM)) (30Pashov A. Canziani G. Macleod S. Plaxco J. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Kieber-Emmons T. Vaccine. 2005; 23: 2168-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that different peptide motifs rank in their lectin polyreactivity in the following order: RYRY ≫ YYRYD > YYPYD ≫ YWRYD (28Cunto-Amesty G. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Luo P. Jousheghany F. Kieber-Emmons T. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; 33: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is possible that such carbohydrate mimics elicit a broader range of anti-carbohydrate antibodies than predicted from the initial characterization of these motifs. Here we further explore the possibility of using Y(R/P)Y-based carbohydrate mimetic peptides as MAM for HIV vaccine development by studying the polyreactivity of these motifs. Reagents—Biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I (catalog number B-1105), biotinylated peanut agglutinin (catalog number B-1075), biotinylated Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) (catalog number B-1235), biotinylated jacalin (catalog number B-1155), biotinylated Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (catalog number B-1325), biotinylated PHA-E (catalog number B-1125), biotinylated Erythrina cristagalli lectin (catalog number B-1145), biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin (catalog number B-1305), and biotinylated ConA were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Gp120MN was from Advance Biotechnologies Inc. (Columbia, MD; catalog number 14-129-050). The peptides RYRY (RGGLCYCRYRYCVCVGR; D002), PYRY (RGGLCYCPYRYCVCVGR), PYPY (RGGLCYCPYPYCVCVGR), YPYRY (RGGLCYCYPYRYCVCVGR), YRYPY (RGGLCYCYRYPYCVCVGR), YPYPY (RGGLCYCYPYPYCVCVGR), and 911 (YRYRYGRYRSGSYRYRYGRYRSGS) were synthesized as 8-mer multiple antigen peptides (MAPs) by BioSynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Cell Lines—Human immunodeficiency virus Env protein (gp120) expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-PI) (catalog number 2284) cells and CHO cells transfected only with an empty vector (CHO-EE) (catalog number 2238) were from AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health (31Weiss C.D. White J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7060-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-PI cells are cotransfected with HIV-1 env and rev expression vectors. CHO-PI expresses the HXB2 envelope protein with a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. The HXB2 env gene lacks complete rev and tat genes and was introduced using the vector pEE14 (Celltech), which expresses glutamine synthetase. The cells were cultured according to the protocol available in the data base. ELISA—For the lectin panel binding, 4HBX microtiter plates (Immulon) were coated with 5 μg/ml (0.3 μm) peptide RYRY or YPYRY in methanol overnight at room temperature by evaporation. After blocking with 0.5% fetal bovine serum in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, biotinylated lectins were incubated in the microtiter plates at dilutions between 50 pm and 10 μm in duplicate wells. Streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate was used as a secondary reagent with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, and the adsorbance was read at 405 nm. Saturation binding curves (of the type: concentration × maximal level/(K + concentration) + background) were fitted to the experimental data with the help of the nonlinear regression unit of the Statistica for Windows (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Anti-human IgG conjugates of alkaline phosphatase were used as secondary reagents, and 0.1% p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.5, was used as a chromogenic substrate and read at 405 nm. All binding experiments were carried out at room temperature. Biosensor Experiments—Because of the highly hydrophobic nature of the multiple antigenic peptides used, the assay was designed following the method used by MacKenzie et al. (32MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5533-5538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The peptides were coupled to a hydrophobic biosensor chip HPA, covered with a lipid monolayer. The liposome suspension was prepared by drying in a rotary evaporator 4 ml of 7.5 mm solution of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol followed by addition of 60 ml of distilled water to the flask and sonication for 15 min at 37 °C. The liposome suspension was cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g, aliquoted, and frozen. The surface plasmon resonance binding assay was carried out using Biacore 3000 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). The surface of an HPA chip (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) was washed by a 5-min injection of 40 mm n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside followed immediately by the injection of the liposome suspension at 2 μl/min. The liposome layer was considered continuous when the sensorgram reached a plateau. To stabilize the lipid-coated surface, the liposome injection was followed by a 3-min injection of 10 mm NaOH. This procedure yielded typically a signal of 1500–2000 resonance units. Solutions of lyophilized MAP dissolved in distilled water were injected over the surface of the chip to at ligand density 800 resonance units. Lectins were then injected at 20 μl/min flow rate in HBS-N buffer (Biacore) for 4 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min (ConA, 200, 300, 400, and 500 nm or lotus lectin-6, 18.7, 31.2, and 43.7 nm) followed by 4 min of dissociation phase before regeneration. The surface was regenerated using 10 mm NaOH delivered in three pulses of 4 min each. The sensorgrams of the binding were analyzed after subtracting the binding to a liposome-covered channel with no peptide. Data preparation for analysis and fitting of the direct binding data were performed using BIAEvaluation 3.1. The lectins displayed complex kinetics of binding to the studied peptides, which sometimes required fitting using the bivalent analyte model and mass transfer. In the cases when bivalent binding model was used, only the set of the constants for the first phase were used. The χ2 criterion of the goodness of fit varied between 0.1 and 1.4 for the different experiments. Precipitation of Mimotope-reactive Human IgG Antibodies—Human IgG binding to RYRY and YPYRY was isolated from the intravenous immunoglobulin preparation (IVIg) Sandoglobulin (Novartis) by precipitation. After extensive dialysis against PBS to eliminate the sugar excipient, 100 mg of IVIg were mixed with 0.4 mg of the MAP of interest slowly dissolved in distilled water with constant mixing. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before adding polyethylene glycol 4400 to 3.5% and incubating further for least 4 h at 4°C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, rinsed, and dissolved in 30 ml of 0.05 m glycine/HCl buffer, pH 2.7. This solution was concentrated in Amicon ultrafiltration concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa, resuspended in the same buffer, and concentrated again three times to separate the lower molecular weight MAP from the IgG. The resulting solution was dialyzed against PBS and concentrated again to 0.5 mg/ml IgG. No MAP was detectable in the dialyzed samples as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cross-blot—A dot-blot technique was used to analyze the binding of antibody fractions to gp120 and peptides (27Pashov A. Canziani G. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Kaveri S.V. Macleod S. Saha R. Perry M.

Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) was pre-wetted and inserted in a miniblotter (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA). Recombinant gp120 (SF162, 7363, AIDS Reagents, National Institutes of Health) was added to the channels and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed, blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS, Tween containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and inserted again in the miniblotter at 90° relative to the original orientation. Different antibody fractions were added at 1.3 μm to the channels and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After additional washes the entire membrane was incubated with an alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and the reactivities were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Sigma). In the inhibition experiments the 0.33 μm of the antibodies were mixed with 2500 μm of different sugars. The resulting pattern was scanned and digitized using ImageJ software as described previously (33Pashov A. Kenderov A. Kyurkchiev S. Kehayov I. Hristova S. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Giltiay N.

The average staining of the area adjacent to the analyzed spot along the axis of the channel containing the antibody was used as a background and was subtracted from the value of the specific spot. Immunoprecipitation—CHO-PI or CHO-EE cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml RYRY or YPYRY precipitated fractions of IVIg or nonfractionated IVIg, washed, lysed, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The clear extract was incubated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma), which were washed and boiled with sample buffer, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7, with a protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% BisTris gradient gel (Invitrogen), blotted onto PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer, and probed with deglycosylated gp120 Env2-3-specific serum (AIDS reagents). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect the binding of the anti-gp120 antibody, and the reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Statistics—The staining intensities in the cross-blot experiment were compared using Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05). The half-maximal binding of lectins in MAP ELISA was compared using the standard error of the estimate provided by Statistica for Windows (StatSoft). The logit linearized data for the binding of 2G12 to peptides were compared by General Linear Models (GLM) followed by post hoc pair wise comparisons Statistica (StatSoft) with significance level of p < 0.05. RYRY Is a Polyreactive Mimotope—The reactivity of the mannose mimotope peptide RYRY (also known as D002) with ConA has been studied previously (27Pashov A. Canziani G. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Kaveri S.V.

To determine the degree of specificity of the mimicry, we further tested the reactivity of RYRY with a panel of lectins (Fig. 1 and Table 1) with specificity relevant to the repertoire of carbohydrate epitopes found on HIV-1 Env. Microtiter plates were coated with RYRY and incubated with serial dilutions of different biotinylated lectins. The concentrations of lectins that yielded half-maximal binding were used to compare the binding of the diverse biotinylated ligands. All lectins tested bound to the peptide but the apparent affinities (which could be assessed only comparatively) grouped in three groups with approximately 1 order of difference. The maximal levels of binding differed (lotus > PHA > ConA > MAA > GS-1 > VVL > WGA) with lower maximal binding seen with the lectins with higher half-maximal binding concentration (data not shown).TABLE 1Lectin specificitiesLectinSpecificityRef.PHA (Phaseolus vulgaris)Complex biantennary oligosaccharides with outer galactose and bisecting GlcNAc58Yan L.

Five variants were synthesized that had the same flanking regions (RGGLCYCXXXXCVCVGR) responsible for the cyclization but with the following core motifs: PYPY, YRYPY, YPYRY, YPYPY, and PYRY. To quantitate the binding of each peptide to ConA and lotus lectin, the kinetic parameters of the interaction were determined next by surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 2). The peptides in MAP format were adsorbed on a hydrophobic biosensor chip HPA covered with a liposome monolayer. The lectins were injected over the surface thus prepared in different concentrations. The parameters are based on the calculations from two matrices. The kinetic parameters showed dependence on the concentration for the two lower concentrations (data not shown); therefore, the comparison was performed based on the mean of the values for the two higher concentrations of each parameter. At these two concentrations, the values of each of the parameters for a given peptide converged. All peptides had high apparent affinity for both lectins (KD in the range 0.2–8.3 nm). Lotus lectin bound to the peptides with higher association rates and higher affinity than ConA, but the dissociation rates were comparable on average (Fig. 2). The high association rates of YPYPY and YPYRY and the very low dissociation rate of RYRY contributed to the higher affinity these three peptides had for lotus as compared with PYPY, PYRY, and YRYPY. The pattern of avidities of these two lectins with the panel of RYRY versions differed with RYRY ranking first in binding to lotus and 4th in binding to ConA. Ranking the peptides according to affinity showed that YPYRY had, on the average, higher ranks for both lectins than the rest of the peptides. Although the parameters varied specifically for the two lectins the avidities of all peptides were close. Lectin Binding Profile for YPYRY Compared with RYRY—The changes in the binding to a panel of lectins that accompanied the modification of the main motif of the peptide from RYRY (D002) to YPYRY were analyzed next. The concentration yielding half-maximal binding to YPYRY of each panel of lectins was determined by ELISA as done previously for RYRY (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 2). Maximal binding capacity could indicate the abundance of the mimicking conformation in the ensemble, and indeed lower affinity lectins also showed lower maximal values. In this experiment, however, the conclusion is formally imprecise because of possible differences in the specific biotin activity in the conjugates of the different lectins. Therefore, we considered only the concentrations yielding half-maximal binding as an invariant parameter of binding. Thus, the range of apparent affinities was the same for both peptides, but the ranking of the lectins was altered. For both peptides there were two groups of lectins with markedly different apparent affinity. Three of five lectins in the high binding group for YPYRY had improved binding compared with RYRY. Lotus lectin binding was reduced but remained in the range of high binding lectins because its avidity for RYRY exceeded considerably that of any other tested lectin. Thus, the YPYRY motif had an increased avidity for three of five lectins (WGA, ConA, and PHA) as compared with the prototype RYRY-containing peptide, and at the same time retained high binding to two others (jacaline and lotus), which is considered an improvement of its MAM polyspecificity because these lectins represent diverse specificities.FIGURE 4Comparison of half-maximal binding to RYRY and Y"
https://openalex.org/W2026819744,"γ-Secretase is one of the critical enzymes required for the generation of amyloid-β peptides from the β-amyloid precursor protein. Because amyloid-β peptides are generally accepted to play a key role in Alzheimer disease, γ-secretase inhibition holds the promise for a disease-modifying therapy for this neurodegenerative condition. Although recent progress has enhanced the understanding of the biology and composition of the γ-secretase enzyme complex, less information is available on the actual interaction of various inhibitor classes with the enzyme. Here we show that the two principal classes of inhibitor described in the scientific and patent literature, aspartyl protease transition state analogue and small molecule non-transition state inhibitors, display fundamental differences in the way they interact with the enzyme. Taking advantage of a γ-secretase enzyme overexpressing cellular system and different radiolabeled γ-secretase inhibitors, we observed that the maximal binding of non-transition state γ-secretase inhibitors accounts only for half the number of catalytic sites of the recombinant enzyme complex. This characteristic stoichiometry can be best accommodated with a model whereby the non-transition state inhibitors bind to a unique site at the interface of a dimeric enzyme. Subsequent competition studies confirm that this site appears to be targeted by the main classes of small molecule γ-secretase inhibitor. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug γ-secretase modulator sulindac sulfide displayed noncompetitive antagonism for all types of inhibitor. This finding suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-type γ-secretase modulators target an alternative site on the enzyme, thereby changing the conformation of the binding sites for γ-secretase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2077851206,"Collagen XVII, a type II transmembrane protein in hemidesmosomes, is involved in the anchorage of stratified epithelia to the underlying mesenchyme. Its functions are regulated by ectodomain shedding, and its genetic defects lead to epidermal detachment in junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), a heritable skin fragility syndrome, but the molecular disease mechanisms remain elusive. Here we used a spontaneously occurring homozygous COL17A1 deletion mutant in JEB to discern glycosylation of collagen XVII. The mutation truncated the distal ectodomain and positioned the only N-glycosylation site 34 amino acids from the newly formed C terminus, which impaired efficient N-glycosylation. Immunofluorescence staining of authentic JEB keratinocytes and of COS-7 cells transfected with the mutant indicated intracellular accumulation of collagen XVII precursor molecules. Cell surface biotinylation and quantification of ectodomain shedding demonstrated that only about 15% of the truncated collagen XVII reached the cell surface. The cell surface-associated molecules were N-glycosylated in a normal manner, in contrast to the molecules retained within the cells, indicating that N-glycosylation of the ectodomain is required for targeting of collagen XVII to the plasma membrane and that reduced accessibility of the N-glycosylation site negatively regulates this process. Functional consequences of the strong reduction of collagen XVII on the cell surface included scattered deposition of cell adhesion molecule laminin 5 into the extracellular environment and, as a consequence of faulty collagen XVII-laminin ligand interactions, aberrant motility of the mutant cells.

Functional consequences of the strong reduction of collagen XVII on the cell surface included scattered deposition of cell adhesion molecule laminin 5 into the extracellular environment and, as a consequence of faulty collagen XVII-laminin ligand interactions, aberrant motility of the mutant cells. Collagen XVII belongs to the family of collagenous transmembrane proteins, which function both as cell membrane receptors and as extracellular matrix components and are involved in a broad spectrum of biological events, ranging from cell adhesion to host defense (1Franzke C.W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4005-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The group members typically are trimers of identical polypeptides, α-chains, which contain an N-terminal intracellular domain, a single transmembrane stretch, and a large extracellular C terminus with one or more collagenous subdomains, i.e. a structure characteristic of type II transmembrane proteins. The ectodomain is shed from the cell surface by metalloproteinases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family to yield a shorter form of the molecule, which remains stable in the extracellular space after the release (2Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As a component of the hemidesmosomes, collagen XVII is involved in the anchorage of stratified epithelia in the skin, the mucous membranes, or the eye to the underlying mesenchyme. Mutations in the collagen XVII gene, COL17A, cause JEB, a genodermatosis characterized by mechanically induced detachment of the epidermis from the dermis. To date, over 30 different COL17A1 mutations have been reported (Human Gene Mutation Database, Cardiff University; Refs. 3Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Exp.

Bioinformatics predict four potential N-glycosylation sites within the amino acid sequence of collagen XVII, three in the endodomain and one in the ectodomain, 77 amino acids proximally from the C terminus. We have previously shown that this latter site, an Asn-Val-Thr sequon, is N-glycosylated (11Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol.

N-Glycosylation is catalyzed within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; JEB, junctional epidermolysis bullosa; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; OST, oligosaccharyl-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PNGase, N-glycosidase F; HaCaT, human adult low calcium high temperature keratinocytes. by the translocon-associated multisubunit enzyme complex oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) and involves the transfer of oligosaccharides to an Asn residue in the sequon Asn-X-(Thr/Ser) (12Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 13Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides are needed for proper folding and stabilization of the protein, which is important for correct intracellular transport and targeting, such as the cell surface integration of type II transmembrane proteins (14Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Apart from the sequence in and around the sequon, the efficiency of N-glycosylation in the ER lumen is greatly influenced by the accessibility of the sequon to the lumenally orientated active site of OST. Studies utilizing in vitro transcription/translocation systems showed that N-glycosylation efficiency decreased significantly when the sequon was fewer than 60 residues from the C terminus (15Nilsson I. von H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because the distance between the ribosome P-site and OST active site is estimated to be around 65 residues, inefficient N-glycosylation was presumed to be due to the sequon failing to reach the active site of OST prior to dissociation of the polypeptide from the ribosome (15Nilsson I. von H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we provide molecular evidence that truncation of the distal C terminus of collagen XVII impairs its N-glycosylation. We describe a C-terminal deletion mutant of collagen XVII in JEB, in which the Asn-Val-Thr sequon is located only 34 amino acids from the newly formed C terminus. This leads to accumulation of most of the mutated collagen XVII within the cell and its proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation. Only about 15% of the mutated collagen XVII reached the cell surface, which is not sufficient to ensure proper anchorage of keratinocytes to the basement membrane. COL17A1 Mutation Detection—Following informed consent, EDTA-blood samples were obtained from the index patient and her parents. Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The entire coding region of COL17A1 (GenBank™ accession number M91669) and the exon/intron boundaries were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, using primer pairs as reported by Gatalica et al. (17Gatalica B. Pulkkinen L. Li K. Kuokkanen K. Ryynanen M. McGrath J.A. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 352-365PubMed Google Scholar). Primer sequences for exon 54 and 55 were 5′-TTGATGTCCCAAGCTTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CTAATGAGCGTCAGCCTTGC-3′, giving rise to a 416-bp product. Direct sequencing of PCR products in both directions was performed using standard methods. Samples were submitted to automated sequencing in an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). DNA sequences were compared with the reference sequence from the NCBI Entrez Nucleotide data base. Cell Cultures and Transient Transfections—Skin biopsies of the patient were obtained shortly after birth and at the age of 1.5 years. Keratinocytes were obtained by trypsinization of control and the JEB skin biopsies and cultured in serum-free, low calcium keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 2-6 passages as described (18Konig A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 48 h before extraction or staining, 50 μg of l-ascorbate/ml were added to the cultures.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were seeded to 90% confluence on 6-well plates and on the next day, transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of wild-type or mutant collagen XVII cDNA/well and Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufac-turer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Prior to the measurements, the cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml l-ascorbate for 48 h to allow for full prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation of newly synthesized collagens. For analysis of glycosylation, HaCaT keratinocytes or transfected COS-7 cells were seeded in medium containing 25 or 100 nm tunicamycin and subsequently cultured for 48 h. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were further grown in serum-free keratinocyte basal medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with the previously used tunicamycin concentrations for 5 h to determine the ectodomain release (shedding assay). mRNA Analysis—mRNA was isolated from JEB and control keratinocytes with Oligotex Direct mRNA mini kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.

Burgeson, MGH/Harvard Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Boston, MA). Transfected COS-7 cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and stained with the NC16A antibody. The secondary antibodies were Cy3- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled species-specific immunoglobulins (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany and Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany, respectively). Fibrillar actin was stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Single stainings were observed with an Axiophot microscope equipped with an Axio Cam MRc digital camera. Double stainings were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Images of horizontal and vertical sections were captured with single channel excitation using the Leica software. PhotoShop (Adobe) was used for image superimposition. Time-lapse Videomicroscopy and Image Analysis—Keratinocytes were seeded in the center of wells (10-μl drop/well, 24-well plates, Costar) in KGM supplemented with laminin 5 (2.5 μg/ml) to allow rapid cell adhesion. After 4 h, the cells were washed with PBS, and the wells were filled with fresh KGM. 12 h later, cell movement was recorded in a thermally controlled chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) placed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100TV, Zeiss) equipped with a digital CCD camera (Xillix MicroImager, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada). Phase contrast photographs were automatically captured every 5 min for 800 min and stored with the Openlab software system (Improvision, Coventry, UK.). The sequences of images were converted to QuickTime movies, and migration tracks were analyzed using the Dynamic Image Analysis System software (Solltech Inc., Oakdale, IA). Extracted migration parameters included cell velocity (speed in μm/min) and processive index defined by the ratio between the linear and the absolute distances covered by a cell during the time of recording. Immunodetection of Proteins—For immunoblotting, keratinocytes were extracted with a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and proteinase inhibitors (6Schumann H.

Recombinant C-terminally Deleted Collagen XVII—The C-terminal deletion construct with 18 novel amino acids followed by a stop codon was generated using the full-length cDNA for human collagen XVII cloned into the NotI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen Europe, Leek, The Netherlands). In the first mutagenesis reaction, the original amino acids 1450GPKGDR1455 were replaced with SRTQR-STOP using the primers 5′-GGAGAGATGGGCACTCCATCCAGGACCCAAAGGTGAGGCCCTGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGTGCCCATCTCTCCTTTTTGCCCAGG-3′ (the codons of the novel amino acids underlined). Using the first mutated construct as a template, the amino acids 1444GEMGTP1449 were replaced with KRRDGH using the primers 5′-GGACCCCCTGGGCAAAAAAAAAGGAGAGATGGGCACTCCAGGACCCAA-3′ and 5′-TTTTTGCCCAGGGGGTCCTTGAATGGCTCC-3′. In the last mutagenesis reaction, the second mutated construct was used as a template to replace the amino acids 1437QGPPGQK1443 with HSRTPWA using the primers 5′-CAAACTTATGGAGCCATTCATTCAAGGACCCCCTGGGCAAAAAGGAGAGAT-3′ and 5′-AATGGCTCCATAAGTTTGGAAGAAGTCCAT-3′. The PCR products were purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hildesheim, Germany). The resulting deletions and all amplicons were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The N-linked glycosylation consensus site in collagen XVII was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore, the asparagine in 1421NVT1423 was converted into threonine in 1421TVT1423 using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Germany). For transfection, the COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Semiconfluent cells were transfected with the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using 10 μg of DNA/75-cm2 culture flask. Transfected cells were grown in serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml l-ascorbate, which was added every 24 h to allow hydroxylation of collagen and proper triple-helix formation. The media were collected 48 h after transfection and processed, in parallel with the cell layers, as described (11Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Surface Biotinylation—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were cultured with 50 μg/ml of l-ascorbate for 48 h, washed extensively, and surface-biotinylated with d-biotinoyl-ϵ-aminocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). After extensive washes with PBS for five times, the cells were extracted with a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and proteinase inhibitors (6Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Pulkkinen L. Mauviel A. Kuster W. Luthi U. Owaribe K. Uitto J. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Am. J. Hum.

Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and the precipitates were immunoblotted both with the NC16A antibody, to detect total collagen XVII, and with a streptavidin-coupled alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) to detect biotinylated collagen XVII. The software TotalLab1D V1.00 from Phoetix (Biostep GmbH Jahnsdorf, Germany) was used for semiquantitative analysis of the signals. Deglycosylation—For removal of N-linked carbohydrate residues, samples of cell lysate or concentrated cell medium containing 50 μg of protein were treated with 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C prior to digestion with 10 units/ml N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or 5 units/ml endoglycosidase H overnight at 37 °C (New England Biolabs). Mutation Analysis Reveals a C-terminal Deletion of Collagen XVII Ectodomain—After diagnostic antigen mapping had suggested JEB and collagen XVII abnormalities in a newborn female with mild trauma-induced acral skin blistering and slight involvement of the nails (Fig. 1A), COL17A1 mutation analysis was performed. Sequencing of all 56 COL17A1 exons revealed a homozygous duplication of four nucleotides in positions 4305-4308 in exon 54 (Fig. 1B), designated as c.4305_4308dupCATT (nucleotide +1 is the A of the ATG-translation initiation codon). The duplication resulted in a frame-shift, starting with codon 1437, and a premature termination codon 18 codons downstream. These changes generated a new sequence of 18 amino acids, which replaced the 61 most C-terminal amino acids of the ectodomain in the truncated protein (Fig. 1C). In contrast to many mutations leading to premature termination codons, this one did not cause significant nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated the presence of collagen XVII mRNA, nearly at the same level as in the controls (not shown). Expression of Truncated Collagen XVII in JEB Keratinocytes—The presence of truncated collagen XVII was shown first by immunofluorescence staining of the skin of the patient. Antibodies to the juxtamembranous NC16A domain of collagen XVII showed a positive, yet moderately weaker, staining of the basement membrane than in normal skin (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In contrast, Ecto-5, an antibody directed against the distal C-terminal ectodomain, yielded no signal in JEB skin, indicating that a deleted molecule was present in situ (Fig. 2A, lower panels). To obtain additional evidence for synthesis of truncated collagen XVII, keratinocytes were isolated from the skin of the patient and cultivated. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts and media was used to analyze collagen XVII expression (Fig. 2B). Antibodies to the NC16A domain recognized the 180-kDa full-length transmembrane molecule and the shed 120-kDa form in control keratinocytes. In JEB keratinocytes, truncated collagen XVII was found, with an ∼10-kDa reduction in molecular mass, i.e. 170 kDa for the transmembrane form and 110 kDa for the shed ectodomain (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The truncated polypeptides were recognized with the NC16A antibody, but not with Ecto-5, indicating that the distal C terminus of collagen XVII was deleted. In addition to the reduction in molecular mass, the amount of the shed form of collagen XVII was significantly reduced in JEB cells (Fig. 2B, upper right blot). Scanning densitometry of the blots revealed that in JEB cells, the quantity of shed collagen XVII was ∼15% of the controls (Fig. 2B, upper right panel). C-terminally Truncated Collagen XVII Accumulates within the Cell—Immunofluorescence staining of collagen XVII with the NC16A antibody showed a perinuclear/ER signal in control keratinocytes, whereas in JEB cells, the signal was distributed in the entire intracellular space (Fig. 2C). Moreover, a fraction of collagen XVII was distinctly co-localized with cortical actin in controls (Fig. 2C, arrows), indicating cell membrane targeting of collagen XVII. This was not the case in JEB cells (Fig. 2C). Together, these observations suggested that C-terminal deletion of collagen XVII leads to its intracellular accumulation. To verify this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding wild-type human collagen XVII or the C-terminally truncated mutant. Subsequently, the surface of the transfected cells was biotinylated with a non-permeable reagent, sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin. This experiment revealed that only about 10-15% of mutant collagen XVII was present on the cell surface and that most of the mutant collagen XVII was not accessible to the biotinylation agent (Fig. 3A). Consistently with these findings, collagen XVII-overexpressing COS-7 cells contained the wild-type protein mainly in the perinuclear/ER area in immunofluorescence staining, whereas the C-terminally truncated collagen XVII accumulated within the cells, producing a patchy staining pattern (Fig. 3B). C-terminal Truncation of Collagen XVII Impairs Co-translational N-Glycosylation—Collagen XVII has one actively used N-gly-cosylation site at position 1421, close to the distal C terminus (11Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present mutant, the C-terminal deletion did not remove the 1421 Asn-Val-Thr sequon but reduced its distance from the C terminus from 77 to 34 amino acids (Fig. 4A). Since C-terminal truncation can alter co-translational N-glycosylation efficiency when the sequon is fewer than 60 residues from the C terminus (15Nilsson I. von H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Walmsley A.R. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we determined whether intracellular accumulation and decreased cell surface targeting of mutant collagen XVII depended on its glycosylation state. Extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant collagen XVII were treated with PNGase F and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The 180-kDa wild-type collagen XVII band was completely sensitive to digestion with PNGase F (Fig. 4B). A single band of about 175 kDa was apparent after removal of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. In contrast, the double band at 170 kDa representing mutant collagen XVII yielded in a single band after incubation with PNGase, indicating that C-terminally truncated collagen XVII was partially glycosylated (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the ectodomain of collagen XVII released into the medium, both wild-type and mutant, was completely sensitive to digestion with PNGase F, as shown by a mobility shift of ∼5 kDa (Fig. 4B). Both ectodomains were insensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating complex carbohydrate structures derived from Golgi transition (data not shown; Ref. 22Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Borradori L. Huotari V. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24521-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Tunicamycin is an antibiotic and inhibitor of the initial N-glycosylation of proteins during the passage through the ER lumen (23Mahoney W.C. Duksin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6572-6576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Duksin D. Mahoney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The treatment was used to verify whether lack of glycosylation of collagen XVII is mainly responsible for the intracellular accumulation and diminished targeting to the cell surface. For this purpose, COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type collagen XVII were treated with 0.1 and 0.5 μm tunicamycin. The treatment strongly inhibited glycosylation of collagen XVII, as shown in Fig. 4C, left panel, for the transmembrane form. Concomitantly, the quantity of the shed ectodomain in the medium of tunicamycin-treated cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 4C, right panel). The same results have been observed with tunicamycin-treated HaCaT cells (not shown). Since tunicamycin treatment also influences the glycosylation of other proteins that may have an effect on collagen XVII targeting, we generated a glycosylation-deficient collagen XVII mutant by substituting the critical Asn residue in amino acid position 1421 by a Thr (N1421T). Transfection of COS-7 cells with N1421T cDNA resulted in exclusive expression and intracellular accumulation of unglycosylated collagen XVII and no production of the shed ectodomain, as determined by Western blot analysis of the cell lysate and concentrated medium (Fig. 4D). Abnormal Matrix Deposition and Motility of JEB Keratinocytes—To investigate whether lack of glycosylation and intracellular accumulation of truncated collagen XVII have functional consequences, we examined the motility of JEB keratinocytes and the deposition of laminin 5 and collagen XVII ectodomain in the extracellular milieu. Immunofluorescence staining showed that in cultures of control keratinocytes, laminin 5 and the shed ectodomain of collagen XVII were deposited in a concentric pattern in well circumscribed areas close to the cell bodies (Fig. 5A). In contrast, both proteins were deposited in a scattered manner, farther away from the cell bodies in cultures of JEB cells (Fig. 5A). Processing of laminin 5, which is needed for its integration in the basement membrane (25Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 26Gagnoux-Palacios L. Allegra M. Spirito F. Pommeret O. Romero C. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 459-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was not altered in JEB keratinocytes, excluding the possibility that the scattered deposition of laminin 5 was caused by its deficient cleavage (not shown). Analysis of cell motility by timelapse videomicroscopy demonstrated that single cell tracks of control keratinocytes were rather linear, whereas JEB keratinocytes frequently changed direction of translocation (Fig. 5B, colored trajectories in upper panels). This was reflected by a significantly different (p < 0.01) mean processive index of 0.38 ± 0.17 (n = 17 cells) for the controls and of 0.23 ± 0.17 (n = 18 cells) for JEB keratinocytes. For an easier comparison, the net cell trajectories of wild-type and mutant keratinocytes were displayed as wind rose plots (Fig. 5B, lower panels), indicating that JEB cells characteristically moved with random directions, unlike the controls, which moved in a directed manner. The velocity of JEB and control keratinocytes were not significantly different (0.91 ± 0.23 and 0.95 ± 0.19 μm/min, respectively). Thus, lack of normal collagen XVII on the cell surface leads to loss of directed cell motility and abnormal deposition of extracellular adhesion molecules. As a type II transmembrane protein, collagen XVII connects the intracellular keratinocyte intermediate filament network with the extracellular basement membrane zone. Its absence as a consequence of COL17A1 null mutations leads to severe epidermal dysadhesion, whereas missense mutations often cause unfolding of the triple-helix, susceptibility to degradation by tissue proteinases, and functional insufficiency (8Tasanen K. Floeth M. Schumann H. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Vaisanen L. Has C. Franzke C. Hurskainen T.

In this study, we analyzed a novel deletion, which was associated with mild skin blistering. A homozygous duplication in COL17A1 resulted in replacement of the 61 most C-terminal amino acids of collagen XVII by a new sequence of 18 amino acids, eliminating the NC1 and Col-1 domains. Despite the premature termination codon caused by the nucleotide duplication, it did not lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay but allowed synthesis of truncated collagen XVII α-chains. Thus, the mutant was useful for assessing the functional role of the distal C terminus. Bioinformatic predictions disclosed one potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid position 1421 in the C terminus of the molecule (11Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The deletion reduces the distance of the site from the C terminus from 77 to 34 amino acids and concomitantly leads to a decrease in N-glycosylation. A similar effect has been described for the non-anchored prion protein in neuronal cells (21Walmsley A.R. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In that case, N-glycosylation was abolished when the sequons were less than 60 residues from the C terminus. Initial N-glycosylation is essential for correct trafficking, folding, and sorting of a number of membrane proteins (14Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar), and its lack leads to retention in the ER and to proteasomal degradation in association with disease processes. This has been demonstrated for membrane proteins, such as fukutin-related protein, PHEX, Slc11a1, or SURx in muscular dystrophy (28Esapa C.T. McIlhinney R.A. Blake D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), X-linked hypophosphatemia (29Sabbagh Y. Boileau G. DesGroseillers L. Tenenhouse H.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), innate macrophage resistance to pathogen infections (30White J.K. Stewart A. Popoff J.F. Wilson S. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (31Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25416-25422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of collagen XVII, the importance of N-glycosylation for cell surface integration was confirmed by both mutagenesis of the N-glycosylation site and tunicamycin treatment. Both methods led to dramatically reduced glycosylation of collagen XVII and abolished the release of the ectodomain from the cell surface, indicating that non-glycosylated collagen XVII does not meet the ER criteria for further transit to Golgi. However, a minor fraction of mutated molecules in JEB cells must have been normally glycosylated since about 15% of mutant collagen XVII was found on the cell surface. This is also supported by the resistance of the mutant collagen XVII ectodomain against endoglycosidase H treatment, which indicates normal intracellular maturation of these molecules. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the N-glycosylation site in the C terminus of collagen XVII is important for the maturation and plasma membrane targeting of the molecule. Mutations in the COL17A1 gene result in weakening of the basal keratinocyte-basement membrane anchorage and tissue separation in JEB skin (32Jonkman M.F. de Jong M.C. Heeres K. Pas H.H. van der Meer J.B. Owaribe K. Martinez D.V. Niessen C.M. Sonnenberg A. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33McGrath J.A. Gatalica B. Christiano A.M. Li K. Owaribe K. McMillan J.R. Eady R.A. Uitto J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Since laminin 5 and collagen XVII are functional ligands, the amount of collagen XVII required for adequate epidermal-dermal adhesion in the skin poses an intriguing question. Here we demonstrate that about 15% of the normal amount is not sufficient. On the other hand, heterozygous carriers of COL17A1 null mutations, who have about 50% of the normal collagen XVII levels in the skin, are clinically unaffected (3Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Exp. Dermatol. 1998; 7: 46-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Pulkkinen L. Uitto J. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), indicating that 50% of the normal level is sufficient for adequate stabilization of the dermal-epidermal junction. The molecular details and regulation of collagen XVII-laminin 5 ligand interactions are not yet fully understood. The interactions are likely to vary upon changing biological context, such as steady state adhesion versus proliferation and migration. One possibility is that collagen XVII is needed for correct organization of laminin 5 in the extracellular matrix (20Tasanen K. Tunggal L. Chometon G. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Aumailley M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2027-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The scattered, poorly organized laminin 5 matrix observed here and, previously, with collagen XVII-deficient keratinocytes (20Tasanen K. Tunggal L. Chometon G. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Aumailley M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2027-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), favors this hypothesis. In addition, collagen XVII may coordinate keratinocyte behavior within a group of cells in certain situations, e.g. during wound healing. Using in vitro wounding assays, we previously reported that collagen XVII-deficient cells are hypermobile and close a scratch wound faster than controls (20Tasanen K. Tunggal L. Chometon G. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Aumailley M. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 2027-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Conversely, wound closure is slower in the presence of exogenously added ectodomain of collagen XVII (2Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here we provide experimental evidence that diminished plasma membrane integration of collagen XVII is associated with uncoordinated keratinocyte movements, an observation congruent with disturbed wound healing in JEB (34Fine J.D. Arch. Dermatol. 1988; 124: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings underline the role of collagen XVII as a glycosylated cell surface protein and basement membrane ligand, which plays an important role in epidermal cell adhesion and motility.

https://openalex.org/W2025993934,"The segment C-terminal to the hydrophobic motif at the V5 domain of protein kinase C (PKC) is the least conserved both in length and in amino acid identity among all PKC isozymes. By generating serial truncation mutants followed by biochemical and functional analyses, we show here that the very C terminus of PKCα is critical in conferring the full catalytic competence to the kinase and for transducing signals in cells. Deletion of one C-terminal amino acid residue caused the loss of ∼60% of the catalytic activity of the mutant PKCα, whereas deletion of 10 C-terminal amino acid residues abrogated the catalytic activity of PKCα in immune complex kinase assays. The PKCα C-terminal truncation mutants were found to lose their ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase, to rescue apoptosis induced by the inhibition of endogenous PKC in COS cells, and to augment melatonin-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the deletion of 1 or 10 C-terminal residues results in the deformation of the V5 domain and the ATP-binding pocket, respectively. Finally, PKCα immunoprecipitated using an antibody against its C terminus had only marginal catalytic activity compared with that of the PKCα immunoprecipitated by an antibody against its N terminus. Therefore, the very C-terminal tail of PKCα is a novel determinant of the catalytic activity of PKC and a promising target for selective modulation of PKCα function. Molecules that bind preferentially to the very C terminus of distinct PKC isozymes and suppress their catalytic activity may constitute a new class of selective inhibitors of PKC.

Therefore, the very C-terminal tail of PKCα is a novel determinant of the catalytic activity of PKC and a promising target for selective modulation of PKCα function. Molecules that bind preferentially to the very C terminus of distinct PKC isozymes and suppress their catalytic activity may constitute a new class of selective inhibitors of PKC. Protein kinase C (PKC) 3The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; aPKC, atypical PKC; cPKC, classic PKC; nPKC, novel PKC; MBP, myelin basic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; RMSF, root-mean-square fluctuation; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; V5, variable region 5; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase. is a family of at least 11 members of serine/threonine protein kinases that play a key role in transducing extracellular signals generated by growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Most of the PKC isozymes, except for the recently identified PKCζII that consists of only a catalytic domain (3Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), share in common a single polypeptide chain with an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain interspersed by a hinge region (2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Based on their primary sequences and biochemical properties, the 11 known PKC isozymes are divided into the following three subgroups: classic/conventional PKC (cPKC, α, β1, β2, and γ), novel PKC (nPKC, δ, ϵ, θ, and η), and atypical PKC (aPKC, ζ, ζII, and ι/λ). Conventional PKCs are activated by diacylglycerol, Ca2+, and phosphatidylserine, whereas novel PKCs do not respond to Ca2+ but are activated by diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. Atypical PKCs are insensitive to either diacylglycerol or Ca2+ but are activated by lipids, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidylserine, and/or via interaction with the Cdc42-GTP-Par6 complex (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 3Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Structurally, most of the PKCs have four conserved domains (C1 to C4) separated by five variable domains (V1 to V5). There is an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain at the N terminus of PKC that binds to the substrate-binding cavity to sterically block substrate binding. The C1 domain in cPKCs and nPKCs binds to diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine, whereas the C2 domain in cPKCs binds to anionic lipids in a calcium-dependent manner (2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). PKC has a well defined ontogeny; all PKCs are first synthesized as an inactive precursor and sent to the plasma membrane to undergo a maturation process (2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 4Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The first step during maturation is the transphosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 in the activation loop that is located at the C4 domain. This is then followed by phosphorylation of its turn motif and hydrophobic motif located at the V5 domain via autophosphosphorylation in the case of cPKC and via either autophosphorylation or transphosphorylation in the case of nPKC (5Cenni V. Doppler H. Sonnenburg E.D. Maraldi N. Newton A.C. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-34764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The matured PKC is kept inactive via autoinhibition in which the pseudosubstrate segment binds to the substrate-binding site. Finally, the catalytically competent but inactive PKC is released to the cytosol and is ready to be activated by second messengers generated by the stimulation of extracellular cues. Despite remarkable achievements in the understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology of PKC in the last 3 decades, the molecular details underlying how PKCs are regulated are still far from complete. One of the less studied domains of PKC is the V5 domain, which is a segment of about 50-70 amino acid residues C-terminal to the catalytic core (C3 and C4 domains). Although it contains the highly conserved turn motif and hydrophobic motif (FXXF(S/T)(F/Y)), the V5 domain is apparently the least conserved domain in PKC (8Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). This low conservation of sequence homology has led some authors to postulate that the C-terminal portion of PKC has little importance in the biology of PKC (9Su L. Parissenti A.M. Riedel H. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recent studies have shown that the V5 domain is not only important in the maturation of PKC (2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), but it also constitutes at least part of the determinants of isozyme-specific functions of PKC (10Babwah A.V. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5419-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Gokmen-Polar Y. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20261-20266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Wang Q.J. Lu G. Schlapkohl W.A. Goerke A. Larsson C. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the C-terminal sequence of cPKCs, PKCϵ (representative nPKC), PKCζ (representative of aPKC), protein kinase Bα (PKBα), and that of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) revealed an interesting feature of the C termini of these kinases (Fig. 1) (13Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), i.e. PKA terminates at Phe-350 (Fig. 1B). This last amino acid residue of PKA corresponds to the invariable phenylalanine residue N-terminal to the phosphoacceptor residue at the hydrophobic motif found in many AGC kinases (13Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Critically important is the fact that the amino acid sequences in PKC isozymes beyond the C terminus of the hydrophobic motif are highly variable both in length and identity. This begs the question as to what is the function of the additional segment of 7-22 residues C-terminal to the hydrophobic motif in PKC. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the very C terminus of PKCα plays a critical role in controlling the catalytic competence of this kinase. To that end, we generated serial C-terminal truncation mutants of PKCα and analyzed the catalytic activity of these mutants using a variety of assays. We show here that the last 10 amino acid residues at the C terminus of PKCα are not only indispensable for its catalytic activity but also important for the cellular functions of this kinase. Our findings suggest that the very C terminus beyond the hydrophobic motif in PKC may be an attractive target for the development of specific pharmacological agents to inhibit individual isozymes of PKC. Materials—Anti-PKCα antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog number 05-154). Anti-ERK1/2 was from Promega (Madison WI). Anti-hemagglutinin and anti-Myc (clone 9E10) were obtained from Roche Applied Science. A P500 antibody (14Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chen S.J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) that recognizes the phosphorylated threonine at the activation loop of isozymes in the PKC family was a generous gift of A. Newton (University of California, San Diego). Anti-PKCα antibody (catalog number P4334), monoclonal antibodies against FLAG-tag (M2) and β-actin, myelin basic protein (catalog number M1891), protamine sulfate (catalog number P4020), histone H1 (catalog number H4524), and all other reagents were from Sigma. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Expression Constructs—An N-terminally FLAG-tagged bovine PKCα cDNA clone in pcDNA3 was generated from a bovine PKCα cDNA clone provided by A. Toker (Harvard Medical School). Myc-p42-ERK1/2 was from C. J. Marshall (Cancer Research UK, London). We generated all truncation and point-mutation constructs using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were cultured in the high glucose (4.5 g/liter) version of Dulbecco's modified Eagle media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2mm l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Unless stated otherwise, exponentially growing cells (60-70% confluent) were transiently transfected with 1 μg of DNA/8 × 105 cells overnight using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Western Analysis—Cells in a 35-mm culture dish were lysed by 200 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clarified lysates were subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto Protran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h, the blots were probed with primary antibodies as described (16Duan W. Sun B. Li T.W. Tan B.J. Lee M.K. Teo T.S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The immunoblots were then analyzed using the SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Chemiluminescence was detected using a LAS-1000plus Chemiluminescence and Fluorescence Imaging System (Fuji Photo Film) equipped with a cooled CCD camera that registers light emitted from chemiluminescence but not the radiation from 32P. The chemiluminescence signals were quantified using ImageGauge 4 software (Fuji Photo Film). Estimation of Protein Half-life—Twenty hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing 200 μg/ml cycloheximide or solvent control (0.1% (v/v)). In these experiments, the cycloheximide used was from a stock solution of cycloheximide that was dissolved in tissue culture grade dimethyl sulfoxide (catalog numbers C7698 and D2650, respectively; Sigma). At each time point, cells in 12-well plates were lysed with 100 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Thirty seven μl of supernatant for each sample was used for Western analysis. The zero point of the time course was defined as 4 h after the addition of cycloheximide. The amounts of PKCα in each sample were normalized by that of endogenous β-actin in Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. The half-life was derived by plotting the amount of protein remaining against time on a semi-logarithmic graph as described previously (17Kornitzer D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—For preparation of total cell membranes, cells cultured in a 60-mm dish were lysed in 1 ml of isotonic buffer without detergent (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 5mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) by 30 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. After 10 min of centrifugation at 1, 000 × g at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Two hundred μl of the supernatant after the second centrifugation was concentrated using a chloroform/methanol precipitation method (18Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3183) Google Scholar) and was designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet obtained after the ultracentrifugation was designated as total membranes (particulate fraction). Immune Complex Kinase Assay—Total cell lysate was incubated with paramagnetic Dynabeads that had been coated with anti-FLAG antibodies. The immunoprecipitate complexes were washed twice with buffer B (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), three times with buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m LiCl), twice with buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl) and once with the kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Unless otherwise stated, the PKC assay was carried out at 30 °C for 6 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2.8 × 10-4 μCi/pmol) and indicated substrates with or without 300 μm CaCl2, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 108 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine, and 1.6 μg/ml diacylglycerol (prepared as multilamellar vesicles). All reactions proceeded linearly. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 3.3 μl of 2 m ATP and 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and the reaction mixtures were quickly centrifuged, and the kinase-bound Dynabeads were separated by a magnet. The supernatant containing protamine sulfate or histone was removed and was subjected to a P81 filter assay and analyzed by scintillation counting, whereas that containing MBP was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImaging. The kinase activity of each sample was corrected for background counts/PhosphorImaging densitometric units from negative controls (immunoprecipitations performed with vector-transfected cells). The amount of kinase in each sample in the same batch of experiments was determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody using the LAS-1000plus Imaging System that does not register radiation from 32P. The protein mass of FLAG-tagged PKCα was then used to normalize the counts/PhosphorImaging densitometric units to derive the specific activity of PKCα. p42 MAP Kinase Activation Assay—COS-1 cells were cotransfected with Myc-p42 MAPK and one of the FLAG-tagged PKCα expression constructs. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 400 nm TPA for 10 min. Myc-p42 MAPK was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was analyzed using MBP as a substrate as described (19Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Melatonin-stimulated Neurite Outgrowth Assay—N1E-115 cells were plated at 0.25 × 105/well in a 24-well plate and transfected with one of the PKCα expression plasmids. Six hours post-transfection, the culture medium was replaced by Dulbec-co's modified Eagle's media containing 1 nm melatonin (Calbiochem) and 15% serum. Twenty four hours later, cells were photographed using an Axiovert 25 inverted phase contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Coolpix 990 CCD camera (Nikon). Cells containing at least one process greater than the soma diameter were classified as cells with neurites. For each experimental group, the cell morphology of at lest 200 cells was analyzed blindly using coded photographs. Flow Cytometry—About 1 × 106 COS-1 cells were collected by trypsinization. After microcentrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS. A single cell suspension was obtained by repeated pipetting or vortexing. Cells were fixed by dropwise addition of ice-cold ethanol (final concentration of 70%) while vortexing. Ethanol-fixed cells were stored at 4 °C overnight in the dark. Prior to propidium iodide staining, cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS. Cells were then treated with 1 ml of PBS containing 40 μl/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) at 37 °C for 30 min. Stained cells were held at 4 °C for at least 1.5 h before analysis. Immediately prior to analysis, cells were passed through a Falcon 35-μm nylon mesh cell strainer cap (BD Biosciences) to remove aggregated cells. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by operators without the knowledge of the identity of each sample using an EPICS Elite flow cytometer from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA) with EXPO32 software. For each histogram, at least 10,000 cells were assayed. The percentages of DNA fragmentation reflecting apoptotic cells were determined by measuring the fraction of nuclei containing a hypodiploid DNA content (sub-G1 fraction), which is a characteristic feature of apoptosis (20Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling of Bovine PKCα—A structural alignment of human PKCθ at 2.0 Å (PDB code 1XJD (21Xu Z.-B. Chaudhary D. Olland S. Wolfrom S. Czerwinski R. Malakian K. Lin L. Stahl M.L.

Huber R. Kinzel V. Bossemeyer D. Gassel M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7743-7749Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)), and the turn/hydrophobic motif from the recently solved structure of human PKCι at 3.0 Å (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55958) Google Scholar) was generated by superposing the three-dimensional coordinates according to a ClustalW (21Xu Z.-B. Chaudhary D. Olland S. Wolfrom S. Czerwinski R. Malakian K. Lin L. Stahl M.L. Joseph-McCarthy D. Benander C. Fitz L. Greco R. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. J. Biol.

To this alignment, the sequence for the catalytic domains of bovine PKCα (residues 333-672) was added and aligned. Insertions and deletions relative to the known structures were positioned in the loop regions, keeping the secondary structure elements intact. The program MODELLER (25Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10616) Google Scholar) was then used to generate 20 initial homology models of bovine PKCα-(333-672) based on this alignment. The model with the lowest objective function was chosen as the representative model for further study. To provide some structural basis for the positioning of the final nine residues, the PKCα sequence was also used to search the PDB using LOOPP (26Meller J. Elber R. Proteins. 2001; 45: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60158) Google Scholar). The human G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J.G. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) was identified from the LOOPP search, and a short segment from isopenicillin-N synthetase (29Roach P.L. Clifton I.J. Fulop V. Harlos K. Barton G.J. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Schofield C.J. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) was identified from the BLAST search. Models of the two deletion mutants PKCα-Δ672 and PKCα-Δ663 were generated by removing 1 and 10 residues, respectively, followed by terminal re-patching. The three models were then further optimized using CHARMM (30Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14008) Google Scholar) to add hydrogen atoms to the protein and phosphate atoms to the known phosphorylated residues, followed by a restrained energy minimization to remove any remaining steric clashes. Molecular Dynamics Simulation of PKCα Models—To probe the possibility of structural changes in the native and mutant models, the three models were subjected to a 10-ns molecular dynamics simulation using NAMD software (31Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Compt. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2141) Google Scholar) with the CHARMM22 force field. The model structures were solvated to a distance of 8 Å from all protein atoms in a rectangular box of water. Fifteen sodium cations were added to each box to neutralize the overall negative charge of the structures. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with a 2-fs time step at a constant temperature of 300 K and a constant pressure of 1 atm under periodic boundary conditions. The Particle Mesh Ewald method was used for electrostatics, and a 12 Å cutoff was used for van der Waals interactions. The TIP3P water model (32Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30469) Google Scholar) was used to model the solvent. The ensemble was minimized for 1500 steps using the conjugate gradient method. This was followed by a heating protocol where the ensemble temperature was increased from 0 to 300 K over 5 ps. Afterward, the backbone atoms of the structure were fixed, whereas the side chains and solvent were allowed to move unrestrained for a further 30 ps, followed by totally unrestrained equilibration for 10 ps. The production run was then performed for 10 ns, with the SHAKE algorithm (33Van Gunsteren W.F. Beremdsen H.J.C. Mol. Physiol. 1977; 34: 1311-1327Crossref Scopus (1588) Google Scholar) implemented to restrain all hydrogen motions. Coordinates were saved every 1 ps. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. Tukey's honestly significant difference test was used to calculate differences between means for N1E-115 neurite outgrowth. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Generation and Characterization of PKCα Mutants—A full-length bovine PKCα with a FLAG epitope tag fused to the second amino acid residue was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. A PCR-based mutagenesis strategy was used to create all the truncation and point-mutation constructs. The truncation mutants were generated by introducing an in-frame stop codon at the designated positions. For example, the PKCα-Δ672 mutant carried a stop codon at amino acid residue 672 with the C terminus of the mutant being amino acid residue 671. Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of all PKCα constructs used in this study. All the PKCα constructs expressed well in COS-1 cells (data not shown). Because it had been proposed that PKC mutants lacking the C-terminal segment might be insoluble (2Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), it is important that we first analyzed the solubility of all our PKCα truncation and point-mutation proteins. To do this, cells transiently transfected with PKCα were lysed with buffers containing 1% Triton X-100. Detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were obtained after centrifugation and were then subjected to Western analysis. Consistent with reports from others (34Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2348-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Wang W.-L. Yeh S.-F. Chang Y.-I. Hsiao S.-F. Lian W.-N. Lin C.-H. Huang C.-Y. F. Lin W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37705-37712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), all PKCα mutants were found in the soluble fraction, although there was a slightly increased detergent-insoluble fraction for truncation mutants in COS cells (data not shown). We further analyzed the in vivo stability of the truncation mutants of PKCα by measuring the half-life of these proteins. As shown in Table 1, removal of one amino acid residue from the C terminus had minimal impact on the apparent half-life of PKCα-Δ672, whereas the removal of 3-10 more amino acid residues resulted in a slight decrease of the apparent half-life of PKCα-Δ670, PKCα-Δ666, and PKCα-Δ663. Only the removal of 11 amino acid residues from the C terminus caused a severe reduction in the apparent half-life of PKCα-Δ662. We concluded that the truncation of the last 10 amino acid residues from the C terminus does not significantly alter the detergent solubility or the in vivo stability of the PKCα mutants.TABLE 1WT-PKCαΔ672Δ670Δ666Δ683Δ662Half-life4.6 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.53.8 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The Last 10 Amino Acid Residues Are Essential for the Catalytic Competence of PKCα—Next, we proceeded to analyze the catalytic activity of these mutants. After transient transfection, the FLAG-tagged PKCα was immunoprecipitated from the COS cell lysate, washed extensively with 0.5 m lithium chloride, and subjected to an in vitro immune complex kinase assay. We first tested the wild-type PKCα and truncation mutants using protamine sulfate as a substrate, as this arginine-rich protein binds PKC and releases the pseudosubstrate and thus serves an excellent cofactor-independent substrate of PKC (36Souvignet C. Chambaz E.M. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 37Leventhal P.S. Bertics P.J. J. Biol.

It was not until some 80 years later that the most common biological sulfate donor, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), 3The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; KIE, kinetic isotope effect; EIE, equilibrium isotope effect; pNPS, p-nitrophenyl sulfate; EST, estrogen sulfotransferase. 3The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; PAP, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; KIE, kinetic isotope effect; EIE, equilibrium isotope effect; pNPS, p-nitrophenyl sulfate; EST, estrogen sulfotransferase. was identified (2Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 2652-2653Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sulfotransferases catalyze the transfer of the sulfuryl group from a donor, which is most often PAPS, to hydroxyl or amine nucleophiles (Fig. 1). The reverse reaction, the hydrolysis of sulfate esters, is catalyzed by sulfatases. Thus, these enzymes have a complementary relationship analogous to that of kinases and phosphatases. However, enzymatic sulfuryl transfer has remained less thoroughly studied than phosphoryl transfer. Among sulfotransferases that utilize PAPS, several structural and mechanistic investigations have been reported. Structures have been solved for catecholamine sulfotransferase (3Bidwell L.M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures have been solved for estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) with 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) and estradiol bound (6Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and also for the EST-PAP-vanadate complex (7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). EST catalyzes sulfuryl transfer between PAPS and the phenolic oxygen atom of β-estradiol. The sulfation prevents β-estradiol from binding to and activating the estrogen receptor. EST catalyzes both the forward and the reverse reactions, as shown in Fig. 1; p-nitrophenol is an alternate sulfuryl acceptor in the forward direction, and p-nitrophenyl sulfate (pNPS) can function as a sulfuryl donor to PAP in the reverse direction (8Zhang H. Varlamova O. Vargas F.M. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. Varmalova O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10888-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). X-ray structures and site-directed mutagenesis have identified two crucial active site residues, His-108 and Lys-106, which are each ∼3 Å from the oxygen atom of estradiol. Mutation of Lys-106 to arginine, serine, and alanine had little impact on the Km for PAPS but decreased the kcat value by a factor of 200–3000, and mutation of His-108 to serine, leucine, lysine, or arginine resulted in a protein with no detectable catalytic activity (7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This effect and the position of His-108 relative to the phenol group on the substrate suggest a role for this residue as a catalytic base. Lys-106, the only residue in a position to interact with the nonbridging oxygens of the transferring SO3 moiety, probably functions in substrate positioning and transition state stabilization. The x-ray structures led to the proposal of a concerted, in-line mechanism for transfer of the sulfuryl group (7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effects (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1983; 105: 6062-6070Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have revealed that uncatalyzed sulfuryl transfer reactions have transition states characterized by extensive leaving group bond fission and little nucleophilic participation. This is described as a loose transition state in which the sulfuryl group resembles SO3. In this study, kinetic isotope effects were used to examine the transition state of the EST-catalyzed sulfuryl transfer from the alternate sulfuryl donor pNPS to PAP. The KIEs have previously been reported for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of pNPS (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and for the reactions of two arylsulfatases with pNPS (15Gibby S.G. Younker J.M. Hengge A.C. J. Phys. Org. Chem. 2004; 17: 541-547Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The present data allow a comparison of the transition state for the EST-catalyzed sulfuryl transfer from pNPS with these previously characterized reactions. Synthesis of Compounds—The potassium salt of the natural abundance and labeled forms of the p-NPS were prepared as described previously (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). EST was purified as described previously (8Zhang H. Varlamova O. Vargas F.M. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. Varmalova O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10888-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The sodium salt of PAP was obtained from Sigma for preliminary experiments; the majority of the PAP used was prepared and purified according to a procedure found in the literature (16Baddiley J. Buchanan J.G. Letters R. J. Chem. Soc. 1958; : 1000-1007Crossref Google Scholar). Kinetic Isotope Effect Experiments—Kinetic isotope effects were measured at the positions shown in Fig. 2 using the competitive method, as described previously for uncatalyzed reactions of pNPS (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the competitive method, a mixture of isotopic isomers is allowed to react to a known fraction of completion, and the isotopic composition of the product and residual substrate are monitored. The measurement of KIEs requires attaining a significant fraction of completion for the reaction, while suppressing equilibrium effects. Therefore a set of preliminary experiments was performed with varying pH, enzyme activity and relative concentrations of PAP and pNPS. Final conditions were selected to suppress the reaction between PAPS and p-nitrophenol, so that the KIEs observed would reflect sulfuryl transfer from pNPS to PAP. The optimal pH was found to be 6.1, where Km for pNPS = 150 μm, and kcat = 0.52 s–1 at saturating levels of PAP. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C in 100.0 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 6.1 containing 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 7.0 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol (for enzyme stability). PAP was present at a concentration of 10 mm, and pNPS was at 1.0 mm. The large excess of PAP suppressed the reverse reaction between PAPS and p-nitrophenol, which might develop as a result of the growing concentrations of these species during the course of the reaction. To this solution, enzyme was added to a concentration of 3–4 μm. The extent of reaction was measured spectrophotometrically by observation of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm in a reaction aliquot added to basic solution. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were compared with a background experiment that contained all of the ingredients except for enzyme and that yielded no change over the time course of the kinetic experiments. The reaction reached equilibrium between PAPS and pNPS when 70% of the original pNPS was converted to p-nitrophenol. KIE trials were run to 35.2 and 27.3% of conversion. The enzymatic reactions were stopped by the adjustment of the pH to 5.0 and three extractions of the reaction mixture with diethyl ether, with all liberated p-nitrophenol transferred to the ether phase. Residual pNPS, which remained in the aqueous phase, was treated with saturated BaNO3 and then vacuumfiltered to remove precipitated PAP and PAPS. The pH was then reduced with HCl, and samples were heated at 46 °C to hydrolyze the residual pNPS. This solution was then extracted with ether to isolate the p-nitrophenol. The two ether extracts were then processed separately to isolate product and residual substrate p-nitrophenol. Separation of the p-nitrophenol from glycerol took several steps, beginning with the rotary evaporation of the ether. The resulting mixture of glycerol and p-nitrophenol was redissolved in water. This aqueous solution was acidified and extracted with toluene, which left most of the glycerol in the aqueous fraction. The p-nitrophenol was extracted from toluene by washing with aqueous base, and then the aqueous fraction was brought to pH 5 and extracted with ether. Drying over magnesium sulfate and evaporation of ether produced dry p-nitrophenol that sublimed satisfactorily. The discarded fractions at each stage were tested spectrophotometrically for p-nitrophenol. The process was found to be >99% percent effective in recovering the p-nitrophenol, eliminating the possibility of isotopic fractionation resulting from the separation procedures. After sublimation, the p-nitrophenol samples were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry using an ANCA-NT combustion system working in tandem with a Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Isotope effects were calculated from the isotopic ratios at partial reaction in the p-nitrophenol product (Rp), in the residual substrate (Rs), and in the starting material (Ro). Equations 1 and 2 were used to calculate the observed isotope effect either from Rp and Ro, or from Rs and Ro, respectively, at fraction of reaction, f. KIE=log(1-f)/log(1-f(Rp/Ro))(Eq.1) KIE=log(1-f)/log[(1-f)(Rs/Ro)](Eq.2) The 15N isotope effects were measured using natural abundance pNPS. The 18O isotope effects were measured by the remote label method (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17O'Leary M.H. Marlier J.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 3300-3306Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the nitrogen atom in the reactant was used as a reporter for the bridging oxygen atom or the nonbridging oxygen atoms. These experiments yielded an observed isotope effect that is the product of the effect of 15N and that of 18O substitutions. The observed isotope effects from these experiments were then corrected for the 15N effect and for incomplete levels of isotopic incorporation in the starting material as described previously (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Kinetic Isotope Effect Terminology and Methodology—A common notation for isotope effects uses a leading superscript of the heavier isotope to indicate the isotope effect on the following kinetic quantity; for example, 15(V/K) denotes the nitrogen-15 isotope effect on V/K (18Northrop D.B. Cleland W.W. O'Leary M.H. Northrop D.B. Isotope Effects on Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions. University Park Press, Baltimore1977: 122-152Google Scholar). An isotope effect is termed normal if it is greater than 1, i.e. if the lighter isotopically labeled compound reacts at a faster rate. The isotope effect is inverse if this ratio is less than 1. A kinetic isotope effect reflects differences in bonding to the labeled atom in the ground state compared with the transition state of the rate-limiting step. A primary kinetic isotope effect at an atom undergoing bond cleavage will be normal because of the preference of the heavier isotope for the lower energy (more tightly bonded) position. Secondary kinetic isotope effects are normal if the labeled atom becomes more loosely bonded in the transition state or inverse if bonding becomes tighter. A fuller description of the contributions to isotope effects in general, and to those on sulfuryl transfer reactions in particular, can be found in recent reviews (19Hengge A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Marlier J.F. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Data and Interpretation—The primary KIE 18(V/K)bridge is a measure of the extent of SO bond fission in the transition state (19Hengge A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). With the p-nitrophenolate leaving group, previous experiments suggest a maximum of about 1.03 when bond fission is far advanced (19Hengge A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The magnitude is diminished if leaving group protonation occurs in the transition state, as evidenced by the value of 1.0097 measured in the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPS (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 15(V/K) responds to the development of delocalized negative charge on the leaving group and arises from the contribution of a quinonoid resonance form involving the nitro group. This KIE reaches a maximum of about 1.003 when a full negative charge is developed on the leaving group, as would be expected from extensive SO bond fission (19Hengge A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To the extent that the leaving group is protonated and thus neutralized in the transition state, the magnitude of 15(V/K) is reduced. The secondary KIE 18(V/K)nonbridge is small and inverse in the hydrolysis of pNPS, where the transition state is loose and the transferring sulfuryl group resembles SO3 (9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a tight transition state, defined as one in which nucleophilic addition is more advanced than leaving group bond fission, this isotope effect would be normal because of loss of the SO pi bond character. In such a transition state the sulfuryl group would resemble a pentacoordinate trigonal bipyramid, and the bond orders to the nonbridging oxygen atoms are reduced. The KIEs measured for the EST-catalyzed reaction are shown in Table 1. For purposes of comparison, the results for the uncatalyzed hydrolysis under alkaline and acidic conditions are also shown.TABLE 1Kinetic isotope effects for sulfuryl transfer from pNPS in the reaction catalyzed by EST and in the alkaline and acid hydrolysis reactionsIsotope effectEST reactionIsotope effectHydrolysis, pH 9, 85 °CaThe KIEs for alkaline hydrolysis at 85 °C can be approximately corrected to the same temperature as the acid hydrolysis using the equation: ln(KIE at 294 K = (358 K/294 K)ln(KIE at 358 K). This yields 18knonbridge = 0.9940, 18kbridge = 1.026, 15k = 1.0032.

This yields 18knonbridge = 0.9940, 18kbridge = 1.026, 15k = 1.0032. The data for non-enzymatic KIEs are from Ref. 9Hoff R.H. Larsen P. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9338-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab The 18(V/K)bridge is large for the EST-catalyzed reaction. In the uncatalyzed alkaline hydrolysis this KIE is 1.021, but it is reduced somewhat by the higher temperature made necessary by the unreactive nature of pNPS. The EST value of 1.028 is close to the maximum value of this isotope effect of 1.03 (19Hengge A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Clearly, the transition state of the EST reaction exhibits a high degree of bond fission to the leaving group. Also, the chemistry must be fully rate-limiting, or very nearly so, ruling out the possibility of commitment factors or contributions from the reverse reaction, both of which would reduce the magnitude of the observed isotope effects. As the largest KIE, 18(V/K)bridge would be most sensitive to such suppression. The KIE measurements made at two different fractions of reaction were very close: 1.0287 ± 0.0004 at 27.3% and 1.0273 ± 0.0006 at 35.2%. This demonstrates that the opposing reaction is not contributing sufficiently to cause a deviation in the observed KIEs. Contribution from the opposing reaction would cause a reduction in the observed KIE toward the equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) between p-NPS and p-nitrophenol. An estimation of this EIE can be made from the maximum KIE of 1.03, representing essentially full SO bond fission, and the EIE for protonation of p-nitrophenolate of 0.985 (21Hess R.A. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11256-11263Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), to yield 1.015 as the expected EIE. The maximum value of 15(V/K) of 1.003 represents a delocalized unit charge on the leaving group (19Hengge A.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The magnitude of 15(V/K) in the EST reaction of 1.0014 indicates the presence of a little less than a half-unit of negative charge in the transition state. This is less than would be expected on the basis of the extensive SO bond fission implied by the large 18(V/K)bridge and indicates that partial charge neutralization occurs. Several residues, discussed below, could serve as potential proton donors. The results here indicate that protonation of the leaving group lags behind SO bond fission. This could be a manifestation of the stability of the p-nitrophenolate anion, although in other reactions with this leaving group, such as the reactions of protein-tyrosine phosphatases with pNPP, 15(V/K) is abolished by the enzymatic general acid (22Hengge A.C. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7084-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Hengge A.C. Sowa G.A. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13982-13987Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The normal 18(V/K)nonbridge differs from the slightly inverse value for the alkaline hydrolysis. No measurements have been reported of this KIE in reactions of sulfate esters known to exhibit significant nucleophilic participation. If this KIE responds in sulfates in the same manner as in phosphates, one would expect the 18(V/K)nonbridge to become normal as the transition state becomes tighter with more nucleophilic participation. In phosphodiesters, this KIE is in the range of 1.003 to 1.006 (24Hengge A.C. Tobin A.E. Cleland W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5919-5926Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In triesters it is even larger, up to 1.041 (25Anderson M.A. Shim H. Raushel F.M. Cleland W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9246-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) from significant loss of the PO pi bond in a transition state resembling a phosphorane, a species in which the central atom has five single bonds. The small, normal value observed for the EST-catalyzed reaction indicates very modest changes in bonding to the nonbridging oxygen atoms and argues against a highly associative process in which SOnonbridge bond order is significantly diminished. Published crystal structures (6Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) show that the EST active site can easily accommodate the loose transition state implied by the KIE data. A simple model of the transition state for sulfuryl transfer from pNPS to PAP in the active site was constructed (Fig. 3) using these two crystal structures. The PAP-vanadate complex was overlaid on the PAP of the PAP-estradiol structure with the vanadate changed to SO3, and p-nitrophenol was overlaid in the position of the phenolic ring of estradiol. Hydrogen atoms were added and minimized using MM+. The positions of residues and atoms of the reacting species are similar to those obtained from a superposition of the EST-PAP-vanadate and the EST-PAP-estradiol structures (7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The resulting SO distances of 2.37 Å on both the entering and leaving group sides are consistent with a loose transition state with low bond order to the entering and leaving groups, consistent with the isotope effects. Two residues have hydrogen atoms in position to potentially act as the general acid or to hydrogen bond to the p-nitrophenoxide leaving group. These are His-108 and Lys-106, which are 1.85 and 1.73Å from the scissile oxygen atom, respectively, in the model. Mutation of either of these residues has been found to reduce EST activity significantly (7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Lys-106 is also within 2.73 Å of the nonbridging oxygens of the transferring SO3 moiety in the model and might function in substrate positioning and in stabilization of the transition state. In the forward reaction (sulfuryl transfer from PAPS), negative charge would build on the nonbridging oxygens of the sulfuryl group and on the scissile (POS) bridging oxygen atom; several hydrogen bond donors are in a position to stabilize such charge. Lys-48 has a hydrogen atom that is 2.05 Å from this oxygen atom in the model. The backbone NH moieties of Thr-51 and Thr-52 can each form hydrogen bonds with nonbridging oxygen atoms of the 5′-phosphoryl group of PAP, which is the leaving group. The loose transition state and in-line, concerted nature of the reaction implied by the KIE results confirms and expands the proposals of Negishi and colleagues (7Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) based on crystal structures. Compared with phosphatases, the active site of EST provides little in the way of positive charge to interact with the transferring group, consistent with a mechanism in which the negative charge on the sulfuryl group remains relatively unchanged during the reaction. This work represents the second report of isotope effect data for enzymatic sulfuryl transfer and the first on a sulfotransferase. Other experimental investigations have also supported the notion of a loose transition state for enzymatic sulfuryl transfer. A linear free-energy analysis in the forward and reverse directions indicates that the sulfuryl transfer reaction catalyzed by β-arylsulfotransferase IV probably proceeds by a loose transition state (26Chapman E. Bryan M.C. Wong C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 910-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) similar to the EST reaction. Kinetic isotope effects for the hydrolysis of pNPS by the arylsulfatases from Helix pomatia and Aerobacter aerogenes found 18(V/K)nonbridge values similar to those of the EST reaction, indicating little involvement of the nonbridging oxygen atoms and little nucleophilic involvement (15Gibby S.G. Younker J.M. Hengge A.C. J. Phys. Org. Chem. 2004; 17: 541-547Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The uncatalyzed sulfuryl transfer from PAPS to water is believed to proceed by a sulfur trioxide-like transition state with only weak involvement of water (27Bedford C.T. Kirby A.J. Logan C.J. Drummond J.N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), like the uncatalyzed hydrolysis reactions of aryl sulfates. Thus, the evidence available thus far, in the few enzymatic sulfuryl transfer reactions that have been studied to date, suggests that enzymatic and uncatalyzed sulfuryl transfer reactions proceed with similar transition states."
https://openalex.org/W2119131945,"Physiological concentrations of NaCl inhibit the hydrolysis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by ADAMTS-13. This effect is because of the specific binding of chloride ions to VWF. Urea-induced unfolding was measured in the presence of NaCl, CH3COONa, and NaClO4 at pH 8.0, 25 °C, for multimeric VWF, the recombinant A1-A2-A3 VWF domains, and the A1 domain. Chloride stabilizes the folded conformation of the A1-A2-A3 and A1 domains more efficiently than acetate but less strongly than perchlorate. Spectroscopic evidence showed that chloride binds to both the A1 and A1-A2 domain but not to the isolated A2 domain. Binding of Cl– to both wild type (WT) and the natural mutant p.R1306W A1-A2-A3 domains of VWF has a large heat capacity change equal to –1 and –0.4 kcal mol–1 K–1 for WT and p.R1306W A1-A2-A3 domains, respectively. This result implies that a burial of a vast apolar surface area is caused by conformational transitions linked to chloride binding. At any temperature, chloride affinity was higher for WT than for the mutant p.R1306W form. Chloride ions inhibit hydrolysis by ADAMTS-13 of the A1-A2-A3 and A1-A2 domains in the presence of either urea or high shear stress, whereas this effect was either absent or negligible in experiments using A2 and A2-A3 domains. These findings show that the A1 domain contains the binding site of chloride ions that control allosterically the proteolysis by ADAMTS-13 of the Tyr1605–Met1606 bond in the A2 domain and that the R1306W mutation of type 2B VWD quenches the binding of chloride ion to the A1 domain.

The degradation of von Willebrand factor (VWF) 2The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; WT, wild type; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; VWD, von Willebrand disease; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 2The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; WT, wild type; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; VWD, von Willebrand disease; HEK, human embryonic kidney. depends on the activity of the zinc protease ADAMTS-13, which cleaves this multimeric adhesive protein at the peptide bond between residues Tyr1605 and Met1606 of the A2 domain (1Chung D.W.

Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In contrast with other zinc proteases, such as the matrix metalloproteases, ADAMTS-13 does not need activation by other hydrolases to become proteolytically competent toward VWF (1Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence this protease must be regulated by other factors to avoid the continuous cleavage of high molecular weight VWF multimers, which play a key role in primary hemostasis. The regulatory mechanisms of the VWF/ADAMTS-13 interaction are linked to the high conformational mobility of VWF. The adhesion of platelets to the vessel wall, under the high flow/shear conditions of blood in the microcirculation, is mediated by VWF and in particular by sequences within the A1 and A3 domains. The A1 domain (residues 1260–1479) binds to the platelet glycoprotein Ib·IX·V complex (GpIb), to subendothelial glycosaminoglycans, to sulfatides of the cell surface (6Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and to nonfibrillar collagen type VI (7Hoylaerts M.F. Yamamoto H. Nuyts K. Vreys I. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Native VWF in blood has no appreciable binding to platelets. This interaction can take place by means of such exogenous nonphysiologic modulators as ristocetin and botrocetin (8Howard M.A. Firkin B.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1971; 26: 362-369Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Read M.S. Smith S.V. Lamb M.A. Brinkhous K.M.

It is generally assumed that the modulation of GPIbα binding activity involves conformational changes in VWF that lead to the exposure of functional sites normally cryptic when the molecule is in solution. In vivo, this may occur under high shear stress (5Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A.

Blood. 1987; 69: 625-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or when VWF interacts with such subendothelial components as collagen after the integrity of the vessel wall is disrupted (13Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22777-22780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of VWF-GpIb complex was recently found to accelerate the specific cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS-13 (14Nishio K. Anderson P.J. Zheng X.L. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This finding implies that the conformation of the A1 domain regulates through allosteric mechanisms the accessibility of the ADAMTS-13 cleavage site in the A2 domain of VWF. On the other hand, the VWF A-like domain is conserved in several plasma and matrix proteins involved in different biological functions and is now considered the prototype for a protein superfamily containing at least 75 proteins that are similar in sequence (15Colombatti A. Bonaldo E. Blood. 1991; 77 (2315): 2305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For many of these proteins the VWF A domain is characterized by a strong ability to transmit allosteric signals in virtue of its high conformational mobility (16Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1267-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 17De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R. Merati G. Di Stasio E. Mannucci P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of VWF can be obtained in vitro under static conditions, using a mild denaturing milieu, which generates partially unfolded VWF conformers that are susceptible to proteolytic attack by ADAMTS-13. Moreover, early studies by Furlan et al. (2Furlan M. Robles R. Lämmle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recently extended by our group (17De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R. Merati G. Di Stasio E. Mannucci P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) on the specificity of the VWF/ADAMTS-13 interaction showed that physiological concentrations of NaCl inhibit allosterically the hydrolysis of VWF in the presence of mild denaturing urea concentrations. We largely ascribed this effect to the specific binding of chloride ions to VWF (17De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R. Merati G. Di Stasio E. Mannucci P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the molecular mapping of the anion-binding site is still elusive. The goal of this study was to assess within the A1-A2-A3 domains of VWF the effect of chloride binding on the unfolding of the protein and on its conformational stability. A further goal of the study was to map the binding site of chloride ions within the A1-A3 domains and to analyze the allosteric linkage with the hydrolysis of the Tyr1605–Met1606 peptide bond in the A2 domain. The natural type 2B VWD mutant, p.R1306W VWF, was also used to investigate how this mutation is allosterically linked to both chloride binding and to the efficiency of VWF hydrolysis by ADAMTS-13. Step 1—The sequence encoding domains A1, A2, and A3 was amplified with designed primers (set A) available on request, using as a template the pSV-VWFH vector, a kind gift of Lysiane Hilbert and Claudine Mazurier (Lille, France), which contains the full-length human VWF cDNA (18Hilbert L. Gaucher C. de Romeuf C. Horellou M.H. Vink T. Mazurier C. Blood. 1994; 83: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was purified and digested with AvrII and EcoRV (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and then ligated into pSV-VWFH vector, which had been digested with the same enzymes, in order to obtain the pSV-A1A2A3V5 vector. Step 2—The construction of the pSV-SPHA1A2A3V5 cloning vector, containing also the VWF signal peptide and the His6 tag sequence, required a second PCR (PCR condition and primers, set B, are available on request). The pSV-VWFH was used as a template, and the PCR product was purified, digested with AvrII and Tth111I, and ligated into the pSV-A1A2A3V5 vector, which had been digested with the same enzymes. Step 3—The pSV-SPHA1A2A3V5 vector was further amplified with designed primers available on request (set C). The PCR product was purified and digested with HindIII and EcoRV and then ligated into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), which had been digested with HindIII and PmeI, in order to obtain the pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5 vector. The ligation was feasible because both EcoRV and PmeI cause blunt ends. Step 4—The p.R1306W mutation was introduced into pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5 using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A forward primer (5′-GGACATGATGGAGTGGCTGCGCATCTCC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GGAGATGCGCAGCCACTCCATCATGTCC-3′) were used to introduce c.3916C > T (designated as T), to obtain pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5-R1306W. Step 5—A small portion of pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5 vector, containing a short sequence of the A2 domain and the V5 tag sequence, was amplified (primer set D available on request). The product of this PCR was purified, digested with BspEI and DraIII, and then ligated into pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5 vector, which had been digested with the same enzymes, in order to obtain pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2V5. Cloned inserts were sequenced to confirm the correct sequence (19Baronciani L. Cozzi G. Canciani M.T. Peyvandi F. Srivastava A. Federici A.B. Mannucci P.M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 30: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/lite l-glutamine, and 100 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Approximately 5 × 106 HEK293 cells were independently transfected with pcDNA3. 1SPHA1A2A3V5, pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5-R1306W, and pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2V5 expression vectors by using a method described previously (20Baronciani L. Federici A.B. Beretta M. Cozzi G. Canciani M.T. Mannucci P.M. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 2689-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned medium was applied to confluent cells 14 h after transfection, collected after additional 72 h, and added with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mm. The sequence encoding domains A2 and A2-A3 were amplified with primer sets E and F, respectively (available on request), using as a template the pcDNA3.1SPHA1A2A3V5 vector. The PCR product obtained with primer set E was purified, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and then ligated into pRSET-A (Invitrogen) vector, which had been digested with the same enzymes, in order to obtain the pRSET-A2V5 vector. The PCR product obtained with primer set F was purified and digested with the KpnI and HindIII and then ligated into the pRSet-A2V5 vector, which had been digested with the same enzymes in order to obtain the pRSET-A2A3V5 vector. Both pRSET-A2V5 and pRSET-A2A3V5 vectors were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Transformed bacteria were grown in LB broth at 37 °C and shaken. Recombinant protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside overnight. Bacteria were harvested and lysed using CelLytic™ Express (Sigma) reagent, and the soluble fraction was collected. Conditioned media of transfected HEK293 and the soluble fraction from bacteria were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, and recombinant proteins were purified on a nickel-chelated agarose column (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, overnight at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and the concentration was quantified using a protein assay (Bio-Rad) and spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients (g/liter) of 0.574, 0.682, 0.999, 0.612, and 0.548 for WT A1-A2-A3, p.R1306W A1-A2-A3 mutant, A2, A1-A2, and A2-A3 domains, respectively. The A2-A3 domains obtained from the above procedure under nonreducing conditions showed a series of bands with a molecular mass of greater than 48 kDa (not shown). Western blot analysis showed that all these bands reacted with rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled polyclonal anti-VWF antibody from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Prodotti Gianni, Milano, Italy). These bands disappeared under reducing conditions, where a single band of ∼48 kDa showed up. This finding suggested that several constructs randomly stem in bacteria from the folding process, using different arrangements of the free cysteine residues present in the construct. Thus, a further purification was performed by RP-HPLC using a C4 column (5–60% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 40 min). The peaks corresponding to the 48-kDa species were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.50. Finally, to check the correct folding of this species, a collagen binding assay (Life Therapeutics, Cabru, Peregallo di Lesmo, Italy) was performed on this material and compared with the behavior of purified A1-A3 and isolated A2 domains, knowing that only the A1 and A3 domains interact with equine tendon collagen (7Hoylaerts M.F. Yamamoto H. Nuyts K. Vreys I. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The assay confirmed that the A2 domain did not interact with immobilized collagen, whereas 0.05–0.15 mg/ml of both A1-A2-A3 and A2-A3 bound to collagen with progressively higher avidity (in both cases an absorbance value of >5-fold with respect to blank at 0.05 mg/ml). This finding showed that the A2-A3 domains support significant binding to collagen, strongly suggesting that the HPLC-purified A2-A3 domains folded correctly. Multimeric VWF—Pharmaceutical preparations of VWF concentrates (Fahndi, Grifols, Ghezzano, Italy) were used as source material to purify VWF. Briefly, 20,000 units of preparation were suspended in 20 ml of distilled water and filtered using 2-μm pore-sized membranes. This solution was gel-filtered at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min onto a 70 × 2.6 cm Sephacryl S500 column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C to eliminate albumin present in the preparation. The peak containing VWF was pooled and passed through a heparin-Sepharose column (25 × 1.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. A gradient of 0.1–0.5 m NaCl was applied for 60 min. The last peak to be eluted (0.29 m NaCl) was pooled, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. SDS-PAGE of this material showed under reducing conditions the existence of a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 230 kDa. The concentration of this purified material was measured by a standardized method using a commercial kit for VWF antigen (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) and an automatic instrument (Instrumentation Laboratory). By using the same instrument and a commercially available assay (VWF activity; Instrumentation Laboratory), the ratio between VWF antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity (expressed as percentage) was equal to 1.05, demonstrating that the purified protein had an intact functional activity. Accordingly, purified VWF showed a 110% aggregating activity at 10 μg/ml (final antigen concentration) in a ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation assay using 1.5 mg/ml ristocetin in a PACK-4 aggregometer (Helena Laboratories). A1 Domain (39/34-kDa VWF)—A 39/34-kDa fragment of VWF, expressing the A1 domain of the protein (21Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J. Corino G.L. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was produced by dispase (Roche Applied Science) digestion of human VWF, purified as described above. This fragment encompasses residues from Leu1243 to Gly1481 (239 residues). Briefly, VWF (1 mg/ml) in 0.01 m Tris, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.2 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.4, was equilibrated with dispase (0.3 mg/mg of VWF) for 6 h at 25°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mm final concentration). The digest was then loaded at 0.4 ml/min onto a 1.5 × 5-cm column of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris, 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4. After washing, the 39/34-kDa VWF fragment was eluted with 0.01 m Tris, 0.5 m sodium chloride, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, pH 7.4, and dialyzed against TBS at 4 °C. The identity of the isolated 39/34-kDa VWF fragment was confirmed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and a Criterion apparatus (Bio-Rad) and by an N-terminal sequence performed on an automatic analyzer (Applied Biosystems), which found for both the 39- and the 34-kDa bands the sequence Leu-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Thr, corresponding to the residues 1243–1248 of VWF, as found previously (21Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J. Corino G.L. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The difference in molecular weight was attributed to a different O-glycosylation pattern as demonstrated in previous studies (21Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J. Corino G.L. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The purified 34/39-kDa fragment was used in the spectroscopic experiments without further separation. Full-length human ADAMTS-13 was expressed and purified as reported previously (17De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R. Merati G. Di Stasio E. Mannucci P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels showed that under reducing conditions the purified material consisted of a single band of ∼170 kDa. Urea-induced unfolding curves were fitted to a two-state equation, as described previously (22Bolen D.W. Santoro M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8069-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), to calculate the thermodynamic parameters ΔG, Cm, and m. The observed free energy of unfolding, ΔG, is assumed to be a linear function of urea molarity with ΔG =ΔG0 – m[U], where m represents the sensitivity of the transition to the urea concentration, and ΔG0 is the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturants at a standard state of 1 m. Another derived parameter, U½, defined as the ratio (ΔG0/m), is the concentration of urea where the fraction of unfolded protein equals that in the native state. The values of these parameters and their standard deviations are the average of at least two unfolding experiments. For each determination of the unfolding free energy under a particular set of salt conditions, increasing urea concentrations were analyzed by adding stepwise to VWF and its A domains a stock urea solution (9 m) buffered with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.00, at 25 °C. The recorded fluorescence spectra were corrected for the contribution of urea alone and the dilution factor of the protein solution. The extent of denaturation was monitored at 25 °C by tryptophan and tyrosine fluorescence at 337 nm on a thermostated spectrofluorometer (Varian Cary Eclipse) with an excitation wavelength of 295/280 nm (5 nm bandpass at both excitation and emission wavelength). Specifically, fluorescence intensity (F) as a function of urea concentration ([U]) was fitted to Equation 1, F=(FON+sN[U])+(FOD+sD[U])exp-(ΔG-m[U])/kBT1+exp-(ΔG-m[U])/kBT(Eq.1) where ΔG and m are the intercept and slope, respectively, of the linear extrapolation of the unfolding free energy to zero urea concentration; F0N and sN are the intercept and slope, respectively, of the native state base line; F0D and sD are their counterparts of the denatured state base line, and kB and T are the Boltzman's constant and the absolute temperature. Each sample, thermostated at 25 °C, was allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 min, and the final VWF and the concentration of its domains were always ∼0.1 mg/ml, to avoid inner filter effects. Fluorescence experiments of guanidine chloride-dependent unfolding were also performed to demonstrate the applicability of the two-state model of unfolding for the A1-A2-A3 domain. Data were analyzed by the linear extrapolation method, using GRAFIT (Erithacus Software, Horley Surrey, UK). To study the effect of salts on ΔG, samples with the same concentration of salts were prepared in duplicate, and fluorescence data sets in the different repeats were fitted to Equation 1 with ΔG, m, F0N, sN, F0D, and sD as specific to a particular data set. Standard errors of fitting parameters were calculated along with the best fit values. The temperature dependence of Cl– binding was analyzed by change of the intrinsic fluorescence of the various VWF domains, as reported previously (17De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R. Merati G. Di Stasio E. Mannucci P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23295-23302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed over a temperature range from 7 to 40 °C, in a 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at all temperatures. The pH′ of the buffer solution was always set at 25 °C, using a ΔpH/ΔT value of Tris buffer of –0.027. In some experiments, intrinsic fluorescence of the A1-A2-A3 domains was studied as a function of unfractionated heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa; Calbiochem) up to a concentration of 10 μm. The thermodynamic parameters of binding were calculated using the van't Hoff analysis and fitting for ΔCp, TH, and TS, contained in Equation 2, which assumes a large negative heat capacity change (23Spolar R.S. Livingstone J.R. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), -logKd=ΔCp/R·2.303(TH/T-ln(TS/T)-1)(Eq.2) where ΔCp is the heat capacity change, and TH and TS define the characteristic temperatures where the enthalpic (ΔH) and entropic (ΔS) contributions to the free energy change are 0, respectively. Recombinant ADAMTS-13 (final reaction concentration 5–10 nm) was incubated in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 m urea, 3 mm BaCl2, NaCl from 0 to 0.15 m, pH 8.0, at 25 °C with 0.05 mg/ml of purified A1-A2-A3 (WT and p.R1306W), A1-A2, A2-A3, and A2 domains of VWF. In the latter case urea was omitted from the buffer solution, because the denaturant partially inhibits the protease activity of ADAMTS-13. At different time points, 50 μl of the samples were removed; the reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and the reaction products were analyzed by RP-HPLC. Samples were analyzed by means of a 250 × 4.6-mm RP-304 column (Bio-Rad). The chromatographic run was performed by applying the following conditions: 5% acetonitrile for 5 min, from 5 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 60 min for A1-A2-A3 domains and 40 min for the A2 domain, whereas the acetonitrile gradient was 20% for 5 min and from 20 to 65% in 45 min for the A1-A2 and A2-A3 fragments. The peaks were detected routinely at 214 or 254 nm. For the shear stress experiments, a cone-plate rheometer (model CSL 500) from Carrimed (now TA Instruments, Waters S.p.A., Vimodrone, Italy) was used. The used cone had a diameter of 4 cm and the cone-plate gap was of 10 μm. The experimental conditions used were 5 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm BaCl2, t either 0.01 or 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. The purified A1-A2-A3 domains of VWF were used at 0.05 mg/ml, whereas recombinant ADAMTS-13 was employed at 10 nm. To ensure achievement at the desired temperature, samples were applied on the cone-plate apparatus for about 1 min under static conditions. The shear stress applied was either of 0 or 40 dynes/cm2, corresponding from the geometry of the system (0.2°) to a shear rate ranging from 818 to 850 s–1. The total volume of the applied sample was of 344 μl. The shear was applied for 1 or 5 min. At the end, the cone-plate was stopped; the entire volume of the sample was recovered, and 10 mm EDTA (final concentration) was added to the solution to stop the reaction. The fragments produced by ADAMTS-13 were identified and quantified by RP-HPLC as described above. To check the specificity of the shear-induced VWF cleavage by ADAMTS-13, a control experiment was performed under the same experimental conditions except for the presence of 10 mm EDTA, and no significant VWF hydrolysis was observed. In the kinetic study with 1.5 m urea, in virtue of the pseudo-first order conditions (concentration <Km of the reaction), the percent of the peptide cleaved at time = t, Pt(%), was fitted to Equation 3, Pt(%)=100·(1-exp(-kobst))(Eq.3) kobs is the pseudo-first order rate of its hydrolysis, equal to e0 kcat/Km (e0 is the ADAMTS-13 concentration). The calculated kobs values were subsequently analyzed as a function of chloride concentration. The experimental data were analyzed on the basis of Scheme 1, E+S⇄k-1k1ES→kcatE+P1+P2(Eq.4) 1K↑↓1Ks↑↓ E+SCl-⇄1k-11k1E·SCl-→1kcatE+P1+P where E is ADAMTS-13; S is the VWF substrate; Cl– is chloride, and P1/P2 are the N- and C-terminal peptides produced by hydrolysis of the peptide bond between Tyr1605 and Met1606. Chloride acts as effector, whose binding and dissociation from VWF was considered much faster than that of VWF to the enzyme. Under these conditions, the pseudo-first order of the ADAMTS-13/VWF interaction, kobs, was analyzed by the following linkage Equation 4 (17De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S.

Production of VWF A Domains—In all cases expression and purification of the various VWF A domains allowed pure preparations to be obtained. The purity and molecular weight of these constructs were checked by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels and were found equal to 72.5 kDa for WT and p.R1306W A1-A2-A3 domains, 53.4 kDa for the A1-A2 domain, 27.8 kDa for the A2 domain, and 48 kDa for the A2-A3 domain. Fig. 1 shows the SDS-PAGE of the A1-A2-A3, A1-A2, A2-A3, A1, and A2 domain used in this study.

Utilizing H-Ras effector mutants, we show that mutants H-Ras(G12V/E37G) and H-Ras(G12V/D38N) suppressed integrin activation in an ERK-independent manner. H-Ras(G12V/D38N) specifically activated the PLCϵ effector pathway and suppressed integrin activation. Inhibition of PLCϵ activation with a kinase-dead PLCϵ mutant prevented H-Ras(G12V/D38N) from suppressing integrin activation, and low level expression of H-Ras(G12V/D38N) could synergize with wild-type PLCϵ to suppress integrins. In addition, knockdown of endogenous PLCϵ with small interfering RNA blocked H-Ras(G12V/D38N)-mediated integrin suppression. Suppressing integrin function with the H-Ras(G12V/D38N) mutant reduced cell adhesion to von Willebrand factor and fibronectin; this reduction in cell adhesion was blocked by coexpression of the kinase-dead PLCϵ mutant. These results show that H-Ras suppresses integrin affinity via independent Raf and PLCϵ signaling pathways and demonstrate a new physiological function for PLCϵ in the regulation of integrin activation.

Integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins that control cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion and that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and migration (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). An essential feature of integrins is their ability to regulate the strength of ligand binding, a process termed affinity modulation (2Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Various intracellular signals can induce a conformational change in the integrin heterodimer, activating or suppressing ligand binding. Members of the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins have been shown to modulate integrin affinity (2Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).

In addition, activation of the H-Ras downstream effector Raf also suppresses integrin activation in CHO cells (3Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 4Sethi T. Ginsberg M.H. Downward J. Hughes P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, R-Ras, a closely related member of the Ras superfamily, activates integrins and reverses H-Ras-mediated suppression of integrin affinity (4Sethi T. Ginsberg M.H. Downward J. Hughes P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Activation of Raf by H-Ras leads to the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2. H-Ras-mediated suppression of integrin affinity can be reversed by expression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which can dephosphorylate and inactivate ERK1/2 (3Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, studies using H-Ras/R-Ras chimeras have revealed that integrin affinity modulation does not precisely correlate with ERK1/2 activation (6Hansen M. Rusyn E.V. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Cox A.D. Willumsen B.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4448-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.-L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Remarkably, although targeting of ERK1 to the plasma membrane has been shown to be sufficient to suppress integrins (8Chou F.-L. Hill J.M. Hsieh J.-C. Pouyssegur J. Brunet A. Glading A. Überall F. Ramos J.W. Werner M.H. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52587-52597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), inhibition of ERK1/2 activation with either MKP-3 or U0126 fails to affect integrin suppression by H-Ras (7Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.-L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This discrepancy in the current data might therefore be explained by the demonstration of an alternative pathway for integrin suppression that does not rely on ERK1/2 activation. Several effector pathways are activated by H-Ras in addition to Raf, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ral guanine exchange factors (GEFs). Amino acid substitution mutants of H-Ras have been extensively utilized in dissecting its downstream effector pathways. The effector mutant T35S retains its ability to activate Raf, whereas mutants E37G and Y40C are Raf-independent and activate Ral GEFs and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively (9White M.A. Nicolette C.

Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Diacylglycerol stimulates protein kinase C activation, and IP3 mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ (18Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar). Three major classes of PI-PLC have previously been identified: PLCβ, PLCγ, and PLCδ (19Majerus P.W. Ross T.S. Cunningham T.W. Caldwell K.K. Jefferson A.B. Bansal V.S. Cell. 1990; 63: 459-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). They contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an EF-hand domain, catalytic X and Y domains, and the regulatory C2 domain. PLCγ contains another PH domain, which is split by two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain. These PI-PLC classes are activated by distinct signaling mechanisms (20Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). PLCβ is activated by the α subunit (Gα) or βγ subunits (Gβγ) of heterotrimeric G proteins. PLCγ is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation following binding to tyrosine kinases of receptor or non-receptor types through its SH2 domain. PLCδ is activated by the high molecular weight G protein Gh and/or by an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+. Recently, a fourth class of PI-PLC was identified, PLCϵ (15Kelley G.G.

PLCϵ also contains putative PH and EF-hand domains and is activated by Gβγ subunits (22Wing M.R. Houston D. Kelley G.G. Der C.J. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48257-48261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLCϵ is unique in that it possesses two types of functional domains not seen in other classes. At its N terminus, PLCϵ possesses a CDC25 homology domain (a GEF domain for the Ras family of small G proteins), which exhibits GEF activity toward Rap1 and H-Ras (17Lopez I. Mak E.C. Ding J. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

H-Ras binds to PLCϵ in a GTP-dependent manner through its RA2 domain to stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into the secondary messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol, suggesting that PLCϵ may be a downstream effector of H-Ras and Rap1 (15Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 16Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariya K.-I. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T.

However, given the signaling attributes and wide tissue distribution of PLCϵ, it is likely that this protein has a critical role in mammalian physiology. We therefore examined whether H-Ras utilizes PLCϵ to suppress integrins in cells and thus modulate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.

DNA Constructs—Tac-α5 (the extracellular domain of the interleukin-2 receptor fused to the intracellular domain of α5 integrin) was obtained from Susan E. LaFlamme (Center for Cell Biology and Cancer Research, Albany, NY), and pDCR-H-Ras (G12V and effector mutants) was obtained from Michael H. Wigler (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Johannes L.

The D38N mutation was introduced into pDCR-H-Ras(G12V) by site-directed mutagenesis. Cell Lines and Transfection—The CHO(αβ-py) cell line stably expresses a chimeric integrin composed of αIIbα6Aβ3β1 (3Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. CHO(αβ-py) cells were also maintained in G418 antibiotic at 400 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Serum-free medium was used to quiesce cells. Transient transfection of cells with plasmid DNA was performed with Lipofectamine™ Plus reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium containing DNA-Lipofectamine complexes was removed and replaced with fresh complete medium. For experiments when protein activity was to be assessed, the transfection medium was replaced with quiescent medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were either lysed for SDS-PAGE analyses or used for integrin affinity determination. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) of PLCϵ—Kelley et al. (25Kelley G.G.

To assess the whether these siRNA oligonucleotides could be used in CHO cells, we amplified the corresponding regions of siRNAPLCϵ#3 and siR-NAPLCϵ#5 from CHO cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR using primers based on consensus rat/mouse PLCϵ sequence. The respective 616- and 380-bp products were gel-purified and sequenced. We confirmed that the region targeted by siR-NAPLCϵ#3 and siRNAPLCϵ#5 was 100% conserved in CHO cells. Thus, we used these siRNA oligonucleotides to knock down PLCϵ in CHO cells. Transient transfection of cells with siRNA was performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium containing siRNA-Oligofectamine complexes was removed and replaced with fresh complete medium. Cells were then transfected with plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine as indicated below. Seventy-two hours after siRNA transfection, cells were either lysed for RNA extraction or protein analysis or used for integrin affinity determination. Fibronectin Type III Repeat 9–11 Fragment—The soluble type III repeats 9–11 of fibronectin (referred to as FN9–11), which contain the RGD domain responsible for integrin binding, were expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 cells from the pGEX-4T2 vector and biotinylated as described previously (7Hughes P.E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Integrin affinity in transfected cells was analyzed by three-color flow cytometry. Cells were transfected with test DNA (as stated) together with 0.75 μg of Tac-α5 transfection reporter construct. Single cell suspensions of trypsinized cells were resuspended in a total volume of 50 μl containing either PAC-1 (5 μg/ml) or FN9–11 for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mg/ml glucose (pH 7.4). Internal controls containing either 5 mm EDTA or 100 μm MnCl2 were performed for each sample. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated on ice with 50 μlof DMEM containing 1:25 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (for PAC-1) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (for FN9–11) for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed again and incubated on ice for an additional 30 min with 50 μl of DMEM containing 1:50 (v/v) R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Tac antibody (ACT-1). Cells were finally washed and resuspended in cold PBS. Immediately prior to analysis on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium), TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at a final concentration of 1 μm (in PBS) was added to each sample. PAC-1/FN9–11 binding was determined by gating for live and highly transfected cells (TO-PRO-3-negative and high Tac binding, respectively). To obtain numerical estimates of integrin activation, an integrin activation index (AI) was calculated, where AI = ((FN – FI)/(FA – FI)) × 100 and percent inhibition = ((AI0 – AI)/AI0) × 100. FN is the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of PAC-1/FN9–11 binding of the native integrin, FI is the mean fluorescence intensity of PAC-1/FN9–11 binding in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, and FA is the mean fluorescence intensity of PAC-1/FN9–11 binding in the presence of 100 μm Mn2+, AI0 is the activation index with the control vector, and AI is the activation index with the DNA under testing. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Immunoblotting was performed with appropriate antibodies diluted in 5% nonfat dried milk powder and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Relative protein expression was quantified using ImageJ software. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed by treatment with RQ1 DNase (Promega Corp.), and the RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer and then stored at –80 °C. cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription of 400 ng of RNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at –20 °C. All reagents for PCR were obtained from Promega Corp. The reaction contained 2.5 μlof10× buffer, 0.25 μlof Taq polymerase, 1 μlof dNTP (10 mm), 0.5 μm forward and reverse primers, 17.25 μlof nuclease-free water, and 2 μl of cDNA. The PCR program was as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The primers used were PLCϵfor (GGCTACGTAGGCAGGATTGTCTTA), PLCϵrev (TTTCCCTGCACCCTTCCACTTGC), β-actin-for (CCACCAACTGGGACGACATG), and β-actin-rev (GTCTCAAACATGATCTGGGTCATC). PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.), and sequenced on both strands (MWG Biotech). Ral Activity Assay—Cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Ral constructs as described above and quiesced 24 h prior to lysis. Cells were lysed in 450 μl of Ral lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and one Complete™ protease inhibitor tablet). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration estimated. Protein concentrations were normalized, and equal volumes were incubated with 50 μl of the Ral-binding domain of RLIP76 coupled to GST-agarose beads (28Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) for 60 min at 4 °C. Samples of whole cell lysates were taken for loading controls of Ral proteins. Agarose beads were washed four times with Ral lysis buffer and finally resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Whole cell lysates and Ral-binding domain-bound samples (20 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel, and Western blots were probed with anti-Ral antibody. PLC Activity Assay—CHO-K1 cells were maintained in inositol-free DMEM (ICN Biochemicals, Basingstoke) supplemented with dialyzed 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Labtech International, East Sussex, UK). Cells were transfected as described above and quiesced 24 h prior to lysis in serum-free DMEM containing 5 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then incubated with 20 mm lithium chloride for 60 min, washed, and lysed with 500 μlof0.5 m trichloroacetic acid. Lysates were clarified at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (400 μl) was neutralized by addition to a 50:50 mixture of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane/tri-n-octylamine (750 μl). The mixture was vortexed and separated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous phase was collected (300 μl), diluted by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O, and loaded onto an AG 1-X8 200–400 mesh formate form column (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK). Following a column wash with 10 ml of 60 mm ammonium formate and 5 mm sodium tetraborate, [3H]IP1–3 was eluted with 5 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cells were transfected with test DNA, and CHO(αβ-py) cells were also transfected with 2 μg of pEGFP-C3. Cells were harvested after 48 h and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM. 96-Well cell culture cluster plates were coated with 5 μg/ml von Willebrand factor (vWF) (CHO(αβ-py) cells) or 10 μg/ml fibronectin (CHO-K1 cells) in PBS for 60 min at 37 °C and blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. The cell suspension (200 μl) was added to each well and allowed to adhere for 15 min at 37 °C. Unattached cells were removed by gentle shaking for 3 × 10 s. Total cell adhesion was assessed by centrifugation of the plate at 1000 rpm for 5 min. For CHO(αβ-py) cells, adhesion was quantified on a fluorescence plate reader. For CHO-K1 cells, adhesion was quantified by staining adherent cells with methylene blue (0.4%) for 5 min, three washes with PBS, and elution of stain with 0.1 m HCl. The absorbance of each sample was read at 640 nm on an optical plate reader. Adhesion was expressed as a percentage compared with total cell adhesion with background cell adhesion to plastic subtracted against all values. The data represented are shown as the percent change in cell adhesion with values normalized against control cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the appropriate post-test analyses were applied. p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. Integrin Suppression by H-Ras(G12V) Effector Mutants T35S and E37G—It has previously been reported that a constitutively active mutant of H-Ras (H-Ras(G12V)) suppresses integrin function (3Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways downstream of H-Ras are still poorly understood. To examine the role of downstream effectors of H-Ras in integrin suppression, we utilized the CHO(αβ-py) cell line, a CHO cell line stably expressing a chimeric integrin that contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of αIIbβ3 fused to the cytoplasmic domains of α6Aβ1 (3Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 4Sethi T. Ginsberg M.H. Downward J. Hughes P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). H-Ras(G12V) effector mutants were transfected into CHO(αβ-py) cells, and their effect upon integrin affinity modulation was assessed. The integrin AI was quantified from changes in the binding levels of the αIIbβ3 ligand-mimetic monoclonal antibody PAC-1, detected by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1A shows that the H-Ras(G12V) effector mutants E37G (25.3 ± 14.6%) and T35S (27.9 ± 6.6%) both induced a significant reduction in the AI compared with control vector-transfected cells (70.6 ± 8.5%, p < 0.01). This was comparable with H-Ras(G12V)-induced reduction in the integrin AI (23.1 ± 4.3%). In contrast, effector mutant Y40C (59.0 ± 15%) did not significantly reduce the AI in our system. Furthermore, we confirmed previous results (3Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity with LY294002 (10 μm) does not affect H-Ras(G12V)-mediated integrin suppression in CHO(αβ-py) cells (data not shown), in agreement with the inability of H-Ras(G12V/Y40C) to suppress integrins. Each mutant was expressed at similar levels in the transfected CHO(αβ-py) cells (Fig. 1B). H-Ras(G12V) and the effector mutant T35S both stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation as detected by anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (clone MAPK-YT; 4.6 ± 0.6- and 3.2 ± 0.5-fold increase (mean ± S.E.) compared with vector, respectively; n = three independent experiments) (Fig. 1B). As expected, the effector mutants E37G and Y40C did not stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation above that in control transfected cells (0.9 ± 0.2- and 1.1 ± 0.2-fold change, respectively). Transfection of the H-Ras mutants did not alter the level of ERK2 expression in these transfected cells. Fig. 1C shows the effect of H-Ras(G12V/E37G) expression in the CHO(αβ-py) cell assay. Expression of H-Ras(G12V/E37G) caused a marked reduction in PAC-1 binding, resulting in a leftward shift in the highly transfected cell population (Fig. 1C, upper quadrants). The untransfected/poorly transfected cell population (Fig. 1C, lower quadrants) did not display any significant change in PAC-1 binding. PAC-1 binding to the chimeric integrin in CHO(αβ-py) cells was inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 1C, left panel). In contrast, H-Ras(G12V/E37G)-transfected cells in the presence of Mn2+ displayed a slight rightward shift in the whole cell population as a result of increased PAC-1 binding (Fig. 1C, right panel). The ability of Mn2+ to override H-Ras(G12V/E37G) suppression of PAC-1 binding by activating integrins indicates that the effect of H-Ras is not due to changes in integrin expression in this system, but rather to suppression of integrin activity. These results suggest that H-Ras(G12V) mediates integrin suppression by two separate effector pathways: a Raf/ERK-dependent signaling pathway utilized by T35S and a Raf/ERK-independent pathway utilized by E37G.
