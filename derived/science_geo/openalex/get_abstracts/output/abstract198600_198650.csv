Neither descriptions of cytological changes of lymphocytes in lymphatic tissues during antibody production1, nor the proof of release of γ-globulin from lymphoid cells2, nor the demonstration of antibodies in tissue cultures of pure lymphocytes immunized in vivo 3 could reveal whether lymphocytes are producers or only carriers of antibodies. An attempt was made, therefore, to obtain antibody production after contact of lymphocytes from rabbit lymph with antigen in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1975839908,"RECENTLY, Sterzl1 used newborn animals as recipients for the transfer of tissues producing antibodies as infant animals cannot produce antibodies after administration of antigens during the early postnatal period2. This experimental model has been used successfully by Mitchison3, who evoked antibody production in chicks after transfer of spleen tissue from strongly immunized hens. Dixon and Weigle4, however, were unable to demonstrate the usefulness of infant animals for the demonstration of antibody formation after transfer of tissues from animals immunized 24 hr. previously. In further work, when cells mixed with antigen in vitro were transferred, results were again negative5. In the work reported here, the possibility of using infant animals soon after birth as recipients was tested."

Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine derivative, which is used medicinally as a potent depressant for the interbrain. Aron, Guelfi and Voisin2 reported an atonic effect of this drug on the sensibility of the pituitary gland induced by stress."

https://openalex.org/W2052888877,"DURING the course of studies on the synthesis of sulphate esters an opportunity was taken to obtain evidence to support the suggestion1 that the type II mammalian arylsulphatases (arylsulphatases A and B)2 were unlikely to be directly involved in the synthesis of arylsulphates by particle-free mammalian liver preparations. It has already been pointed out3 that the type I arylsulphatase of mammalian livers (arylsulphatase C) cannot be directly involved in this synthetic process since the enzyme is microsomal in origin and highly insoluble. Similar considerations do not apply to the type II enzymes, however, since although they are mainly associated with the so-called ‘light mitochondria’, appreciable amounts are always present in preparations of the soluble components of the liver cell4."

https://openalex.org/W2010508148,"IN the course of an investigation of the complement and antibody activities of animal sera (to be reported elsewhere) the effect of several agents on the serum protein has been examined by paper electrophoresis. It has recently been demonstrated that while controlled heat modified in various ways the electrophoretic pattern of serum protein it also affected differently the reactiveness of the serum with complement1. It has also been reported2 that ultra-violet irradiation of immune serum would either impair or completely destroy the ability to lyse, to agglutinate, to combine with toxins, to precipitate, to fix complement, or to confer passive anaphylaxis."

https://openalex.org/W2002038728,"FOUR groups of rats were employed in studying the influence of glucose-1-phosphate on liver steatosis, induced by a high-fat, low-protein diet in rats: one, which served as control, was on a normal diet, and the remaining groups were placed on the steatogenous diet of Handler1 for 30 days. Of the latter groups one did not receive any treatment, one was treated with 3 gm./kgm. of glucose per os daily and the last one was treated with 3 gm./kgm. of glucose-1-phosphate daily. Treatment with glucose or glucose-1-phosphate was started 15 days after the administration of the steatogenous diet. The effect of treatment was studied by determining the liver content of total lipids, glycogen and easily hydrolysable phosphorus."

https://openalex.org/W2024781833,"MOLYBDENUM complexed as silico-molybdate has been shown to be very active in the re-activation of aldehyde oxidase from which the molybdenum has been removed by dialysis1. Other reports have implicated silicate, phosphate and other anions as agents which increase the activity of molybdate -dependent enzymes2,3. Jacobs and Sanadi4 suggested that a silico-molybdate complex was involved in a terminal electron transport system that was coupled with phosphorylation. It was shown by Glenn and Crane5, however, that the in vivo functioning of aldehyde oxidase was probably not dependent on silico-molybdate even though it did greatly enhance the activity of the in vitro system."
https://openalex.org/W2099044787,"THE first X-ray diffraction studies of the α–β transformation in keratin were made by Herzog and Jancke1 and Astbury and Street2. Since then it has occupied a pivotal position in all attempts to determine the molecular structure of proteins. Recently, Bendit3 has reported the variation of the peak intensity of the 5.1 A., 4.6 A. and 9.8 A. reflexions against percentage extension for Lincoln wool and concluded therefrom that Astbury's hypothesis of a molecular transformation based on a 1:1 correspondence of the intensity variation of the first two reflexions is not tenable. However, no quantitative X-ray study of the degree of order introduced with extension has been yet reported."
