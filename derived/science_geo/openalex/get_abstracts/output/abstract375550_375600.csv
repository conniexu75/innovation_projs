https://openalex.org/W2051165598,"Abnormal activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway is a feature of many human cancers, making it an attractive target for antitumour therapy. Several RAF and MEK inhibitors are in clinical trials, but an unexpected complication has emerged. Although selective BRAF inhibitors are effective in treating mutant BRAF melanoma, in which they potently suppress RAF-MEK-ERK signalling, the same inhibitors are ineffective against tumours that carry an oncogenic mutation in the KRAS gene. Two groups now report that the reason for this dramatic difference is that RAF 'inhibitors' have dual activity, functioning as either inhibitors or activators of RAF, depending on the cellular context and mutational status of RAF. In News & Views, Karen Cichowski and Pasi Jänne discuss the mechanistic and clinical implications of these findings and similar work reported in Cell. The RAS–RAF signalling pathway is an attractive target for drug development in oncology, and several RAF inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials. Here and in an accompanying paper, RAF inhibitors are shown to have opposing roles, functioning as either inhibitors or activators of RAF depending on the cellular context and mutational status of RAF. The mechanistic basis for these opposing roles is dissected. The results have implications for the clinical use of these inhibitors and for the design of kinase inhibitors. Activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF are found in more than 30% of all human tumours and 40% of melanoma, respectively, thus targeting this pathway could have broad therapeutic effects1. Small molecule ATP-competitive RAF kinase inhibitors have potent antitumour effects on mutant BRAF(V600E) tumours but, in contrast to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, are not potent against RAS mutant tumour models, despite RAF functioning as a key effector downstream of RAS and upstream of MEK2,3. Here we show that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors have two opposing mechanisms of action depending on the cellular context. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAF inhibitors effectively block the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and decrease tumour growth. Notably, in KRAS mutant and RAS/RAF wild-type tumours, RAF inhibitors activate the RAF–MEK–ERK pathway in a RAS-dependent manner, thus enhancing tumour growth in some xenograft models. Inhibitor binding activates wild-type RAF isoforms by inducing dimerization, membrane localization and interaction with RAS–GTP. These events occur independently of kinase inhibition and are, instead, linked to direct conformational effects of inhibitors on the RAF kinase domain. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrate that ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can have opposing functions as inhibitors or activators of signalling pathways, depending on the cellular context. Furthermore, this work provides new insights into the therapeutic use of ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2110776599,"Histones and Alternative Splicing Alternative splicing—the inclusion of different combinations of gene exons within a messenger RNA transcript—occurs in the majority of human genes and is regulated by basal and tissue-specific splicing factors, by transcription kinetics, and by chromatin structure. Luco et al. (p. 996 , published online 4 February) analyzed the alternative splicing of the human fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene in tissue culture cells and found that inclusion of exon IIIb or IIIc was modulated by the levels of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3-K36me3) and H3-K4me3. Histone H3-K36me3 enrichment correlated with binding of the chromatin protein, MRG15. The MRG15 protein in turn recruited the polypyrimidine tract–binding protein (PTB) splicing factor, which acts to repress alternative exon inclusion, thus establishing a direct link between histone modifications and the splicing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1966438745,"The M2 protein of influenza A virus is a membrane-spanning tetrameric proton channel targeted by the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine. Resistance to these drugs has compromised their effectiveness against many influenza strains, including pandemic H1N1. A recent crystal structure of M2(22-46) showed electron densities attributed to a single amantadine in the amino-terminal half of the pore, indicating a physical occlusion mechanism for inhibition. However, a solution NMR structure of M2(18-60) showed four rimantadines bound to the carboxy-terminal lipid-facing surface of the helices, suggesting an allosteric mechanism. Here we show by solid-state NMR spectroscopy that two amantadine-binding sites exist in M2 in phospholipid bilayers. The high-affinity site, occupied by a single amantadine, is located in the N-terminal channel lumen, surrounded by residues mutated in amantadine-resistant viruses. Quantification of the protein-amantadine distances resulted in a 0.3 A-resolution structure of the high-affinity binding site. The second, low-affinity, site was observed on the C-terminal protein surface, but only when the drug reaches high concentrations in the bilayer. The orientation and dynamics of the drug are distinct in the two sites, as shown by (2)H NMR. These results indicate that amantadine physically occludes the M2 channel, thus paving the way for developing new antiviral drugs against influenza viruses. The study demonstrates the ability of solid-state NMR to elucidate small-molecule interactions with membrane proteins and determine high-resolution structures of their complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2024290860,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is caused by a BCR-ABL fusion that generates a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Although inhibition of tyrosine kinase with imatinib has been used successfully for CML therapy, it does not deplete the leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) that drive the recurrence of CML. Naka et al. show that Foxo3a plays an essential role in the maintenance of LICs in CML, and that TGF-β is a critical regulator of Akt activation in LICs and controls Foxo3a localization. They also show that treatment of LICs in human CML with a TGF-β inhibitor impairs their colony-forming ability in vitro. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a BCR-ABL fusion, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that, it is believed, leads to suppression of the forkhead O transcription factors (FOXO). Although the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is a breakthrough for CML therapy, imatinib does not deplete the leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) that drive the recurrence of CML. Foxo3a is now shown to have an essential role in the maintenance of CML LICs in a mouse model. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is caused by a defined genetic abnormality that generates BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase1. It is widely believed that BCR-ABL activates Akt signalling that suppresses the forkhead O transcription factors (FOXO), supporting the proliferation or inhibiting the apoptosis of CML cells2,3,4. Although the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is a breakthrough for CML therapy, imatinib does not deplete the leukaemia-initiating cells (LICs) that drive the recurrence of CML5,6,7,8. Here, using a syngeneic transplantation system and a CML-like myeloproliferative disease mouse model, we show that Foxo3a has an essential role in the maintenance of CML LICs. We find that cells with nuclear localization of Foxo3a and decreased Akt phosphorylation are enriched in the LIC population. Serial transplantation of LICs generated from Foxo3a+/+ and Foxo3a-/- mice shows that the ability of LICs to cause disease is significantly decreased by Foxo3a deficiency. Furthermore, we find that TGF-β is a critical regulator of Akt activation in LICs and controls Foxo3a localization. A combination of TGF-β inhibition, Foxo3a deficiency and imatinib treatment led to efficient depletion of CML in vivo. Furthermore, the treatment of human CML LICs with a TGF-β inhibitor impaired their colony-forming ability in vitro. Our results demonstrate a critical role for the TGF-β–FOXO pathway in the maintenance of LICs, and strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms that specifically maintain CML LICs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2016606965,"Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the CHD (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding domain) member CHD7, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller homologous to the Drosophila trithorax-group protein Kismet, result in a complex constellation of congenital anomalies called CHARGE syndrome, which is a sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by malformations of the craniofacial structures, peripheral nervous system, ears, eyes and heart. Although it was postulated 25 years ago that CHARGE syndrome results from the abnormal development of the neural crest, this hypothesis remained untested. Here we show that, in both humans and Xenopus, CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest (NC), a transient cell population that is ectodermal in origin but undergoes a major transcriptional reprogramming event to acquire a remarkably broad differentiation potential and ability to migrate throughout the body, giving rise to craniofacial bones and cartilages, the peripheral nervous system, pigmentation and cardiac structures. We demonstrate that CHD7 is essential for activation of the NC transcriptional circuitry, including Sox9, Twist and Slug. In Xenopus embryos, knockdown of Chd7 or overexpression of its catalytically inactive form recapitulates all major features of CHARGE syndrome. In human NC cells CHD7 associates with PBAF (polybromo- and BRG1-associated factor-containing complex) and both remodellers occupy a NC-specific distal SOX9 enhancer and a conserved genomic element located upstream of the TWIST1 gene. Consistently, during embryogenesis CHD7 and PBAF cooperate to promote NC gene expression and cell migration. Our work identifies an evolutionarily conserved role for CHD7 in orchestrating NC gene expression programs, provides insights into the synergistic control of distal elements by chromatin remodellers, illuminates the patho-embryology of CHARGE syndrome, and suggests a broader function for CHD7 in the regulation of cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2005710199,"Obesity is a highly heritable disorder but the genetic associations reported to date account for only a small percentage of the inherited variation in body mass index. Two groups report deletions on chromosome16p11.2 that may explain part of the 'missing heritability' in terms of 'high-penetrance' mutations that are rare but when present are very often associated with severe obesity. This is in contrast to more common gene defects that are less closely associated with clinical symptoms. Bochukova et al. identified rare recurrent copy number variants in 300 patients with severe early-onset obesity, caused by deletions involving several genes including SH2B1, known to be involved in leptin and insulin signalling. Many of the patients also suffered neurodevelopmental disorders. Walters et al. identified deletions of at least 593 kilobases on chromosome 16p11.2 in 31 patients with a previously unrecognized type of extreme obesity. The strategy they used to identify the lesion — using small well-phenotyped cohorts of extreme phenotypes with targeted follow-up in genome-wide association studies and population cohorts — shows promise as a means of identifying 'missing heritability' in complex metabolic diseases more generally. Recently, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified as being associated with obesity, but these loci together account for only a small fraction of the known heritable component. Here, an association is reported between rare deletions of at least 593 kilobases at 16p11.2 and a highly penetrant form of obesity. The strategy used of combining study of extreme phenotypes with targeted follow-up is promising for identifying missing heritability in obesity. Obesity has become a major worldwide challenge to public health, owing to an interaction between the Western ‘obesogenic’ environment and a strong genetic contribution1. Recent extensive genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with obesity, but these loci together account for only a small fraction of the known heritable component1. Thus, the ‘common disease, common variant’ hypothesis is increasingly coming under challenge2. Here we report a highly penetrant form of obesity, initially observed in 31 subjects who were heterozygous for deletions of at least 593 kilobases at 16p11.2 and whose ascertainment included cognitive deficits. Nineteen similar deletions were identified from GWAS data in 16,053 individuals from eight European cohorts. These deletions were absent from healthy non-obese controls and accounted for 0.7% of our morbid obesity cases (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg m-2 or BMI standard deviation score ≥ 4; P = 6.4 × 10-8, odds ratio 43.0), demonstrating the potential importance in common disease of rare variants with strong effects. This highlights a promising strategy for identifying missing heritability in obesity and other complex traits: cohorts with extreme phenotypes are likely to be enriched for rare variants, thereby improving power for their discovery. Subsequent analysis of the loci so identified may well reveal additional rare variants that further contribute to the missing heritability, as recently reported for SIM1 (ref. 3). The most productive approach may therefore be to combine the ‘power of the extreme’4 in small, well-phenotyped cohorts, with targeted follow-up in case-control and population cohorts."

In response to environmental stress, eukaryotic cells activate stress response programs that down-regulate energy-expensive processes, such as transcription and translation. These regulatory programs reduce the expression of common housekeeping genes while increasing the expression of genes that repair stress-induced damage and promote cell survival. At the level of translation, this is achieved by exploiting the differential sensitivity of mRNAs to changes in the availability or activity of general initiation factors, such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) 3The abbreviations used are: eIF2αeukaryotic translation initiation factor 2αANGangiogenintiRNAtRNA-derived stress-induced RNASGstress granulePBprocessing bodyP-3′-tiRNA and P-5′-tiRNAphosphorylated 3′ and 5′-tiRNA, respectivelyHRIheme-regulated inhibitor kinaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineSAsodium arsenitencRNAnon-coding RNA.

Phosphorylation of eIF2α by one of several stress-activated kinases reduces the availability of the eIF2-GTP-tRNAiMet ternary complex to inhibit translation initiation. This reduces the translation of most transcripts but enhances the translation of transcripts possessing regulatory upstream open reading frames, such as transcription factor ATF4, a component of the integrated stress response program. Thus, phospho-eIF2α triggers a profound reprogramming of cellular protein synthesis that helps cells adapt to adverse environmental conditions. eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α angiogenin tRNA-derived stress-induced RNA stress granule processing body phosphorylated 3′ and 5′-tiRNA, respectively heme-regulated inhibitor kinase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline sodium arsenite non-coding RNA.

ANG secretion is stimulated by hypoxia, suggesting that it may serve as a stress-induced paracrine factor that protects neighboring cells from deleterious effects of stress. In a previous study, we showed that stress promotes ANG-mediated tRNA cleavage to produce tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) (4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Cleavage occurs preferentially in the anticodon loop of mature tRNA to produce 5′- and 3′-fragments (5′- and 3′-tiRNAs, respectively). The addition of recombinant wild type but not RNase-inactive mutant ANG to cultured cells promotes tiRNA production and inhibition of protein synthesis. Thus, the ribonuclease activity of ANG is absolutely required for its angiogenic and cytoprotective properties as well as for tiRNA production and repression of translation. Moreover, transfection of 5′-tiRNAs but not 3′-tiRNAs inhibits translation in cultured cells. Importantly, tiRNAs inhibit protein translation in an eIF2α-independent manner (4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), suggesting that ANG and tiRNAs may activate complementary components of an integrated stress response program. Stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits translation and promotes the assembly of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic foci at which untranslated mRNPs are transiently concentrated (14.Anderson P. Kedersha N. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R397-R398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). SGs contain stalled 48 S preinitiation complexes that remain after elongating ribosomes have run off their transcripts. SGs are assembled in a phospho-eIF2α-independent manner by the xenobiotic agents pateamine A and hippuristanol, compounds that inhibit the RNA helicase activity of initiation factor eIF4A to prevent 48 S scanning (15.Bordeleau M.E.

Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) suggests that they might also inhibit 48 S scanning. If so, tiRNAs, like pateamine A and hippuristanol, should induce phospho-eIF2α independent assembly of SGs. Indeed, we find that transfection of natural 5′-tiRNAs but not 3′-tiRNAs induces phospho-eIF2α-independent SG assembly in cultured cell lines. Transfection of synthetic 5′-tiRNAAla also inhibits protein synthesis and induces SG assembly, processes that are enhanced by the presence of a 5′-monophosphate modification. Although recombinant ANG does not induce SG assembly on its own, it enhances the assembly of sodium arsenite and pateamine A-induced SGs. Taken together, our data implicate ANG, tiRNAs, and SGs in a phospho-eIF2α-independent stress response program.

The 3′-end-biotinylated counterparts of these RNAs were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Cells were transfected with DNA plasmids, siRNAs, or tiRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Before transfection, DNA or RNA complexes were preincubated in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM medium; Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature. For DNA plasmid transfections, U2OS cells were grown to ∼50% confluence in a 10-cm dish and then transfected with a total of 3 μg of each DNA plasmid complexed with 3 μl of Lipofectamine; 36 h post transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated 24 h prior to immunofluorescence experiments (see “Immunofluorescence Microscopy”). For siRNA transfections, U2OS cells (1.5 × 105/well) were plated in 6-well plates and grown to about 30% confluence, and 6 h later, they were transfected with 40 nm HRI siRNA or control siRNA using 2 μl of Lipofectamine. Two days after siRNA transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated for immunofluorescence experiments (see “Immunofluorescence Microscopy”). For tiRNA transfection, U2OS cells (0.9 × 105/well) were plated in 24-well plates for 24 h and then transfected with 750 nm synthetic or natural tiRNAs using 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine. tiRNA extraction from ANG-treated cells was done as previously described (4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). U2OS cells (1 × 105/well) were plated in 24-well plates and 24 h later were incubated with metabolic labeling medium (DME without l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, l-methionine, or l-cystine (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Fisher). After 30 min, fresh metabolic labeling medium containing ∼200 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (EasyTag Express 35S Protein Labeling Mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and wild type or P112L mutant ANG (0.5 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 70 μm sodium arsenite or 15 nm pateamine A was added to each well, and cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To extract proteins, cells were washed three times with PBS, harvested in 200 μl of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and then lysed with an ultrasonic sonicator (Branson). Proteins from clarified supernatants were precipitated by 60% acetone and resuspended in 70 μl of lysis buffer, and 10 μl of each sample was used to measure protein concentration or to count 35S incorporation. The amount of 35S incorporated into the whole cell protein was quantified with a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter), and the percentage of incorporation was calculated for each sample by dividing the counts of 35S incorporation by the concentration of total protein and then multiplying this value by 100. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) with a bovine serum albumin protein standard. Natural tiRNAs were purified as described (4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). 500 pmol of native tiRNAs or synthetic control RNAs were treated with Terminator 5′-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (Epicenter Biotechnologies) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation of RNA. The resulting RNA was separated by 15% urea-PAGE and stained with SYBR Gold. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 5 mm MES (Sigma), pH 6.2, and 2% SDS. Proteins were separated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes (0.45-μm pore size; Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked with 5% normal horse serum in 1× TBS at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with rabbit polyclonal phospho-eIF2α (serine 52) diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 5% normal horse serum overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times with 1× TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) (GE Healthcare). For the detection of actin, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in TBS containing 5% normal horse serum, followed by incubation with anti-mouse conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) (GE Healthcare). After washing, the specific proteins were detected using the Super Signal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce) and autoradiography on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells (9 × 104) were seeded onto coverslips (Fisher) and 24 h later were transfected with the indicated concentrations of natural or synthetic tiRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and/or treated with the indicated drugs. At various times, cells were fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized using 100% chilled methanol for 10 min. The cells were rinsed several times with PBS and incubated overnight with blocking buffer (5% normal horse serum in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide) at 4 °C. An appropriate primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (1:200 for anti-eIF3b, anti-eIF4G, anti-eIF4E, anti-TIAR, and anti-HuR; 1:1000 for anti-SK1-hedls, anti-RCK, anti-HA, and anti-FLAG M2; and 1:2000 for anti-G3BP antibody) was then added to the cells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, ML grade) diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted in polyvinyl mounting medium, and the cells were viewed and photographed with an Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope (Nikon) equipped with a digital camera (CCD-SPOT RT, Diagnostic Instruments) using a ×60 oil immersion objective. The images were merged and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop (version 10). To determine whether ANG promotes SG assembly, U2OS cells were treated with recombinant ANG in the absence or presence of mild oxidative stress (70 μm sodium arsenite (SA), a dose that induces SGs in less than 20% of cells) for 45 min. The cells were fixed, stained for SG markers (eIF4E, G3BP, and eIF3b), and visualized using fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1, neither wild type ANG nor the inactive P112L mutant (21.Wu D. Yu W. Kishikawa H. Folkerth R.D. Iafrate A.J. Shen Y. Xin W. Sims K. Hu G.F. Ann Neurol. 2007; 62: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) induced SG assembly in the absence of stress (Fig. 1, B and E). In cells treated with low dose arsenite, wild type (but not mutant) ANG significantly increased the number of cells with SGs (Fig. 1, D and E). Wild type but not mutant ANG similarly enhanced pateamine A-induced SG assembly (Fig. 1E), indicating that it potentiates phospho-eIF2α-dependent and independent inducers of SG assembly. We confirmed that wild type but not mutant ANG significantly inhibited protein synthesis (Fig. 1F). The combination of ANG and sodium arsenite or pateamine A did not significantly inhibit protein synthesis more than either treatment alone (Fig. 1F). The finding that ANG inhibits protein synthesis but does not induce SG assembly suggests that a second signal is required for untranslated mRNPs to aggregate at SGs. We have found that stress-induced glycosylation of ribosomal proteins is required for the aggregation of untranslated mRNPs at SGs but not for stress-induced translational repression per se (23.Ohn T. Kedersha N. Hickman T. Tisdale S. Anderson P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This may be one of the stress-induced second signals playing a role in ANG-induced SG assembly. We previously reported that transfection of 5′- but not 3′-ANG-induced natural tiRNAs inhibits protein synthesis in U2OS cells (4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To determine whether this result correlates with the assembly of SGs, we transfected U2OS cells with natural 5′-tiRNAs (Fig. 2C) or 3′-tiRNAs (Fig. 2B) or control RNAs (Fig. 2A; 750 nm final concentrations) using Lipofectamine 2000. Time course analysis revealed that optimal induction of SGs occurred 7 h after transfection (data not shown). At this time point, immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies reactive with SG markers (G3BP and eIF3b) identified very few non-transfected (Fig. 2D), control RNA-transfected (Fig. 2, A and D), or natural 3′-tiRNA-transfected (Fig. 2, B and D) cells with SGs. In contrast, SGs were observed in ∼5% of cells transfected with natural 5′-tiRNAs (Fig. 2C, yellow arrows and Fig. 2D). These data reveal that tiRNA-induced translational repression correlates with SG assembly in a small percentage of cells. Because mature tRNAs are the precursor of tiRNAs, it is likely that 5′- but not 3′-tiRNAs possess a monophosphate modification at their 5′-ends. To test this prediction, we treated natural 5′- and 3′- tiRNAs or control RNAs with 5′-terminal monophosphate exoribonuclease. Although 5′-hydroxyl-containing synthetic RNAs corresponding to 5′- or 3′-halves of tRNAAla (5-OH 5′-tiRNAAla and 5′-OH 3′-tiRNAAla; Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 7 and 8, respectively) were not degraded, the 5′-monophosphate-modified 5′-tiRNAAla was degraded by this enzyme (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, natural 5′-tiRNAs (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6) but not 3′-tiRNAs (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10) were degraded by this enzyme. Thus, 5′- but not 3′-tiRNAs possess 5′-terminal monophosphate modifications. Transfection of natural 5′-tiRNAs into U2OS cells represses translation and promotes the assembly of SGs. Although the majority of these natural RNAs correspond to tRNA halves (3.Fu H. Feng J. Liu Q. Sun F. Tie Y. Zhu J. Xing R. Sun Z. Zheng X. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), minor non-tRNA-derived RNAs might contribute to the observed effects on translation and SG assembly. To determine whether 5′-tRNA halves are responsible for these effects, we tested the biological activities of synthetic 5′-tiRNAs. U2OS cells were transfected with synthetic 5′-monophosphate-modified RNA fragments corresponding to 5′-tiRNAVal (Fig. 3C), 5′-tiRNAGly (Fig. 3D), or 5′-tiRNAAla (Fig. 3E) (3.Fu H. Feng J. Liu Q. Sun F. Tie Y. Zhu J. Xing R. Sun Z. Zheng X. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) before processing for immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify SGs. SGs were observed in ∼3, ∼7, and ∼12% of cells transfected with P-5′-tiRNAVal, P-5′-tiRNAGly, and P-5′-tiRNAAla, respectively (Fig. 3, C–E (yellow arrows) and F). In contrast, few if any cells displaying SGs were observed in untreated, unphosphorylated control (ctrlRNA), 5′-phosphorylated control (P-ctrlRNA), or 3′-tiRNAAla-transfected cells (Fig. 3F). To determine whether the small percentage of cells with SGs was a consequence of inefficient transfection efficiency, U2OS cells were transfected with biotin-tagged control or tiRNAs before processing for immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize intracellular biotin (supplemental Fig. 1). Biotin RNA was visualized within endosomes in all cells, indicating that Lipofectamine-mediated RNA uptake is highly efficient. It is possible that the low percentage of tiRNA-induced SGs is a consequence of inefficient egress of tiRNAs from endosomes. A dose-response analysis showed that 75 nm is the threshold for tiRNAAla-induced SG assembly (supplemental Fig. 2). Although the percentage of SGs increased with increasing concentrations of tiRNAAla, at most, 12% of transfected cells assembled SGs. This result suggests that egress from endosomes may well contribute to the low percentage of SGs in tiRNAAla transfected cells. It is also possible the rare cells that assemble SGs are somehow “primed” for SG assembly. This might involve heterogeneous expression of proteins that are required for SG assembly. We tested this possibility by surveying tiRNA-induced SG assembly in U2OS cells expressing recombinant proteins that are known to promote SG assembly (e.g. G3BP (24.Tourrière H. Chebli K. Zekri L. Courselaud B. Blanchard J.M. Bertrand E. Tazi J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), Tudor-SN (25.Scadden A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and ADAR (25.Scadden A.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); supplemental Fig. 3). The percentages of 5′-tiRNAAla-induced SGs in these cells are greater than that observed in the parental U2OS cells. Thus, the poor efficiency of tiRNA-induced SG assembly may reflect heterogeneity in the expression of key SG proteins. The ability of synthetic 5′-tiRNAs to induce the assembly of SGs confirms that the effects of natural 5′-tiRNAs are not due to non-tRNA contaminants. To determine whether monophosphate modifications on 5′- but not 3′-tiRNAs contribute to bioactivity, U2OS cells were transfected with synthetic 5′-tiRNAAla with or without the 5′-phosphate modification. The 5′-monophosphate-modified version induced 4-fold more SG-positive cells than the unmodified version (data not shown) (Fig. 3F). Thus, 5′-end phosphorylation of 5′-tiRNAAla enhances its ability to induce SG assembly. To confirm that the granules induced by 5′-tiRNAs are bona fide SGs, we determined the effect of emetine, a drug that inhibits SG assembly by preventing polysome disassembly (26.Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), on 5′-tiRNAAla-induced SG assembly. U2OS cells were mock-transfected or transfected with synthetic P-5′-tiRNAAla (Fig. 4, C and D) and then treated (Fig. 4, B and D) or not treated (Fig. 4, A and C) with 50 μg/ml emetine for 60 min. SGs (yellow arrows) were detected using eIF4G (green), G3BP (red), and eIF3b (blue). Mock-transfected cells treated with SA served as a positive control (Fig. 4A). Emetine inhibits the formation of SGs in cells transfected with P-5′-tiRNAAla (Fig. 4, D and E) to a similar extent as cells treated with SA (Fig. 4, B and E). The assembly of SGs induced by P-5′-tiRNAAla was confirmed using three additional SG markers, HuR, RCK, and TIAR (data not shown). No SGs were detected in cells transfected with either control RNA (P-ctrlRNA) or 3′-tiRNAAla (data not shown). Because SGs are found in physical association with processing bodies (PBs), an RNA granule linked to mRNA decay (27.Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), we used PBs as another marker to confirm that tiRNAs induce the assembly of bona fide SGs. SGs induced by natural 5′-tiRNA or synthetic 5′-tiRNAAla interact with PBs (Figs. 2C and 3E, insets, white arrowheads, respectively). These results indicate that 5′-tiRNAAla promotes canonical SG assembly. We next determined whether transfection of tiRNAs promotes SG assembly in cells treated with low doses of sodium arsenite. U2OS cells were transfected with natural 5′- or 3′-tiRNAs, synthetic tiRNAs (P-5′-tiRNAAla, or 3′-tiRNAAla), or control RNA (P-ctrlRNA) and then treated with low dose arsenite (70 μm, 60 min). Natural 5′-tiRNAs (Fig. 5A) and synthetic P-5′-tiRNAAla (Fig. 5B) significantly increased the arsenite-induced assembly of SGs. In contrast, natural 3′-tiRNAs (Fig. 5A), synthetic control RNA (Fig. 5B), and synthetic 3′-tiRNAAla (Fig. 5B) failed to promote arsenite-induced SG assembly. The finding that ANG treatment alone induces tiRNA production but not SG assembly suggests that Lipofectamine-mediated transfection imparts a mild stress that is required for tiRNA-induced SG assembly. Thus, ANG appears to lower the threshold for SG assembly. HRI phosphorylates eIF2α in response to SA treatment (28.McEwen E. Kedersha N. Song B. Scheuner D. Gilks N. Han A. Chen J.J. Anderson P. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16925-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We previously showed that phosphorylation of eIF2α is not required for the production of tiRNAs or for tiRNA-induced translational repression (4.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits translation initiation and promotes SG assembly (29.Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), we asked whether tiRNAs require phospho-eIF2α to promote SG assembly. U2OS cells transfected with control (D0) or HRI-directed siRNAs were subsequently retransfected with P-5′-tiRNAAla. Cells treated with SA (200 μm) were used as a positive control for phospho-eIF2α-dependent assembly of SGs, whereas cells treated with pateamine A (50 nm) were used as a control for phospho-eIF2α-independent assembly of SGs. As expected, HRI knockdown effectively prevented arsenite-induced SG assembly (supplemental Fig. 4). In contrast, SGs were assembled in both control and HRI knockdown cultures treated with pateamine A (supplemental Fig. 4) or transfected with P-5′-tiRNAAla (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 4). P-5′-tiRNAAla-induced SG assembly was similar in con"

To survive and evade host responses the parasite remodels the erythrocyte by exporting several hundred effector proteins beyond the surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane. A feature of exported proteins is a pentameric motif (RxLxE/Q/D) that is a substrate for an unknown protease. Here we show that the protein responsible for cleavage of this motif is plasmepsin V (PMV), an aspartic acid protease located in the endoplasmic reticulum. PMV cleavage reveals the export signal (xE/Q/D) at the amino terminus of cargo proteins. Expression of an identical mature protein with xQ at the N terminus generated by signal peptidase was not exported, demonstrating that PMV activity is essential and linked with other key export events. Identification of the protease responsible for export into erythrocytes provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention against this devastating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2075117194,"During their intraerythrocytic development, malaria parasites export hundreds of proteins to remodel their host cell. Nutrient acquisition, cytoadherence and antigenic variation are among the key virulence functions effected by this erythrocyte takeover. Proteins destined for export are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cleaved at a conserved (PEXEL) motif, which allows translocation into the host cell via an ATP-driven translocon called the PTEX complex. We report that plasmepsin V, an ER aspartic protease with distant homology to the mammalian processing enzyme BACE, recognizes the PEXEL motif and cleaves it at the correct site. This enzyme is essential for parasite viability and ER residence is essential for its function. We propose that plasmepsin V is the PEXEL protease and is an attractive enzyme for antimalarial drug development."

The necessary side-chain resonance assignment, however, is labor intensive and prone to error. Here we show that structures can be accurately determined without nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) information on the side chains for proteins up to 25 kilodaltons by incorporating backbone chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and amide proton distances into the Rosetta protein structure modeling methodology. These data, which are too sparse for conventional methods, serve only to guide conformational search toward the lowest-energy conformations in the folding landscape; the details of the computed models are determined by the physical chemistry implicit in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. The new method is not hindered by the deuteration required to suppress nuclear relaxation processes for proteins greater than 15 kilodaltons and should enable routine NMR structure determination for larger proteins."

We have used scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize electronic states in Ga1-xMnxAs samples close to this transition. Our measurements show that doping-induced disorder produces strong spatial variations in the local tunneling conductance across a wide range of energies. Near the Fermi energy, where spectroscopic signatures of electron-electron interaction are the most prominent, the electronic states exhibit a diverging spatial correlation length. Power-law decay of the spatial correlations is accompanied by log-normal distributions of the local density of states and multifractal spatial characteristics. Our method can be used to explore critical correlations in other materials close to a quantum critical point."
https://openalex.org/W2130430294,"Invasive species have tremendous detrimental ecological and economic impacts. Climate change may exacerbate species invasions across communities if non-native species are better able to respond to climate changes than native species. Recent evidence indicates that species that respond to climate change by adjusting their phenology (i.e., the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering) have historically increased in abundance. The extent to which non-native species success is similarly linked to a favorable climate change response, however, remains untested. We analyzed a dataset initiated by the conservationist Henry David Thoreau that documents the long-term phenological response of native and non-native plant species over the last 150 years from Concord, Massachusetts (USA). Our results demonstrate that non-native species, and invasive species in particular, have been far better able to respond to recent climate change by adjusting their flowering time. This demonstrates that climate change has likely played, and may continue to play, an important role in facilitating non-native species naturalization and invasion at the community level."

https://openalex.org/W2079532263,"Just as the funnel hypothesis is used to describe protein folding, it has been suggested that the process of RNA folding involves a rugged energy terrain in which the molecule samples different valleys until it finds the single lowest-energy state — the global minimum. In this study, Solomatin et al. report the surprising finding that a group I intron RNA can stably exist in one of several catalytically active native states (representing local minima). These RNA conformations are able to interconvert, which promises interesting new avenues of study to determine how this occurs, and how the different native states vary at the molecular level. The 'thermodynamic hypothesis' proposes that the sequence of a biological macromolecule defines its folded, active structure as a global energy minimum in the folding landscape; however, it is not clear whether there is only one global minimum or several local minima corresponding to active conformations. Here, using single-molecule experiments, an RNA enzyme is shown to fold into multiple distinct native states that interconvert. According to the ‘thermodynamic hypothesis’, the sequence of a biological macromolecule defines its folded, active (or ‘native’) structure as a global energy minimum in the folding landscape1,2. However, the enormous complexity of folding landscapes of large macromolecules raises the question of whether there is in fact a unique global minimum corresponding to a unique native conformation or whether there are deep local minima corresponding to alternative active conformations3. The folding of many proteins is well described by two-state models, leading to highly simplified representations of protein folding landscapes with a single native conformation4,5. Nevertheless, accumulating experimental evidence suggests a more complex topology of folding landscapes with multiple active conformations that can take seconds or longer to interconvert6,7,8. Here we demonstrate, using single-molecule experiments, that an RNA enzyme folds into multiple distinct native states that interconvert on a timescale much longer than that of catalysis. These data demonstrate that severe ruggedness of RNA folding landscapes extends into conformational space occupied by native conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1986057012,"Space-based infrared spectroscopy has successfully identified various molecules — H2O, CH4, CO2 and CO — in the atmospheres of 'hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets. Swain et al. now report ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b at near-infrared wavelengths not available to space-based telescopes. They find a bright emission feature at ∼3.25 μm which is unexpected and difficult to explain using current models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Fluorescence emission from methane, similar to that seen in the atmospheres of Solar System planets, seems a likely explanation. This work suggests that atmospheric chemistry on exoplanets is more complex than was thought, and opens the field of exoplanet molecular spectroscopy to ground-based telescopes. Infrared spectroscopy can probe the conditions and compositions of exoplanet atmospheres. Previous results relied on space-based telescopes that do not provide spectroscopic capability in the 2.4–5.2 μm spectral region. Here, ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD 189733b are reported between 2.0–2.4 μm and 3.1–4.1 μm; an unexpected feature at around 3.25 μm is found that is difficult to explain with models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, and is assigned to methane. Detection of molecules using infrared spectroscopy probes the conditions and compositions of exoplanet atmospheres. Water (H2O), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) have been detected1,2,3,4,5 in two hot Jupiters. These previous results relied on space-based telescopes that do not provide spectroscopic capability in the 2.4–5.2 μm spectral region. Here we report ground-based observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD 189733b between 2.0–2.4 μm and 3.1–4.1 μm, where we find a bright emission feature. Where overlap with space-based instruments exists, our results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements2,6. A feature at ∼3.25 μm is unexpected and difficult to explain with models that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions at the 1 bar to 1 × 10-6 bar pressures typically sampled by infrared measurements. The most likely explanation for this feature is that it arises from non-LTE emission from CH4, similar to what is seen in the atmospheres of planets in our own Solar System7,8,9. These results suggest that non-LTE effects may need to be considered when interpreting measurements of strongly irradiated exoplanets."
https://openalex.org/W2029137764,"Energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. The primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein's native structure. Theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. Simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. For some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. Where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. Such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the R15, R16 and R17 domains of alpha-spectrin. R15 folds approximately 3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. Here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of R16 and R17. We use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. Theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a 'normal' protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond-second, timescale."

https://openalex.org/W1990816072,"Background Second messengers have a key role in linking environmental stimuli to physiological responses. One such messenger, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), has long been known to be an essential signaling molecule in many different physiological processes in higher plants, including biotic stress responses. To date, however, the guanylyl cyclase (GC) enzymes that catalyze the formation of cGMP from GTP have largely remained elusive in higher plants. Principal Findings We have identified an Arabidopsis receptor type wall associated kinase–like molecule (AtWAKL10) as a candidate GC and provide experimental evidence to show that the intracellular domain of AtWAKL10431–700 can generate cGMP in vitro. Further, we also demonstrate that the molecule has kinase activity indicating that AtWAKL10 is a twin-domain catalytic protein. A co-expression and stimulus-specific expression analysis revealed that AtWAKL10 is consistently co-expressed with well characterized pathogen defense related genes and along with these genes is induced early and sharply in response to a range of pathogens and their elicitors. Conclusions We demonstrate that AtWAKL10 is a twin-domain, kinase-GC signaling molecule that may function in biotic stress responses that are critically dependent on the second messenger cGMP."

Thus, understanding the factors that induce myofibroblast differentiation is paramount to preventing fibrotic healing. Previous studies have shown that mechanical stress derived from the integrin-mediated interaction between extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton promotes myofibroblast differentiation. Integrin α11β1 is a collagen receptor on fibroblasts. To determine whether α11β1 can act as a mechanosensor to promote the myofibroblast phenotype, mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human corneal fibroblasts were utilized. We found that α11 mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts grown in attached three-dimensional collagen gels and conversely down-regulated in cells grown in floating gels. α11 up-regulation could be prevented by manually detaching the collagen gels or by cytochalasin D treatment. Furthermore, SB-431542, an inhibitor of signaling via ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7, prevented the up-regulation of α11 and the concomitant phosphorylation of Smad3 under attached conditions. In attached gels, TGF-β1 was secreted in its inactive form but surprisingly not further activated, thus not influencing α11 regulation. However, inhibition of activin A attenuated the up-regulation of α11. To determine the role of α11 in myofibroblast differentiation, human corneal fibroblasts were transfected with small interfering RNA to α11, which decreased α-smooth muscle actin expression and myofibroblast differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1986040852,"Background The lower incidence of breast cancer among Asian women compared with Western countries has been partly attributed to soy in the Asian diet, leading to efforts to identify the bioactive components that are responsible. Soy Bowman Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC) is a known cancer preventive agent now in human clinical trials. Methodology/Principal Findings The objectives of this work are to establish the presence and delineate the in vitro activity of lunasin and BBI found in BBIC, and study their bioavailability after oral administration to mice and rats. We report that lunasin and BBI are the two main bioactive ingredients of BBIC based on inhibition of foci formation, lunasin being more efficacious than BBI on an equimolar basis. BBI and soy Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor protect lunasin from in vitro digestion with pancreatin. Oral administration of 3H-labeled lunasin with lunasin-enriched soy results in 30% of the peptide reaching target tissues in an intact and bioactive form. In a xenograft model of nude mice transplanted with human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, intraperitoneal injections of lunasin, at 20 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg body weight, decrease tumor incidence by 49% and 33%, respectively, compared with the vehicle-treated group. In contrast, injection with BBI at 20 mg/kg body weight shows no effect on tumor incidence. Tumor generation is significantly reduced with the two doses of lunasin, while BBI is ineffective. Lunasin inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell death in the breast tumor sections. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that lunasin is actually the bioactive cancer preventive agent in BBIC, and BBI simply protects lunasin from digestion when soybean and other seed foods are eaten by humans."
https://openalex.org/W2077588880,"The cell surface receptor CED-1 mediates apoptotic cell recognition by phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we found that the C. elegans intracellular protein sorting complex, retromer, was required for cell corpse clearance by mediating the recycling of CED-1. Retromer was recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing cell corpses, and its loss of function caused defective cell corpse removal. The retromer probably acted through direct interaction with CED-1 in the cell corpse recognition pathway. In the absence of retromer function, CED-1 associated with lysosomes and failed to recycle from phagosomes and cytosol to the plasma membrane. Thus, retromer is an essential mediator of apoptotic cell clearance by regulating phagocytic receptor(s) during cell corpse engulfment."
https://openalex.org/W2034498004,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy state and a regulator of cellular homeostasis. In endothelial cells, AMPK is stimulated via the upstream kinases LKB1 and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKbeta). Previously, AMPK has been reported to activate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates AMPK in human and mice endothelial cells via CaMKKbeta. VEGF-induced AMPK activation is potentiated under conditions of energy deprivation induced by 2-deoxyglucose. To investigate the role of AMPK in endothelial function, CaMKKbeta, AMPKalpha1, or AMPKalpha2 was down-regulated by RNA interference, and studies in AMPKalpha1(-/-) mice were performed. We demonstrate that AMPK does not mediate eNOS phosphorylation at serine residue 1177 or 633, NO- dependent cGMP generation, or Akt phosphorylation in response to VEGF. Using inhibitors of eNOS or soluble guanylyl cyclase and small interfering RNA against eNOS, we show that NO does not act upstream of AMPK. Taken together, these data indicate that VEGF-stimulated AMPK and eNOS pathways act independently of each other. However, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, was phosphorylated in response to VEGF in an AMPKalpha1- and AMPKalpha2-dependent manner. Our results show that AMPKalpha1 plays an essential role in VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro (tube formation and sprouting from spheroids) and in vivo (Matrigel plug assay). In contrast, AMPKalpha2 was not involved in VEGF-triggered sprouting. The data suggest that AMPKalpha1 promotes VEGF-induced angiogenesis independently of eNOS, possibly by providing energy via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W2054682698,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (htt) protein, but the exact mechanism of HD pathogenesis remains uncertain. Recent evidence suggests that htt proteins with expanded polyglutamine tracts induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, probably by interfering with ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Here we report that mutant htt interacts and interferes with the function of gp78, an ER membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase (E3) involved in ERAD. Mapping studies showed that the HEAT repeats 2&3 of htt interact with the cue domain of gp78. The interaction competitively reduces polyubiquitinated protein binding to gp78 and also sterically blocks gp78 interaction of p97/VCP, a molecular chaperone that is essential for ERAD. These effects of htt negatively regulate the function of gp78 in ERAD and are aggravated by polyglutamine expansion. Paradoxically, gp78 is still able to ubiquitinate and facilitate degradation of htt proteins with expanded polyglutamine. The impairment of ERAD by mutant htt proteins is associated with induction of ER stress. Our studies provide a novel molecular mechanism that supports the involvement of ER stress in HD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2095512620,"Granins are major constituents of dense-core secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells, but their function is still a matter of debate. Work in cell lines has suggested that the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed granins, chromogranin A and B (CgA and CgB), are involved in granulogenesis and protein sorting. Here we report the generation and characterization of mice lacking chromogranin B (CgB-ko), which were viable and fertile. Unlike neuroendocrine tissues, pancreatic islets of these animals lacked compensatory changes in other granins and were therefore analyzed in detail. Stimulated secretion of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin was reduced in CgB-ko islets, in parallel with somewhat impaired glucose clearance and reduced insulin release, but normal insulin sensitivity in vivo. CgB-ko islets lacked specifically the rapid initial phase of stimulated secretion, had elevated basal insulin release, and stored and released twice as much proinsulin as wildtype (wt) islets. Stimulated release of glucagon and somatostatin was reduced as well. Surprisingly, biogenesis, morphology and function of insulin granules were normal, and no differences were found with regard to beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. We conclude that CgB is not required for normal insulin granule biogenesis or maintenance in vivo, but is essential for adequate secretion of islet hormones. Consequentially CgB-ko animals display some, but not all, hallmarks of human type-2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this defect remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2150859192,"RecJ is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-specific 5'-3' exonuclease that plays an important role in DNA repair and recombination. To elucidate how RecJ achieves its high specificity for ssDNA, we determined the entire structures of RecJ both in a ligand-free form and in a complex with Mn(2+) or Mg(2+) by x-ray crystallography. The entire RecJ consists of four domains that form a molecule with an O-like structure. One of two newly identified domains had structural similarities to an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold. The OB fold domain alone could bind to DNA, indicating that this domain is a novel member of the OB fold superfamily. The truncated RecJ containing only the core domain exhibited much lower affinity for the ssDNA substrate compared with intact RecJ. These results support the hypothesis that these structural features allow specific binding of RecJ to ssDNA. In addition, the structure of the RecJ-Mn(2+) complex suggests that the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by RecJ proceeds through a two-metal ion mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2085589224,"Background Rh glycoproteins (RhAG, RhBG, RhCG) are members of the Amt/Mep/Rh family which facilitate movement of ammonium across plasma membranes. Changes in ammonium transport activity following expression of Rh glycoproteins have been described in different heterologous systems such as yeasts, oocytes and eukaryotic cell lines. However, in these complex systems, a potential contribution of endogenous proteins to this function cannot be excluded. To demonstrate that Rh glycoproteins by themselves transport NH3, human RhCG was purified to homogeneity and reconstituted into liposomes, giving new insights into its channel functional properties. Methodology/Principal Findings An HA-tag introduced in the second extracellular loop of RhCG was used to purify to homogeneity the HA-tagged RhCG glycoprotein from detergent-solubilized recombinant HEK293E cells. Electron microscopy analysis of negatively stained purified RhCG-HA revealed, after image processing, homogeneous particles of 9 nm diameter with a trimeric protein structure. Reconstitution was performed with sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid lipids in the presence of the C12E8 detergent which was subsequently removed by Biobeads. Control of protein incorporation was carried out by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Particle density in liposomes was a function of the Lipid/Protein ratio. When compared to empty liposomes, ammonium permeability was increased two and three fold in RhCG-proteoliposomes, depending on the Lipid/Protein ratio (1/300 and 1/150, respectively). This strong NH3 transport was reversibly inhibited by mercuric and copper salts and exhibited a low Arrhenius activation energy. Conclusions/Significance This study allowed the determination of ammonia permeability per RhCG monomer, showing that the apparent PunitNH3 (around 1×10−3 µm3.s−1) is close to the permeability measured in HEK293E cells expressing a recombinant human RhCG (1.60×10−3 µm3.s−1), and in human red blood cells endogenously expressing RhAG (2.18×10−3 µm3.s−1). The major finding of this study is that RhCG protein is active as an NH3 channel and that this function does not require any protein partner."
https://openalex.org/W2160469216,"The identification of agents that preferentially kill cancer cells while protecting normal cells offers the potential to overcome toxicities found in many existing chemotherapeutic agents. Because p53 is frequently inactivated in cancer, agents that preferentially kill p53-null cells and protect wild-type p53-expressing cells are highly desirable chemotherapeutic agents. By using pairs of isogenic colon cancer cell lines that differ only in p53 expression (RKO and HCT116), securinine was found to exhibit these properties. Securinine (30 μM) induces apoptosis in 73% of p53-null HCT116 cells (LD50 17.5 μM) as opposed to 17.6% of HCT116 parental cells (LD50 50 μM) at 72 h after treatment. The mechanism of securinine-mediated death in p53-deficient cells involves the induction of the p53 family member, p73. Interestingly, the proapoptotic protein p73 is down-regulated in colon cancer cells expressing p53. This differential regulation of p73 in a p53-dependent fashion reveals a novel pathway for preferentially targeting cancer cells. In contrast to p53-deficient cells, cells expressing p53 are protected from cell death through the p53-mediated up-regulation of p21. These studies reveal a novel approach to specifically target colon cancer cells lacking p53 as well as identify a novel clinically relevant pathway to selectively induce p73 in p53-null cells.—Rana, S., Gupta, K., Gomez, J., Matsuyama, S., Chakrabarti, A., Agarwal, M.

https://openalex.org/W2075191021,"The presence of the 7-deazaguanosine derivative archaeosine (G(+)) at position 15 in tRNA is one of the diagnostic molecular characteristics of the Archaea. The biosynthesis of this modified nucleoside is especially complex, involving the initial production of 7-cyano-7-deazaguanine (preQ(0)), an advanced precursor that is produced in a tRNA-independent portion of the biosynthesis, followed by its insertion into the tRNA by the enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (arcTGT), which replaces the target guanine base yielding preQ(0)-tRNA. The enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of preQ(0) were recently identified, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing the conversion of preQ(0)-tRNA to G(+)-tRNA have remained elusive. Using a comparative genomics approach, we identified a protein family implicated in the late stages of archaeosine biosynthesis. Notably, this family is a paralog of arcTGT and is generally annotated as TgtA2. Structure-based alignments comparing arcTGT and TgtA2 reveal that TgtA2 lacks key arcTGT catalytic residues and contains an additional module. We constructed a Haloferax volcanii DeltatgtA2 derivative and demonstrated that tRNA from this strain lacks G(+) and instead accumulates preQ(0). We also cloned the corresponding gene from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (mj1022) and characterized the purified recombinant enzyme. Recombinant MjTgtA2 was shown to convert preQ(0)-tRNA to G(+)-tRNA using several nitrogen sources and to do so in an ATP-independent process. This is the only example of the conversion of a nitrile to a formamidine known in biology and represents a new class of amidinotransferase chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1989723272,"It has been shown that molecular interactions between site-specific chemical modifications such as acetylation and methylation on DNA-packing histones and conserved structural modules present in transcriptional proteins are closely associated with chromatin structural changes and gene activation. Unlike methyl-lysine that can interact with different protein modules including chromodomains, Tudor and MBT domains, as well as PHD fingers, acetyl-lysine (Kac) is known thus far to be recognized only by bromodomains. While histone lysine acetylation plays a crucial role in regulation of chromatin-mediated gene transcription, a high degree of sequence variation of the acetyl-lysine binding site in the bromodomains has limited our understanding of histone binding selectivity of the bromodomain family. Here, we report a systematic family-wide analysis of 14 yeast bromodomains binding to 32 lysine-acetylated peptides derived from known major acetylation sites in four core histones that are conserved in eukaryotes.The histone binding selectivity of purified recombinant yeast bromodomains was assessed by using the native core histones in an overlay assay, as well as N-terminally biotinylated lysine-acetylated histone peptides spotted on streptavidin-coated nitrocellulose membrane in a dot blot assay. NMR binding analysis further validated the interactions between histones and selected bromodomain. Structural models of all yeast bromodomains were built using comparative modeling to provide insights into the molecular basis of their histone binding selectivity.Our study reveals that while not all members of the bromodomain family are privileged to interact with acetylated-lysine, identifiable sequence features from those that bind histone emerge. These include an asparagine residue at the C-terminus of the third helix in the 4-helix bundle, negatively charged residues around the ZA loop, and preponderance of aromatic amino acid residues in the binding pocket. Further, while bromodomains exhibit selectivity for different sites in histones, individual interactions are of modest affinity. Finally, electrostatic interactions appear to be a primary determining factor that guides productive association between a bromodomain and a lysine-acetylated histone."
https://openalex.org/W2056292473,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABA(B)R), one of the family C G-protein-coupled receptor members, exists as a heterodimer comprised of subunits GB1 and GB2. To clarify the ligand-induced activation mechanism of the GABA(B)R, each subunit was fused with either Cerulean or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein at its intracellular loop, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) changes upon agonist application were monitored. As a result, FRET decreases were observed between GB1a loop 2 and GB2 loop 2 and between GB1a loop 2 and GB2 loop 1, suggesting the dissociation of intracellular domains during the receptor activation. Both intersubunit FRET pairs were expected to faithfully capture the activation of the original receptor as their pharmacological properties were highly similar to that of the wild-type receptor. However, the intrasubunit data suggest that the receptor activation does not involve major structural changes within the transmembrane domain of each subunit. By combining the results obtained from two different levels, it was concluded that the GABA(B)R activation by agonist is associated with an asymmetrical intersubunit rearrangement of GB1a and GB2 on the membrane. This type of activation mode, an intersubunit rearrangement without apparent intrahelical structural changes, appears commonly shared by the GABA(B)R and the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha, another family C G-protein-coupled receptor previously studied by our group. Nevertheless, the directions of intracellular domain movements and its asymmetry observed here highlight the qualitative difference between the two receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1975911433,"Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) functions in a complex with the GTPase dynamin-2 at clathrin-coated pits, where it provokes fission of vesicles to complete endocytosis. Here the SNX9.dynamin-2 complex binds to clathrin and adapter protein complex 2 (AP-2) that line these pits, and this occurs through interactions of the low complexity domain (LC4) of SNX9 with AP-2. Intriguingly, localization of the SNX9.dynamin-2 complex to clathrin-coated pits is blocked by interactions with the abundant glycolytic enzyme aldolase, which also binds to the LC4 domain of SNX9. The crystal structure of the LC4 motif of human SNX9 in complex with aldolase explains the biochemistry and biology of this interaction, where SNX9 binds near the active site of aldolase via residues 165-171 that are also required for the interactions of SNX9 with AP-2. Accordingly, SNX9 binding to aldolase is structurally precluded by the binding of substrate to the active site. Interactions of SNX9 with aldolase are far more extensive and differ from those of the actin-nucleating factor WASP with aldolase, indicating considerable plasticity in mechanisms that direct the functions of the aldolase as a scaffold protein."

https://openalex.org/W2033801220,"Background Specific immunological unresponsiveness to alloantigens can be induced in vivo by treating mice with a donor alloantigen in combination with a non-depleting anti-CD4 antibody. This tolerance induction protocol enriches for alloantigen reactive regulatory T cells (Treg). We previously demonstrated that alpha-1,2-mannosidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis and processing of N-linked glycoproteins, is highly expressed in tolerant mice, in both graft infiltrating leukocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Principal Findings In this study we have identified that alpha-1,2-mannosidase expression increases in CD25+CD4+ Treg when they encounter alloantigen in vivo. When alpha-1,2-mannosidase enzyme activity was blocked, Treg retained their capacity to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro but were unable to bind to physiologically relevant ligands in vitro. Further in vivo analysis demonstrated that blocking alpha-1,2-mannosidase in Treg resulted in the migration of significantly lower numbers to the peripheral lymph nodes in skin grafted mice following adoptive transfer, where they were less able to inhibit the proliferation of naïve T cells responding to donor alloantigen and hence unable prevent allograft rejection in vivo. Significance Taken together, our results suggest that activation of alloantigen reactive Treg results in increased alpha-1,2-mannosidase expression and altered N-glycosylation of cell surface proteins. In our experimental system, altered N-glycosylation is not essential for intrinsic Treg suppressive capacity, but is essential in vivo as it facilitates Treg migration to sites where they can regulate immune priming. Migration of Treg is central to their role in regulating in vivo immune responses and may require specific changes in N-glycosylation upon antigen encounter."

In this study, we used a phage display library to select peptides that interact with Ndst1, with the aim of finding inhibitors of the enzyme. The phage library consisted of cyclic random 10-mer peptides expressed in the phage capsid protein pIII. Selection was based on the ability of engineered phage to bind to recombinant murine Ndst1 (mNdst1) and displacement with heparin. Peptides that were enriched through multiple cycles of binding and disassociation displayed two specific sequences, CRGWRGEKIGNC and CNMQALSMPVTC. Both peptides inhibited mNdst1 activity in vitro, however, by distinct mechanisms. The peptide CRGWRGEKIGNC presents a chemokine-like repeat motif (BXX, where B represents a basic amino acid and X is a noncharged amino acid) and binds to heparan sulfate, thus blocking the binding of substrate to the enzyme. The peptide NMQALSMPVT inhibits mNdst1 activity by direct interaction with the enzyme near the active site. The discovery of inhibitory peptides in this way suggests a method for developing peptide inhibitors of heparan sulfate biosynthesis."

Coactivators and corepressors mediate the regulatory actions of SSTFs by a series of exchanged cofactor complexes that execute enzymatic modifications of nucleosomes and chromatin and interact with the basal transcription apparatus. Coactivators and corepressors are components of complexes that exhibit diverse enzymatic activities. These typically involve the covalent modification of histone tails by adding or removing acetyl, methyl, phosphate, ADP-ribose, ubiquitin, or small ubiquitin-like modifier moieties (23Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8087) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 counteracts the tendency of nucleosomal fibers to fold into higher order chromatin structures. Relaxed chromatin is more accessible to interacting proteins and active gene expression. Acetylation is mediated by a series of histone acetyl transferases including the CBP/p300 family. In contrast, histone deacetylases (HDACs) reduce gene expression by deacetylating lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of histone proteins, thereby encouraging chromatin compaction. HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 have also been found in both N-CoR and silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid-hormone receptor (SMRT) complexes (24Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J.

Pitx2 is first expressed in the ventrally located somatopleure at E8.5, which will become the abdominal wall, and follows myogenic expression in the trunk (27Shih H.P. Gross M.K. Kioussi C. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Pitx2 plays a critical role in jaw development by regulating Tbx1 (28Shih H.P. Gross M.K. Kioussi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5907-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is known that several T-box genes are expressed in and play essential roles in body wall development (11Chapman D.L. Garvey N. Hancock S. Alexiou M. Agulnik S.I. Gibson-Brown J.J. Cebra-Thomas J. Bollag R.J. Silver L.M. Papaioannou V.E. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We therefore examined T-box expression in Pitx2 mutants during abdominal wall development. Seven T-box genes were identified and validated as Pitx2 target genes. The genomic non-coding regions surrounding all of these genes showed clustered and conserved Pitx2 binding motifs within and outside of conserved and ultraconserved regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with abdominal tissue were used to demonstrate Pitx2 occupancy at all T-box target genes in vivo and compare Pitx2 occupancy at several sites scattered throughout the Pitx2-repressed Tbx1 and Pitx2-activated Tbx4 genes. The Pitx2 dependence of co-occupancy by coactivators (CBP and PCAF), corepressors (N-CoR, HDAC1, and HDAC3), and histone acetylation was also examined at these sites. Pitx2-dependent changes in chromatin were consistent with changes in expression for almost all sites in Pitx2-repressed T-box genes. In contrast, chromatin changes in Pitx2-activated T-box genes showed a less predictable pattern. The data were consistent with the model that Pitx2 represses its target genes by recruiting corepressors and HDACs at numerous genomic locations within these genes (7Kioussi C. Briata P. Baek S.H. Rose D.W. Hamblet N.S. Herman T. Ohgi K.A. Lin C. Gleiberman A. Wang J. Brault V. Ruiz-Lozano P. Nguyen H.D. Kemler R. Glass C.K. Wynshaw-Boris A. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 673-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The opposing Pitx2-dependent chromatin effects observed at different genomic sites in Tbx4 suggest that Pitx2 activates its target genes by more site-localized, or indirect, mechanisms.

Stained samples were photographed with a Discovery V8 Zeiss microscope and Axiocam camera system. cDNA or immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA (25 ng) was analyzed by qPCR using SYBR Green I methodology. DNA was preincubated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 32 s, extension at 72 °C for 32 s, and a final elongation step of 2 min at 72 °C. The melting curves of all samples were routinely determined by melting curve analysis to ascertain that only the expected products had been generated. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression levels. Primers used are listed in supplemental Table 1. Abdominal wall tissue was dissected from E10.5 mice, cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and followed by the addition of glycine (125 mm) to quench formaldehyde.

Following ethanol precipitation, the samples were resuspended (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS) and treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 45 °C. DNA was purified with QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and analyzed in a 7500 real-time PCR system using SYBR Green I to evaluate the relative abundance of sequences in input and IP material. Primers used are listed in supplemental Table 1. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (34Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) from abdominal tissue of E10.5 Pitx2+/+ mice. 100 μg of nuclear extract were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer IP150 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h to reduce nonspecific protein binding. After centrifugation, the precleared samples were incubated with 1 μg of antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with buffer IP350 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 350 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once with IP150, and resuspended in denaturing sample buffer. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. Gene expression analysis was used to identify Pitx2 target genes during development. Abdominal walls of E10.5 mice were obtained by cutting across embryos behind the forelimb and in front of the hindlimb. The neural tube and obvious internal organs were removed. The abdominal tissue from which total RNA was extracted therefore consisted predominantly of abdominal body wall and included somites. Total RNA was prepared from the abdominal walls of three pools of wild type (Pitx2+/+, WT), three pools of heterozygote (Pitx2+/LacZ, HET), and three pools of mutant (Pitx2LacZ/LacZ, MUT) embryos. Probes prepared from these RNA were applied to nine Mouse Genome 430a 2.0 microarrays. The results from all nine arrays were normalized by RMA. The average expression value obtained from three biological replicates was compared between genotypes. Array results have been deposited for public access at ArrayExpress under the accession number E-MEXP-2332 The arrays demonstrate that Pitx2 RNA levels decline significantly in the MUT isolates. Pitx2 expression was measured by two probe sets. Probe set 1424797-a-at, which was located within the 3′-non-translated region of Pitx2, produced a robust signal and showed 1.8-fold lower signal in MUT than WT or HET. A second Pitx2 probe set (1450482-a-at), which was located within the coding portion of the last exon, produced a 3-fold lower signal than the first probe and showed 4.7- and 4.3-fold lower signal in MUT than in WT or HET, respectively. Pitx2 levels were not significantly different in WT and HET arrays. Only 10 of ∼20,000 other genes showed higher -fold changes than Pitx2. Pitx2 affected the expression of many other genes at lower levels. Scatter plot comparisons of individual arrays showed fewer changes in internal comparisons, between replicate arrays from the same genotype, than in cross comparisons, between individual arrays from different genotypes (data not shown). The number of regulated genes can be estimated by permutation fold-scanning analysis (28Shih H.P. Gross M.K. Kioussi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5907-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Kioussi C. Gross M.K. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This non-parametric method counts probe set comparisons that fall above each -fold cutoff between conditions (cross comparisons) and within conditions (internal comparisons) and uses them to calculate the number of regulated genes as a function of -fold change or false discovery rate (FDR) (29Kioussi C. Gross M.K. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Kioussi C. Shih H.P. Loflin J. Gross M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18621-18626Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An FDR of 8% was calculated for WT versus MUT comparisons at a 1.7-fold cutoff. There were 600 probe sets that change above this cutoff, corresponding to ∼300 genes. An FDR of 9% FDR was calculated for HET versus MUT comparisons at this -fold cutoff, and 550 probe sets changed above the cutoff. In contrast, a minimum FDR of 55% was calculated at a 1.4-fold cutoff for WT versus MUT comparisons, and less than 50 probe sets changed above this cutoff (data not shown). Scatter plot comparisons between individual replicate arrays within conditions also showed that one of the three replicate arrays in each condition was different from the other two, which matched more closely. The outlier in each of the three conditions was the initial array that was produced for preliminary studies at a different time than the other two, suggesting a technical deviation. The latter two were therefore used to establish a list of putative T-box target genes (Table 1). T-box gene expression was consistently altered in all three replicates.TABLE 1Microarray expression measurements on all T-box genes in the mouse genomeMGI#aMouse Genome Informatics identification number.WTbAverage of two biological replicates from the probe set with the highest average signal across all six arrays.

Consequently, alteration of T-box gene expression was of particular interest to us in the abdominal wall context as well. All probe sets corresponding to T-box genes were therefore examined for Pitx2-dependent expression (Table 1). Tbx2, Tbx4, Tbx5, Tbx15, Tbx19, Tbx20, and Mga showed consistent, significant alterations of expression in different comparisons and/or with different probe sets. Six genes of the T-box family were selected as putative Pitx2 targets in the abdomen (Table 1, bold). Single probe sets for Tbx6 and Tbx1 showed little and/or insignificant change of expression in array data. These genes were selected for further analyses because of their known abdominal expression and interaction with Pitx2, respectively.

Assuming that public action can modify the prestige of a language in order to avoid language extinction, we analyze two cases: (i) the prestige can only take two values, (ii) it can take any value but its change at each time step is bounded. In both cases, we determine the viability kernel, that is, the set of states for which there exists an action policy maintaining the coexistence of the two languages, and we define such policies. We also study the resilience of the languages and identify configurations from where the system can return to the viability kernel (finite resilience), or where one of the languages is lead to disappear (zero resilience). Within our current framework, the maintenance of a bilingual society is shown to be possible by introducing the prestige of a language as a control variable."
https://openalex.org/W1986366812,"It has long been the goal of vector biology to generate genetic knowledge that can be used to ""manipulate"" natural populations of vectors to eliminate or lessen disease burden. While long in coming, progress towards reaching this goal has been made. Aiming to increase our understanding regarding the interactions between Plasmodium and the Anopheles immune genes, we investigated the patterns of genetic diversity of four anti-Plasmodium genes in the Anopheles gambiae complex of species.Within a comparative phylogenetic and population genetics framework, the evolutionary history of four innate immunity genes within the An. gambiae complex (including the two most important human malaria vectors, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis) is reconstructed. The effect of natural selection in shaping the genes' diversity is examined. Introgression and retention of ancestral polymorphisms are relatively rare at all loci. Despite the potential confounding effects of these processes, we could identify sites that exhibited dN/dS ratios greater than 1.In two of the studied genes, CLIPB14 and FBN8, several sites indicated evolution under positive selection, with CLIPB14 exhibiting the most consistent evidence. Considering only the sites that were consistently identified by all methods, two sites in CLIPB14 are adaptively driven. However, the analysis inferring the lineage -specific evolution of each gene was not in favor of any of the Anopheles lineages evolving under the constraints imposed by positive selection. Nevertheless, the loci and the specific amino acids that were identified as evolving under strong evolutionary pressure merit further investigation for their involvement in the Anopheles defense against microbes in general."
https://openalex.org/W2084746946,"Biological membrane fusion is a basic cellular process catalyzed by SNARE proteins and additional auxiliary factors. Yet, the critical mechanistic details of SNARE-catalyzed membrane fusion are poorly understood, especially during rapid synaptic transmission. Here, we systematically assessed the electrostatic forces between SNARE complex, auxiliary proteins and fusing membranes by the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation using explicit models of membranes and proteins. We found that a previously unrecognized, structurally preferred and energetically highly favorable lateral orientation exists for the SNARE complex between fusing membranes. This preferred orientation immediately suggests a novel and simple synaptotagmin-dependent mechanistic trigger of membrane fusion. Moreover, electrostatic interactions between membranes, SNARE complex, and auxiliary proteins appear to orchestrate a series of membrane curvature events that set the stage for rapid synaptic vesicle fusion. Together, our electrostatic analyses of SNAREs and their regulatory factors suggest unexpected and potentially novel mechanisms for eukaryotic membrane fusion proteins."

By sequence homology Aq793 is a member of the PcrA/UvrD/Rep helicase subfamily. We expressed Aae MutL and the putative A. aeolicus DNA helicase (Aq793) proteins in E. coli. Using synthetic oligonucleotide substrates, we observed that lower concentrations of Aq793 were required to unwind double-stranded DNA that had a 3′-poly(dT) overhang as compared with double-stranded DNA with a 5′-poly(dT) or lacking a poly(dT) tail. This unwinding activity was stimulated by adding Aae MutL with maximal stimulation observed at an ∼1.5:1 (MutL:Aq793) stoichiometric ratio. The enhancement of Aq793 helicase activity did not require the Aae MutL protein to retain endonuclease activity. Furthermore, the C-terminal 123 amino acid residues of Aae MutL were sufficient to stimulate Aq793 helicase activity, albeit at a significantly reduced efficacy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a human PMS2 homologue has been demonstrated to stimulate a PcrA/UvrD/Rep subfamily helicase, and this finding may further our understanding of the evolution of the mismatch repair pathway. Mismatch repair in Escherichia coli involves a number of proteins including MutL and UvrD. Eukaryotes also possess MutL homologues; however, no UvrD helicase homologues have been identified.

Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (2Schofield M.J. Hsieh P. Annu. Rev.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). MMR is therefore an important mechanism in the maintenance of genomic stability. The mechanism and major components of the Escherichia coli and human MMR pathways have been extensively studied (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 5Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 6Iyer R.R.

Res. 1988; 198: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In E. coli, MutS initiates MMR by binding to unpaired bases in duplex DNA. The mispair binding triggers an adenine nucleotide exchange in MutS and subsequent recruitment of MutL. The DNA-MutS-MutL complex stimulates the latent endonuclease activity of MutH that nicks the unmethylated strand at hemimethylated GATC (dam methylation) sites and thereby discriminates the daughter from the parental DNA strand. Interestingly, MutL is not only instrumental in activating the MutH endonuclease activity, it also stimulates UvrD helicase loading at the nick site, facilitating the displacement of the incorrect DNA strand. The displaced strand is finally hydrolyzed by exonucleases, and the ssDNA gap is stabilized by single-stranded binding protein. A complementary DNA strand is synthesized by polymerase III, and E. coli DNA ligase completes the repair. mismatch repair PcrA/UvrD/Rep double-stranded single-stranded human. One difference between E. coli and human mismatch repair is the absence of an identified MutH homologue in the latter organism. Furthermore, MutH homologues appear to be absent in a large number of bacteria and all eukaryotes that have been investigated. Modrich and co-workers (8Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 9Jiricny J. Cell. 2006; 126: 239-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) determined that the endonuclease activity in human MMR resides in the MutLα protein itself instead of a separate MMR component. This may be a general trend in organisms that lack MutH homologues as exemplified by studies in yeast (10Kadyrov F.A. Holmes S.F. Arana M.E. Lukianova O.A. O'Donnell M. Kunkel T.A. Modrich P. J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 12136-12145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MutL appears to stimulate UvrD helicase activity by increasing the UvrD affinity for DNA and thereby increasing its loading rate at a nick (12Matson S.W. Robertson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4089-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). E. coli MutL exists as a homodimer, has a weak ATPase activity, and has been reported to bind DNA (13Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The monomeric MutL protein can be divided into three domains: the N-terminal LN40, the linker, and the C-terminal LC20 regions. The highly conserved N-terminal LN40 domain contains the ATPase motif of the ATPase/kinase superfamily members, GHLK (14Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The LN40 domain is involved in ATP-dependent protein dimerization, perhaps causing the MutL protein to wrap around the DNA helix (15Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the LN40 region of MutL homologues is relatively well conserved between organisms regardless of whether MutH is present or absent in that species. The MutL C-terminal domain is not well conserved between organisms that possess or lack a MutH homologue. Human PMS2 (16Kosinski J. Plotz G. Guarné A. Bujnicki J.M. Friedhoff P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 610-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a subunit of human MutLα, has two notable motifs in the C-terminal domain that are absent in organisms that possess MutH. Mutations in the first motif, DQHAX2EX4E, were found to abolish the endonuclease activity of MutLα (8Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Similar mutations in hPMS2 homologues in yeast and thermophilic bacteria confirmed the importance of an intact DQHAX2EX4E motif for nicking activity (10Kadyrov F.A. Holmes S.F. Arana M.E. Lukianova O.A. O'Donnell M. Kunkel T.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37181-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Fukui K. Nishida M. Nakagawa N. Masui R.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of the second motif, CPHGRPI, is not well understood, although one study suggests that it is important in ATP responsiveness (11Fukui K. Nishida M. Nakagawa N. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12136-12145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MutL from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, a hPMS2 homologue, is known to possess endonuclease activity, and no MutH homologues have been discovered in this organism. E. coli helicase II, also known as UvrD helicase, is a member of the PcrA/UvrD/Rep (PUR) helicase subfamily and is involved in the nucleotide excision repair (18Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathways (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). UvrD is a motor protein capable of unwinding dsDNA in a multi-step, ATP hydrolysis-driven reaction while traveling on one DNA strand in the 3′ to 5′ direction (12Matson S.W. Robertson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4089-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Tomko E.J. Fischer C.J. Niedziela-Majka A. Lohman T.M. Mol.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). It is also an effective translocase with a reported processivity on ssDNA of >2 kb (19Tomko E.J. Fischer C.J. Niedziela-Majka A. Lohman T.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 335-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the MMR pathway, UvrD has its unwinding activity stimulated by the E. coli mismatch repair protein MutL (21Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 22Guarné A. Ramon-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and by the UvrAB complex in the nucleotide excision repair pathway (23Atkinson J. Guy C.P. Cadman C.J. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. McGlynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9612-9623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In MMR, this stimulation is correlated with the DNA binding activity of MutL (12Matson S.W. Robertson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4089-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Robertson A.B. Pattishall S.R. Gibbons E.A. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19949-19959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although UvrD is an important component of the E. coli methyl-directed MMR pathway, UvrD homologues are not involved in the nick-directed MMR pathway of yeast and human. E. coli UvrD shares ∼40% sequence similarity with another PUR helicase family member found in E. coli, the Rep protein. Furthermore, these proteins both form homodimers and display the same 3′ to 5′ polarity of DNA unwinding (25Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yarranton G.T. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Their primary physiological roles, however, appear to be different with UvrD involved in methyl-directed mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and recombinational processes and Rep playing a role in genomic DNA replication. There may be redundancy in function or exceptions in certain instances. For example, UvrD is required for the replication of certain plasmids in E. coli that utilize rolling circle replication (27Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Stimulation of helicases UvrD and Rep by MutL has been described for E. coli proteins (28Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); however, MutL has been reported unable to stimulate UvrD in the thermophilic bacteria Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis and Bacillus stearothermophilus, suggesting that the stimulation of helicase activity in PUR subfamily members may be specific to mesophilic bacteria (29An L. Tang W. Ranalli T.A. Kim H.J. Wytiaz J. Kong H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28952-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The T. tengcongensis MutL (Tte MutL) and B. stearothermophilus MutL (Bst MutL) C-terminal domains are well conserved with those from organisms lacking the endonuclease MutH. Both MutL homologues have in the C-terminal domain the distinctive heavy metal binding motif, DQHAX2EX4E, and the CPHGRPI motif characteristic of hPMS2 family members. A. aeolicus MutL (Aae MutL) also belongs to the hPMS2 family and carries a heavy metal binding motif responsible for its endonuclease activity. We have cloned and expressed in E. coli the putative ATP-dependent DNA helicase Aq793, Aae MutL, a truncated form of Aae MutL (Aae MutL-CTD) and an endonuclease-deficient mutant of Aae MutL (Aae MutL (E357K)). The PUR helicase subfamily homologue Aq793 was found to possess helicase activity in common with the homologues found in E. coli, B. stearothermophilus, and T. tengcongensis. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that a hPMS2-like MutL can stimulate the unwinding activity of a PUR subfamily helicase. The C-terminal domain alone was found to be sufficient to stimulate the helicase activity of Aq793, although significantly higher protein concentrations were required. Recombinant wild-type and mutant A. aeolicus MutL proteins were expressed fused to a C-terminal Mxe GyrA Intein tag in the pTWIN1 vector (30Evans Jr., T.C. Xu M.Q. Biopolymers. 1999; 51: 333-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (New England Biolabs, Inc.), whereas the A. aeolicus helicase (Aq793) protein was expressed with a hexahistidine tag. Protein expression was performed in the E. coli Rosetta™ (DE3) strain (Novagen®, Madison, WI) (F− ompT hsdSB(rB− mB−) gal dcm (DE3) pRARE2 (CamR)) and purified with either chitin affinity chromatography or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, respectively. MutL proteins were further purified using a Q column (GE Healthcare) and Aq793 with a heparin column. Both were eluted with a salt gradient from 0.05 to 0.3 m NaCl. Protein purity was assessed to be >95% by SDS-PAGE analysis. Three sets of synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were used to determine the helicase activity of Aq793 essentially as described previously (29An L. Tang W. Ranalli T.A. Kim H.J. Wytiaz J. Kong H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28952-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All of the dsDNAs were made of the same universal 23-mer top strand 5′-GCCCTGCTGCCGACCAACGAAGG-3′ annealed to 5′-ACCTTCGTTGGTCGGCAGCAGGGC-3′, 5′-(dT)40-ACCTTCGTTGGTCGGCAGCAGGGC-3′ or 5′-ACCTTCGTTGGTCGGCAGCAGGGC-(dT)40-3′ to form dsDNA substrates without a 40-nucleotide dT tail (dT40−), with a 5′ 40-nucleotide dT tail (5′-dT40), or with a 3′ 40-nucleotide dT tail (3′-dT40), respectively (see Fig. 1A). The top and bottom strands were annealed by mixing at a 1:1.5 (universal primer:variable primer) molar ratio in 1× ThermoPol reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and then heating to 95 °C followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. The substrates were labeled by strand extension using Klenow (exo−) (New England Biolabs, Inc.) containing [α-32P]dTTP and purified by size exclusion using Illustra™ MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). This previously reported protocol (25Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) adds a templated and a nontemplated [α-32P]dTTP to the 3′ ends of the oligonucleotide, permitting detection by autoradiography. The helicase reactions were performed by adding 0.02 nm radiolabeled duplex substrate in 1× Thermopol buffer and differing amounts of Aq793 in a 10-μl reaction volume. After a 2-min preincubation at 55 °C, an equal volume of 10 mm ATP in 1× Thermopol buffer was added to initiate the reaction (5 mm final ATP concentration). The reactions proceeded for 20 min and then were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution (0.25% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 100 mm EDTA). A positive control was incubated for 15 min at 95 °C to completely denature the DNA duplexes and quenched by placing the reaction on ice. A negative control without helicase was performed in parallel. The samples were resolved on 20% TBE gels (Invitrogen) scanned with Typhon 9400® (GE Healthcare), and the bands were quantified using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). A set of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides containing a nick was used to determine the helicase activity of Aq793 at a nick. Three oligodeoxynucleotides were used to make the nicked DNA substrate: the bottom strand (B) 5′-GTCCACGGGCCCTCTCCGCCCTGCTGCCGATCAACGAAGGCGAGGCAGCGACCTCATTCCA-3′ and two top strands (T1) 5′-TGGAATGAGGTCGCTGCCTCGCCTTCGTTGA-3′ and (T2) 5′P-TCGGCAGCAGGGCGGAGAGGGCCCGTGGAC-3′. The T2 oligonucleotide was previously labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) with [γ-32P]ATP and purified by size exclusion chromatography using Illustra™ MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). The three oligonucleotides were mixed at a ratio of 1.4:1.2:1 (T1:B:T2) in 1× ThermoPol reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and then heated to 95 °C followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. A titration of Aae MutL, Aae MutL (E357K), or Aae MutL-CTD was performed in a reaction mix containing 0.02 nm DNA substrate and 23.5 pm of Aq793 in 1× Thermopol buffer. After a 2-min equilibration at 55 °C the reactions were initiated by adding ATP to a final concentration of 5 mm. The reactions were stopped and resolved as described above. A titration of Aae MutL was performed in the same condition described above in the reaction mix containing 0.02 nm nicked DNA substrate and 1 nm Aq793 in 1× Thermopol buffer. The ability of Aq793 to unwind dsDNA templates was determined in vitro using synthetic oligonucleotide substrates as described under “Materials and Methods.” The assays were performed with two sets of dsDNA templates. One set used a common 24-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide that was annealed to one of three different complementary ssDNA strands to create a 3′ 40-nucleotide dT overhang (3′-dT40), a 5′ 40-nucleotide dT overhang (5′-dT40), or non-poly(dT)-tailed (dT40−) substrate. The templates were radiolabeled, and the assays were performed at 55 °C. The second set used a radiolabeled 30-mer and a nonlabeled 31-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide that was annealed to a 61-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide to create a nicked substrate. Likewise, the assay using the nicked substrate was performed at 55 °C. A titration of the helicase protein demonstrated that Aq793 could separate the DNA duplex into ssDNA constituents for all of the tailed substrates as well as the nicked substrate (Fig. 1A). A graphical representation of the TBE acrylamide gel data showed that 50 pm, 6 nm, and 40 nm of Aq793 was required to unwind 50% of the 3′-dT40, 5′-dT40, and dT40− substrates, respectively, under these conditions and that 4 nm of Aq793 was necessary to unwind 50% of the nicked DNA substrate (Fig. 1B). These data indicated that Aq793 unwinds DNA with the strongest preference for the substrate with a poly(dT) 3′ overhang. E. coli MutL has been reported to stimulate E. coli UvrD and Rep helicase activity (12Matson S.W. Robertson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4089-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a similar effect occurs with the homologous A. aeolicus proteins, the helicase activity of Aq793 was assayed in the presence of differing amounts of Aae MutL. Conditions were chosen such that the helicase alone unwound ca. 20% of the respective substrate in 20 min as described under “Materials and Methods.” After 20 min the reactions were quenched by the addition of stop solution and applied to an acrylamide gel, and the products were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2A). The percentage of ssDNA formed was plotted against the Aae MutL:Aq793 mole ratio in the reaction. In the absence of Aae MutL, the helicase unwinding activity resulted in ca. 20% displaced ssDNA, as expected. Aq793 helicase activity was significantly stimulated by MutL near stoichiometric ratios of the proteins (Fig. 2B), with maximum stimulation occurring at 1.5:1 MutL:Aq793. No enhanced Aq793 activity was detected at low amounts of MutL; however, at high Aae MutL concentrations, the helicase activity was inhibited (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, MutL-enhanced Aq793 unwinding activity was not observed with the 5′-dT40 and dT40− deoxyoligonucleotide substrates (Fig. 2B). The effect that endonuclease-deficient and truncated forms of Aae MutL had on Aq793 unwinding activity was determined using the same methodology as described for the wild-type Aae MutL. Aae MutL (E357K) is an endonuclease-deficient form of the enzyme (8Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). It stimulated the helicase activity of Aq793 when the two proteins were present at nearly equimolar ratios (Fig. 3A) similar to the wild-type MutL protein. Also, in common with the wild-type enzyme, Aae MutL (E357K) at high molar ratios inhibited the Aq793 helicase activity (Fig. 3). The C-terminal 123 amino acid residues of Aae MutL, similar to the so-called LC20 domain of E. coli, was also able to stimulate Aq793 activity; however, maximum stimulation required an ∼1000-fold molar excess of Aae MutL-CTD over Aq793 (Fig. 3B). Very high excess of Aae MutL-CTD over Aq793 showed a trend toward less stimulation of helicase activity. MutL has been reported to stimulate UvrD helicase activity during mismatch repair. This requires that MutL stimulate the UvrD helicase activity at a nick. To determine whether Aae MutL stimulated Aq793 activity at a nick, the Aq793 helicase activity was assayed on the nicked substrate in the presence of differing concentrations of Aae MutL. Conditions were optimized so that ∼10% of the nicked substrate was unwound in the presence of Aq793 alone as described under “Materials and Methods.” The reactions were quenched by the addition of stop solution and applied to a polyacrylamide gel. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 4A), and the percentage of ssDNA was plotted against the Aae MutL:Aq793 mole ratio in the reaction (Fig. 4B). In the absence of Aae MutL, the helicase unwinding activity resulted in ca. 10% displaced ssDNA, as expected. Aq793 helicase activity was significantly stimulated by MutL near stoichiometric ratios of the proteins, with maximal stimulation occurring at a 1:1 MutL:Aq793 stoichiometric ratio. At high Aae MutL concentrations, the helicase activity was inhibited as observed with the other dsDNA substrates. The E. coli UvrD helicase is involved in many DNA metabolic pathways. One of these pathways is the MMR pathway that ensures DNA replication fidelity and genomic integrity. In E. coli, MutL has been reported to stimulate UvrD helicase activity, most likely by increasing the rate of UvrD loading onto the DNA substrate (12Matson S.W. Robertson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4089-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic MutL proteins have not been reported to stimulate a homologous helicase. Known mismatch repair pathways appear to use one of two methods to discriminate the daughter DNA strand from the parental strand. In E. coli MMR is methyl-directed, whereas in eukaryotes and many bacteria it appears to be nick-directed. The presence or absence of a MutH homologue may be diagnostic for which mechanism is utilized. Furthermore, the C-terminal domains of E. coli MutL homologues are significantly different from Aae MutL homologues, such as human PMS2 (8Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 9Jiricny J. Cell. 2006; 126: 239-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Kadyrov F.A. Holmes S.F. Arana M.E. Lukianova O.A. O'Donnell M. Kunkel T.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37181-37190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is also known that the LC20 domain of E. coli MutL is instrumental in binding and stimulating E. coli UvrD (22Guarné A. Ramon-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the MutL proteins from organisms that lack MutH are not involved in UvrD helicase stimulation. This idea is supported by the previous publication that Tte and Bst MutL proteins, both hPMS2 homologues, did not stimulate UvrD helicase activity (29An L. Tang W. Ranalli T.A. Kim H.J. Wytiaz J. Kong H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28952-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above idea, the work described herein demonstrates that a bacterial hPMS2 homologue can stimulate the helicase activity of UvrD homologues. The stimulation increased with increasing ratios of Aae MutL:Aq793 with the maximum helicase enhancement at a ratio of ∼1:1. At higher stoichiometries the helicase activity was eventually inhibited, probably because a large excess of Aae MutL in solution, not productively bound to DNA, was competing with the DNA substrate for Aq793 binding. Interestingly, the Aae MutL-CTD domain alone was able to stimulate Aq793 helicase activity. Although the LC20 of E. coli MutL was reported to contribute important contacts to UvrD binding and helicase stimulation, this region alone was not found to significantly enhance E. coli UvrD unwinding activity (22Guarné A. Ramon-Maiques S. Wolff E.M. Ghirlando R. Hu X. Miller J.H. Yang W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is not known, but it should be noted that the Aq793 stimulation required 1000-fold higher Aae MutL-CTD:Aq793 ratios than for the full-length Aae MutL protein. We demonstrated for the first time that the putative helicase, Aq793, was able to unwind DNA. It displayed a substantial preference for unwinding a DNA substrate with a 3′ poly(dT) overhang as compared with a 5′ overhang or a non-poly(dT) tailed DNA. This property is shared by E. coli UvrD and reinforces that Aq793 is a 3′-5′ helicase (25Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Aae MutL stimulation of Aq793 activity was only observed when substrates possessed a 3′-poly(dT) overhang or at a nick. The Aae MutL may be binding to the ssDNA regions and loading the Aq793, at which point the helicase moves in a 3′-5′ direction. This would obviously increase the rate of unwinding a substrate with a 3′ overhang, but loading the helicase on a 5′ overhang would simply result in the helicase translocating along the ssDNA region without causing substrate unwinding. Despite the fact that no stimulation was observed with the substrates other than with 3′-dT40, at high Aae MutL:Aq793 ratios, helicase activity was inhibited probably by the mechanism discussed above. In the annotated genome of A. aeolicus, Aq793 is listed as Rep helicase. However, this has not been experimentally verified, and the PUR subfamily helicases are difficult to differentiate based on sequence alone. Interestingly, we show that Aae MutL was able to stimulate the helicase activity of Aq793 on a nicked substrate. This would be expected if Aq793 were the A. aeolicus UvrD homologue. This study focused on whether Aae MutL could act to stimulate a PUR family helicase, something that had not been previously reported to occur in an organism that lacks an obvious MutH homologue. More detailed characterization is needed to ascertain whether Aq793 is actually a UvrD homologue. E. coli MutL has been reported to stimulate both UvrD and Rep helicases. Homologues of human MutLα have not been reported to stimulate the PUR subfamily of helicases. Aae MutL is a hPMS2 homologue and has been demonstrated to possess a latent endonuclease activity (11Fukui K. Nishida M. Nakagawa N. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12136-12145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) similar to the human protein. Eukaryotic MutL proteins are not known to stimulate the activity of a helicase such as UvrD. However, despite the sequence and biochemical similarities of hPMS2 and Aae MutL, the latter protein stimulates Aq793 helicase activity in a manner very similar to the interaction of E. coli MutL with E. coli UvrD. The work herein indicates that MMR, in at least some bacteria that lack MutH homologues, is an intriguing blend of the better studied MMR mechanisms exemplified by E. coli and Homo sapiens. Furthermore, A. aeolicus is in the phylum Aquificae, which some argue contains some of the earliest eubacterial species (31Horiike T. Miyata D. Hamada K. Saruhashi S. Shinozawa T. Kumar S. Chakraborty R. Komiyama T. Tateno Y. Gene. 2009; 429: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and only one ATP-dependent DNA helicase homologue was identified in A.aeolicus. Therefore, the MMR pathway in A. aeolicus may have occurred very early in evolution. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that a human PMS2 homologue can stimulate the activity of a ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of Aae MutL is sufficient to promote this stimulation. A. aeolicus lacks MutH and appears to use a mismatch repair pathway that has similarities and differences with both E. coli and human MMR. It will be exciting to see whether this is a general trend in bacteria that lack MutH."

Simply managing for multiple positive influences will often aid in recovery; however, the relative impacts of multiple threats and/or interactions among them are not always predictable. We used a series of experiments and quantitative observational studies to examine the importance of five potential limiting factors to the abundance of a state-listed endangered hemiparasitic annual forb, Cordylanthus rigidus ssp. littoralis (C.r.l., California, USA): host availability, mammalian herbivores, insect seed predators, fire suppression, and exotic species. While this initial assessment is certainly not a complete list, these factors stem from direct observation and can inform provisional recommendations for management and further research. Methodology and Principal Findings Studies were conducted at five sites and included assessments of the influence of host availability, exotic species, exclusion of mammalian herbivores and insect seed predators on C.r.l. productivity, and simulated effects of fire on seed germination. C.r.l. was limited by multiple threats: individuals with access to host species produced up to three times more inflorescences than those lacking hosts, mammalian herbivory reduced C.r.l. size and fecundity by more than 50% and moth larvae reduced seed production by up to 40%. Litter deposition and competition from exotic plant species also appears to work in conjunction with other factors to limit C.r.l. throughout its life cycle. Conclusions and Significance The work reported here highlights the contribution that a series of small-scale studies can make to conservation and restoration. Taken as a whole, the results can be used immediately to inform current management and species recovery strategies. Recovery of C.r.l. will require management that addresses competition with exotic plant species, herbivore pressure, and availability of preferred host species."
