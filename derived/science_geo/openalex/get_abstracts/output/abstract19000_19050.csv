https://openalex.org/W2133388060,"We show that a protein with a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor can be recovered from lysates of epithelial cells in a low density, detergent-insoluble form. Under these conditions, the protein is associated with detergent-resistant sheets and vesicles that contain other GPI-anchored proteins and are enriched in glycosphingolipids, but do not contain a basolateral marker protein. The protein is recovered in this complex only after it has been transported to the Golgi complex, suggesting that protein-sphingolipid microdomains form in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane and supporting the model proposed by Simons and colleagues for sorting of certain membrane proteins to the apical surface after intracellular association with glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W2057682957,"Preparations of dispersed paired helical filaments (PHFs) from the brains of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome patients display on gels three principal bands corresponding to abnormally modified forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Interpretation of the pattern is difficult because there are six tau isoforms in normal brain and phosphorylation changes their mobility. By enzymatic dephosphorylation at high temperature, we have shifted the three abnormal bands obtained from dispersed PHFs to align with the six nonphosphorylated tau isoforms. By using antibodies specific for some of the inserts that distinguish the various isoforms and label PHFs, we have established a correspondence between PHFs, abnormal bands, and isoforms. This identification of isoforms is a necessary step in unravelling the molecular pathogenesis of PHFs."
https://openalex.org/W2048870886,"Structural models for the nitrogenase FeMo-cofactor and P-clusters are proposed based on crystallographic analysis of the nitrogenase molybdenum-iron (MoFe)-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii at 2.7 angstrom resolution. Each center consists of two bridged clusters; the FeMo-cofactor has 4Fe:3S and 1Mo:3Fe:3S clusters bridged by three non-protein ligands, and the P-clusters contain two 4Fe:4S clusters bridged by two cysteine thiol ligands. Six of the seven Fe sites in the FeMo-cofactor appear to have trigonal coordination geometry, including one ligand provided by a bridging group. The remaining Fe site has tetrahedral geometry and is liganded to the side chain of Cys alpha 275. The Mo site exhibits approximate octahedral coordination geometry and is liganded by three sulfurs in the cofactor, two oxygens from homocitrate, and the imidazole side chain of His alpha 442. The P-clusters are liganded by six cysteine thiol groups, two which bridge the two clusters, alpha 88 and beta 95, and four which singly coordinate the remaining Fe sites, alpha 62, alpha 154, beta 70, and beta 153. The side chain of Ser beta 188 may also coordinate one iron. The polypeptide folds of the homologous alpha and beta subunits surrounding the P-clusters are approximately related by a twofold rotation that may be utilized in the binding interactions between the MoFe-protein and the nitrogenase Fe-protein. Neither the FeMo-cofactor nor the P-clusters are exposed to the surface, suggesting that substrate entry, electron transfer, and product release must involve a carefully regulated sequence of interactions between the MoFe-protein and Fe-protein of nitrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2082127202,"When messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) containing alternative 5' splice sites are spliced in vitro, the relative concentrations of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and the essential splicing factor SF2 precisely determine which 5' splice site is selected. In general, an excess of hnRNP A1 favors distal 5' splice sites, whereas an excess of SF2 results in utilization of proximal 5' splice sites. The regulation of these antagonistic activities may play an important role in the tissue-specific and developmental control of gene expression by alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2040412213,"The nitrogenase enzyme system catalyzes the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-dependent reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia during the process of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase consists of two proteins: the iron (Fe)-protein, which couples hydrolysis of ATP to electron transfer, and the molybdenum-iron (MoFe)-protein, which contains the dinitrogen binding site. In order to address the role of ATP in nitrogen fixation, the crystal structure of the nitrogenase Fe-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii has been determined at 2.9 angstrom (A) resolution. Fe-protein is a dimer of two identical subunits that coordinate a single 4Fe:4S cluster. Each subunit folds as a single alpha/beta type domain, which together symmetrically ligate the surface exposed 4Fe:4S cluster through two cysteines from each subunit. A single bound ADP (adenosine diphosphate) molecule is located in the interface region between the two subunits. Because the phosphate groups of this nucleotide are approximately 20 A from the 4Fe:4S cluster, it is unlikely that ATP hydrolysis and electron transfer are directly coupled. Instead, it appears that interactions between the nucleotide and cluster sites must be indirectly coupled by allosteric changes occurring at the subunit interface. The coupling between protein conformation and nucleotide hydrolysis in Fe-protein exhibits general similarities to the H-Ras p21 and recA proteins that have been recently characterized structurally. The Fe-protein structure may be relevant to the functioning of other biochemical energy-transducing systems containing two nucleotide-binding sites, including membrane transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2014222675,"E2F is a transcription factor believed to play a role in the activation of genes required for cellular proliferation. Its regulation is likely important for maintenance of G0 and for the initiation of cell growth. The retinoblastoma product (RB) forms a complex with E2F in G1 in primary and established human cells. As these cells enter S, a second E2F-containing complex appears. It contains p107, a nuclear “pocket” protein with similarities in structure and protein-binding properties to RB, and cyclin A, a cyclin believed to play a role in facilitating DNA replication. Hence, the regulation of E2F is carried out differently in G1 or S. The presence of cyclin A and a pocket protein, a possible cell growth regulator, in the same S phase-associated complex suggests a link between the function of E2F and the regulation of the DNA replication process."
https://openalex.org/W2044219128,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the CD3-ζ subunit of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex is involved in signal transduction. However, the function of the remaining invariant subunits, CD3-γ, -δ, and ε, is still poorly understood. To examine their role in TCR function, we have constructed TCR/CD3 complexes devoid of functional ζ subunit and showed that they are still able to trigger the production of interleukin-2 in response to antigen or superantigen. These data, together with previous results, indicate that the TCR/CD3 complex is composed of at least two parallel transducing units, made of the γδε and ζ chains, respectively, Furthermore, the analysis of partially truncated ζ chains has led us to individualize a functional domain that may have constituted the building block of most of the transducing subunits associated with antigen receptors and some Fc receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2081547332,"It has not been possible to analyze the cellular mechanisms underlying learning in behaving mammals because of the difficulties in recording intracellularly from awake animals. Therefore, in the present study of neuronal plasticity in behaving monkeys, the net effect of a single neuron on another neuron (the ""functional connection"") was evaluated by cross-correlating the times of firing of the two neurons. When two neurons were induced to fire together within a short time window, the functional connection between them was potentiated, and when simultaneous firing was prevented, the connection was depressed. These modifications were strongly dependent on the behavioral context of the stimuli that induced them. The results indicate that changes in the temporal contingency between neurons are often necessary, but not sufficient, for cortical plasticity in the adult monkey: behavioral relevance is required."
https://openalex.org/W2011858497,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is a primate lentivirus related to human immunodeficiency viruses and is an etiologic agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-like diseases in macaques. To date, only inactivated whole virus vaccines have been shown to protect macaques against SIV infection. Protective immunity was elicited by recombinant subunit vaccines. Four Macaca fascicularis were immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SIVmne gp160 and were boosted with gp160 produced in baculovirus-infected cells. All four animals were protected against an intravenous challenge of the homologous virus at one to nine animal-infectious doses. These results indicate that immunization with viral envelope antigens alone is sufficient to elicit protective immunity against a primate immunodeficiency virus. The combination immunization regimen, similar to one now being evaluated in humans as candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccines, appears to be an effective way to elicit such immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1665071864,"The filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores has been proposed to regulate Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in a variety of tissues. To test this hypothesis, we have used three structurally unrelated inhibitors of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of intracellular Ca2+ stores and investigated their effect on Ca2+ homeostasis in HL-60 cells. Without increasing cellular inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate levels, all three inhibitors (cyclopiazonic acid, thapsigargin, and 2,5-Di-tert-butylhydroquinone) released Ca2+ from intracellular stores, resulting in total depletion of agonist-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The Ca2+ release was relatively slow with a lag time of 5 s and a time to peak of 60 s. After a lag time of approximately 15 s, all three Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors activated a pathway for divalent cation influx across the plasma membrane. At a given concentration of an inhibitor, the plasma membrane permeability for divalent cations closely correlated with the extent of depletion of Ca2+ stores. The influx pathway activated by Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors conducted Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Ba2+ and was blocked, at similar concentrations, by La3+, Ni2+, Cd2+, as well as by the imidazole derivate SK&F 96365. The divalent cation influx in response to the chemotactic peptide fMLP had the same characteristics, suggesting a common pathway for Ca2+ entry. Our results support the idea that the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores regulates Ca2+ influx in HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980294824,"In cell-free extracts derived from Xenopus eggs which oscillate between S phase and mitosis, incompletely replicated DNA blocks the activation of p34cdc2-cyclin by maintaining p34cdc2 in a tyrosine-phosphorylated form. We used a recombinant cyclin fusion protein to generate a substrate to measure the ability of the tyrosine kinase(s) to phosphorylate and inactivate p34cdc2 in the absence of tyrosine phosphatase activity. p34cdc2 tyrosine phosphorylation is highly regulated during the cell cycle, being elevated in S phase and attenuated in mitosis. The elevation in p34cdc2 tyrosine phosphorylation rate occurs in response to the presence of incompletely replicated DNA. Moreover, okadaic acid and caffeine, which uncouple the dependence of mitosis on the completion of S phase, increase unphosphorylated p34cdc2 by attenuating tyrosine kinase function. These data indicate that the control system, which monitors the state of DNA replication, modulates the function of the tyrosine kinase by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism, ensuring that mitosis occurs only when S phase is complete."
https://openalex.org/W2046708988,"The regiospecific formation of oligomers from unblocked monomers in aqueous solution is one of the central tenets in research on the origins of life on earth. Direct experimental support for this hypothesis has been obtained in studies of the condensation of the 5'-phosphorimidazolide of adenosine (ImpA) with itself and with P1,P2-diadenosine-5',5'-pyrophosphate (AppA) in water in the presence of a montmorillonite clay. Oligomers of up to ten nucleotides in length are formed. Analysis of the trimers, tetramers, and pentamers formed from a 9:1 ImpA:AppA mixture has shown that 85% of the bonds formed are 3',5'-linked and that any 2',5'-linkages present are at the phosphodiester bond next to the 3'-terminus of the oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W2001610575,"Muscle fibers specialized for fast or slow contraction are arrayed in characteristic patterns within developing limbs. Clones of myoblasts analyzed in vitro express fast and slow myosin isoforms typical of the muscle from which they derive. As a result, it has been suggested that distinct myoblast lineages generate and maintain muscle fiber pattern. We tested this hypothesis in vivo by using a retrovirus to label myoblasts genetically so that the fate of individual clones could be monitored. Both myoblast clones labeled in muscle in situ and clones labeled in tissue culture and then injected into various muscles contribute progeny to all fiber types encountered. Thus, extrinsic signals override the intrinsic commitment of myoblast nuclei to particular programs of gene expression. We conclude that in postnatal development, pattern is not dictated by myoblast lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2008274778,"MITOCHONDRIA contain a complex machinery for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins1,2. Receptor proteins exposed on the outer membrane surface are required for the specific binding of precursor proteins to mitochondria, either by binding of cytosolic signal recognition factors or by direct recognition of the precursor polypeptides1–5. Subsequently, the precursors are inserted into the outer membrane at the general insertion site GIP (general insertion protein)6–10. Here we report the analysis of receptors and GIP by crosslinking of translocation intermediates and by coimmunoprecipitation. Surface-accumulated precursors were cross-linked to the receptors MOM19 and MOM72, suggesting a direct interaction of preproteins with surface receptors. We identified three novel mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, MOM7, MOMS, and MOM30 that, together with the previously identified MOM38, seem to form the GIP site and are present in the mitochondrial receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1578803116,"Previous purification and characterization of the yeast vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (H(+)-ATPase) have indicated that it is a multisubunit complex consisting of both integral and peripheral membrane subunits (Uchida, E., Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1090-1095; Kane, P. M., Yamashiro, C. T., and Stevens, T. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19236-19244). We have obtained monoclonal antibodies recognizing the 42- and 100-kDa polypeptides that were co-purified with vacuolar ATPase activity. Using these antibodies we provide further evidence that the 42-kDa polypeptide, a peripheral membrane protein, and the 100-kDa polypeptide, an integral membrane protein, are genuine subunits of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. The synthesis, assembly, and targeting of three of the peripheral subunits (the 69-, 60-, and 42-kDa subunits) and two of the integral membrane subunits (the 100- and 17-kDa subunits) were examined in mutant yeast cells containing chromosomal deletions in the TFP1, VAT2, or VMA3 genes, which encode the 69-, 60-, and 17-kDa subunits, respectively. The steady-state levels of the various subunits in whole cell lysates and purified vacuolar membranes were assessed by Western blotting, and the intracellular localization of the 60- and 100-kDa subunits was also examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The results suggest that the assembly and/or the vacuolar targeting of the peripheral subunits of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase depend on the presence of all three of the 69-, 60-, and 17-kDa subunits. The 100-kDa subunit can be transported to the vacuole independently of the peripheral membrane subunits as long as the 17-kDa subunit is present; but in the absence of the 17-kDa subunit, the 100-kDa subunit appears to be both unstable and incompetent for transport to the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W1570011224,"The cytoplasmic domain of the human T cell-type interleukin-1 receptor (hIL-1R) is not involved in the binding, internalization, or nuclear localization of interleukin-1 (IL-1), but is essential for signal transduction. We have previously localized a 50-amino acid region (residues 477-527) critical for IL-1-mediated activation of the interleukin-2 promoter in T cells. This region displays a striking degree of amino acid conservation in human, murine, and chicken IL-1Rs. Here we report the results of a site-directed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of the hIL-1R. We have introduced single-amino acid substitutions at positions conserved in all three receptors and at nonconserved positions and identified key amino acids for IL-1R function in signal transduction. Three basic (Arg431, Lys515, and Arg518) and 3 aromatic (Phe513, Trp514, and Tyr519) amino acids that are conserved in human, murine, and chicken IL-1Rs could not be replaced without abolishing IL-1R-mediated signal transduction. A substitution at another conserved position (Pro521) reduces significantly the ability of the IL-1R to transmit the IL-1 signal. Nonconserved residues could be replaced without affecting signal transduction. The cytoplasmic domain of the IL-1R is related to that of the Drosophila Toll protein, with a 26% identity and a 43% similarity in amino acid sequence. The amino acids shown to be essential for IL-1R function are conserved in the Toll protein. Our experimental data indicate that the amino acid sequence similarity between the IL-1R and the Drosophila toll protein reflects a functional homology between the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1571009912,"The molecular mechanism of the regulation of Ca2+ pump ATPase by phospholamban in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum was examined using synthetic peptides of phospholamban and purified Ca2+ pump ATPase from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. The phospholamban monomer of 52 amino acid residues contains two distinct domains, the cytoplasmic (amino acids 1-30) and the transmembrane (amino acids 31-52) domains. The peptide corresponding to the amino acids 1-31 of phospholamban (PLN 1-31) decreased the Vmax of the Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity in dose-dependent manner, while it had no effect on the affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+ (KCa). On the other hand, the peptide corresponding to the amino acids 28-47 of phospholamban (PLN 28-47) increased the KCa from 0.52 to 1.33 microM without significant change in the Vmax value when reconstituted into vesicles with the ATPase. Essentially the same results as PLN 28-47 were obtained with the peptide corresponding to the amino acids 8-47 of phospholamban (PLN 8-47). The inhibitory effects of PLN 1-31 and PLN 8-47 on the ATPase were reversed by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the peptides (Ser16). These results indicate that phospholamban suppresses Ca2+ pump ATPase at two different sites, the cytoplasmic domain for Vmax and the transmembrane domain for KCa, and that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation de-suppresses these inhibitory effects on the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1598862603,"UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC initiate nucleotide excision repair by incising a damaged DNA strand on each side of the damaged nucleotide. This incision reaction is substoichiometric with regard to UvrB and UvrC, suggesting that both proteins remain bound following incision and do not turn over. The addition of only helicase II to such reaction mixtures turns over UvrC; UvrB turnover requires the addition of helicase II, DNA polymerase I, and deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Column chromatography and psoralen photocross-linking experiments show that following incision, the damaged oligomer remains associated with the undamaged strand, UvrB, and UvrC in a post-incision complex. Helicase II releases the damaged oligomer and UvrC from this complex, making repair synthesis possible; DNase I footprinting experiments show that UvrB remains bound to the resulting gapped DNA until displaced by DNA polymerase I. The specific binding of UvrB to a psoralen adduct in DNA inhibits psoralen-mediated DNA-DNA cross-linking, yet promotes the formation of UrvB-psoralen-DNA cross-links. The discovery of psoralen-UvrB photocross-linking offers the potential of active-site labeling."
https://openalex.org/W2082007124,"Most peptides do not enter the central nervous system because of their hydrophilic character and the presence of peptidolytic enzymes in the lipoidal blood-brain barrier. To achieve brain delivery of a peptide conjugate, an opioid peptide (enkephalin) was placed in a molecular environment that disguises its peptide nature and provides biolabile, lipophilic functions to penetrate the blood-brain barrier by passive transport. The strategy also incorporates a 1,4-dihydrotrigonellinate targetor that undergoes an enzymatically mediated oxidation to a hydrophilic, membrane-impermeable trigonellinate salt. The polar targetorpeptide conjugate that is trapped behind the lipoidal blood-brain barrier is deposited in the central nervous system. Analgesia was observed with ""packaged"" enkephalin but not with the unmodified peptide or lipophilic peptide precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1501972593,"Thapsigargin (TG), a plant sesquiterpene lactone extract, interacts tightly with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport ATPase yielding a 1:1 stoichiometric complex. In addition to inhibiting steady state enzyme activity, TG can be shown to inhibit two individual partial reactions of the ATPase cycle (i.e. Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP and enzyme phosphorylation by Pi in the absence of Ca2+) even when these reactions are studied separately without interdependence. As the two partial reactions occur at domains relatively distant from each other in the protein structure, it is apparent that the TG induced perturbation involves the entire enzyme. The rate of TG interaction with the ATPase, as estimated by the onset of functional inhibition and by the development of an intrinsic fluorescence signal, is relatively low in the presence of Ca2+. The interaction is much faster when Ca2+ is removed from the medium by the addition of EGTA or is dissociated from the enzyme by utilization of ATP. When the TG interaction with the ATPase is studied in the presence of Ca2+ as a function of temperature (15-35 degrees C) and pH (6.0-8.0), two distinct kinetic components are observed: a fast component which is prevalent at high temperature and low pH, and a slow component which is prevalent at low temperature and high pH. This pattern suggests that the enzyme resides in two states, whose relatively slow equilibration is temperature- and pH-dependent. As only one state is reactive to TG, the enzyme population residing in this state reacts immediately with TG. On the other hand, the enzyme population residing in the alternate state must undergo slow conversion to the reactive state before being affected by TG. It can be also demonstrated that in the presence of Ca2+ TG shifts the ATPase from a refractory state to a state which is able to form bidimensional crystalline arrays stabilized by decavanadate. It is concluded that TG reacts specifically with the ATPase conformation which is prevalent in the absence of Ca2+, thereby forming a catalytically inactive dead-end complex."
https://openalex.org/W1596448669,"Greater than 85 of the transport-impaired PiZ variant of human alpha 1-antitrypsin is retained within transfected mouse hepatoma cells and is subjected to intracellular degradation (Le, A., Graham, K., and Sifers, R.N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14001-14007). The retained protein undergoes a discrete size reduction that results from the modification of its endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides and is inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin. Metabolic poisons and inhibitors of protein synthesis perturb the intracellular degradation of the retained protein but do not affect its size reduction. The ability of metabolic poisons to influence the degradation of the PiZ variant in cells treated with brefeldin A indicates that export of the macromolecule from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is not the energy-dependent component of its degradation. Subcellular fractionation experiments have verified that both the size reduction and degradation of the retained PiZ variant occur within the rough ER. Finally, sedimentation velocity centrifugation analysis of radiolabeled cell extracts has indicated that approximately 80 of the PiZ variant consists as soluble aggregates immediately after its synthesis. An inability to detect more extensive aggregation during the retention period supports our previous conclusion that only a small fraction of the macromolecules actually form large insoluble aggregates (Graham, K.S., Le, A., and Sifers, R.N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20463-20468). Overall, these findings indicate that soluble aggregates of the PiZ variant are degraded within the ER by a mechanism sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029810321,"The action of the endogenous polyamine spermine on NMDA-induced responses (in the presence of glycine) was evaluated in cultured spinal cord neurons under voltage- and concentration-clamp conditions. Spermine potentiated NMDA-induced responses in a dose-dependent manner. It was more effective in potentiating steady-state currents (i.e., desensitized response) than the peak phase of the response, indicating that the degree of desensitization was reduced in the presence of the polyamine. Kinetic analysis revealed that the desensitization onset rate, but not recovery rate, was affected by spermine. The effect was voltage independent and was seen in thoroughly dialyzed cells, in which desensitization becomes independent of glycine. Spermine potentiation showed fast on-off kinetics, and intracellular spermine, loaded in the recording pipette, did not occlude potentiation by extracellularly applied spermine. These results are consistent with the existence of a modulatory site for polyamines in the extracellular domain of the NMDA receptor, the activation of which potentiates NMDA receptor function by regulating its desensitization kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2085857382,"Most calcium-activated potassium channels couple changes in intracellular calcium to membrane excitability by conducting a current with a probability that depends directly on submembrane calcium concentration. In rat adrenal chromaffin cells, however, a large conductance, voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK) undergoes rapid inactivation, suggesting that this channel has a physiological role different than that of other BK channels. The inactivation of the BK channel, like that of the voltage-gated Shaker B potassium channel, is removed by trypsin digestion and channels are blocked by the Shaker B amino-terminal inactivating domain. Thus, this BK channel shares functional and possibly structural homologies with other inactivating voltage-gated potassium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1590078694,"The molecular basis of a dramatically decreased steady state level of beta-hexosaminidase beta subunit mRNA in a patient with juvenile Sandhoff disease was investigated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HEXB gene coding for the beta subunit revealed two single base substitutions, one in exon 2 (A to G, a known polymorphism) and the other in exon 11 (C to T). Analysis of the beta subunit mRNA species demonstrated activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 11 as well as skipping of the exon. A transfection assay using a chimeric gene containing intron 10 flanked by cDNA sequences carrying the mutation confirmed that the single base substitution located at position 8 of exon 11 inhibits the selection of the normal 3' splice site. The results demonstrate a new type of exon mutation affecting 3' splice site selection."

GlcNAcT-V was purified by sequential affinity chromatography using first UDP-hexanolamine-agarose and then a synthetic oligosaccharide inhibitor-agarose column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two major bands at apparent molecular masses of 69 and 75 kDa. The enzyme was recovered in a 26% final yield with a 450,000-fold increase in specific activity to a Vmax of 18.8 mumols/(mg.min). Enzyme activity was stabilized and enhanced by the addition of 20% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml IgG, and 0.2 M NaCl. The optimal ranges of pH and Triton X-100 concentrations for enzyme activity were 6.5-7.0 and 1.0-1.5%, respectively. The divalent cations, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, were each found to have a negligible (less than 10%) effect on activity; moreover, the enzyme was fully active in the presence of 20 mM EDTA. The Km value of the purified enzyme toward a synthetic trisaccharide acceptor was 90 microM, and the Ki value toward a synthetic active site inhibitor was 140 microM."

https://openalex.org/W1587093582,"Leader peptidase of Escherichia coli spans the plasma membrane twice with its amino terminus on the periplasmic surface of the membrane and its large carboxyl-terminal domain protruding into the periplasm. To monitor the transfer of the amino terminus of leader peptidase to the periplasm, we have constructed a fusion protein between the 18-residue amino-terminal periplasmic domain of Pf3 bacteriophage coat protein and the beginning of leader peptidase. We find that neither the SecA or SecY proteins nor a transmembrane electrochemical potential is required for insertion of the amino terminus, while the transfer of the carboxyl-terminal domain of leader peptidase has these requirements. The first 35 residues of leader peptidase, which include the first hydrophobic domain and the carboxyl-terminal positively charged cluster, are sufficient to insert the amino terminus. When positively charged residues are introduced before the first transmembrane segment, translocation of the amino terminus is abolished. These studies in protein membrane topogenesis, showing that there are different requirements for amino and carboxyl termini insertion, indicate that multiple mechanisms exist even within the same protein."
https://openalex.org/W1479799584,"The vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a proton-translocating ATPase that acidifies the vacuolar lumen and generates a pH gradient across the vacuole membrane. We have investigated the role of compartment acidification of the vacuolar system in the sorting of vacuolar proteins. Strains with chromosomal disruptions of the genes encoding the A, B, or c subunit of the vacuolar ATPase are unable to acidify their vacuoles. These vat mutant strains accumulate and secrete precursor forms of the soluble vacuolar hydrolases carboxypeptidase Y and proteinase A. The kinetics of secretion suggests that missorting occurs in the Golgi complex or in post-Golgi vesicles. The presence of mature forms of the vacuolar proteins within the cell indicates that vat mutations do not cause defects in zymogen processing. Precursor forms of the membrane-associated vacuolar hydrolase alkaline phosphatase are also accumulated in vat mutant cells but to a lesser extent, suggesting that sorting of vacuolar membrane proteins is less sensitive to changes in the lumenal pH. A similar type of missorting defect can be induced in wild-type cells at pH 7.5. These results indicate that acidification of the vacuolar system is important for efficient sorting of proteins to the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W1553509746,"Studies with a rolling-circle DNA replication system reconstituted in vitro with a tailed form II DNA template, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Pol III HE), the Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein, and the primosome, showed that within the context of a replication fork, the oligoribonucleotide primers that were formed were limited to a length in the range of 9 to 14 nucleotides, regardless of whether they were subsequently elongated by the lagging-strand DNA polymerase. This is in contrast to the 8-60-nucleotide-long primers synthesized by the primosome in the absence of DNA replication on a bacteriophage phi X174 DNA template, although when primer synthesis and DNA replication were catalyzed concurrently in this system, the extent of RNA polymerization decreased. As described in this report, we therefore examined the effect of the DNA Pol III HE on the length of primers synthesized by primase in vitro in the absence of DNA replication. When primer synthesis was catalyzed either: i) by the primosome on a phi X174 DNA template, ii) by primase on naked DNA with the aid of the DnaB protein (general priming), or iii) by primase alone at the bacteriophage G4 origin, the presence of the DNA Pol III HE in the reaction mixtures resulted in a universal reduction in the length of the heterogeneous RNA products to a uniform size of approximately 10 nucleotides. dNTPs were not required, and the addition of dGMP, an inhibitor of the 3'----5' exonuclease of the DNA Pol III HE, did not alter the effect; therefore, neither the 5'----3' DNA polymerase activity nor the 3'----5' exonuclease activity of the DNA Pol III HE was involved. E. coli DNA polymerase I, and the DNA polymerases of bacteriophages T4 and T7 could not substitute for the DNA Pol III HE. The Pol III core plays a crucial role in mediating this effect, although other subunits of the DNA Pol III HE are also required. These observations suggest that the association of primase with the DNA Pol III HE during primer synthesis regulates its catalytic activity and that this regulatory interaction occurs independently of, and prior to, formation of a preinitiation complex of the DNA Pol III HE on the primer terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1625140679,We determined the species specificity and function of structural domains of the interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R) by construction of human/murine chimeric IFN-gamma R cDNA clones and their expression in various cells. We demonstrate that we can reconstitute a biologically active IFN-gamma R in eukaryotic cells with chimeric receptors as long as the extracellular domain and an accessory factor are from the same species. These results indicate that the extracellular domain of the receptor interacts directly or indirectly with the species-specific accessory factor.
https://openalex.org/W1761456141,"Genomic and cDNA clones for the three members of a gene subfamily (pma) encoding a plasma membrane H+-translocating ATPase in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia were isolated and sequenced. They are between 95 and 96% identical at the deduced amino acid sequence level. Sequence comparisons with the corresponding tomato genes (Ewing, N. N., Wimmers, L. E., Meyer, D. J., Chetelat, R. T., and Bennett, A. B. (1990) Plant Physiol. 94, 1874-1881) indicate that divergence among the three N. plumbaginifolia pma genes occurred before the development of the Solanaceae family. Here, determination of pma1 transcription initiation sites reveals several 5' boundaries located 266 to 120 nucleotides upstream from the plasma membrane H+-ATPase translation initiation codon. The 5'-untranlated region contains a small open reading frame, 9 residues long. pma3 has a single, 264-nucleotide long 5' leader containing a 5-residue open reading frame. The latter is completely conserved in a corresponding tomato gene. These features suggest the possibility of translational regulation of plant pma genes. S1 nuclease protection assays on total cellular RNA isolated from different organs reveals that all three genes are expressed in leaf, stem, flower, and root tissues, albeit at different levels according to the organ and gene. The different genes for the plant H+-translocating ATPase are thus subject to differential regulation of transcription, possibly related to specific aspects of enzyme function."
https://openalex.org/W1529182644,"1) Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy we have studied the location and function of residue beta Y331 in the catalytic site of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase. The fluorescent analog lin-benzo-ADP was used as a catalytic-site probe, and was found to bind to three sites in normal F1, with Kd1 = 0.20 microM and Kd2,3 = 5.5 microM. lin-Benzo-ATP was a good substrate for hydrolysis. 2) The mutants investigated were beta Y331F, L, A and E. kcat/KM for ATP hydrolysis in purified F1 was reduced according to the series Y greater than or equal to F greater than L greater than A greater than E, with E being severely impaired; concomitant decreases in binding affinity for lin-benzo-ADP were seen. 3) Fluorescence properties of lin-benzo-ADP bound to F1 differed widely, depending on the residue present at position beta 331. Red shifts of excitation and emission spectra occurred with F and L residues, but not with Y, A, or E. There was strong quenching of fluorescence with wild-type (Y), partial quenching with A, and no quenching with F, L, or E. 4) We conclude that (a) the environment around the bound adenine moiety in the catalytic site is nonpolar, (b) residue beta 331 is part of the adenine-binding subdomain and when tyrosine is the residue, the phenolic hydroxyl makes direct interaction with the fluorophore, (c) an aromatic residue is not absolutely required at position beta 331 for catalytic function, but an increase in polarity leads to functional impairment, and (d) in terms of fluorescence response of bound lin-benzo-ADP all three catalytic sites behaved the same. 5) F1 from mutant beta Y297F bound lin-benzo-ADP with the same fluorescence and binding characteristics as normal F1, and catalytic properties were similar to normal. Therefore, there was no reason to conclude that residue beta Y297 is involved in binding the adenine moiety of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1596583443,"Fast skeletal and cardiac troponin C (TnC) contain two high affinity Ca2+/Mg2+ binding sites within the C-terminal domain that are thought to be important for association of TnC with the troponin complex of the thin filament. To test directly the function of these high affinity sites in cardiac TnC they were systematically altered by mutagenesis to generate proteins with a single inactive site III or IV (CBM-III and CBM-IV, respectively), or with both sites III and IV inactive (CBM-III-IV). Equilibrium dialysis indicated that the mutated sites did not bind Ca2+ at pCa 4. Both CBM-III and CBM-IV were similar to the wild type protein in their ability to regulate Ca(2+)-dependent contraction in slow skeletal muscle fibers, and Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity in fast skeletal and cardiac muscle myofibrils. The mutant CBM-III-IV is capable of regulating contraction in permeabilized slow muscle fibers but only if the fibers are maintained in a contraction solution containing a high concentration of the mutant protein. CBM-III-IV also regulates myofibril ATPase activity in fast skeletal and cardiac myofibrils but only at concentrations 10-100-fold greater than the normal protein. The pCa50 and Hill coefficient values for Ca(2+)-dependent activation of fast skeletal muscle myofibril ATPase activity by the normal protein and all three mutants are essentially the same. Competition between active and inactive forms of cardiac and slow TnC in a functional assay demonstrates that mutation of both sites III and IV greatly reduces the affinity of cardiac and slow TnC for its functionally relevant binding site in the myofibrils. The data indicate that although neither high affinity site is absolutely essential for regulation of muscle contraction in vitro, at least one active C-terminal site is required for tight association of cardiac troponin C with myofibrils. This requirement can be satisfied by either site III or IV."
https://openalex.org/W1577308337,"Abstract Site-specific mutagenesis was used to replace Gly310, Gly770, and Gly801, located in the transmembrane domain of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, with either alanine or valine. In addition, Gly310 was substituted with proline. In the Gly310----Ala mutant, the Vmax for Ca2+ transport and ATPase activity was reduced to about 40% of the wild type activity, but the apparent Ca2+ affinity was close to normal. The Gly310----Val and Gly310----Pro mutants were devoid of Ca2+ transport or ATPase activity and displayed more than a 20-fold reduction in the apparent Ca2+ affinities measured in the phosphorylation assays with either ATP or Pi. In these mutants, the rate of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis was reduced, and the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate accumulated. The apparent affinity for Pi was increased in the absence, but not in the presence, of dimethyl sulfoxide. The properties of this new class of Ca(2+)-ATPase mutants (E2/E2P type) are consistent with a conformational state in which the protein-phosphate interaction is stabilized and the Ca(2+)-protein interaction is destabilized. The Gly770----Ala mutant transported Ca2+ with a Vmax close to that of the wild type, but displayed more than a 20-fold reduction of apparent Ca2+ affinity. The Gly770----Val mutant was not phosphorylated from either ATP or Pi. The Gly801----Ala mutant transported Ca2+ with a Vmax of 126% that of the wild type, hydrolyzed ATP at the same Vmax as the wild type in the presence of calcium ionophore, and displayed a 3-fold reduction in apparent Ca2+ affinity. The Gly801----Val mutant was unable to transport Ca2+ and to be phosphorylated from ATP, even at a Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, but Ca2+ in the micromolar range inhibited phosphorylation from Pi. The ability to bind ATP with normal affinity was retained. The properties of this mutant are consistent with a disruption of one of the two Ca2+ binding sites required for phosphorylation with ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1520792625,"The beta-galactoside beta 1-6- and beta 1-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases (beta 1-6GnT and beta 1-3GnT) that synthesize blood group I and i antigens were identified in rat tissues, using pyridylaminated lacto-N-neotetraose (Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-PA) as an acceptor. The products of the transferase reactions were separated on high performance liquid chromatography. The products of the transferase reactions were identified by 1H NMR as (formula; see text) and GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-PA. The product for beta 1-6GnT was also identified by methylation analysis. Kinetic experiments were carried out using rat serum for beta 1-3GnT and partially purified enzyme from rat intestine for beta 1-6GnT. beta 1-3GnT has a pH optimum of 7.5 and requires Mn2+ for optimal activity. beta 1-6GnT has a pH optimum of 7.0 and does not require Mn2+. Studies on the substrate specificity of each enzyme indicated that the preferred substrate for beta 1-3GnT had the general structure Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-OR and, for beta 1-6GnT, Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal-OR where R = sugar. This is the first demonstration that the beta 1-6GnT acts on an internal galactose of lacto-N-neotetraose and paragloboside, and the enzyme appears to be a novel enzyme in terms of substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1582399641,"The kinetic influence of bound creatine kinase (CK) on the Ca(2+)-activated myosin ATPase was evaluated. ATPase rates were measured from 0.8 microM to 3.2 mM MgATP. Under control conditions, the apparent KmATP was 79.9 +/- 13.3 microM. In contrast, the addition of 12.2 mM phosphocreatine (PCr) decreased the apparent KmATP to a value of 13.6 +/- 1.4 microM. To determine if this reduction was merely the result of an ATP maintenance system, ATP was regenerated using either phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase (PEP-PK), or PCr and soluble bovine cardiac CK. Data obtained with PEP + PK indicated an apparent KmATP of 65.5 +/- 7.3 microM. To study the effects of exogenous CK, the endogenous CK was irreversibly inhibited with 1 mM iodoacetamide. The kinetics of the ATPase were then examined by adding soluble CK to the incubation medium. Under these conditions, the KmATP was 56.4 +/- 0.86 microM. Therefore, these two ATP regeneration systems could not duplicate the effects of endogenous CK. The reduction of the apparent KmATP by endogenous CK was not the result of an altered inhibition by MgADP. MgADP inhibition was determined to be non-competitive, with a Ki of 5.0 +/- 0.1 mM. These data suggest that the observed kinetic effects reflect the proximity of the enzymes in the myofibrillar bundle, thus emphasizing the importance of bound CK for the localized regeneration of MgATP utilized by the myosin ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1566691717,"T lymphocyte activation resulting from antigen recognition involves a protein tyrosine kinase pathway which triggers phosphorylation of several cellular substrates including the CD3 zeta subunit of the T cell receptor (TCR) to form pp21. The homologous TCR-associated protein, CD3 eta, is an alternatively spliced product of the same gene locus as CD3 zeta. CD3 eta lacks one of six cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (Tyr-132) found in CD3 zeta and is itself not phosphorylated. Site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation studies herein demonstrates that Tyr-132 is required for the formation of pp21. Moreover, the differential phosphorylation of CD3 zeta versus CD3 eta is not due to a selective association of the known TCR-associated protein tyrosine kinase, p59fyn; p59fyn but not p56lck or p62yes is associated with each of the three TCR isoforms containing CD3 zeta 2, or CD3 eta 2, or CD3 zeta-eta. This association occurs through components of the TCR complex distinct from CD3 zeta or CD3 eta. In addition, we show that pp21 formation is not only dependent on Tyr-132 but results from concomitant phosphorylation of other CD3 zeta residues including Tyr-121. Mutation of Tyr-90, -121, or -132 does not alter primary signal transduction as shown by the ability of individual CD3 zeta Tyr----Phe mutants to produce interleukin-2 upon TCR stimulation. Thus, the substantial structural changes in CD3 zeta upon TCR stimulation as reflected by alteration in its mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis may affect subsequent events such as receptor desensitization, receptor movement, and/or protein associations."
https://openalex.org/W1582460359,"Binding of bacteria to fibronectin has been implicated as a mechanism of bacterial adhesion to the host tissue. In this report we have analyzed the binding of a strain of Streptococcus dysgalactiae to fibronectin. The cells bind to a site in the NH2-terminal domain of the protein via trypsin-sensitive cell surface components. Furthermore, a lysate prepared by sonication of streptococcal cells contained fibronectin-binding proteins that inhibit the binding of the ligand to intact bacteria. When the proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted to an Immobilon-P filter, and probed with 125I-labeled fibronectin, a 140-kDa fibronectin-binding protein was identified along with a number of smaller binding proteins. A genomic DNA library was constructed and screened for the expression of fibronectin-binding proteins. Two clones were isolated and shown to contain unrelated inserts by restriction mapping and cross-hybridization experiments. The two encoded proteins were also immunologically distinct although both bound to the same region of the fibronectin molecule, and both effectively inhibited the binding of 125I-fibronectin to bacterial cells. Immunological analyses showed that only one of the two proteins tentatively identified as fibronectin receptors was expressed in detectable quantities in the Streptococcus dysgalactiae strain under the culture conditions employed."
https://openalex.org/W1587376298,"The IgE-binding site of the human low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) has previously been mapped to the extracellular domain between amino acid residues 160 and 287. We now have investigated which conformational epitope within this domain specifies the receptor-ligand interaction. The analysis of homolog-scanning mutants expressed in mammalian cells demonstrates that amino acid side chains that affect IgE binding are located in two discontinuous segments, between residues 165-190 and 224-256. The overall structure of the chimeric binding domains, as probed with 11 conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies, is generally not distorted, except by replacement of residues 165-183. In this region, disruption of binding function appears to be caused by global conformational constraints on the binding site. Substitution and deletion mutants demonstrate that six out of eight extracellular cysteines, Cys163, Cys174, Cys191, Cys259, Cys273, and Cys282, are necessary for IgE binding and are most likely involved in intramolecular disulfide bridges. We show that the Fc epsilon RII domain delineated by Cys163 and Cys282 encodes all the structural information required to form the IgE-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1520069313,"The beta, gamma-bidentate chromium(III) complex of ATP (CrATP) was used as a substrate analog to stabilize a form of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum containing both of the bound calcium ions in an occluded state without enzyme phosphorylation. The kinetics of dissociation of Ca2+ from the occlusion sites in the CrATP-enzyme complex were consistent with the existence of two nonequivalent and interdependent Ca2+ occlusion sites, both in the membranous Ca(2+)-ATPase and in a detergent-solubilized monomeric Ca(2+)-ATPase preparation. The rate constant for release of the first calcium ion was k1 = 0.99 h-1, whereas the second calcium ion was released with a rate constant of k2 = 0.25 h-1 when the first site was empty and with a rate constant of k3 = 0.13 h-1 when the first site was occupied by Ca2+. Ca2+ binding at the first site occurred with a rate constant of k-1 = 0.96 microM-1 h-1 (apparent Kd = 1.0 microM). The Ca(2+)-occluded state was further stabilized by ADP, binding in exchange with ATP with an apparent Kd of 8.6 microM. Two kinetic classes of CrATP-binding sites were observed, each with a stoichiometry of 3-4 nmol/mg of protein; but only the fast phase of CrATP binding was associated with Ca2+ occlusion. Derivatization of the Ca(2+)-ATPase with N-cyclohexyl-N'-(4-dimethylamino-1-naphthyl)carbodimide resulted in inactivation of phosphorylation of the enzyme from MgATP, whereas the ability to occlude Ca2+ in the presence of CrATP was retained, albeit with a reduced apparent affinity for Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1634039594,"Alkaline phosphatase is anchored to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Mannose residues of the GPI glycan are suggested to be derived from dolichol-P-mannose. In the present study we examined the effect of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-Glc), an inhibitor of dolichol-P-mannose synthesis, on the biosynthesis and processing of alkaline phosphatase in JEG-3 cells. In control cells, a proform precursor (64.5 kDa) with a hydrophobic peptide domain at the COOH terminus was immediately processed into an intermediate form (63 kDa) by proteolytic removal of the COOH-terminal extension and replacement with the GPI anchor, and then to a mature form (66 kDa) by terminal glycosylation of its N-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast, when cells were treated with F-Glc (1 mM), the protein was synthesized as a proform of 61 kDa. The reduction in its molecular mass was mostly due to the inhibition in maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides by F-Glc. The 61-kDa proform identified by antibodies to the COOH-terminal peptide was detectable even at 3 h after the synthesis, and was gradually processed to doublet forms of 58-59 kDa which were finally secreted into the medium. None of these forms were labeled with [3H]ethanolamine and [3H]stearic acid, components of the GPI anchor, and expressed on the cell surface as a membrane-bound form. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of the GPI synthesis causes a prolonged accumulation of the proform, which is then gradually processed into secretory forms by proteolytic removal of the COOH-terminal hydrophobic peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1511824111,"Several cell-mediated activities for the amino terminus of fibronectin have been documented. In the present study we describe a macrophage surface protein with binding activity directed to the amino terminus of the fibronectin molecule. The binding of a 29-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment to macrophages reached steady state by 30 min and was half-maximal at approximately 2 x 10(-8) M. This binding was specifically inhibited by excess unlabeled 29-kDa fragment or intact fibronectin but not by a 180-kDa fibronectin fragment which lacks the amino terminus. Competitive binding studies of the 70-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment to macrophages revealed a single binding site with KD = 7.14 x 10(-8) M and approximately 8 x 10(4) binding sites/cell. Radiolabeled surface proteins extracted from rat peritoneal macrophages and from the human U937 cell line were applied to an affinity column comprised of the 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin coupled to a solid support. A single trypsin-sensitive radiolabeled protein of 67 kDa, from either cell type, was eluted from this column with urea. This protein showed no immunologic identity with fibronectin, fibrin(ogen), or albumin. The 67-kDa protein exhibited identical apparent molecular weight under reducing and nonreducing conditions, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. We have localized the fibronectin binding activity of this protein to within the 29-kDa amino-terminal domain of fibronectin. The 67-kDa protein eluted from the 70-kDa column failed to bind to a column comprised of the 45-kDa gelatin-binding fragment of fibronectin. Additionally, the 67-kDa protein was specifically eluted from the 70-kDa column by the 29-kDa amino-terminal fragment but not by the 45-kDa gelatin-binding fragment. These data suggest that this 67-kDa protein is a macrophage cell surface binding protein for the amino terminus of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1509220924,"Acrylodan, which normally modifies cysteine residues, was employed to derivatize recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) under native conditions, using a reagent:protein ratio of 3:1. Two major covalent protein/acrylodan adducts were generated and subsequently purified by DEAE TSK 5PW ion exchange chromatography. Peptide mapping and mass spectrometry were used to locate the probe on the modified proteins. Both modified proteins carried one molecule of acrylodan each, one at Cys-8 and the other at Lys-103. Neither Cys-71 nor any of the other 13 lysine residues of rIL-1 beta was modified. Cysteine 71 is inaccessible to acrylodan, but the unusual specificity for Lys-103 could be caused by the location of that residue at the bottom of a hydrophobic pocket which might specifically bind the reagent. No double-labeled protein was detected, indicating that the introduction of the label at either site interferes with the labeling at the other. Both acrylodan-modified proteins exhibited bioactivity in the thymocyte proliferation assay at a level equivalent to that of the unmodified control protein (1.7 x 10(7) units/mg), which shows that the modification of either the Cys-8 or Lys-103 position with acrylodan does not interfere with the cellular bioactivities of the respective proteins. Furthermore, receptor binding assays yielded a Kd = 32.0 +/- 4.8 pM for the Lys-103-labeled protein, Kd = 69.5 +/- 12.7 pM for the unmodified protein, and Kd = 75.0 +/- 11.6 pM for the Cys-8-labeled protein. Thus, Cys-8 or Lys-103 modification of rIL-1 beta by acrylodan also does not interfere with the ability of the molecule to bind to its receptor. The slightly higher affinity of the Lys-103-labeled protein for the receptor suggests that the positive charge on this residue in the native molecule may interfere with IL-1 receptor binding. The two fluorescent labeled IL-1 proteins described herein should provide interesting probes for the study of IL-1/IL-1 receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1485940804,"The Nu3 gene of bacteriophage lambda resides within a cluster of genes that specify structural components of the bacteriophage head. Previous experiments indicate that the Nu3 gene product (gpNu3) is associated with immature proheads but is not detectable in mature proheads or bacteriophage particles, hence its classification as a scaffolding protein. The Nu3 gene has been cloned and overexpressed, and its protein product has been purified. The purified protein is biologically active, as demonstrated by its ability to complement a gpNu3-deficient extract in an in vitro assembly reaction. The sequence of the amino terminus of the protein indicates that translation of Nu3 starts at nucleotide position 5,342 on the standard lambda DNA sequence, yielding a protein with a calculated Mr of 13,396. A combination of gel exclusion chromatography and velocity sedimentation gradient data indicates that gpNu3 possesses an unusually elongated shape."
https://openalex.org/W1511864506,"Energy-dependent activation of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF0CF1) has been elucidated by investigating the conformational changes, the ADP effect, and the catalytic cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis. Conformational change was observed by measuring the reactivity of Lys-109 of the epsilon subunit of chloroplast coupling factor 1 with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. In the postillumination dark, the Lys-109 reactivity decreased biphasically with half-times of less than 1 and 17 s. NH4Cl accelerated the slow phase decrease. Addition of ADP (0.2 microM) in the postillumination dark inactivated CF0CF1 (0.05 microM) with a half-time of 12 s. At high concentration of CF0CF1 (1.2 microM), inactivation occurred without exogenously added ADP with a half-time of 12 s. Accompanying the inactivation, the positive catalytic cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis decreased. Addition of 10 mM NH4Cl before ADP (0.2 microM) decelerated the ADP-induced inactivation to a half-time of 64 s. Throughout this inactivation, the positive catalytic cooperativity was maintained at a high level. These results suggest three distinct conformations of CF0CF1, EH, EM, and EL, and their ADP binding forms EM-ADP and EL-ADP. EH, EM, and EL have a low affinity for ADP, a high affinity for ADP, and low accessibility to ADP, respectively. EM and EL exhibit highly cooperative ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by EM-ADP exhibits no cooperativity. EL-ADP is inactive."

This defect results from the simultaneous presence of two nuclear genes which promote a cryosensitive phenotype on a nonfermentable carbon source. Measurements of mitochondrial protein synthesis carried out in vivo and in organello evidenced a specific defect the synthesis of subunits 6 and 8. Measurements of the steady state levels of mitochondrial mRNA showed that the defect subunits 6 and 8 was correlated with a modification of the expression of a cotranscript ATP8-ATP6. This cotranscript is matured at a unique site to give two cotranscripts of 4600 and 5200 bases length. In mutant mitochondria, the ratio between both cotranscripts, 5200/4600, was lowered. In parallel, expression of the whole mitochondrial transcription unit supporting the genes COXI, ATP8, ATP6, and RF3 was enhanced. However, despite this over expression, the amount of the long cotranscript ATP8-ATP6 remained lower than wild type mitochondria."

The emission and excitation maxima indicated the presence of two operationally distinct conformers for each probe. The iodide quenching and the kinetics of fluorescence changes associated with guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation show that each covalent adduct exists both in hydrated and dehydrated environments. Furthermore, fluorescence changes associated with the binding of the adducts to a recombinant soluble murine receptor indicated that only the conformers with the label in the hydrophobic environment are competent toward the soluble murine interleukin receptor and that the hydrated and dehydrated conformers are in a dynamic equilibrium on the time scale of the binding experiments."
