https://openalex.org/W2047269867,"A SIGNIFICANT proportion (up to 70%) of individuals experience an acute clinical syndrome of varying severity associated with primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1–4. We report here studies on six individuals who showed an acute HIV syndrome which generally resolved within four weeks, concomitant with a dramatic downregulation of viraemia2–5. To characterize the T-cell-mediated primary immune response to HIV, we used combined semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay and cytofluorometry to analyse the T-cell antigen receptor repertoire in sequential peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients. We found major oligoclonal expansions in a restricted set of variable-domain β-chain (Vβ) families. Cells expressing the expanded Vβs predominantly expressed the CDS T-cell differentiation antigen and mediated HlV-specific cytotoxicity. Major oligoclonal expansions of these CD8+ T lymphocytes may represent an important component of the primary immune response to viral infections and may help to clarify both the immunopathogenic and the protective mechanisms of HIV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2038087154,"The osmotic balance between the cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments of cells is critical for the control of cell volume. A mammalian protein kinase, Jnk, which is a distant relative of the mitogen-activated protein kinase group, was activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine in osmotically shocked cells. The activation of Jnk may be relevant to the biological response to osmotic shock because the expression of human Jnk in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae rescued a defect in growth on hyper-osmolar media. These data indicate that related protein kinases may mediate osmosensing signal transduction in yeast and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2107237397,"Interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) proteolytically cleaves pro-IL-1β to its mature, active form. The crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution of a recombinant human ICE-tetrapeptide chloromethylketone complex reveals that the holoenzyme is a homodimer of catalytic domains, each of which contains a p20 and a p10 subunit. The spatial separation of the C-terminus of p20 and the N-terminus of p10 in each domain suggests two alternative pathways of assembly and activation in vivo. ICE is homologous to the C. elegans cell death gene product, CED-3, and these may represent a novel class of cytoplasmic cysteine proteases that are important in programmed cell death (apoptosis). Conservation among members of the ICE/CED-3 family of the amino acids that form the active site region of ICE supports the hypothesis that they share functional similarities."
https://openalex.org/W1964429281,"The integration of chromosomal DNA replication into the eukaryotic cell cycle might involve temporal regulation of interactions between cellular factors and replication origins. We show here that yeast replication origins exist in two chromatin states during the cell cycle. In the postreplicative state, genomic footprints closely resemble those produced in vitro by the purified ORC and ABF1 proteins, indicating that the binding of these proteins to replication origins is not sufficient to drive the initiation of DNA replication. The prereplicative state is characterized by an additional region of protection overlapping the ORC footprint. This prereplicative complex appears near the end of mitosis and persists through G1. After entry into S phase, origins return to the postreplicative state. Similarities in temporal regulation of the prereplicative state and the Xenopus licensing factor suggest that mechanisms limiting DNA replication to once per cell cycle may be conserved among eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2090343238,"Accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells as a consequence of arterial injury is a major feature of vascular proliferative disorders. Molecular approaches to the inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation in these settings could potentially limit intimal expansion. This problem was approached by introducing adenoviral vectors encoding the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) into porcine arteries that had been injured by a balloon on a catheter. These smooth muscle cells were shown to be infectable with adenoviral vectors, and introduction of the tk gene rendered them sensitive to the nucleoside analog ganciclovir. When this vector was introduced into porcine arteries immediately after a balloon injury, intimal hyperplasia decreased after a course of ganciclovir treatment. No major local or systemic toxicities were observed. These data suggest that transient expression of an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a cytotoxic drug locally may limit smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to balloon injury."

https://openalex.org/W1602952910,"The peptide, MKATKLVLGAVILGSTLLAGCSSN, corresponding to the N-terminal 24 amino acids of Braun's prolipoprotein, was used to study the lipid modification of prolipoprotein in Escherichia coli by measuring the rate of incorporation of either [2-3H]glycerol or [9,10-3H]palmitate from the corresponding labeled phosphatidylglycerol into the peptide. Using E. coli strains containing varying levels of prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl modification activities due to mutations in or overexpression of the gene involved in diacylglyceryl modification (lgt), we have shown that the activities based on the peptide assay correlated well with the prolipoprotein-based assay. Further, we have followed the fate of the lipid substrate, phosphatidylglycerol, during the modification reaction and found that lipid modification of prolipoprotein involves the transfer of diacylglyceryl moiety from phosphatidylglycerol to the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue with the concomitant formation of sn-glycerol 1-phosphate. This mechanism is contrary to the previously proposed two-step mechanism of an initial glyceryl transferase followed by O-acyl transfer (Chattopadhyay, P.K., and Wu, H.C. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 5318-5322). Accordingly, the enzyme that catalyzes this activity has been named phosphatidylglycerol-prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase. The revised pathway for the lipoprotein biogenesis in bacteria consists of three successive reactions catalyzed by prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase, signal peptidase II, and apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W2092386534,"The dpp/BMP family of TGFβ-related factors controls numerous events in pattern formation and morphogenesis. How these polypeptide signals are received and transduced by target cells is largely unknown. We combine molecular and genetic approaches to establish that the Drosophila saxophone (sax) gene encodes a dpp receptor. We compare the structural properties and expression patterns of sax with a second dpp receptor encoded by the thick veins (tkv) gene. While the sax gene is expressed ubiquitously, tkv is expressed in a highly localized and dynamic pattern during development. Some, but not all, of the tkv expression pattern parallels that of dpp. Ubiquitous expression of a tkv transgene rescues both tkv and sax loss-of-function mutations. Thus, there is at least partial functional overlap of the sax and tkv receptors in vivo. We consider these observations in terms of possible ligand-receptor interactions during Drosophila development."
https://openalex.org/W1972994374,"Neurons in the primary visual cortex of the cat are selectively activated by stimuli with particular orientations. This selectivity can be disrupted by the application of antagonists of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to a local region of the cortex. In order to determine whether inhibitory inputs are necessary for a single cortical neuron to show orientation selectivity, GABA receptors were blocked intracellularly during whole cell recording. Although the membrane potential, spontaneous activity, subfield antagonism, and directional selectivity of neurons were altered after they were perfused internally with the blocking solution, 18 out of 18 neurons remained selective for stimulus orientation. These results indicate that excitatory inputs are sufficient to generate orientation selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2092079765,"The crystal structure of HGPRTase with bound GMP has been determined and refined to 2.5 Å resolution. The enzyme has a core structure resembling the nucleotide-binding fold of dehydrogenases, and a second lobe composed of residues from the amino and carboxy termini. The GMP molecule binds in an anti conformation in a solvent-exposed cleft of the enzyme. Lys-165, which forms a hydrogen bond to O6 of GMP, appears to be critical for determining the specificity for guanine and hypoxanthine over adenine. The location of active site residues also provides evidence for a possible mechanism for general base-assisted HGPRTase catalysis. A rationalization of the effects on stability and activity of naturally occurring single amino acid mutations of HGPRTase is presented, including a discussion of several mutations at the active site that lead to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W1505763719,"The mts-1 gene is associated with the expression of the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. The protein product of the mts-1 gene belongs to the S100 family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins with unknown biochemical function. In the present work, monoclonal anti-Mts-1 antibodies were used to isolate and characterize Mts-1 protein possible targets. Mts-1 protein can be immunoprecipitated by both anti-Mts-1 and anti-myosin antibodies as a complex with myosin from lysates of different mouse and human cell lines. Precipitation of myosin by anti-Mts-1 antibodies is specific and depends on the presence of Mts-1 protein. Ca(2+)-dependent association between Mts-1 protein and the heavy chain of non-muscle myosin was demonstrated by blot overlay technique. Furthermore, association between myosin and Mts-1 was confirmed by sucrose gradient analysis. Finally, immunofluorescent staining of the mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell line showed that Mts-1 protein is co-localized with the myosin complex. The data suggest that the target for Mts-1 protein is a heavy chain of non-muscle myosin."

https://openalex.org/W2036212839,"During transcription elongation, three flexibly connected parts of RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli advance along the template so that the front-end domain is followed by the catalytic site which in turn is followed by the RNA product binding site. The advancing enzyme was found to maintain the same conformation throughout extended segments of the transcribed region. However, when the polymerase traveled across certain DNA sites that seemed to briefly anchor the front-end domain, cyclic shifting of the three parts, accompanied by buildup and relief of internal strain, was observed. Thus, elongation proceeded in alternating laps of monotonous and inchworm-like movement with the flexible RNA polymerase configuration being subject to direct sequence control."

https://openalex.org/W1985129504,"Mutations in the Drosophila quail gene result in female sterility due to the disruption of cytoplasmic transport from the nurse cells into the oocyte late in oogenesis. Nurse cells from quail mutant egg chambers fail to assemble cytoplasmic actin filament bundles correctly. We have cloned the quail gene and found that it encodes a protein with homology to the vertebrate actin-regulating protein villin. Unlike vertebrate villin, which is restricted to specialized absorptive epithelial cells, the villin-like protein encoded by quail is germline specific in adult files. Antibodies directed against the quail protein show a striking colocalization with filamentous actin in the nurse cells and the oocyte. Our results demonstrate that the villin-like product of quail is required for the formation of cytoplasmic actin filament bundles in nurse cells, possibly by regulating both the polymerization and organization of actin filaments as demonstrated for vertebrate villin in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2031196013,"An essential yeast protein, Nup145p, is identified via its genetic interaction with the nucleoporin Nsp1p. Nup145p contains GLFG repeats and localizes to nuclear pores. Depletion of Nup145p in vivo leads rapidly to nuclear retention of polyadenylated RNAs and more slowly to cytoplasmic accumulation of a nuclear reporter protein. A stretch of 140 amino acids within Nup145p is conserved in two other yeast nucleoporins, Nup116p and Nup100p, and in an uncharacterized C. elegans protein. Genetic experiments in yeast reveal that the three copies of the motif carry out an essential, redundant function. Fragments of Nup145p and Nup116p including this motif bind specifically to homopolymeric RNAs in vitro. Nup145p, Nup116p, and Nup100p thus represent a novel class of nucleoporins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport."
https://openalex.org/W2074422606,"Retinotopic map development in nonmammalian vertebrates appears to be controlled by molecules that guide or restrict retinal axons to correct locations in their targets. However, the retinotopic map in the superior colliculus (SC) of the rat is developed instead by a topographic bias in collateral branching and arborization. Temporal retinal axons extending across alternating membranes from the topographically correct rostral SC or the incorrect caudal SC of embryonic rats preferentially branch on rostral membranes. Branching preference is due to an inhibitory phosphatidylinositol-linked molecule in the caudal SC. Thus, position-encoding membrane-bound molecules may establish retinotopic maps in mammals by regulating axon branching, not by directing axon growth."

https://openalex.org/W2014936628,"The high-mobility group protein 14 (HMG-14) is a non-histone chromosomal protein that is preferentially associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. To assess the effect of HMG-14 on transcription by RNA polymerase II, in vivo-assembled chromatin with elevated amounts of HMG-14 was obtained. Here it is shown that HMG-14 enhanced transcription on chromatin templates but not on DNA templates. This protein stimulated the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II but not the level of initiation of transcription. These findings suggest that the association of HMG-14 with nucleosomes is part of the cellular process involved in the generation of transcriptionally active chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1588986801,"We have previously isolated rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (rho DGI) from bovine brain and characterized it. Bovine rho GDI is a protein of a M(r) of 23,421 with 204 amino acids. rho GDI inhibits the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of post-translationally lipid-modified small GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) of the rho family, including the rho, rac, and cdc42 subfamilies, and keeps them in the GDP-bound inactive form. In the present study, we first purified rho GDI from the cytosol fraction of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isolated its gene. Yeast rho GDI gene had an open reading frame without introns encoding a protein of a M(r) of 23,138 with 202 amino acids. Yeast rho GDI protein was 36% identical with bovine rho GDI. Yeast rho GDI expressed in Escherichia coli was active not only on yeast rho1 but also on mammalian rho family members which were post-translationally modified. Disruption of rho GDI did not induce apparent phenotypes, whereas overexpression of yeast or bovine rho GDI resulted in the inhibition of cell growth. These results indicate that rho GDI exists and regulates the function of the rho family members in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1733159128,"Driving forces and substrate specificity for transport of reduced glutathione (GSH) across rat liver cell canalicular membrane were examined in vesicles isolated from this plasma membrane domain. In contrast to previous studies indicating a single saturable component of canalicular GSH transport, the present results demonstrate the presence of both high and low affinity components with apparent Km values of 0.24 +/- 0.04 and 17.4 +/- 2.1 mM and Vmax values of 0.09 +/- 0.01 and 2.3 +/- 0.3 nmol.mg-1.20 s-1, respectively. The Km values in two previously published reports are discordant, 0.33 versus 16 mM, but are comparable with the two transport components identified in the present study. To further characterize these GSH transport mechanisms, [3H]GSH uptake by canalicular vesicles was measured at concentrations of 50 microM, where transport is expected to occur largely on the high affinity component, and at 5 mM, where the low affinity system should predominate. Neither component of GSH transport was affected by ATP or a Na+ gradient, but both were stimulated by a valinomycin-induced membrane potential, indicating electrogenic transport pathways. The high affinity component was cis-inhibited by glutathione S-conjugates (1 mM), other gamma-glutamyl compounds (5 mM), and 4,4‘-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid (0.1 mM), whereas these agents had no effect on the low affinity component at similar inhibitor concentrations. Sulfobromophthalein (BSP, 0.1 mM) inhibited both GSH transport components. However, neither component was affected by taurocholate (0.5 mM) or L-glutamate (10 mM). The inhibition by S-butylglutathione, the GSH analogue ophthalmic acid, and by BSP was competitive in nature, although BSP also produced a slight decrease in Vmax, suggesting a mixed type of inhibition. Ophthalmic acid and some glutathione S-conjugates were also able to trans-stimulate high affinity GSH uptake. These results indicate the presence of at least two ATP-independent, electrogenic glutathione transport mechanisms on the canalicular membrane; the high affinity component may function to deliver some glutathione S-conjugates, gamma-glutamyl compounds, and other anions into bile, whereas the low affinity system probably functions as a high capacity transporter capable of delivering large amounts of GSH into bile."
https://openalex.org/W139102930,"We concluded previously from mutagenesis in the intradiscal domain of bovine rhodopsin that the formation of a tertiary structure comprising the N-terminal tail and the three polypeptide loops is essential to the in vivo assembly of the functional rhodopsin. We now report on more comprehensive mutagenic studies in the intradiscal domain to determine more precisely the requirement for the formation of the above-proposed tertiary structure. Three large deletions, two consisting of groups of 10 amino acids each, and the third of 34 amino acids, were carried out in the N-terminal loop. All the three mutant opsins only poorly formed the rhodopsin chromophore. In the BC loop, we carried out five 2 amino acid deletions, 2 single amino acid deletions, and three mutations in which short sequences in the loop were reversed. All the resulting mutant opsins had lost the ability to bind 11-cis-retinal. In the DE loop, where extensive mutagenesis had previously been carried out, we carried out 3 amino acid replacements (Asn, Thr, Tyr) at Cys187. None of these mutants bound 11-cis-retinal. In loop FG, we carried out four 2 amino acid deletions, 1 single amino acid deletion, 3 amino acid replacements, and one mutation in which the sequence of the 7 amino acids was reversed. All the mutants in FG loop partially formed the rhodopsin chromophore. All the mutants now described appeared to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum: several that were examined in detail were complexed with non-opsin proteins, the chaperonins. Treatment with ATP-MgCl2 released the latter from the mutant rhodopsins. Our overall conclusion is that the formation of the specific structure in the intradiscal domain has highly stringent spatial requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2040014090,"A prolonged pause in transcription elongation at positions +16 and +17 of the phage lambda late gene operon has an important role in the modification of RNA polymerase by the lambda gene Q transcription antiterminator. Mutations included in the transcription bubble of the paused transcription complex, particularly at +2 and +6, abolish pausing and the ability of Q protein to modify RNA polymerase. By transcribing heteroduplex templates made in vitro, we show that the sites identified by these mutations act through the nontranscribed strand of DNA. This result suggests unexpected regulatory functions of the nontranscribed DNA strand in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1980290943,"The microinjection of messenger RNA encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) into early embryos of Xenopus laevis leads to the induction of mesoderm in ectodermal explants. This induction occurs without a stimulation of overall protein synthesis and is blocked by the co-expression of a dominant negative mutant of the proto-oncogene ras or a truncated activin type II receptor. Although other translation factors have been studied in vertebrate and invertebrate embryos, none have been shown to play a direct role in development. The results here suggest a mechanism for relaying and amplifying signals for mesoderm induction."
https://openalex.org/W1774272595,"The molecular mechanisms that underlie the biological effects of low frequency sinusoidal electric fields may involve induced changes in the physical state of charged cell surface receptors. We have used intensified fluorescence video microscopy to study the redistribution of cell surface receptors, including transferrin receptors (TFR) and low density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R), in response to externally applied alternating current electric fields in the 3 to 23 V/cm range (peak to peak). Redistribution of both TFR and LDL-R was prominent at frequencies of 1 and 10 Hz but negligible at frequencies of 60 and 120 Hz. Application of a 1 Hz, 23 V/cm field for 15 min caused a twofold change in local TFR surface density, whereas application of a 60 Hz, 23 V/cm field resulted in no significant TFR redistribution. The extent of TFR redistribution induced by a 1 Hz field changed by only 20% over the field strength range from 3.5 to 23 V/cm. AC field-induced cell surface receptor migration did not consistently follow electric field lines, suggesting that mechanisms more complex than classical electrophoresis and electroosmosis mediate receptor redistribution. Joule heating and plasma membrane calcium channel activation were shown not to be involved in the mechanism of receptor redistribution. Applied external electric fields may reorganize cytoskeletal and plasma membrane structures, providing pathways for cell surface receptors to migrate anharmonically."

https://openalex.org/W1592554448,"Antiestrogens antagonize many genomic effects of estrogen through binding to the nuclear estrogen receptor. We report here that NIH3T3 fibroblasts grown in the presence of colchicine acquire the activation of a large conductance chloride channel upon exposure to extracellular but not intracellular antiestrogens. This effect can be prevented by extracellular 17 beta-estradiol, but not intracellular 17 beta-estradiol or extracellular 17 alpha-estradiol. This is the first demonstration of a regulatory role for antiestrogens and estrogens in the regulation of ionic channels occurring through an interaction of these compounds with a plasma membrane binding site distinct from the classical estrogen receptor and subsequent activation of intracellular second messenger pathway (or pathways)."
https://openalex.org/W1487358765,"Several enzymes with lysophospholipase/phospholipase B activity have been described from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro, these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing all phospholipids that can be extracted from yeast cells. Two forms of the enzyme have been isolated from plasma membranes and a third from culture supernatants and the periplasmic space, but their biological roles have not been determined. These highly glycosylated enzymes were reported to have very similar catalytic properties but differed with respect to apparent molecular weight. We isolated a gene from S. cerevisiae, encoding a protein predicted to share 45% amino acid sequence identity with phospholipase B from Penicillium notatum. This yeast gene, designated PLB1, was mapped to the left arm of chromosome VIII. No residual lysophospholipase/phospholipase B activity was detected upon assay of extracts or culture supernatants of a plb1 delta mutant. Thus, either the PLB1 gene encodes all of the previously detected isoforms of phospholipase B or its gene product is required for their expression or activation. Deletion of PLB1 did not result in any apparent phenotypic defect, suggesting either that we failed to identify the growth conditions that would betray such a defect or that Plb1p is functionally redundant with another protein, whose activity has gone undetected. A plb1 delta mutant released wild-type levels of the soluble phosphatidylinositol metabolite glycerophosphoinositol into the growth medium but released greatly reduced levels of the corresponding phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine metabolites. These results indicate that PLB1 is principally responsible for the production of the deacylation products of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not phosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W1540592979,"Abstract The protein gp115 is an exocellular yeast glycoprotein modified by O- and N-glycosylation and attached to the plasma membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol. The more remarkable structural feature in gp115 is the presence of a 36-amino acid serine-rich region. Similar sequences have been found in mammalian glycoproteins, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor, the decay-accelerating factor, and the mucins, where they are targets of multiple sites of O-glycosylation. The modification of these regions greatly influences their conformation and gives rise to rodlike structures. In this work, we have deleted or duplicated the Ser-rich region of gp115. The analysis of the size and glycosylation state of both mutant proteins indicates that about 52% of the total contribution of the O-glycosylation to the mass of the protein is concentrated in this region. The phenotype of ggp1 null mutant expressing the mutant proteins was also analyzed to understand if this region is important for gp115 function. The defects of slow growth rate and resistance to zymolyase of the ggp1 cells are completely complemented by both mutant proteins, suggesting that this region could be dispensable for gp115 function. A tentative model of gp115 structure is presented on the basis of the obtained data."
https://openalex.org/W1485198209,"In screening a rat pancreatic islet cDNA library by differential hybridization for transcripts increased by glucose, the H chain of ferritin, an iron storage protein, was identified. An ELISA for rat ferritin showed that the insulin cell contains a surprisingly high amount of ferritin comparable to that of iron storage tissues. Most of the ferritin was located in the beta cell, as judged from colocalization of ferritin and insulin by immunohistochemical staining of the pancreas. Islets maintained for 24 h in culture medium containing 20 mM glucose are capable of releasing insulin in response to stimulation with glucose, but islets maintained at 1 mM glucose are incapacitated in response to glucose (see ref 1). Immunoassayable ferritin was threefold higher in 20 mM glucose islets than in 1 mM glucose islets and the glucose-stimulated increase in H ferritin mRNA was confirmed by probing Northern blots of islet RNA with authentic H and L chain cDNAs. This showed that H ferritin mRNA was four- to eightfold higher in 20 mM-glucose islets than in 1 mM glucose islets, whereas L ferritin mRNA was decreased 75-90% in 20 mM glucose islets relative to 1 mM glucose islets. The physiological reason for the abundance of (apo)ferritin in the beta cell is not readily apparent because the islet contains very little iron. Whether or not ferritin is used to handle another metal such as zinc, which is plentiful in the beta cell, is unknown. Another potential reason for ferritin in the beta cell is that ferritin has antioxidant properties and the beta cell is particularly sensitive to oxygen radicals. Regardless of its physiologic purpose, the high amount of ferritin can explain why iron is preferentially retained in the insulin cell and causes diabetes in diseases of iron overloading.—MacDonald, M. J., Cook, J. D., Epstein, M. L., Flowers, C. H. Large amount of (apo)ferritin in the pancreatic insulin cell and its stimulation by glucose. FASEB J. 8: 777-781; 1994."
https://openalex.org/W1566044288,"Dipeptides serve as substrates for both transport and hydrolytic processes. This has caused uncertainty as to whether different systems mediate both processes, and if so, whether they can be functionally separated. To investigate these problems, we determined the effects of a series of compounds previously characterized as aminopeptidase (AP) inhibitors on transport and hydrolytic activities of the kidney brush border membrane. The substrate used for assaying transport activity was Gly-Gln whereas Leu-, Arg-, and Glu-nitroanilides, as well as Gly-Tyr and Ala-Tyr, were used in assaying hydrolytic activity. The AP inhibitors, arphamenines A and B and bestatin, strongly inhibited transport by the oligopeptide/H+ symporter (EC50 values of 15 to 67 microM). The mechanism of inhibition appeared to be competition for the binding site of the symporter. In contrast, leucinethiol, leuhistin, and amastatin had little or no effect on dipeptide transport (EC50 values of 4 to more than 50 mM). Arphamenine and leucinethiol, in concentrations as high as 100 microM, were found to be either ineffective or weak inhibitors of membrane-associated hydrolysis. In contrast, amastatin and leuhistin, in concentrations as low as 20 microM, almost completely inhibited dipeptide hydrolysis. These results show that dipeptide hydrolysis can be selectively suppressed by either amastatin or leuhistin and dipeptide transport by arphamenine. Furthermore, the results provide new insight into the structural features of substrates that are recognized at the binding site of the oligopeptide/H+ symporter."
https://openalex.org/W1544348503,"Volume expansion of little skate (Raja erinacea) erythrocytes leads to the formation of oligomeric forms of the band 3 protein. The oligomers are formed following incubation in hypotonic media or inclusion of a permeant solute such as ethylene glycol. Oligomers were detected by specifically labeling the skate erythrocyte band 3 homolog with the radiolabeled stilbene [3H]4,4'-diisothiocyano-1,2 diphenylethane-2,2'-disulfonic acid and cross-linking membrane proteins with the homobifunctional agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Under isoosmotic conditions, the distribution of band 3 in the monomer, dimer, and tetramer forms was 38, 54, and 8%. Medium of 0.5 osmolarity caused the distribution to change to 22% monomer, 31% dimer, and 47% tetramer. Upon return to isoosmotic conditions, cell volume, as well as the distribution of band 3 in the monomer, dimer, and tetrameric forms, returned to control values. Return of hypotonically swollen cells to isoosmotic conditions also returned taurine efflux back to control values. Hyperosmolarity caused a 20% shrinkage of cell volume but did not have any effect on either taurine efflux or the distribution of band 3 in the oligomeric forms. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and dinitrostilbene disulfonate, two agents that interact with and cause the formation of the tetrameric form of human band 3, also caused a shift toward to tetrameric peak in skate band 3. To determine whether the cross-linked oligomers had proteins that closely associate with band 3 in the intact cell, Western blots were performed to detect ankyrin and band 4.1. Neither protein appeared with the dimeric or tetrameric forms of band 3, suggesting that the mobility shift was in fact due to association of band 3 monomers. This is the first demonstration that oligomerization of band 3 occurs during a physiologic effect that may be mediated by the band 3 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1587453136,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binds two distinct cell surface receptors designated p60 and p80. Our previous studies indicate that a protein kinase from U-937 cells binds to and phosphorylates the p60 receptor. While the p80 receptor is phosphorylated in vivo, no association of a protein kinase has been described. We employed a fusion protein comprising of glutathione S-transferase and the cytoplasmic domain of the p80 receptor (GST-p80CD) to identify cellular proteins that might associate with this receptor. From 35S- and 32P-labeled cells, a protein of 59 kDa bound specifically to GST-p80CD. In vitro kinase reactions indicated that serine/threonine protein kinase activity associated with GST-p80CD and causes its phosphorylation. Additionally, a 59-kDa phosphoprotein was also identified after kinase reactions of proteins bound to GST-p80CD. This kinase activity required either Mg2+ or Mn2+ for optimal activity, and it phosphorylated myelin basic protein, histone H2B, and also the cytoplasmic domain of the p60 receptor. Treatment of cells with TNF increased the p80 receptor-associated kinase activity by 200%. In summary, our results provide evidence of a novel ligand-activated serine/threonine protein kinase that associates with the cytoplasmic domain of the p80 receptor and causes the phosphorylation of both forms of the TNF receptor. This p80 TNF receptor-associated protein and the associated kinase described here are referred to as p80-TRAP and p80-TRAK, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1526609249,"We studied the effects of activation of the Gq-alpha signaling pathway on mitogenesis by expressing a mutant (Q209L), activated alpha-subunit of Gq (alpha q*) in NIH-3T3 cells. A clonal NIH-3T3 cell line expressing alpha q* in an inducible manner was isolated. Expression of alpha q* is induced with dexamethasone, allowing the use of non-induced cells as controls for the effects of alpha q* expression. We found that, by itself, expression of alpha q* did not increase either DNA synthesis or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity in serum-starved cells. Because alpha q* transforms cells grown in the presence of serum (De Vivo M., Chen, J., Codina, J., and Iyengar, R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 18263-18266), we tested whether growth factor-stimulated signaling and mitogenesis were affected by expression of alpha q*. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated thymidine incorporation modestly (50%) in contact-inhibited, confluent cell cultures. In cells expressing alpha q*, PDGF stimulated DNA synthesis up to 3-fold over basal. Concomitant with the potentiation of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, expression of alpha q* potentiated PDGF-stimulated p44 MAP kinase activity. PDGF was much more effective in stimulating both DNA synthesis and p44 MAP kinase activity in subconfluent cell cultures and expression of alpha q* exerted little or no effect on PDGF-stimulated effects in subconfluent cells. These data show that cooperation between signaling pathways may occur in a cell state-specific fashion. Such cooperation in part may be responsible for the triggering of complex cellular responses such as cell transformation."

Infection of human or murine cells with murine leukemia viruses rapidly increases the expression of genes belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and involved in T-lymphocyte activation, including the class I major histocompatibility complex antigens. We report here that the long terminal repeat (LTR) of Moloney murine leukemia virus encodes a novel trans-activator, which induces transcription and expression of class I major histocompatibility complex genes. The portion of the LTR responsible for trans-activation lies within the U3 region and can be excised from the LTR while maintaining its activity. Analysis of the U3 region of the LTR and its flanking sequences suggests that functional or regulatory elements for the trans-activity exist between nucleotides 32 and 219 of the LTR sequences. The region of the LTR identified here as important in trans-activation has been shown recently to be a critical determinant of leukemogenicity and latency of Moloney murine leukemia virus. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of retrovirus-induced activation of cellular gene expression, potentially contributing to leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1550686805,"A large body of evidence indicates that experimental agents which raise cellular cAMP levels inhibit T cell growth and division. By contrast, many studies have reported that mitogen activation of T cells increases cAMP levels, implying a positive physiological role for cAMP in the activation process. In the present study we demonstrate that mitogen activation of human peripheral T lymphocytes induces nuclear factors that form complexes with cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Four complexes are identified by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, two of which are induced by mitogen activation. All four complexes contain CREB and are bound to the cAMP response element (CRE) core sequence (TGACGTCA), as indicated by antibody and oligonucleotide competition experiments. Binding of the four complexes to CRE is prevented by dephosphorylation of nuclear extracts and is restored by rephosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase or endogenous kinases. Similar complexes are detected in nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells. Mitogen induction of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay complexes is not accounted for by protein phosphorylation or by induction of CREB. Rather, the data indicate that mitogen increases the levels of a nuclear factor(s) that dimerizes with CREB. Induction of new CREB complexes implies a physiological role for cAMP in mitogen activation of T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1530897874,"The crystal structure of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A derivative II, a covalent derivative obtained by reaction of 6-chloropurine 9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate with the alpha-amino group of Lys-1, has been determined and refined at 2.1-A resolution with an agreement factor R = 0.166 for 6254 reflections in the resolution shell 8.0 to 2.1 A. Crystals are orthorhombic and belong to space group C222(1) with unit cell parameters a = 75.73 A, b = 57.85 A, and c = 53.26 A. This crystal packing had never been reported before for pancreatic ribonuclease nor its complexes. The structure found is in accordance with the location of p2, B3, and R3 subsites at the N-terminal region of the protein and provides an explanation of the catalytic behavior observed for this derivative. In particular, differences in kinetic parameters and in the pKa value of His-119 between derivative II and native ribonuclease A can be interpreted on the basis of the position of the phosphate moiety within the derivative structure. Some uncertainty remains on the nucleotide sugar conformation determined."
https://openalex.org/W1681317086,"The diversity of protein isoforms is often generated from single genes by alternative splicing of the primary transcript. Using transfection of beta tropomyosin minigene constructs into homologous and heterologous cell systems, we show that there are differences, among higher vertebrates, in the components of the splicing machinery which control the conserved regulated splicing pattern of two mutually exclusive exons (6A and 6B) present in this gene. These experiments demonstrate that genes which give rise to alternative transcripts may require an appropriate combination of splicing factors which are species-specific, or at least restricted to the same taxonomic subgroup (class). An important practical implication is that the splicing of these genes may be deregulated in heterologous systems in vitro and in vivo, i.e. in transgenic animals."
