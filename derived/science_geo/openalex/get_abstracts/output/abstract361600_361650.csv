https://openalex.org/W2129150286,"Common variants at only two loci, FTO and MC4R, have been reproducibly associated with body mass index (BMI) in humans. To identify additional loci, we conducted meta-analysis of 15 genome-wide association studies for BMI (n > 32,000) and followed up top signals in 14 additional cohorts (n > 59,000). We strongly confirm FTO and MC4R and identify six additional loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)): TMEM18, KCTD15, GNPDA2, SH2B1, MTCH2 and NEGR1 (where a 45-kb deletion polymorphism is a candidate causal variant). Several of the likely causal genes are highly expressed or known to act in the central nervous system (CNS), emphasizing, as in rare monogenic forms of obesity, the role of the CNS in predisposition to obesity."

https://openalex.org/W1986290768,"Aberrant folding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum activates the bifunctional transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1. Ire1 excises an intron from HAC1 messenger RNA in yeasts and Xbp1 messenger RNA in metozoans encoding homologous transcription factors. This non-conventional mRNA splicing event initiates the unfolded protein response, a transcriptional program that relieves the endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here we show that oligomerization is central to Ire1 function and is an intrinsic attribute of its cytosolic domains. We obtained the 3.2-A crystal structure of the oligomer of the Ire1 cytosolic domains in complex with a kinase inhibitor that acts as a potent activator of the Ire1 RNase. The structure reveals a rod-shaped assembly that has no known precedence among kinases. This assembly positions the kinase domain for trans-autophosphorylation, orders the RNase domain, and creates an interaction surface for binding of the mRNA substrate. Activation of Ire1 through oligomerization expands the mechanistic repertoire of kinase-based signalling receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1999603649,"Coherent and reversible mapping of quantum information between light and matter is an important experimental challenge in quantum information science. In particular, it is an essential requirement for the implementation of quantum networks and quantum repeaters. So far, quantum interfaces between light and atoms have been demonstrated with atomic gases, and with single trapped atoms in cavities. Here we demonstrate the coherent and reversible mapping of a light field with less than one photon per pulse onto an ensemble of approximately 10(7) atoms naturally trapped in a solid. This is achieved by coherently absorbing the light field in a suitably prepared solid-state atomic medium. The state of the light is mapped onto collective atomic excitations at an optical transition and stored for a pre-determined time of up to 1 mus before being released in a well-defined spatio-temporal mode as a result of a collective interference. The coherence of the process is verified by performing an interference experiment with two stored weak pulses with a variable phase relation. Visibilities of more than 95 per cent are obtained, demonstrating the high coherence of the mapping process at the single-photon level. In addition, we show experimentally that our interface makes it possible to store and retrieve light fields in multiple temporal modes. Our results open the way to multimode solid-state quantum memories as a promising alternative to atomic gases."

https://openalex.org/W1990275904,"Germline substitutions in the endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 (encoded by TEK) cause a rare, inherited form of venous anomaly known as a mucocutaneous venous malformation (VMCM; refs. 1, 2, 3 and V.W., N.L., M.U., A. Irrthum, L.M.B. et al., unpublished data). We identified a somatic 'second hit' causing loss of function of TIE2 in a resected VMCM and assessed whether such localized, tissue-specific events have a role in the etiology of sporadic venous malformations, which are far more common. We identified eight somatic TEK mutations in lesions from 28 of 57 individuals (49.1%) with sporadic venous malformations; the mutations were absent from the individuals' blood and control tissues. The somatic mutations included one causing a frequent L914F substitution and several double mutations in cis, all of which resulted in ligand-independent TIE2 hyperphosphorylation in vitro. When overexpressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the L914F mutant was abnormally localized and responded to ligand, in contrast to wild-type TIE2 and the common, inherited R849W mutant, suggesting that the mutations have distinct effects. The presence of the same mutations in multifocal sporadic venous malformations in two individuals suggests a common origin for the abnormal endothelial cells at the distant sites. These data show that a sporadic disease may be explained by somatic changes in a gene causing rare, inherited forms and pinpoint TIE2 pathways as potential therapeutic targets for venous malformations."

https://openalex.org/W1990136127,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins activates the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. The transmembrane protein Ire1 is a central player in this pathway, acting as a kinase and an endoribonuclease. It excises an intron on HAC1 mRNA resulting in translation of the transcription factor Hac1 that in turn activates target genes. This issue reports two studies on Ire1. Korennykh et al. solve the crystal structure of Ire1 kinase and show that it spontaneously assembles into a rod-shaped oligomer. This positions the kinase domains for trans-phosphorylation, orders the RNase domains and creates an interaction site for mRNA substrate binding. Aragón et al. show that on activation, Ire1 molecules cluster into discrete foci containing high-order oligomers on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. HAC1 mRNA is recruited to these foci by means of a sequence in its 3′ untranslated region and is processed at these sites. In this way the HAC1 mRNA is delivered to a site where it is processed, ensuring that it is translated only when the unfolded protein response is on. It is shown that after activation, Ire1 molecules cluster into discrete foci containing high order oligomers on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. HAC1 mRNA is recruited to these foci by means of a sequence in its 3′ UTR and is processes at these sites. Disruption of either Ire1 clustering or HAC1 mRNA recruitment impairs UPR signalling. Hence HAC1 mRNA is delivered to a site where it is processed thus ensuring that it is only translated when UPR is on. Deficiencies in the protein-folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in all eukaryotic cells lead to ER stress and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR)1,2,3. ER stress is sensed by Ire1, a transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease, which initiates the non-conventional splicing of the messenger RNA encoding a key transcription activator, Hac1 in yeast or XBP1 in metazoans. In the absence of ER stress, ribosomes are stalled on unspliced HAC1 mRNA. The translational control is imposed by a base-pairing interaction between the HAC1 intron and the HAC1 5′ untranslated region4. After excision of the intron, transfer RNA ligase joins the severed exons5,6, lifting the translational block and allowing synthesis of Hac1 from the spliced HAC1 mRNA to ensue4. Hac1 in turn drives the UPR gene expression program comprising 7–8% of the yeast genome7 to counteract ER stress. Here we show that, on activation, Ire1 molecules cluster in the ER membrane into discrete foci of higher-order oligomers, to which unspliced HAC1 mRNA is recruited by means of a conserved bipartite targeting element contained in the 3′ untranslated region. Disruption of either Ire1 clustering or HAC1 mRNA recruitment impairs UPR signalling. The HAC1 3′ untranslated region element is sufficient to target other mRNAs to Ire1 foci, as long as their translation is repressed. Translational repression afforded by the intron fulfils this requirement for HAC1 mRNA. Recruitment of mRNA to signalling centres provides a new paradigm for the control of eukaryotic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1967787729,"A long-term series of observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope has generated the highest quality spectrum so far obtained for an extrasolar planet. Previous spectra of the 'hot Jupiter' HD 189733b did not detect the predicted abundance of water vapour in the atmosphere, but the new data reveal strong water absorption in a mid-infrared emission spectrum. The differences between these and the earlier observations point to the possibility that predicted planetary-scale dynamical weather structures might alter the emission spectrum over time. Indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of the planet HD 189733b have recently been found in transmission spectra. This paper reports the detection of strong water absorption in a high signal-to-noise, mid-infrared emission spectrum of the planet itself. The differences between these and previous observations are significant and admit the possibility that predicted planetary-scale dynamical weather structures might alter the emission spectrum over time. Recent observations of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b did not reveal the presence of water in the emission spectrum of the planet1. Yet models of such ‘hot-Jupiter’ planets predict an abundance of atmospheric water vapour2. Validating and constraining these models is crucial to understanding the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres in extreme environments. Indications of the presence of water in the atmosphere of HD 189733b have recently been found in transmission spectra3,4, where the planet’s atmosphere selectively absorbs the light of the parent star, and in broadband photometry5. Here we report the detection of strong water absorption in a high-signal-to-noise, mid-infrared emission spectrum of the planet itself. We find both a strong downturn in the flux ratio below 10 µm and discrete spectral features that are characteristic of strong absorption by water vapour. The differences between these and previous observations are significant and admit the possibility that predicted planetary-scale dynamical weather structures6 may alter the emission spectrum over time. Models that match the observed spectrum and the broadband photometry suggest that heat redistribution from the dayside to the nightside is weak. Reconciling this with the high nightside temperature7 will require a better understanding of atmospheric circulation or possible additional energy sources."

https://openalex.org/W2041988645,"Haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells use a prototypic cell signalling system to transmit information about the extracellular concentration of mating pheromone secreted by potential mating partners. The ability of cells to respond distinguishably to different pheromone concentrations depends on how much information about pheromone concentration the system can transmit. Here we show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase Fus3 mediates fast-acting negative feedback that adjusts the dose response of the downstream system response to match the dose response of receptor-ligand binding. This 'dose-response alignment', defined by a linear relationship between receptor occupancy and downstream response, can improve the fidelity of information transmission by making downstream responses corresponding to different receptor occupancies more distinguishable and reducing amplification of stochastic noise during signal transmission. We also show that one target of the feedback is a previously uncharacterized signal-promoting function of the regulator of G-protein signalling protein Sst2. Our work suggests that negative feedback is a general mechanism used in signalling systems to align dose responses and thereby increase the fidelity of information transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1990813383,"The plant hormone auxin controls root epidermal cell development in a concentration-dependent manner. Root hairs are produced on a subset of epidermal cells as they increase in distance from the root tip. Auxin is required for their initiation and continued growth, but little is known about its distribution in this region of the root. Contrary to the expectation that hair cells might require active auxin influx to ensure auxin supply, we did not detect the auxin-influx transporter AUX1 in root-hair cells. A high level of AUX1 expression was detected in adjacent non-hair cell files. Non-hair cells were necessary to achieve wild-type root-hair length, although an auxin response was not required in these cells. Three-dimensional modelling of auxin flow in the root tip suggests that AUX1-dependent transport through non-hair cells maintains an auxin supply to developing hair cells as they increase in distance from the root tip, and sustains root-hair outgrowth. Experimental data support the hypothesis that instead of moving uniformly though the epidermal cell layer, auxin is mainly transported through canals that extend longitudinally into the tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2061963189,"Secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) were reported to antagonise Chordin processing by Sizzled, a tolloid-like metalloproteinase in Xenopus and zebrafish. Surprisingly, mammalian sFRP2 enhances the activity of tolloid-like metalloproteinases on procollagen C to modulate fibrosis associated with cardiac injury. Secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) have emerged as key regulators of a wide range of developmental and disease processes. Most of the known functions of mammalian sFRPs have been attributed to their ability to antagonize Wnt signalling. Recently however, Xenopus laevis and zebrafish sFRP, Sizzled, was shown to function as an antagonist of Chordin processing by Tolloid-like metalloproteinases. This has led to the proposal that sFRPs may function as evolutionarily conserved antagonists of chordinase activities of this class of proteinases. In contrast to this proposal, we show here that the mammalian sFRP, sFRP2, does not affect Chordin processing, but instead, can serve as a direct enhancer of procollagen C proteinase activity of Tolloid-like metalloproteinases. We also show that the level of fibrosis, in which procollagen processing by Tolloid-like proteinases has a rate-limiting role, is markedly reduced in Sfrp2-null mice subjected to myocardial infarction. Importantly, this reduced level of fibrosis is accompanied by significantly improved cardiac function. This study thus uncovers a function for sFRP2 and a potential therapeutic application for sFRP2 antagonism in controlling fibrosis in the infarcted heart."

https://openalex.org/W1975304359,"Continental rifts begin and develop through repeated episodes of faulting and magmatism, but strain partitioning between faulting and magmatism during discrete rifting episodes remains poorly documented. In highly evolved rifts, tensile stresses from far-field plate motions accumulate over decades before being released during relatively short time intervals by faulting and magmatic intrusions. These rifting crises are rarely observed in thick lithosphere during the initial stages of rifting. Here we show that most of the strain during the July-August 2007 seismic crisis in the weakly extended Natron rift, Tanzania, was released aseismically. Deformation was achieved by slow slip on a normal fault that promoted subsequent dyke intrusion by stress unclamping. This event provides compelling evidence for strain accommodation by magma intrusion, in addition to slip along normal faults, during the initial stages of continental rifting and before significant crustal thinning."

https://openalex.org/W2083654253,"Increased levels of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a critical regulator of cellular memory, are associated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) expression and disease progression in breast cancer. High levels of EZH2 signal the presence of metastasis and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. To test the hypothesis that deregulation of EZH2 contributes to ER-negative breast cancer progression, EZH2 expression was inhibited in ER-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and CAL51 using a lentivirus system. EZH2 knockdown decreased proliferation and delayed the G(2)/M cell-cycle transition, although not affecting apoptosis. In vivo, EZH2 downregulation significantly decreased breast xenograft growth and improved survival. EZH2 knockdown upregulated BRCA1 protein. Of note, BRCA1 knockdown was sufficient to rescue the effects of EZH2 downregulation on proliferation, G(2)/M arrest, and on the levels of hyperphosphorylated mitotic Cdc25C and Cyclin B1 proteins, crucial for entry into mitosis. Invasive ER-negative breast carcinomas show significant overexpression of EZH2 and downregulation of BRCA1 proteins. Taken together, we show that EZH2 is important in ER-negative breast cancer growth in vivo and in vitro, and that BRCA1 is required for the proliferative effects of EZH2. Blockade of EZH2 may provide a prime target to prevent and/or halt ER-negative breast cancer progression."

https://openalex.org/W2038121225,"Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency is regulated in part by transcription factor (TF) pathways that maintain self-renewal and inhibit differentiation. Stat3 and c-Myc TFs are essential for maintaining mouse ES cell self-renewal. c-Myc, together with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, is a reprogramming factor. While previous studies have investigated core transcriptional circuitry in ES cells, other TF pathways that promote ES cell pluripotency have yet to be investigated. Therefore, to further understand ES cell transcriptional networks, we used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) to map Stat3 and c-Myc binding targets in ES cells. Our results show that Stat3 and c-Myc occupy a significant number of genes whose expression is highly enriched in ES cells. By comparing Stat3 and c-Myc target genes with gene expression data from undifferentiated ES cells and embryoid bodies (EBs), we found that Stat3 binds active and inactive genes in ES cells, while c-Myc binds predominantly active genes. Moreover, the transcriptional states of Stat3 and c-Myc targets are correlated with co-occupancy of pluripotency-related TFs, polycomb group proteins, and active and repressive histone modifications. We also provide evidence that Stat3 targets are differentially expressed in ES cells following removal of LIF, where culture of ES cells in the absence of LIF resulted in downregulation of Stat3 target genes enriched in ES cells, and upregulation of lineage specific Stat3 target genes. Altogether, we reveal transcriptional targets of two key pluripotency-related genes in ES cells – Stat3 and c-Myc, thus providing further insight into the ES cell transcriptional network."
https://openalex.org/W1985290816,"Behavioural studies show that sleep plays a role in learning, and birdsong is a well established model system for the study of learning. It has been proposed that forebrain premotor neuron activity in sleeping adult zebra finches reflects daytime singing episodes. Now Sylvan Shank and Daniel Margoliash demonstrate a surprising role for sleep in establishing the organization of the songbird's brain at the time the bird first starts to learn to sing. In juvenile zebra finches yet to master their song, exposure to an adult 'tutor' song produced profound changes in the premotor neuronal activity during the subsequent sleep session. These changes in night-time activity are echoed in tutor-song-induced changes in singing the next day. In sleeping adult zebra finches, forebrain premotor neuron activity is proposed to reflect daytime singing episodes. This study shows that in juvenile songbirds yet to master their song, auditory exposure to an adult 'tutor' song produced profound changes in the premotor neuronal activity during the subsequent sleep session. These changes in night time activity preceded and reflected tutor-song induced changes in singing the next day. Behavioural studies widely implicate sleep in memory consolidation in the learning of a broad range of behaviours1,2,3,4. During sleep, brain regions are reactivated5,6, and specific patterns of neural activity are replayed7,8,9,10, consistent with patterns observed in previous waking behaviour. Birdsong learning is a paradigmatic model system for skill learning11,12,13,14. Song development in juvenile zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) is characterized by sleep-dependent circadian fluctuations in singing behaviour, with immediate post-sleep deterioration in song structure followed by recovery later in the day15. In sleeping adult birds, spontaneous bursting activity of forebrain premotor neurons in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) carries information about daytime singing16. Here we show that, in juvenile zebra finches, playback during the day of an adult ‘tutor’ song induced profound and tutor-song-specific changes in bursting activity of RA neurons during the following night of sleep. The night-time neuronal changes preceded tutor-song-induced changes in singing, first observed the following day. Interruption of auditory feedback greatly reduced sleep bursting and prevented the tutor-song-specific neuronal remodelling. Thus, night-time neuronal activity is shaped by the interaction of the song model (sensory template) and auditory feedback, with changes in night-time activity preceding the onset of practice associated with vocal learning. We hypothesize that night-time bursting induces adaptive changes in premotor networks during sleep as part of vocal learning. By this hypothesis, adaptive changes driven by replay of sensory information at night and by evaluation of sensory feedback during the day interact to produce the complex circadian patterns seen early in vocal development."
https://openalex.org/W2025015805,"Children born to mothers with lupus have a higher rate of learning disorders. Now, in mouse studies, Betty Diamond and her colleagues show that neurotoxic antibodies found in mothers with lupus are transferred to the brains of their offspring. This leads to abnormalities in cortical formation during development and in cognitive function when the pups become adults. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies and preferentially affecting women of childbearing age. Because the offspring of mothers with SLE show a high frequency of learning disorders1,2,3,4,5, we hypothesized that maternally transferred autoantibodies that bind DNA and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)6,7,8,9,10,11,12 could have a pathogenic role during fetal brain development. Here we describe a maternal SLE mouse model wherein pregnant dams harbored DNA-specific, NMDAR-specific autoantibodies throughout gestation. High titers of these autoantibodies in maternal circulation led to histological abnormalities in fetal brain and subsequent cognitive impairments in adult offspring. These data support a paradigm in which in utero exposure to neurotoxic autoantibodies causes abnormal brain development with long-term consequences. This paradigm may apply to multiple congenital neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2011901667,"PHLPP (PH domain leucine-rich repeats protein phosphatase) represents a family of novel Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. Two highly related isoforms in this family, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, have been identified to serve as negative regulators of Akt and protein kinase C by dephosphorylating the kinases directly. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of both PHLPP isoforms in colorectal cancer specimens and the adjacent normal mucosa using immunohistochemical staining. We found that the expression of PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 isoform was lost or decreased in 78 and 86% of tumor tissues, respectively. Stable overexpression of either PHLPP isoform in colon cancer cells decreased the rate of cell proliferation and sensitized the cells to growth inhibition induced by the phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, whereas knockdown of either PHLPP isoform by shRNA promoted the proliferation of DLD1 cells. In addition, we demonstrated that the PHLPP-mediated growth inhibition in colon cancer cells was largely rescued by overexpression of a constitutively active Akt. Moreover, reexpression of either PHLPP isoform in HCT116 cells inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our results strongly support a tumor suppressor role of PHLPP in colon cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2087543902,"Crystallization is the most serious bottleneck in high-throughput protein-structure determination by diffraction methods. We have used data mining of the large-scale experimental results of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium and experimental folding studies to characterize the biophysical properties that control protein crystallization. This analysis leads to the conclusion that crystallization propensity depends primarily on the prevalence of well-ordered surface epitopes capable of mediating interprotein interactions and is not strongly influenced by overall thermodynamic stability. We identify specific sequence features that correlate with crystallization propensity and that can be used to estimate the crystallization probability of a given construct. Analyses of entire predicted proteomes demonstrate substantial differences in the amino acid-sequence properties of human versus eubacterial proteins, which likely reflect differences in biophysical properties, including crystallization propensity. Our thermodynamic measurements do not generally support previous claims regarding correlations between sequence properties and protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1970680779,"Efficient and correct responses to double-stranded breaks (DSB) in chromosomal DNA are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal alterations that lead to cancer. The generation of DSB is associated with structural changes in chromatin and the activation of the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a key regulator of the signalling network of the cellular response to DSB. The interrelationship between DSB-induced changes in chromatin architecture and the activation of ATM is unclear. Here we show that the nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1 modulates the interaction of ATM with chromatin both before and after DSB formation, thereby optimizing its activation. Loss of HMGN1 or ablation of its ability to bind to chromatin reduces the levels of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced ATM autophosphorylation and the activation of several ATM targets. IR treatments lead to a global increase in the acetylation of Lys 14 of histone H3 (H3K14) in an HMGN1-dependent manner and treatment of cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors bypasses the HMGN1 requirement for efficient ATM activation. Thus, by regulating the levels of histone modifications, HMGN1 affects ATM activation. Our studies identify a new mediator of ATM activation and demonstrate a direct link between the steady-state intranuclear organization of ATM and the kinetics of its activation after DNA damage."

Several differences were observed when compared to previously established values from the United States, most notably in neutrophils and eosinophils.In a recently conducted vaccine trial in Uganda, 31 percent (n = 69) of volunteers screened (n = 223) were excluded due to hematologic abnormalities. If local reference ranges had been employed, 83% of those screened out due to these abnormalities could have been included in the study, drastically reducing workload and cost associated with the screening process.

https://openalex.org/W1992705983,"Laboratories routinely expose cells to high doses of ultraviolet (UV) light to measure the response to DNA damage. But what happens in the real world, where organisms are exposed either continuously or intermittently to low levels of UV? A study of the effects of environmentally relevant UV levels on yeast cells shows that there is a DNA system sufficiently sensitive to kick in following low-UV exposure. It is the RAD6–RAD8–RAD5 post-replication repair pathway. By preventing the generation of excess single-stranded DNA when replication forks are interrupted, it allows cells to replicate their DNA when it is damaged, thereby avoiding the activation of a cellular response that would inhibit proliferation. It is shown that type of repair pathway, known as postreplication repair, permits cells to replicate their DNA when it is damaged, thereby avoiding the activation of a cellular response that would inhibit proliferation. In nature, organisms are exposed to chronic low-dose ultraviolet light (CLUV) as opposed to the acute high doses common to laboratory experiments. Analysis of the cellular response to acute high-dose exposure has delineated the importance of direct DNA repair by the nucleotide excision repair pathway1 and for checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest in promoting cell survival2. Here we examine the response of yeast cells to CLUV and identify a key role for the RAD6–RAD18–RAD5 error-free postreplication repair (RAD6 error-free PRR) pathway3,4 in promoting cell growth and survival. We show that loss of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway results in DNA-damage-checkpoint-induced G2 arrest in CLUV-exposed cells, whereas wild-type and nucleotide-excision-repair-deficient cells are largely unaffected. Cell cycle arrest in the absence of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway was not caused by a repair defect or by the accumulation of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts. Notably, we observed increased replication protein A (RPA)– and Rad52–yellow fluorescent protein foci5 in the CLUV-exposed rad18Δ cells and demonstrated that Rad52-mediated homologous recombination is required for the viability of the rad18Δ cells after release from CLUV-induced G2 arrest. These and other data presented suggest that, in response to environmental levels of ultraviolet exposure, the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway promotes replication of damaged templates without the generation of extensive single-stranded DNA regions. Thus, the error-free PRR pathway is specifically important during chronic low-dose ultraviolet exposure to prevent counter-productive DNA checkpoint activation and allow cells to proliferate normally."
https://openalex.org/W2036424674,"Aging is associated with a progressive loss of muscle mass, increased adiposity and fibrosis that leads to sarcopenia. At the molecular level, muscle aging is known to alter the expression of a variety of genes but very little is known about the molecular effectors involved. SRF (Serum Response Factor) is a crucial transcription factor for muscle-specific gene expression and for post-natal skeletal muscle growth. To assess its role in adult skeletal muscle physiology, we developed a post-mitotic myofiber-specific and tamoxifen-inducible SRF knockout model. Five months after SRF loss, no obvious muscle phenotype was observed suggesting that SRF is not crucial for myofiber maintenance. However, mutant mice progressively developed IIB myofiber-specific atrophy accompanied by a metabolic switch towards a more oxidative phenotype, muscular lipid accumulation, sarcomere disorganization and fibrosis. After injury, mutant muscles exhibited an altered regeneration process, showing smaller regenerated fibers and persistent fibrosis. All of these features are strongly reminiscent of abnormalities encountered in aging skeletal muscle. Interestingly, we also observed an important age associated decrease in SRF expression in mice and human muscles. Altogether, these results suggest that a naturally occurring SRF down-regulation precedes and contributes to the muscle aging process. Indeed, triggering SRF loss in the muscles of mutant mice results in an accelerated aging process."

Inhibition of NF-κB by suppressing the canonical NF-κB activation pathway, for instance by knockdown of the three subunits of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex (IKK1, IKK2 and NEMO) triggers apoptosis in such cells. Here, we show that an MDS/AML model cell line exhibits a constitutive interaction, within the nucleus, of activated, S1981-phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) with NEMO. Inhibition of ATM with two distinct pharmacological inhibitors suppressed the activating autophosphorylation of ATM, blocked the interaction of ATM and NEMO, delocalized NEMO as well as another putative NF-κB activator, PIDD, from the nucleus, abolished the activating phosphorylation of the catalytic proteins of the IKK complex (IKK1/2 on serines 176/180), enhanced the expression of IκBα and caused the relocalization of NF-κB from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by apoptosis. Knockdown of ATM with small-interfering RNAs had a similar effect that could not be enhanced by knockdown of NEMO, PIDD and the p65 NF-κB subunit, suggesting that an ATM inhibition/depletion truly induced apoptosis through inhibition of the NF-κB system. Pharmacological inhibition of ATM also induced the nucleocytoplasmic relocalization of p65 in malignant myeloblasts purified from patients with high-risk MDS or AML, correlating with the induction of apoptosis. Altogether, these results support the contention that constitutively active ATM accounts for the activation of NF-κB in high-risk MDS and AML."

However, after the first study published in 2005 three other groups have dismissed the polymorphism described in the first paper as a causal mutation. Methodology and Principal Findings In the present study, we have produced a choriocarcinoma cell line overexpressing STOX1. This overexpression results in transcriptional modification of 12.5% of the genes, some of them being direct targets as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. STOX1 overexpression correlates strongly and specifically with transcriptomic alterations in preeclamptic placentas (r = 0.30, p = 9.10−7). Numerous known key modulators of preeclampsia (such as Endoglin, Syncytin, human chorionic gonadotrophin -hCG-, and Glial Cell Missing Homolog -GCM1-) were modified in these transformed choriocarcinoma cells. Conclusions Our results contribute to reconcile contradictory data concerning the involvement of STOX1 in preeclampsia. In addition, they strongly suggest that anomalies in STOX1 expression are associated with the onset of preeclampsia, thus indicating that this gene should be the target of future studies. Our cellular model could constitute an invaluable resource for studying specific aspects of this human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2047610428,"Background Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the second most common leukemia with approximately 13,410 new cases and 8,990 deaths annually in the United States. A novel fusion toxin treatment, diphtheria toxin GM-CSF (DT-GMCSF) has been shown to selectively eliminate leukemic repopulating cells that are critical for the formation of AML. We previously showed that DT-GMCSF treatment of U937 cells, an AML cell line, causes activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis. Methods and Findings In this study we further investigate the mechanisms of cell death induced by DT-GMCSF and show that, in addition to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, DT-GMCSF also kills AML cells by simultaneously activating caspase-independent necroptosis. These mechanisms depend on the ability of the targeted toxin to inhibit protein synthesis, and are not affected by the receptor that is targeted or the mechanism through which protein synthesis is blocked. Conclusions We conclude that fusion toxin proteins may be effective for treating AML cells whether or not they are defective in apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1973711833,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling is a potent modulator of the invasive and metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells. Indeed, breast tumor responsiveness to TGF-β is important for the development of osteolytic bone metastases. However, the specific TGF-β isoforms that promote breast cancer outgrowth in bone is unknown. We demonstrate that expression of a TGF-β ligand trap, which neutralizes TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells diminished their outgrowth in bone and reduced the severity of osteolytic lesion formation when compared with controls. We further show that a reduction or loss of TGF-β1 expression within the bone microenvironment of TGF-β1+/− and TGF-β1−/− mice significantly reduced the incidence of breast tumor outgrowth compared with wild-type animals. Interestingly, those tumors capable of growing within the tibiae of TGF-β1-deficient mice had upregulated expression of all three TGF-β isoforms. Finally, breast cancer cells expressing the TGF-β ligand trap showed a pronounced reduction in their ability to form osteolytic lesions when injected into the tibiae of TGF-β1+/− mice. Thus, our studies show that both host- and tumor-derived TGF-β expression plays a critical role during the establishment and outgrowth of breast cancer cells in bone."
https://openalex.org/W2119491918,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a dominantly inherited tumor syndrome that results from the mutation of the MEN1 gene that encodes protein menin. Stable overexpression of MEN1 has been shown to partially suppress the Ras-mediated morphological changes of fibroblast cells. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which menin decreases the oncogenic effects on cell morphology and other phenotypes. Here we showed that ectopic expression of menin in pretumor β-cells increases islet cell adhesion and reduces cell migration. Our further studies revealed that menin interacts with the scaffold protein, IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), reduces GTP–Rac1 interaction with IQGAP1 but increases epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)/β-catenin interaction with IQGAP1. Consistent with an essential role for menin in regulating β-cell adhesion in vivo, accumulations of β-catenin and E-cadherin are reduced at cell junctions in the islets from Men1-excised mice. Together, these results define a novel menin–IQGAP1 pathway that controls cell migration and cell–cell adhesion in endocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012503835,"The activation of T lymphocytes by specific antigen is accompanied by the formation of a specialized signaling region termed the immunological synapse, characterized by the clustering and segregation of surface molecules and, in particular, by T cell receptor (TCR) clustering.To better understand TCR motion during cellular activation, we used confocal microscopy and photo-bleaching recovery techniques to investigate the lateral mobility of TCR on the surface of human T lymphocytes under various pharmacological treatments. Using drugs that cause an increase in intracellular calcium, we observed a decrease in TCR mobility that was dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton. In parallel experiments measurement of filamentous actin by FACS analysis showed that raising intracellular calcium also causes increased polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton. These in vitro results were analyzed using a mathematical model that revealed effective binding parameters between TCR and the actin cytoskeleton.We propose, based on our results, that increase in intracellular calcium levels leads to actin polymerization and increases TCR/cytoskeleton interactions that reduce the overall mobility of the TCR. In a physiological setting, this may contribute to TCR re-positioning at the immunological synapse."

https://openalex.org/W2057975887,"Staphylococcus aureus colonies can spread on soft agar plates. We compared colony spreading of clinically isolated methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All MSSA strains showed colony spreading, but most MRSA strains (73%) carrying SCCmec type-II showed little colony spreading. Deletion of the entire SCCmec type-II region from these MRSA strains restored colony spreading. Introduction of a novel gene, fudoh, carried by SCCmec type-II into Newman strain suppressed colony spreading. MRSA strains with high spreading ability (27%) had no fudoh or a point-mutated fudoh that did not suppress colony spreading. The fudoh-transformed Newman strain had decreased exotoxin production and attenuated virulence in mice. Most community-acquired MRSA strains carried SCCmec type-IV, which does not include fudoh, and showed high colony spreading ability. These findings suggest that fudoh in the SCCmec type-II region suppresses colony spreading and exotoxin production, and is involved in S. aureus pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090738600,"Animals often settle near competitors, a behavior known as social attraction, which belies standard habitat selection theory. Two hypotheses account for these observations: individuals obtain Allee benefits mediated by the physical presence of a competitor, or they use successfully settled individual as a source of information indicating the location of high quality habitat. We evaluated these hypotheses experimentally in two species of shrikes. These passerine birds with a raptor-like mode of life impale prey to create larders that serve as an indicator of male/habitat quality. Thus, two forms of indirect information are available in our system: a successfully settled shrike and its larder. Typically these two cues are associated with each other, however, our experimental treatment created an unnatural situation by disassociating them. We manipulated the presence of larders of great grey shrikes and examined the settling decisions of red-backed shrikes within and outside the great grey shrike territories. Male red-backed shrikes did not settle sooner on plots with great grey shrikes compared to plots that only contained artificial larders indicating that red-backed shrikes do not use the physical presence of a great grey shrike when making settling decisions which is inconsistent with the Allee effect hypothesis. In contrast, for all plots without great grey shrikes, red-backed shrikes settled, paired and laid clutches sooner on plots with larders compared to plots without larders. We conclude that red-backed shrikes use larders of great grey shrikes as a cue to rapidly assess habitat quality."
https://openalex.org/W1989116853,"Background Neuroanatomical studies investigating the connectivity of brain areas have heretofore employed procedures in which chemical or viral tracers are injected into an area of interest, and connected areas are subsequently identified using histological techniques. Such experiments require the sacrifice of the animals and do not allow for subsequent electrophysiological studies in the same subjects, rendering a direct investigation of the functional properties of anatomically identified areas impossible. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we used a combination of microstimulation and fMRI in an anesthetized monkey preparation to study the connectivity of the superior colliculus (SC). Microstimulation of the SC resulted in changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals in the SC and in several cortical and subcortical areas consistent with the known connectivity of the SC in primates. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrates that the concurrent use of microstimulation and fMRI can be used to identify brain networks for further electrophysiological or fMRI investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2024947160,"Liver resection and the use of small-for-size grafts are restricted by the necessity to provide a sufficient amount of functional liver mass. Only few promising strategies to maximize liver regeneration are available. Apart from its erythropoiesis-stimulating effect, erythropoietin (EPO) has meanwhile been recognized as mitogenic, tissue-protective, and anti-apoptotic pleiotropic cytokine. Thus, EPO may support regeneration of hepatic tissue.Rats undergoing 68% hepatectomy received daily either high dose (5000 IU/kg bw i.v.) or low dose (500 IU/kg bw i.v.) recombinant human EPO or equal amounts of physiologic saline. Parameters of liver regeneration and hepatocellular apoptosis were assessed at 24 h, 48 h and 5 d after resection. In addition, red blood cell count, hematocrit and serum EPO levels as well as plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were evaluated. Further, hepatic Bcl-x(L) and Bax protein expression were analyzed by Western blot.Administration of EPO significantly reduced the expression of PCNA at 24 h followed by a significant decrease in restitution of liver mass at day 5 after partial hepatectomy. EPO increased TNF-alpha levels and shifted the Bcl-x(L) to Bax ratio towards the pro-apoptotic Bax resulting in significantly increased hepatocellular apoptosis.Multiple doses of EPO after partial hepatectomy increase hepatocellular apoptosis and impair liver regeneration in rats. Thus, careful consideration should be made in pre- and post-operative recombinant human EPO administration in the setting of liver resection and transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2048352529,"Regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical to prostate cancer (PCa) development; therefore, AR is the first line therapeutic target for disseminated tumors. Cell cycle-dependent accumulation of cyclin D1 negatively modulates the transcriptional regulation of AR through discrete, CDK4-independent mechanisms. The transcriptional corepressor function of cyclin D1 resides within a defined motif termed repressor domain (RD), and it was hypothesized that this motif could be utilized as a platform to develop new strategies for blocking AR function. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the RD peptide is sufficient to disrupt AR transcriptional activation of multiple, prostate-specific AR target genes. Importantly, these actions are sufficient to specifically inhibit S-phase progression in AR-positive PCa cells, but not in AR-negative cells or tested AR-positive cells of other lineages. As expected, impaired cell cycle progression resulted in a suppression of cell doubling. Additionally, cell death was observed in AR-positive cells that maintain androgen dependence and in a subset of castrate-resistant PCa cells, dependent on Akt activation status. Lastly, the ability of RD to cooperate with existing hormone therapies was examined, which revealed that RD enhanced the cellular response to an AR antagonist. Together, these data demonstrate that RD is sufficient to disrupt AR-dependent transcriptional and proliferative responses in PCa, and can enhance efficacy of AR antagonists, thus establishing the impetus for development of RD-based mimetics."
https://openalex.org/W2111978653,"We have determined X-ray crystal structures of four members of an archaeal specific family of proteins of unknown function (UPF0201; Pfam classification: DUF54) to advance our understanding of the genetic repertoire of archaea. Despite low pairwise amino acid sequence identities (10–40%) and the absence of conserved sequence motifs, the three-dimensional structures of these proteins are remarkably similar to one another. Their common polypeptide chain fold, encompassing a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and five α-helices, proved to be quite unexpectedly similar to that of the RRM-type RNA-binding domain of the ribosomal L5 protein, which is responsible for binding the 5S- rRNA. Structure-based sequence alignments enabled construction of a phylogenetic tree relating UPF0201 family members to L5 ribosomal proteins and other structurally similar RNA binding proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of the evolutionary purview of the RRM superfamily. Analyses of the surfaces of these newly determined UPF0201 structures suggest that they probably do not function as RNA binding proteins, and that this domain specific family of proteins has acquired a novel function in archaebacteria, which awaits experimental elucidation."
