https://openalex.org/W2967450000,"Most patients diagnosed with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survive less than 5 years, but a minor subset survives longer. Here, we dissect the role of the tumor microbiota and the immune system in influencing long-term survival. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the tumor microbiome composition in PDAC patients with short-term survival (STS) and long-term survival (LTS). We found higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of LTS patients and identified an intra-tumoral microbiome signature (Pseudoxanthomonas-Streptomyces-Saccharopolyspora-Bacillus clausii) highly predictive of long-term survivorship in both discovery and validation cohorts. Through human-into-mice fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments from STS, LTS, or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration. Our study demonstrates that PDAC microbiome composition, which cross-talks to the gut microbiome, influences the host immune response and natural history of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2969167159,"We performed a comprehensive assessment of rare inherited variation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by analyzing whole-genome sequences of 2,308 individuals from families with multiple affected children. We implicate 69 genes in ASD risk, including 24 passing genome-wide Bonferroni correction and 16 new ASD risk genes, most supported by rare inherited variants, a substantial extension of previous findings. Biological pathways enriched for genes harboring inherited variants represent cytoskeletal organization and ion transport, which are distinct from pathways implicated in previous studies. Nevertheless, the de novo and inherited genes contribute to a common protein-protein interaction network. We also identified structural variants (SVs) affecting non-coding regions, implicating recurrent deletions in the promoters of DLG2 and NR3C2. Loss of nr3c2 function in zebrafish disrupts sleep and social function, overlapping with human ASD-related phenotypes. These data support the utility of studying multiplex families in ASD and are available through the Hartwell Autism Research and Technology portal."
https://openalex.org/W2967524380,"Growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is an inflammation-associated hormone with poorly defined biology. Here, we investigated the role of GDF15 in bacterial and viral infections. We found that inflammation induced GDF15, and that GDF15 was necessary for surviving both bacterial and viral infections, as well as sepsis. The protective effects of GDF15 were largely independent of pathogen control or the magnitude of inflammatory response, suggesting a role in disease tolerance. Indeed, we found that GDF15 was required for hepatic sympathetic outflow and triglyceride metabolism. Failure to defend the lower limit of plasma triglyceride levels was associated with impaired cardiac function and maintenance of body temperature, effects that could be rescued by exogenous administration of lipids. Together, we show that GDF15 coordinates tolerance to inflammatory damage through regulation of triglyceride metabolism."

How these opposing effects are integrated to impact immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is unclear. We show that while inhibiting tumor IFNG signaling decreases interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cancer cells, it increases ISGs in immune cells by enhancing IFNG produced by exhausted T cells (TEX). In tumors with favorable antigenicity, these TEX mediate rejection. In tumors with neoantigen or MHC-I loss, TEX instead utilize IFNG to drive maturation of innate immune cells, including a PD1+TRAIL+ ILC1 population. By disabling an inhibitory circuit impacting PD1 and TRAIL, blocking tumor IFNG signaling promotes innate immune killing. Thus, interferon signaling in cancer cells and immune cells oppose each other to establish a regulatory relationship that limits both adaptive and innate immune killing. In melanoma and lung cancer patients, perturbation of this relationship is associated with ICB response independent of tumor mutational burden.

In melanoma and lung cancer patients, perturbation of this relationship is associated with ICB response independent of tumor mutational burden. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) of the inhibitory receptors CTLA4 and PD1 can result in durable responses in multiple cancer types (Ribas and Wolchok, 2018Ribas A. Wolchok J.D. Cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade.Science. 2018; 359: 1350-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2961) Google Scholar). Resistance and relapse are common and can be influenced by factors inherent to immune cells, cancer cells, or both (Patel and Minn, 2018Patel S.A. Minn A.J. Combination Cancer Therapy with Immune Checkpoint Blockade: Mechanisms and Strategies.Immunity. 2018; 48: 417-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Important immune features include the status of T cell infiltration and the differentiation or activation state of T cells and innate immune cells. Features intrinsic to cancer cells that can impact ICB outcome include their repertoire of neoantigens, the ability to present antigens on major histocompatibility complex class one (MHC-I), and the expression of inhibitory receptor ligands. The clinical relevance of these immune and cancer cell factors is highlighted by common biomarkers for ICB response such as type I or II interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) (Ayers et al., 2017Ayers M.

Both IFN-gamma (IFNG) and type I IFN (IFN-I) are among the known pathways that have critical roles in anti-tumor immunity. IFN enhances immune function by inducing expression of MHC-I (Dighe et al., 1994Dighe A.S. Richards E. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Enhanced in vivo growth and resistance to rejection of tumor cells expressing dominant negative IFN γ receptors.Immunity. 1994; 1: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), which is constitutively expressed on many tissues including cancer cells, and by enabling dendritic cells (DCs) to cross prime T cells (Diamond et al., 2011Diamond M.S. Kinder M. Matsushita H. Mashayekhi M. Dunn G.P. Archambault J.M. Lee H. Arthur C.D. White J.M.

In this way, IFNs are important in the early phase of antigen recognition and the interaction between adaptive and innate immune cells. Accordingly, loss-of-function mutations and genomic alterations in the IFN signaling pathway have been associated with clinical ICB resistance and/or relapse (Gao et al., 2016Gao J. Shi L.Z. Zhao H.

In contrast, some patients have tumors with mutations in the IFN pathway that nonetheless respond to ICB (Hellmann et al., 2018Hellmann M.D. Nathanson T. Rizvi H. Creelan B.C. Sanchez-Vega F.

Blackmon S.M. et al.Resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy through inactivation of antigen presentation.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) or have high serum levels of IFNG that associates with ICB progression (Huang et al., 2017Huang A.C. Postow M.A. Orlowski R.J. Mick R. Bengsch B. Manne S. Xu W. Harmon S. Giles J.R. Wenz B. et al.T-cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response.Nature. 2017; 545: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). These apparently “paradoxical” observations may represent feedback inhibition properties of IFN signaling (Snell et al., 2017Snell L.M. McGaha T.L. Brooks D.G. Type I Interferon in Chronic Virus Infection and Cancer.Trends Immunol. 2017; 38: 542-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the context of chronic pathogen infection, persistent IFN signaling and ISGs dampen immune responses to prevent immune-mediated pathology while allowing for a host-pathogen stalemate (Cheng et al., 2017Cheng L. Ma J. Li J. Li D. Li G. Li F. Zhang Q. Yu H. Yasui F. Ye C. et al.Blocking type I interferon signaling enhances T cell recovery and reduces HIV-1 reservoirs.J. Clin.

Blockade of chronic type I interferon signaling to control persistent LCMV infection.Science. 2013; 340: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In cancer, this dichotomous function of IFN is exploited through chronic signaling by tumor cells that can promote resistance to ICB (Benci et al., 2016Benci J.L. Xu B. Qiu Y. Wu T.J. Dada H. Twyman-Saint Victor C. Cucolo L. Lee D.S.M. Pauken K.E. Huang A.C. et al.Tumor Interferon Signaling Regulates a Multigenic Resistance Program to Immune Checkpoint Blockade.Cell. 2016; 167: 1540-1554.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). IFN-driven resistance can be inhibited by genetic ablation of the IFNG receptor (IFNGR) and/or IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) in cancer cells, resulting in a decrease in PDL1, other inhibitory ligands, and the GzmB antagonist SERPINB9 (Jiang et al., 2018Jiang P. Gu S. Pan D. Fu J. Sahu A. Hu X. Li Z. Traugh N. Bu X. Li B. et al.Signatures of T cell dysfunction and exclusion predict cancer immunotherapy response.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 1550-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Expansion of exhausted T cells (TEX) can then ensue to restore ICB response through unknown mechanisms. Together, these observations highlight the importance of understanding how the opposing functions of IFN signaling impact cancer immunotherapy. Loss of the beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) subunit of MHC-I appears to be a common resistance mechanism to ICB (Sade-Feldman et al., 2017Sade-Feldman M. Jiao Y.J. Chen J.H. Rooney M.S. Barzily-Rokni M. Eliane J.-P. Bjorgaard S.L. Hammond M.R. Vitzthum H. Blackmon S.M. et al.Resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy through inactivation of antigen presentation.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, diminished expression or loss of B2M can also occur in patients who respond to ICB (Rizvi et al., 2018Rizvi H. Sanchez-Vega F. La K. Chatila W. Jonsson P. Halpenny D. Plodkowski A. Long N. Sauter J.L. Rekhtman N. et al.Molecular Determinants of Response to Anti-Programmed Cell Death (PD)-1 and Anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Blockade in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Profiled With Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing.J. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 36: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, Rodig et al., 2018Rodig S.J. Gusenleitner D. Jackson D.G. Gjini E. Giobbie-Hurder A. Jin C. Chang H. Lovitch S.B. Horak C. Weber J.S. et al.MHC proteins confer differential sensitivity to CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade in untreated metastatic melanoma.Sci Transl Med. 2018; 10 (eaar3342)Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that innate immune cells might contribute to ICB response in some cases. Indeed, conventional NK cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are capable of destroying cancers through either perforin-mediated cytotoxicity or TNF-family death receptors such as TRAIL (Spits et al., 2016Spits H. Bernink J.H. Lanier L. NK cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells: partners in host defense.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). NK/ILC effector function is regulated through cellular maturation, combinations of activating and inhibitory receptors, and possibly immune checkpoint receptors like PD1, TIM3, and TIGIT (Gao et al., 2017Gao Y. Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Bald T. Ng S.S. Young A. Ngiow S.F. Rautela J. Straube J. Waddell N.

Wei H. et al.Blockade of the checkpoint receptor TIGIT prevents NK cell exhaustion and elicits potent anti-tumor immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that type one ILCs (ILC1s) can participate in anti-tumor immunity or cancer immune surveillance. This includes ILC1-like populations (Dadi et al., 2016Dadi S. Chhangawala S. Whitlock B.M. Franklin R.A. Luo C.T. Oh S.A. Toure A. Pritykin Y. Huse M. Leslie C.S. Li M.O. Cancer Immunosurveillance by Tissue-Resident Innate Lymphoid Cells and Innate-like T Cells.Cell. 2016; 164: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and intratumoral ILC1s that are generally poorly cytotoxic (Cortez et al., 2017Cortez V.S. Ulland T.K. Cervantes-Barragan L. Bando J.K. Robinette M.L. Wang Q. White A.J. Gilfillan S. Cella M. Colonna M. SMAD4 impedes the conversion of NK cells into ILC1-like cells by curtailing non-canonical TGF-β signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Gao et al., 2017Gao Y. Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes F. Bald T. Ng S.S. Young A. Ngiow S.F. Rautela J. Straube J. Waddell N. Blake S.J. et al.Tumor immunoevasion by the conversion of effector NK cells into type 1 innate lymphoid cells.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18: 1004-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although the ability of NK/ILC1s to eradicate tumors with diminished MHC-I and/or a poor neoantigens is of significant interest, how to mobilize these innate immune cells to facilitate tumor response is unclear. A large proportion of human cancers differentially express a subset of ISGs that can predict resistance to radiation and chemotherapy (Weichselbaum et al., 2008Weichselbaum R.R. Ishwaran H. Yoon T. Nuyten D.S.A. Baker S.W. Khodarev N. Su A.W. Shaikh A.Y. Roach P. Kreike B. et al.An interferon-related gene signature for DNA damage resistance is a predictive marker for chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18490-18495Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, this ISG resistance signature (ISG.RS) is also associated with resistance to ICB, as demonstrated by elevated expression in murine tumors from Res 499 melanoma cells (Figure 1A), which were derived from an ICB-resistant B16-F10 tumor (Twyman-Saint Victor et al., 2015Twyman-Saint Victor C. Rech A.J. Maity A. Rengan R. Pauken K.E. Stelekati E. Benci J.L. Xu B. Dada H. Odorizzi P.M. et al.Radiation and dual checkpoint blockade activate non-redundant immune mechanisms in cancer.Nature. 2015; 520: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). In contrast, ISGs can also predict clinical ICB response, especially ISGs typically associated with IFNG signaling (Ayers et al., 2017Ayers M. Lunceford J. Nebozhyn M. Murphy E. Loboda A. Kaufman D.R. Albright A. Cheng J.D. Kang S.P. Shankaran V. et al.IFN-γ-related mRNA profile predicts clinical response to PD-1 blockade.J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127: 2930-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). To begin reconciling these seemingly disparate observations, we examined the ISG.RS and genes from the IFNG hallmark gene set (IFNG.GS) by dividing them into two non-overlapping subsets (Figure 1B and Table S1) and creating a metagene (the average scaled expression of all genes in the set). The expression of these ISG metagenes was then examined across different cellular populations in human melanomas using previously published single-cell RNA-seq data (Tirosh et al., 2016Tirosh I. Izar B. Prakadan S.M. Wadsworth 2nd, M.H. Treacy D. Trombetta J.J. Rotem A. Rodman C. Lian C. Murphy G. et al.Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2016; 352: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). This revealed that the IFNG.GS is predominantly expressed by intratumoral immune cells such as T cells, NK cells, and macrophages (Figures 1B and S1A). In contrast, the ISG.RS is predominantly expressed in cancer cells, albeit with variable expression.Figure S1ISGs and Immune Cell Populations Expressed in Human Melanoma, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Boxplots of ISG metagene expression in immune cell populations determined by single-cell RNA-seq of human melanoma.

To understand the potential consequences of these differences in IFNG.GS and ISG.RS expression patterns, we analyzed bulk RNA-seq data combined from two cohorts of melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1 (Figure 1C) (Hugo et al., 2016Hugo W. Zaretsky J.M. Sun L. Song C. Moreno B.H. Hu-Lieskovan S. Berent-Maoz B. Pang J. Chmielowski B.

As expected, the majority of genes in the IFNG.GS are depressed in the majority of tumors from non-responders to anti-PD1 (Figure S1B). However, like ICB-resistant murine Res 499 tumors, most ISG.RS genes are enriched in tumors from non-responders (Figure S1B). Consistent with the importance of CD8 T cells in response, tumors with high IFNG.GS but low ISG.RS also have the greatest proportion of CD8 T cells (Figure 1D, top right quadrant) as inferred by CIBERSORT (Newman et al., 2015Newman A.M. Liu C.L. Green M.R. Gentles A.J. Feng W. Xu Y. Hoang C.D. Diehn M. Alizadeh A.A. Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C). The higher frequencies of CD8 T cells are accompanied by increased number of activated NK cells (Figure 1D, orange regression line), which also has been associated with clinical ICB response (Riaz et al., 2017Riaz N. Havel J.J. Makarov V. Desrichard A. Urba W.J. Sims J.S. Hodi F.S. Martín-Algarra S. Mandal R.

To understand how these immune and interferon-related variables independently contribute to ICB response, we utilized a multivariable logistic regression model. This revealed that while higher IFNG.GS increases the odds ratio for response, ISG.RS independently decreases the likelihood (Figure 1E). The significance of both of these variables are independent of tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, which expectedly correlates with response. In contrast, neither the abundance of CD8 T cells nor NK cells are significant in the model. A random forest model, which does not assume linearity and incorporates interaction effects, revealed that ISG.RS exhibits a higher importance score than either IFNG.GS or TMB (Figure S1D). In total, these data suggest that while expression of IFNG.GS by immune cells is associated with CD8 T cell abundance, accumulation of activated NK cells, and ICB response, all of these effects are opposed by high levels of ISG.RS in cancer cells. Although the IFNG.GS and ISG.RS predict opposite clinical outcomes, their expression is positively correlated, consistent with IFN controlling both metagenes (Figure 1F). An explanation for this apparent “paradox” lies in the relative expression of each metagene. When expression of the ISG.RS exceeds the IFNG.GS, resistance is favored (Figure 1F, left plot, red circles below diagonal). In contrast, most responses occur when IFNG.GS is similar to or greater than ISG.RS (Figure 1F, blue circles). Based on these findings, we combined the two metagenes into a ratio of IFNG.GS over ISG.RS (or, the difference of these two metagenes in log transformed space). By logistic regression, this composite variable (dISG) is strongly associated with response and is independent of TMB (Figure 1F, right plot and inset). Specifically, the probability of response is low when either the ratio or TMB is low but increases when either increase. Furthermore, random forest machine learning and bootstrapping revealed that the ISG ratio has the highest robustness and average variable importance compared to TMB and multiple immune features (Figure S1E). In total, the single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis suggests that distinct ISGs differentially expressed by cancer and immune cells can oppose each other to influence CD8 T cell infiltrate and NK activation and can be combined into a ratio that predicts ICB response independent of TMB (Figure 1G). Motivated by these findings, we sought to understand the mechanistic underpinnings inferred by these statistical relationships. If the probability of ICB response is influenced by the ratio of IFNG-related ISGs expressed by immune cells over inhibitory ISGs expressed by cancer cells, one way to enhance the ratio in favor of response is to prevent IFN signaling in cancer cells. We first confirmed whether the ISG.RS, which is elevated in ICB-resistant Res 499 tumors, is regulated by IFN signaling in cancer cells (hereafter referred to as tumor IFN signaling). Indeed, CRISPR knockout of IFNGR and/or IFNAR significantly diminishes ISG.RS levels (Figure 1H). However, loss of tumor IFN signaling can render cancers less responsive to immunotherapy due to compromised MHC-I and antigen processing (Manguso et al., 2017Manguso R.T. Pope H.W.

Med. 2016; 375: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar), suggesting that the impact from ablating tumor IFN signaling might be context dependent. In light of this, we surmised two situations whereby the benefit of inhibiting IFN-driven resistance could outweigh the potential negative impact on MHC-I. The first is when constitutive MHC-I is high, minimizing effects that loss of IFN-inducible MHC-I has on CTL-mediated killing. A second situation is when tumors have depleted or poor neoantigens. Here, diminished CTL recognition presumably makes MHC-I status less consequential for T cell-mediating killing, but interference with IFN-driven resistance might improve killing by NK or other innate lymphoid cells. We first characterized various mouse tumor models for differences in MHC-I expression, TMB, and predicted neoantigen status (Figure 2A). Of these, CT26 colorectal cancer has the highest TMB (Figure 2B) and maintains high MHC-I in the absence of IFNG signaling (Figures 2C and 2D)"
https://openalex.org/W2967977322,"While Mediator plays a key role in eukaryotic transcription, little is known about its mechanism of action. This study combines CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens, degron assays, Hi-C, and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to dissect the function and structure of mammalian Mediator (mMED). Deletion analyses in B, T, and embryonic stem cells (ESC) identified a core of essential subunits required for Pol II recruitment genome-wide. Conversely, loss of non-essential subunits mostly affects promoters linked to multiple enhancers. Contrary to current models, however, mMED and Pol II are dispensable to physically tether regulatory DNA, a topological activity requiring architectural proteins. Cryo-EM analysis revealed a conserved core, with non-essential subunits increasing structural complexity of the tail module, a primary transcription factor target. Changes in tail structure markedly increase Pol II and kinase module interactions. We propose that Mediator's structural pliability enables it to integrate and transmit regulatory signals and act as a functional, rather than an architectural bridge, between promoters and enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2968334948,"Small proteins are traditionally overlooked due to computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe >4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ∼30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2967355849,"Somatosensory over-reactivity is common among patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and is hypothesized to contribute to core ASD behaviors. However, effective treatments for sensory over-reactivity and ASDs are lacking. We found distinct somatosensory neuron pathophysiological mechanisms underlie tactile abnormalities in different ASD mouse models and contribute to some ASD-related behaviors. Developmental loss of ASD-associated genes Shank3 or Mecp2 in peripheral mechanosensory neurons leads to region-specific brain abnormalities, revealing links between developmental somatosensory over-reactivity and the genesis of aberrant behaviors. Moreover, acute treatment with a peripherally restricted GABAA receptor agonist that acts directly on mechanosensory neurons reduced tactile over-reactivity in six distinct ASD models. Chronic treatment of Mecp2 and Shank3 mutant mice improved body condition, some brain abnormalities, anxiety-like behaviors, and some social impairments but not memory impairments, motor deficits, or overgrooming. Our findings reveal a potential therapeutic strategy targeting peripheral mechanosensory neurons to treat tactile over-reactivity and select ASD-related behaviors."

We apply T-Scan to discover new viral antigens, perform high-resolution mapping of TCR specificity, and characterize the reactivity of a tumor-derived TCR. T-Scan is a powerful approach for studying T cell responses. The immune system is divided into innate and adaptive subsystems that together work to eliminate or inactivate pathogens and eliminate neoplasias. The adaptive immune system generates an immunological memory through memory B and T lymphocytes, potent effectors of this system. Understanding the specificity of this memory is central to understanding the ways in which pathogens are identified and eliminated, tumors are rejected, and pathogenic autoimmunity emerges. B and T cells evolve antigen specificity through the generation of somatically rearranged B cell receptors (BCRs) and T cell receptors (TCRs). T lymphocytes fall broadly into two categories, CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Of these, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directly eliminate pathogens by recognizing and killing cells infected by intracellular pathogens. CTLs use TCRs to survey antigens presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on the surface of cells. Upon TCR recognition of cognate antigen-MHC I complexes, CTLs secrete cytokines and cytolytic molecules, thereby killing the target cell. CTLs are required for the control of many infections, including HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and malaria (Li et al., 2016Li X. Huang J. Zhang M. Funakoshi R. Sheetij D. Spaccapelo R. Crisanti A.

Aberrant antibodies and T cell responses to self-antigens can cause autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (Gravano and Hoyer, 2013Gravano D.M. Hoyer K.K. Promotion and prevention of autoimmune disease by CD8+ T cells.J. Autoimmun. 2013; 45: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, CTL recognition of tumor cells serves as the foundation for promising immunotherapies such as adoptive T cell transfer and T cell immune checkpoint blockade (Yang, 2015Yang Y. Cancer immunotherapy: harnessing the immune system to battle cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 3335-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). A major ongoing challenge is the characterization of the antigens driving T cell activity in these contexts. Understanding the targets of T cell responses is critical to enable the effective harnessing and modulation of CTLs across human disease. We and others have recently developed high-throughput approaches to interrogate B cell specificities. These technologies rely on displaying large candidate antigen libraries using phage display (PhIP-Seq, VirScan) (Larman et al., 2011Larman H.B. Zhao Z. Laserson U. Li M.Z. Ciccia A. Gakidis M.A.M.

Proteomics. 2014; 13: 1585-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Such unbiased profiling of antibody specificities reveals biomarkers of disease and insights about humoral immunity (Xu et al., 2016Xu G.J. Shah A.A. Li M.Z. Xu Q. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. Elledge S.J. Systematic autoantigen analysis identifies a distinct subtype of scleroderma with coincident cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, equivalent tools for comprehensive profiling of T cell specificities have not kept pace, limiting our ability to understand the adaptive immune system on a systems-wide scale. Identifying T cell specificities is challenging for several reasons. First, T cell antigens are presented as short peptides non-covalently bound to MHC molecules, complicating the prediction and synthetic generation of candidate antigens. Second, TCRs have relatively low affinity for their targets (Stone et al., 2009Stone J.D. Chervin A.S. Kranz D.M. T-cell receptor binding affinities and kinetics: impact on T-cell activity and specificity.Immunology. 2009; 126: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Finally, TCR signaling is complex as antigen binding does not uniformly lead to functional TCR signaling (Sibener et al., 2018Sibener L.V. Fernandes R.A. Kolawole E.M. Carbone C.B. Liu F. McAffee D. Birnbaum M.E. Yang X. Su L.F. Yu W. et al.Isolation of a Structural Mechanism for Uncoupling T Cell Receptor Signaling from Peptide-MHC Binding.Cell. 2018; 174: 672-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Classic approaches for understanding T cell specificity rely on readouts of T cell function, which include assays for cytotoxicity, cytokine release, and proliferation in the presence of candidate antigens (Sharma and Holt, 2014Sharma G. Holt R.A. T-cell epitope discovery technologies.Hum. Immunol. 2014; 75: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), augmented by peptide-MHC tetramers for antigen-specific populations (Altman et al., 1996Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J.

However, these are primarily useful for per-determined sets of 10–100 s of antigens but are unsuitable for unbiased discovery of antigens at genome scale (Bentzen et al., 2016Bentzen A.K.

Several other approaches have been taken to map unknown T cell specificities. A recent approach uses display of peptides as single-chain fusions to MHC on the surface of target cells. T cell binding to cognate antigen results in trogocytosis (Li et al., 2019Li G. Bethune M.T. Wong S. Joglekar A.V. Leonard M.T. Wang J.K. Kim J.T. Cheng D. Peng S. Zaretsky J.M. et al.T cell antigen discovery via trogocytosis.Nat.

Methods. 2019; 16: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), enabling the isolation of recognized target cells. Another approach uses display of genetically encoded random peptides covalently attached to MHC molecules on the surface of yeast (Birnbaum et al., 2014Birnbaum M.E. Mendoza J.L. Sethi D.K. Dong S. Glanville J. Dobbins J. Ozkan E. Davis M.M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Garcia K.C.

Mimotopes for alloreactive and conventional T cells in a peptide-MHC display library.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and use soluble TCRs to pan the yeast library for peptide-MHC binding. This approach suffers from the formidable challenge of mapping the random peptides identified onto the endogenous antigens they resemble (Gee et al., 2018Gee M.H. Han A. Lofgren S.M. Beausang J.F. Mendoza J.L. Birnbaum M.E. Bethune M.T. Fischer S. Yang X.

Moreover, neither the yeast display nor single-chain approaches require endogenous processing of antigens nor functional activation of T cells, which leaves uncertainty as to whether the identified antigens are physiologically meaningful in vivo. Notably, even high affinity TCR binders identified by yeast display do not uniformly lead to T cell function (Adams et al., 2011Adams J.J. Narayanan S. Liu B. Birnbaum M.E. Kruse A.C. Bowerman N.A.

Overall, additional genome-wide tools are required to gain a more complete picture of the antigens functionally driving T cell responses and to enable the level of systematic profiling that is already accessible for the humoral response. Here, we present a TCR epitope scanning method we call T-Scan, a high-throughput, genome-wide platform for the systematic identification of antigens productively recognized by T cells. T-Scan leverages genome-wide libraries encoding pathogen or human proteomes that are processed and presented on endogenous MHC-I molecules. Antigen recognition by cognate TCRs is monitored through a fluorescent reporter of granzyme B (GzB) activity in the target cells. This unbiased strategy eliminates the need for predictive algorithms, and by relying on the physiological activity of T cell killing, is not solely dependent on measuring TCR binding affinity to peptide-MHC complexes. We validate the utility of T-Scan by showing that it can identify known peptide epitopes of both viral and autoreactive TCRs from proteome-wide libraries and go on to exploit the method to generate high-resolution maps of TCR specificity and identify the epitopes recognized by multiple orphan TCRs. We set out to establish a genome-wide screening platform to uncover the specificity of TCRs. We initially considered two categories of approaches to T cell antigen discovery: a target depletion approach and a target enrichment approach. The former would rely upon killing of cognate target cells, allowing for depletion of the relevant target from a pool. However, dropout approaches suffer from low dynamic range and are difficult to multiplex, and detectable depletion would require potent T cells with the ability to all but eliminate a target from a population. In contrast, target enrichment approaches have the advantage that they have a wider potential dynamic range. For example, if one were to obtain 20% killing, for a dropout screen one would need to detect a difference between cognate antigen abundance of 100% and 80%, whereas in an enrichment screen with background killing of 1%, 20% killing could provide a 20-fold enrichment of the antigen. Thus, we set out to employ a target enrichment strategy to develop a T cell epitope screening method. The T-Scan platform that we developed employs a cell-based pooled screen to identify the cognate antigens of T cells (Figure 1A). In T-Scan, target cells express a library of lentivirally-delivered candidate antigens that are processed and presented endogenously on MHC molecules. This library of target cells is co-cultured with T cells of interest, which secrete cytotoxic granules into cells displaying their cognate antigen. A GzB reporter, described below, is used to detect the target cells that receive these cytotoxic granules and to enable their isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Finally, we use PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify the antigens that these cells are programmed to express, thereby permitting a sequencing-based readout of T cell specificity. To isolate target cells functionally recognized by a T cell, we developed reporters of GzB activity. GzB is a serine protease that is contained in the cytotoxic granules and which, when released, cleaves a broad set of proteins to trigger apoptosis (Casciola-Rosen et al., 2007Casciola-Rosen L. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Becker J.W. Hines T. Thornberry N.A. Rosen A. Mouse and human granzyme B have distinct tetrapeptide specificities and abilities to recruit the bid pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4545-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We reasoned that GzB activity is an attractive readout of T cell recognition because (1) GzB provides robust enzymatic activity that can amplify the signal of a limited number of secreted molecules, which provides sensitivity, (2) GzB activity is completely specific to target cells that have received cytotoxic granules, allowing for the isolation of rare cells killed by T cells while avoiding contamination from cells undergoing apoptosis for other reasons, and (3) GzB activity is a functional readout of physiologically relevant T cell activation. We explored several reporters of GzB activity. The first examined allows for direct amplification of the antigen cassette from cells that have received GzB (Figure S1A). Cre recombinase is expressed in target cells, but is held inactive by being tethered to the plasma membrane; GzB cleaves the membrane tether, releasing Cre into the nucleus where it can catalyze the inversion of a reporter cassette adjacent to the expressed antigen. This inversion event can be detected by PCR, enabling the selective amplification of antigen cassettes expressed in GzB-positive cells from bulk genomic DNA without the need for cell sorting of targeted cells. We demonstrated a 4-fold increase in cassette inversion following the delivery of GzB into target cells (Figures S1B and S1C). However, despite efforts to decrease background, the signal-to-noise was not as high as we desired. The second reporter is a genetically encoded protein that fluoresces following proteolysis by GzB (Figure 1B). We generated IFPGZB, an infrared fluorescent protein (IFP)-based GzB reporter, by introducing a GzB-specific cleavage sequence (Choi and Mitchison, 2013Choi P.J. Mitchison T.J. Imaging burst kinetics and spatial coordination during serial killing by single natural killer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) into the scaffold reported by To et al., 2015To T.-L. Piggott B.J. Makhijani K. Yu D. Jan Y.N. Shu X. Rationally designed fluorogenic protease reporter visualizes spatiotemporal dynamics of apoptosis in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 3338-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. This reporter is activated in cells co-cultured with cytotoxic T cells in the presence of cognate antigen, but, crucially, not in the presence of non-cognate antigen (Figure 1C). In screens, target cells activating the IFPGZB reporter following co-culture are isolated by FACS. We observed better signal-to-noise with the fluorogenic GzB reporter than the Cre reporter, and hence we selected this reporter for further development. A key element of the success of any screening strategy is the reduction of noise and preservation of signal. To promote efficient antigen screening, we made two additional modifications to the target cells. First, to reduce noise through the potential for presentation of cross-reactive peptide epitopes on irrelevant MHC proteins, we used CRISPR to mutate all 6 endogenous HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C MHC-encoding genes and re-expressed the individual HLA allele of interest. This ensured that any response detected would be restricted to the correct MHC protein and reduced background reactivity to peptides presented on other MHC alleles. GzB delivery into cells results in the activation of caspases and subsequent apoptosis. During the process of GzB-induced apoptosis, caspases cleave the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) protein, releasing active CAD nuclease. CAD fragments genomic DNA, which could impair our NGS analysis. Thus, second, to preserve signal, we expressed a caspase-resistant version of ICAD protein, ICADCR (Sakahira et al., 1998Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Cleavage of CAD inhibitor in CAD activation and DNA degradation during apoptosis.Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar), in the target cells to prevent genomic DNA fragmentation during apoptosis, enabling more efficient recovery of antigen information from the genomic DNA of GzB-positive cells. We termed the MHC-I null target cells expressing IFPGZB and ICADCR epitope discovery cells (EDCs). As a model for testing the T-Scan platform, we chose CMV-specific T cell responses. T cell responses to CMV have been intensively investigated and many reagents exist that facilitate our efforts to validate the T-Scan platform, including known immunodominant epitopes, antigen-specific TCRs, and peptide-specific tetramers (Klenerman and Oxenius, 2016Klenerman P. Oxenius A. T cell responses to cytomegalovirus.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, Schub et al., 2009Schub A. Schuster I.G. Hammerschmidt W. Moosmann A. CMV-specific TCR-transgenic T cells for immunotherapy.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6819-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we set out to use CMV genome-wide screens with known CMV-reactive T cells to validate the T-Scan platform. We synthesized a library of 5,764 oligonucleotides encoding 2,882 56-amino acid (aa) fragments that collectively tiled across the entire CMV proteome with 28-aa overlap between adjacent fragments (Figure 2A). To generate a comprehensive list of CMV antigens for our screens, we supplemented the reference CMV proteome with open reading frames (ORFs) identified by ribosome footprinting (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012Stern-Ginossar N. Weisburd B. Michalski A. Le V.T.K. Hein M.Y. Huang S.-X. Ma M. Shen B. Qian S.-B. Hengel H. et al.Decoding human cytomegalovirus.Science. 2012; 338: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To provide a measure of reproducibility, each of the peptides was encoded by two distinct nucleic acid sequences, which act as internal duplicates. This library was cloned into a lentiviral vector and transduced into EDCs expressing HLA-A2. To generate T cells for the screen, we transduced donor CD8 T cells with a vector expressing the CMV pp65 protein-specific NLV2 TCR (Schub et al., 2009Schub A. Schuster I.G. Hammerschmidt W. Moosmann A. CMV-specific TCR-transgenic T cells for immunotherapy.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6819-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). First, we verified that these T cells activated the GzB reporter in EDCs that expressed either full-length pp65 or a 56-aa fragment of pp65 containing the NLV epitope (Figure 1D). Then, after co-culture of the T cells with the target cell library, we sorted for GzB-positive EDCs, identified the antigens that they expressed by Illumina sequencing, and compared the abundance of each antigen before and after the sort. Strikingly, the two most enriched peptides identified by the T-Scan screen were the only two antigens in the library that harbored the NLV epitope (Figure 2B). This result was reproducible across the duplicate nucleic acid encodings of each antigen and across independent replicates of the screen (Figures 2C and S2).Figure S2Reproducibility of Three Replicates in the CMV Genome-wide Screen with the NLV2 TCR, Related to Figure 2Show full captionEach dot represents one peptide, with the X and Y axes plotting the performance of the peptide in two independent sorts of the screen.

The X and Y values indicate the combined fold-change of the two barcodes for each peptide. Highlighted red peptides contain the known cognate antigen of the NLV2 TCR. We repeated the screen using a second transduced NLV-specific TCR, NLV3 (Schub et al., 2009Schub A. Schuster I.G. Hammerschmidt W. Moosmann A. CMV-specific TCR-transgenic T cells for immunotherapy.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6819-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and observed robust enrichment of the 56-mers expressing the cognate target across different effector:target ratios (Figure 2D). By performing the screen under various conditions, we found that T-Scan is robust to varying concentrations of T cells, the number of antigens expressed by each target cell (MOI), and the dilution of the cognate T cells with non-transduced T cells (Figures 2D–2F). We also demonstrated that assay performance is not affected by the presence of additional MHC alleles in the EDCs, suggesting that the assay can be used to map T cell responses on multiple alleles simultaneously (Figure S3). To verify that T-Scan is compatible with non-transduced primary cells, we generated NLV-reactive T cells by expanding CD8 T cells from an HLA-A2-positive, CMV-positive donor in the presence of the NLV peptide. We screened these cells against the CMV-wide library and confirmed that the NLV-containing antigens were again the top hits (Figures 2G and 2H). The fold-enrichment observed with the primary T cells (60- to 100-fold) was greater than that achieved with the NLV2 TCR T cells (10- to 20-fold), consistent with increased signal to noise of GzB reporter activation by these cells. Unexpectedly, two overlapping 56-mers from the IE1 gene of CMV were also reproducibly enriched by the NLV-expanded T cells. IE1 was also observed in subsequent screens with these T cells and will be further explored below. To determine whether T-Scan can be used with far larger numbers of candidate antigens, we performed a virome-wide screen (Figure 3A). We introduced a library of 93,904 56-aa fragments that collectively tiled across the entire human virome (Xu et al., 2015Xu G.J. Kula T. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Vernon S.D. Ndung’u T. Ruxrungtham K. Sanchez J. Brander C. Chung R.T. et al.Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome.Science. 2015; 348: aaa0698Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) into HLA-A2 EDCs and performed T-Scan on this antigen pool using the NLV-expanded primary T cells. In spite of the greatly increased complexity of the target library, the two most enriched peptides in the screen were, once again, the only two peptides in the library that contained the known NLV epitope (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, we also observed reproducible enrichment of the same two 56-mers from the IE1 gene of CMV that scored in the CMV-wide screen (Figures 2G and 2H). Because there was no sequence similarity between the NLV epitope and the IE1 peptide, we hypothesized that a subset of the T cells in the donor CD8 repertoire were reactive to an epitope in IE1 contained within the enriching 56mers. Analysis of the 28-aa region common to both 56-mers revealed a high-affinity HLA-A2 binding epitope using the NetMHC4.0 algorithm (Figure 3C), and we found that the NLV-expanded T cells, but not the NLV3 TCR-transduced T cells, were reactive to this peptide (Figure 3D). Moreover, tetramer staining revealed that while ∼25% of the T cells in the NLV-expanded population recognized the NLV epitope, a distinct subpopulation comprising only ∼2% of the T cells recognized the IE1 epitope (Figure 3E). Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that T-Scan can identify both known and novel targets of subclonal populations of T cells from highly complex antigen libraries and highlighted the potential of multiplexing T-Scan to discover the specificities of many T cells at once. As T cells are key mediators of pro"
https://openalex.org/W2968448735,"Introduction Approximately 14 million unintended pregnancies are recorded annually in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We sought to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancies among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods The study pooled data from current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016 from 29 countries in SSA. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors that influence unintended pregnancies in SSA. Results were presented using odds ratios (OR). Results We found overall unintended pregnancy prevalence rate of 29%, ranging from 10.8% in Nigeria to 54.5% in Namibia. As compared to women aged 15–19 years, women of all other age categories had higher odds of unintended pregnancies. Married women were 6 times more probable to report unintended pregnancy as compared to women who had never married (OR = 6.29, CI = 5.65–7.01). The phenomenon had higher odds among rural residents as compared to urban residents (OR = 1.08, CI = 1.01–1.16). Women with primary (OR = 0.74, CI = 0.69–0.80) and secondary (OR = 0.71, CI = 0.65–0.77) levels of education had less chances of unintended pregnancies, compared to those with no education. Again, women in all other wealth categories had less probability of unintended pregnancy, as compared to women with poorest wealth status. Conclusion Our study contributes substantially towards the discourse of maternal wellbeing by unveiling the prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancy across the SSA region. There is the need for SSA countries with high prevalence of unintended pregnancies to consider past and present successful interventions of other countries within the region such as health education, counselling, skills-building, comprehensive sex education and access to contraception. Much of these efforts rest with the governments of SSA countries."
https://openalex.org/W2967909152,"Delineating ecologically meaningful populations among microbes is important for identifying their roles in environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here, we introduce a metric of recent gene flow, which when applied to co-existing microbes, identifies congruent genetic and ecological units separated by strong gene flow discontinuities from their next of kin. We then develop a pipeline to identify genome regions within these units that show differential adaptation and allow mapping of populations onto environmental variables or host associations. Using this reverse ecology approach, we show that the human commensal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus breaks up into sharply delineated populations that show different associations with health and disease. Defining populations by recent gene flow in this way will facilitate the analysis of bacterial and archaeal genomes using ecological and evolutionary theory developed for plants and animals, thus allowing for testing unifying principles across all biology."

Subcellular localization analyses revealed that the MERS-CoV M protein is retained intracellularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and we identified two motifs in the distal part of the C-terminal domain as being important for this specific localization.

https://openalex.org/W2968960330,"Asymmetric division in female meiosis creates selective pressure favoring selfish centromeres that bias their transmission to the egg. This centromere drive can explain the paradoxical rapid evolution of both centromere DNA and centromere-binding proteins despite conserved centromere function. Here, we define a molecular pathway linking expanded centromeres to histone phosphorylation and recruitment of microtubule destabilizing factors, leading to detachment of selfish centromeres from spindle microtubules that would direct them to the polar body. Exploiting centromere divergence between species, we show that selfish centromeres in two hybrid mouse models use the same molecular pathway but modulate it differently to enrich destabilizing factors. Our results indicate that increasing microtubule destabilizing activity is a general strategy for drive in both models, but centromeres have evolved distinct mechanisms to increase that activity. Furthermore, we show that drive depends on slowing meiotic progression, suggesting that selfish centromeres can be suppressed by regulating meiotic timing."

Consequently, there is considerable interest in exploring the instructive potential of metabolites in the context of inter-organ signaling (de Castro Fonseca et al., 2016de Castro Fonseca M.

This communication affects both gut and testes function and is mediated by cytokine signaling and the metabolite citrate. Adult virgin flies show male-biased expression of genes with putative functions in carbohydrate transport and utilization (Figure S1A; Table S1) (Hudry et al., 2016Hudry B. Khadayate S. Miguel-Aliaga I. The sexual identity of adult intestinal stem cells controls organ size and plasticity.Nature. 2016; 530: 344-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including digestive enzymes (Figure S1B). This sexual dimorphism is predominantly confined to the midgut (Figure S1A; Table S1) (Leader et al., 2018Leader D.P. Krause S.A. Pandit A. Davies S.A. Dow J.A.T.

We validated male-biased expression for a subset of genes coding for carbohydrate handling (breakdown, transport, or utilization) proteins via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); we selected genes with midgut-specific expression so that RT-qPCR profiling could be performed on RNA from whole, adult flies (Figure S1C). To analyze this sexual dimorphism, we engineered protein reporters by tagging endogenous proteins representative of various sugar-handling processes with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (see STAR Methods), including: Phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi), Maltase-A3 (Mal-A3), and Amylase proximal (Amy-p). Immunohistochemical analyses of these protein reporters, a transcriptional reporter for Maltase-A7 (Mal-A7) (see STAR Methods) and publicly available protein reporters for other enzymes (Maltase A1 [Mal-A1], Trehalase [Treh], Hexokinase A [Hex-A] and Lactate dehydrogenase [Ldh]) confirmed the sexual dimorphism at the protein level and revealed that it was predominantly confined to the intestinal epithelium (Figure 1A–1I). The epithelial cell types contributing to this expression differed depending on whether the protein was involved in sugar breakdown, transport, or utilization, but invariably included the digestive and absorptive ECs (with one exception, Mal-A3, expressed exclusively in enteroendocrine cells) (Figure 1D).Figure 1Expression of Carbohydrate Metabolism Proteins Is Male-Biased in a Specific Portion of the Adult IntestineShow full caption(A) Expression pattern of Maltase A1 (Mal-AGFP) protein in whole midguts of adult Drosophila (DNA labeled with DAPI, blue; Mal-A1GFP, green).(B and C) Quantifications of Mal-A1GFP (B) and Amylase proximal (Amy-pGFP) (C) protein levels in R2 (left) and R4 (right) regions of adult male (M) and female (F) midguts.

See Table S4 for a list of full genotypes. See also Figure S1. We observed that sexually dimorphic expression was spatially restricted to the posterior R4 region of the adult midgut (Buchon et al., 2013Buchon N. Osman D. David F.P. Fang H.Y. Boquete J.P. Deplancke B. Lemaitre B. Morphological and molecular characterization of adult midgut compartmentalization in Drosophila.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 1725-1738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), even when the transcripts or proteins were expressed in other intestinal portions (see Figures 1A and S1D for Mal-A1, Mal-A7, and Pgi; quantification is shown in Figures 1B, 1C, and 1I for Mal-A1, Amy-p and Mal-A7, respectively). Sexual dimorphism in the R4 region was not restricted to carbohydrate metabolism genes; it also included oxidative stress response genes such as Glutathione S transferase D1 (GstD1) (Figure S1E) and genes with female-biased expression such as Yolk protein 1 (Yp1) (Figure S1F). Thus, the proteins handling sugars in the adult gut are male-biased, and this intestinal sexual dimorphism is spatially confined to the posterior R4 midgut region. To explore how male-biased intestinal sugar gene expression arises, we used RNA-seq transcriptional analysis, which revealed upregulation of sugar genes in “masculinized” female flies lacking the female sex determinant tra (Figure 2A; Table S1). We confirmed that their expression is controlled by TraF and its binding partner Transformer 2 (Tra2) (Amrein et al., 1988Amrein H. Gorman M. Nöthiger R.

We generated a tra allele (traFRT) that allows whole-body or cell-type-specific tra deletion and a traF K-IN knockin allele that constitutively feminizes males. This allele fully rescues tra-null mutant females (unlike UAS-traF), including their fertility (see STAR Methods and Figures S2A–S2D). Both genetic manipulations abrogated the sex bias in sugar gene expression; tra/tra-2 mutation did so by upregulating the expression of the sugar genes in female (masculinized) flies (Figures 2A–2C and S2I), whereas ectopic traF reduced their expression in male (feminized) flies to amounts comparable to those detected in female guts (Figure 2B).Figure S2Functional Validation of transformer (tra) Knockout, Knockin, Gain-of-Function and RNAi Lines, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Sex transformations induced by whole-body tra knockout (traKO) and whole-body traF knockin gain-of-function (traF K-IN).

https://openalex.org/W2968887911,"The NRF2 transcription factor controls a cell stress program that is implicated in cancer and there is great interest in targeting NRF2 for therapy. We show that NRF2 activity depends on Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K)-a kinase that triggers protein de-glycation. In its absence, NRF2 is extensively glycated, unstable, and defective at binding to small MAF proteins and transcriptional activation. Moreover, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma triggered by MYC and Keap1 inactivation depends on FN3K in vivo. N-acetyl cysteine treatment partially rescues the effects of FN3K loss on NRF2 driven tumor phenotypes indicating a key role for NRF2-mediated redox balance. Mass spectrometry reveals that other proteins undergo FN3K-sensitive glycation, including translation factors, heat shock proteins, and histones. How glycation affects their functions remains to be defined. In summary, our study reveals a surprising role for the glycation of cellular proteins and implicates FN3K as targetable modulator of NRF2 activity in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2968255719,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide transposon silencing in animals. The 22–30 nt piRNAs are processed in the cytoplasm from long non-coding RNAs that often lack RNA processing hallmarks of export-competent transcripts. By studying how these transcripts achieve nuclear export, we uncover an RNA export pathway specific for piRNA precursors in the Drosophila germline. This pathway requires Nxf3-Nxt1, a variant of the hetero-dimeric mRNA export receptor Nxf1-Nxt1. Nxf3 interacts with UAP56, a nuclear RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, and CG13741/Bootlegger, which recruits Nxf3-Nxt1 and UAP56 to heterochromatic piRNA source loci. Upon RNA cargo binding, Nxf3 achieves nuclear export via the exportin Crm1 and accumulates together with Bootlegger in peri-nuclear nuage, suggesting that after export, Nxf3-Bootlegger delivers precursor transcripts to the piRNA processing sites. These findings indicate that the piRNA pathway bypasses nuclear RNA surveillance systems to export unprocessed transcripts to the cytoplasm, a strategy also exploited by retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2967075857,"Imaging of rod photoreceptor outer-segment disc membranes by atomic force microscopy and cryo-electron tomography has revealed that the visual pigment rhodopsin, a prototypical class A G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), can organize as rows of dimers. GPCR dimerization and oligomerization offer possibilities for allosteric regulation of GPCR activity, but the detailed structures and mechanism remain elusive. In this investigation, we made use of the high rhodopsin density in the native disc membranes and of a bifunctional cross-linker that preserves the native rhodopsin arrangement by covalently tethering rhodopsins via Lys residue side chains. We purified cross-linked rhodopsin dimers and reconstituted them into nanodiscs for cryo-EM analysis. We present cryo-EM structures of the cross-linked rhodopsin dimer as well as a rhodopsin dimer reconstituted into nanodiscs from purified monomers. We demonstrate the presence of a preferential 2-fold symmetrical dimerization interface mediated by transmembrane helix 1 and the cytoplasmic helix 8 of rhodopsin. We confirmed this dimer interface by double electron–electron resonance measurements of spin-labeled rhodopsin. We propose that this interface and the arrangement of two protomers is a prerequisite for the formation of the observed rows of dimers. We anticipate that the approach outlined here could be extended to other GPCRs or membrane receptors to better understand specific receptor dimerization mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2967240033,"Ethanol consumption is one of the common causative agents implicated in gastric ulcer development. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the induction and development of gastric ulceration. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are key players in ethanol-induced ulcers. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear protein, mediates various inflammation functions. However, the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer is not yet elucidated. Raspberry Ketone (RK) is a natural phenolic compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, absolute ethanol (7.5 ml/kg) was used to induce gastric ulceration in rats. Raspberry Ketone (RK) (50 mg/kg) was given orally one hour before the administration of absolute ethanol. Interestingly, ethanol-induced gastric ulcer was associated with Nrf2 downregulation, which was correlated with NOX-1, 2 NOX-4, and HMGB1 upregulation, and was significantly reversed by RK pre-treatment. RK pre-treatment provided 80% gastroprotection. Gastroprotective properties of RK were mediated via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (suppression of NF-kB and tumor necrosis factor-α), and antiapoptotic activities (reduction of Bax/Bcl2 ratio). Gastroprotective properties of RK were confirmed by histopathological examination. In conclusion, this study is the first to provide evidence to the role of HMGB1 in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, and the crosstalk of Nrf2, NOXs and HMGB1. It also demonstrates that RK represents a promising gastroprotective activity comparable to omeprazole."
https://openalex.org/W2968050800,"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are key elements in the innate immune response. Formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 2 is a PRR that, in addition to proinflammatory, pathogen-derived compounds, also recognizes the anti-inflammatory endogenous ligand annexin A1 (AnxA1). Because the contribution of this signaling axis in viral infections is undefined, we investigated AnxA1-mediated FPR2 activation on influenza A virus (IAV) infection in the murine model. AnxA1-treated mice displayed significantly attenuated pathology upon a subsequent IAV infection with significantly improved survival, impaired viral replication in the respiratory tract, and less severe lung damage. The AnxA1-mediated protection against IAV infection was not caused by priming of the type I IFN response but was associated with an increase in the number of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and enhanced pulmonary expression of the AM-regulating cytokine granulocyte-M-CSF (GM-CSF). Both AnxA1-mediated increase in AM levels and GM-CSF production were abrogated when mouse (m)FPR2 signaling was antagonized but remained up-regulated in mice genetically deleted for mFPR1, an mFPR2 isoform also serving as AnxA1 receptor. Our results indicate a novel protective function of the AnxA1-FPR2 signaling axis in IAV pathology via GM-CSF-associated maintenance of AMs, expanding knowledge on the potential use of proresolving mediators in host defense against pathogens.-Schloer, S., Hübel, N., Masemann, D., Pajonczyk, D., Brunotte, L., Ehrhardt, C., Brandenburg, L.-O., Ludwig, S., Gerke, V., Rescher, U.

https://openalex.org/W2969156088,"Background The Thailand National Strategic Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) 2017–2021, endorsed by the Thai Cabinet in 2016, aims to increase public knowledge about antibiotics and AMR awareness by 20% by 2021. This study assesses the prevalence of antibiotics use, clinical indications and sources; knowledge and access to information related to antibiotics and AMR; and factors related to level of knowledge and access to information among Thai adult population. Methods An AMR module was developed and embedded into the 2017 Health and Welfare Survey; a cross-sectional, two-stage stratified sampling, nationally representative household survey carried out biannually by National Statistical Office. The survey applied a structured interview questionnaire. The survey was conducted in March 2017 where 27,762 Thai adults were interviewed of the AMR module. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results The one-month prevalence of antibiotic use was 7.9% for three common conditions; flu (27.0%), fever (19.2%) and sore throat (16.8%). The majority of antibiotics (70.3%) were provided by public or private healthcare facilities, and 26.7% by pharmacies. Thai adults have low levels of knowledge about antibiotics; only 2.6 gave correct answers to all six statements related to antibiotics, while 13.5% gave wrong answers to all six statements. A few factors associated with knowledge and having received information on antibiotics were assessed. People who have higher education levels, and belong to richer wealth quintiles, and receive antibiotics and AMR information have significantly higher levels of knowledge about antibiotics. In the last 12 months, only 17.8% of respondents had heard information about the proper use of antibiotics and AMR; mostly from doctors (36.1%), health workers (24.8%) and pharmacists (17.7%). Conclusions There is a large gap of public knowledge about the use of antibiotics. The main communication channel is through healthcare professionals, which indicates they are key persons in communicating information about the proper use of antibiotics to the public."
https://openalex.org/W2967861998,"Lassa virus (LASV) causes hemorrhagic fever and is endemic in West Africa. Protective antibody responses primarily target the LASV surface glycoprotein (GPC), and GPC-B competition group antibodies often show potent neutralizing activity in humans. However, which features confer potent and broadly neutralizing antibody responses is unclear. Here, we compared three crystal structures of LASV GPC complexed with GPC-B antibodies of varying neutralization potency. Each GPC-B antibody recognized an overlapping epitope involved in binding of two adjacent GPC monomers and preserved the prefusion trimeric conformation. Differences among GPC-antibody interactions highlighted specific residues that enhance neutralization. Using structure-guided amino acid substitutions, we increased the neutralization potency and breadth of these antibodies to include all major LASV lineages. The ability to define antibody residues that allow potent and broad neutralizing activity, together with findings from analyses of inferred germline precursors, is critical to develop potent therapeutics and for vaccine design and assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2968272386,"Background Auscultation is one of the first examinations that a patient is subjected to in a GP’s office, especially in relation to diseases of the respiratory system. However it is a highly subjective process and depends on the physician’s ability to interpret the sounds as determined by his/her psychoacoustical characteristics. Here, we present a cross-sectional assessment of the skills of physicians of different specializations and medical students in the classification of respiratory sounds in children. Methods and findings 185 participants representing different medical specializations took part in the experiment. The experiment comprised 24 respiratory system auscultation sounds. The participants were tasked with listening to, and matching the sounds with provided descriptions of specific sound classes. The results revealed difficulties in both the recognition and description of respiratory sounds. The pulmonologist group was found to perform significantly better than other groups in terms of number of correct answers. We also found that performance significantly improved when similar sound classes were grouped together into wider, more general classes. Conclusions These results confirm that ambiguous identification and interpretation of sounds in auscultation is a generic issue which should not be neglected as it can potentially lead to inaccurate diagnosis and mistreatment. Our results lend further support to the already widespread acknowledgment of the need to standardize the nomenclature of auscultation sounds (according to European Respiratory Society, International Lung Sounds Association and American Thoracic Society). In particular, our findings point towards important educational challenges in both theory (nomenclature) and practice (training)."

Olshausen B.A. Natural image statistics and neural representation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1193-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). For instance, natural scenes have strong spatial correlations that cause wide groups of cortical cells with overlapping receptive fields to participate in encoding any single individual feature present in the image. This view, which remains highly influential, has led to the idea that a major goal of sensory systems is to reduce the redundancy of neuronal responses (Attneave, 1954Attneave F.

Although the influential finding of redundant coding in sensory cortex may suggest that this coding scheme has been firmly established, several limitations of previous studies prevent this conclusion. First, previous work has relied on neuronal recordings in vitro in the retina (Doi et al., 2012Doi E. Gauthier J.L. Field G.D. Shlens J. Sher A. Greschner M. Machado T.A. Jepson L.H. Mathieson K.

However, when animals are anesthetized, neurons are highly correlated (Ecker et al., 2014Ecker A.S. Berens P. Cotton R.J. Subramaniyan M. Denfield G.H. Cadwell C.R. Smirnakis S.M. Bethge M.

Some informational aspects of visual perception.Psychol. Rev. 1954; 61: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar, Barlow, 1961Barlow H.B.

Adaptive coding of visual information in neural populations.Nature. 2008; 452: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Second, redundancy was previously observed when multiple neurons were recorded tangentially across the cortical surface and not along the cortical column (Montani et al., 2007Montani F. Kohn A.

Independent and redundant information in nearby cortical neurons.Science. 2001; 294: 2566-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Indeed, we confirmed previous findings and observed similar redundancy-dominated information encoding in tangential recordings from the superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex (Figure S1). Cortical columns have been hypothesized to be the elementary functional and computational module of the neocortex (Rakic, 1988Rakic P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar, Mountcastle, 1997Mountcastle V.B.

Although we know much about anatomy, cell types, input-output architecture, and recurrent connectivity (Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010Adesnik H. Scanziani M.

Parallel processing strategies of the primate visual system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), whether cells within a cortical column process information redundantly or synergistically is unknown. Third, the timescales used to compute redundancy in previous studies were much shorter than those normally experienced during wakefulness, such as those occurring during natural viewing when each gaze fixation lasts for hundreds of milliseconds. We re-examined the idea of redundant coding in neocortex by measuring the amount of information about visual stimuli transmitted by neurons within a microcolumn in awake monkey primary visual cortex (V1) at a timescale relevant for visual perception. We found significant synergistic interactions between nearby neurons that were clustered non-randomly across cortical layers to form synergy and redundancy hubs. Neuronal populations comprising only synergy hubs were significantly better at decoding stimulus information compared to redundancy hubs or populations comprising both synergy and redundancy hubs. These findings suggest that the generality of the redundant coding idea in sensory cortex needs to be revisited. That is, columnar neuronal populations can efficiently encode information due to synergistic inter-neuronal interactions, even when receptive fields overlap and shared noise between cells is high. Spike trains were recorded from multiple V1 neurons (Figure 1A; n = 201 single units) in two fixating monkeys using multi-contact laminar arrays advanced perpendicularly to the cortical surface. Stimuli consisted of five sine-wave gratings flashed for 300 ms and presented at equally spaced orientations within 20o of the cells’ optimal orientation. Gratings were 5° in diameter, i.e., large enough to cover the receptive fields of all the neurons recorded by the linear array (Figure 1B). Spatial frequency was chosen to maximize the number of V1 neurons that were driven in a session (average number of presentations of each stimulus per session was 84 ± 13). Because recordings were performed in a cortical column, cells had largely overlapping receptive fields and were tuned to the same stimulus orientation (Figures S2A and S2B). Representative examples of V1 responses of five single units to multiple presentations of sine wave gratings are shown in Figure 1C. From these responses, we calculated the bias-corrected amount of mutual information that spike timing and spike counts carried about stimulus orientation (STAR Methods) as a function of time, from 200 ms before stimulus onset to 1,000 ms post-stimulus onset. Because the responses of cortical neurons are noisy, it is difficult to estimate the precise time of the first spike in response to the stimulus. Therefore, for each time t, we computed the information conveyed by the preceding spike and interspike interval (Figure 1D). To compare these information values with those based on spike counts, at each instant of time t, we calculated the information conveyed by spike counts in windows of different sizes: 10; 50; 100; 200; 300; and 400 ms. Despite the great variability in the amount of information conveyed by pairs of neurons, there was a clear increase in mutual information about 40 ms after stimulus onset (Figure 1E), which is expected given the time the visually evoked neural impulses need to reach primary visual cortex. Contrary to findings in the retina (Berry et al., 1997Berry M.J. Warland D.K. Meister M. The structure and precision of retinal spike trains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5411-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, Gollisch and Meister, 2008Gollisch T. Meister M. Rapid neural coding in the retina with relative spike latencies.Science. 2008; 319: 1108-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), spike counts were more informative than spike times and spike intervals in neuronal pairs (this was also true for single neurons; Figure S2C). Hence, we focused our subsequent analysis on the 300-ms time window, as spike counts in this window were most informative and matched the duration of the flashed stimulus (Figure S2D). As expected, the peak mutual information carried by pairs of neurons represents an almost two-fold increase in information relative to that carried by single cells (Figure 1F). We further examined whether combinations of cells jointly convey less information (redundant coding), the same information (independent coding), or more information (synergistic coding) in their spike counts compared to the sum of the information conveyed independently by individual neurons. On average, the amount of information encoded jointly by a pair of cells was not significantly higher (p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum) than the sum of the information provided by the two neurons forming the pair (Figure 1F; the difference between these two quantities was labeled ΔI). Although this may suggest that pairs of neurons encode stimuli in an independent manner, when ΔI was analyzed separately for each pair (STAR Methods), we observed a significant number of pairs exhibiting synergistic (ΔI > 0; p < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; Figure 1G) and redundant interactions (ΔI < 0; p < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). However, when ΔI was averaged across all the pairs, we failed to observe either net synergy or redundancy (Figure 1G, inset). Out of 1,031 pairs, 43% were synergistic, 47% were redundant, and the remaining 10% were independent (Figure 1H). Thus, contrary to previous findings originating from tangential recordings across the cortical surface (e.g., Figure S1), cortical columns in awake macaque V1 are characterized by a large proportion of synergistic pairs. Although synergistic pairs were slightly less abundant than redundant pairs, they carried significantly more information about incoming stimuli (Figure 1I; p < 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To examine whether these results extend beyond pairwise interactions, we calculated synergy and redundancy for triplets (n = 4,034) and quadruplets (n = 12,526; Figures S3A–S3F). Indeed, approximately 40% of triplets and quadruplets were synergistic. These synergistic groups carried more stimulus information compared to their redundant counterparts, which is consistent with the results found in pairs. To quantify the relative strength of synergy and redundancy, we calculated the peak synergy and redundancy fraction (Montani et al., 2007Montani F. Kohn A. Smith M.A. Schultz S.R. The role of correlations in direction and contrast coding in the primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2338-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; STAR Methods) for the two separate groups of pairs. We found that, on average, synergistic pairs provided approximately 45% more information than the sum of the individual information values provided by the neurons forming the pair, and redundant pairs provided approximately 40% less information. The strength of synergistic and redundant interactions gradually increased as spike counts were calculated over larger windows (Figure 1J). Contrary to previous studies, these findings provide evidence for strong synergy and redundancy, and relatively little independence, within the cortical columns of V1. In principle, one might expect that nearby neurons within a column would have similar tuning curves, and hence, cells separated by smaller distances would mostly have redundant interactions. In that case, our results would simply reflect a distance-based encoding rule. However, we found no significant difference in cortical distance between the neurons forming synergistic and redundant pairs (Figure 1K; p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test). It might also be possible that small differences in tuning preference or mean firing rates between the cells in a pair could be associated with synergistic or redundant interactions. Therefore, we calculated the difference in tuning preferences and the mean firing rates but did not observe significant differences between the distributions for pairs corresponding to synergistic and redundant interactions (tuning preference: Figure S3G, Watson-Williams test; p > 0.05; firing rates: Figure S3H, one-way balanced ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons test; p > 0.05). Altogether, these results demonstrate that synergistic interactions cannot simply be explained in terms of spatial proximity, tuning differences, or firing rate differences between the cells in a pair. We further examined whether we can identify neurons preferentially engaging in synergistic or redundant interactions with the rest of the cells in a column or whether interactions are mixed (Figure 2A). That is, do some neurons have a higher probability than others to establish synergistic or redundant interactions? To examine this issue, we calculated the participation coefficient (PC) of a neuron as the fraction of interactions that were either synergistic or redundant. For example, a neuron with 7 synergistic and 3 redundant pairwise interactions would have a participation coefficient of 0.7 for synergy and 0.3 for redundancy. To assess the statistical significance of the PC values, we calculated the normalized participation coefficient (PCnorm) by randomly assigning the same number of redundant and synergistic interactions between neurons (STAR Methods). The normalized coefficient was obtained by dividing the actual PC for a neuron by the mean PC calculated from the randomized set. Neurons that had a participation coefficient >0.5 and normalized participation coefficient significantly >1 (see STAR Methods for statistical testing) were labeled as synergy or redundancy “hubs,” depending on which interaction dominated (Figure 2B). Neurons not satisfying this criterion were labeled as “non-hubs.” We found that approximately 26% of the neurons in our population were synergy hubs, whereas 37% were redundancy hubs. This demonstrates that synergistic and redundant interactions do cluster such that some neurons preferentially participate in one or the other type of interaction with their neighbors. However, there was no significant difference in mean cortical distance (Figure 2C) between the neurons forming synergy and redundancy hubs (p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). What could be the functional role of such hubs? To answer this question, we built sub-populations of neurons consisting of varying numbers of synergy and redundancy hubs (STAR Methods) and examined their impact on stimulus decoding. For instance, to construct a homogeneous sub-population consisting of 5 neurons, all five neurons were randomly sampled from the pool of either synergy or redundancy hubs in a particular session. Heterogeneous sub-populations of five neurons were constructed by selecting different numbers of synergy and redundancy hubs, e.g., 3 synergy hubs were combined with 2 redundancy hubs or 1 synergy hub was combined with 4 redundancy hubs, etc. (Figure 2D). All possible drawings of neurons from the synergy and redundancy pools were used to construct these sub-populations. We subsequently used a linear discriminant classifier to decode stimulus identity using the spike count responses of the neurons in each sub-population. We normalized decoder accuracy with respect to that of sub-populations containing only redundancy hubs for each session. There was an increase in peak decoder accuracy as the percentage of synergy hubs was increased (Figure 2E shows one example session). The lowest decoder accuracy was obtained for homogeneous populations exclusively consisting of redundancy hubs (Figure 2E). To compare across sessions, we normalized decoder accuracy for each sub-population (homogeneous or heterogeneous) by the lowest performance (hence, the normalized decoder accuracy had values >1 for different sub-populations). Across sessions (Figures S3I–S3K), there was a clear increase in mean normalized decoder accuracy with the increase in the number of synergy hubs in the populations (Figure 2F; n = 11 sessions; p < 0.001; one-way balanced ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons test). Normalized decoder accuracy was not significantly greater than 1 (p > 0.05; t test) for sub-populations where less than half of neurons were synergy hubs. There was a 20% increase in decoder accuracy between sub-populations with only synergy compared to only redundancy hubs. Altogether, these results indicate that there is a specialized subgroup of neurons encoding more stimulus information, and these cells tend to form hubs of synergistic interactions. Next, we examined the nature of the interactions between synergy and redundancy hubs (Figure 3A). Specifically, are synergy-synergy hub interactions predominantly synergistic or redundant? Across sessions (STAR Methods), we found that the probability that synergy hubs interact synergistically with each other is 75% ± 5%, and the probability that redundancy hubs interact synergistically is only 26% ± 6% (Figure 3B). However, one might expect that, by chance, a synergy hub would interact primarily through synergistic interactions with other synergy hubs. Therefore, the probability of a synergistic interaction between two synergy hubs would be high, and the same could be expected for redundancy hubs. To control for this possibility, we calculated the probability of different types of hub-hub interactions by shuffling the interaction labels across the population of pairs while holding the total number of synergistic or redundant interactions for each neuron the same as in the actual data. From these “randomized” networks, we calculated a distribution of interaction percentages for each type of hub-hub interaction, and if the actual interaction percentage was greater than the mean of this distribution (p < 0.05; right-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test), that session was included for analysis (STAR Methods). Across sessions, the probabilities of 2nd-order interaction between hubs were statistically different from 50% (p < 0.001; two-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test). However, interactions between synergy and redundancy hubs are equally likely to be synergistic or redundant (not significantly different from 50%; two-tailed Wilcoxon sign rank test; p > 0.05). This analysis reveals a higher degree of organization of hub networks whereby synergistic-synergistic and redundancy-redundancy interactions are more prevalent between hubs than mixed interactions. We further examined whether synergistic or redundant interactions are confined to a specific cortical layer or they are spread out across the entire cortical column. We thus performed current source density (CSD) analysis (Hansen and Dragoi, 2011Hansen B.J. Dragoi V. Adaptation-induced synchronization in laminar cortical circuits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 10720-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Hansen et al., 2012Hansen B.J. Chelaru M.I. Dragoi V.

We calculated the degree of synergy and redundancy for cell pairs within (intra) and between layers (inter). In both cases, averaging the ΔI values for all the pairs within a group yielded a mean that was not significantly different from zero (p > 0.05; t test) to indicate independent encoding of information (Figure 4B, inset). However, when pairs were analyzed separately within each group, we mostly found synergistic (ΔI > 0; p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank test) and redundant (ΔI < 0; p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank test) rather than independent interactions (Figures 4C and 4D) across the layers of V1. Peak values of synergy and redundancy (Figures 4C and 4D, insets) were not significantly different across inter- or intra-layer pairs (p > 0.05; one-way balanced ANOVA). The presence of synergy and redundancy in inter-layer pairs suggests that these interactions are not confined locally within layers but extend across layers for distances up to hundreds of microns.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is likely to be of value in understanding a large proportion of ET with Mendelian and complex disease inheritance patterns. In ET families with Mendelian inheritance patterns, WGS may lead to gene identification where WES analysis failed to identify the causative single nucleotide variant (SNV) or indel due to incomplete coverage of the entire coding region of the genome, in addition to accurate detection of larger structural variants (SVs) and copy number variants (CNVs). Alternatively, in ET families with complex disease inheritance patterns with gene x gene and gene x environment interactions enrichment of functional rare coding and non-coding variants may explain the heritability of ET. We performed WGS in eight ET families (n = 40 individuals) enrolled in the Family Study of Essential Tremor. The analysis included filtering WGS data based on allele frequency in population databases, rare SNV and indel classification and association testing using the Mixed-Model Kernel Based Adaptive Cluster (MM-KBAC) test. A separate analysis of rare SV and CNVs segregating within ET families was also performed. Prioritization of candidate genes identified within families was performed using phenolyzer. WGS analysis identified candidate genes for ET in 5/8 (62.5%) of the families analyzed. WES analysis in a subset of these families in our previously published study failed to identify candidate genes. In one family, we identified a deleterious and damaging variant (c.1367G>A, p.(Arg456Gln)) in the candidate gene, CACNA1G, which encodes the pore forming subunit of T-type Ca(2+) channels, CaV3.1, and is expressed in various motor pathways and has been previously implicated in neuronal autorhythmicity and ET. Other candidate genes identified include SLIT3 which encodes an axon guidance molecule and in three families, phenolyzer prioritized genes that are associated with hereditary neuropathies (family A, KARS, family B, KIF5A and family F, NTRK1). Functional studies of CACNA1G and SLIT3 suggest a role for these genes in ET disease pathogenesis."

We describe a novel function of SAT1 as a gene-specific transcriptional regulator through local polyamine acetylation. SAT1 expression is elevated in aggressive brain tumors and promotes resistance to radiotherapy. Expression profiling in glioma cells identified SAT1 target genes that distinguish high- and low-grade tumors, in support of the prognostic utility of SAT1 expression. We further discovered mechanisms of SAT1-driven tumor aggressiveness through promotion of expression of both DNA damage response pathways as well as cell cycle regulatory genes. Mechanistically, SAT1 associates specifically with the promoter of the MELK gene, which functionally controls other SAT1 targets, and leads biologically to maintenance of neurosphere stemness in conjunction with FOXM1 and EZH2. CRISPR knockin mutants demonstrate the essentiality of the polyamine acetyltransferase activity of SAT1 for its function as a transcriptional regulator. Together, the data demonstrate that gene-specific polyamine removal is a major transcriptional regulatory mechanism active in high-grade gliomas that drives poor outcomes."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed the course of HIV/AIDs by enabling patients to live longer, raising concern of the co- existence of HIV with other chronic illnesses, notably non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are on the rise in developing countries and evidence shows higher occurrence among people living with HIV (PLHIV). In Uganda, the burden of NCDs among PLHIV remains largely unquantified.


Objective 
To determine the prevalence of hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, asthma, cardiomyopathy and multi-morbidity among HIV positive patients, receiving Anti-Retroviral Therapy at Joint Clinical Research Centre, Lubowa, Uganda.


Methods 
This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 387 systematically sampled patients, receiving ART at the Joint Clinical Research Centre, Lubowa, between March and April 2017. The study used data extracted from routine care patient files to identify individuals with non-communicable diseases. Prevalence of the NCDs was estimated and reported with 95% confidence intervals. Prevalence was also reported at various levels of socio- demographic, behavioural and clinical factors.


Results 
The overall prevalence of having at least one NCD was 20.7% (95% CI: 16.7–24.5). The prevalence of hypertension was 12.4% (95% CI: 9.1–15.7), osteoporosis 6.5% (95% CI: 4.0–8.9), diabetes mellitus 4.7% (95% CI: 2.6–6.8), renal impairment 1.6% (95% CI: 0.3–2.8), asthma 1.6% (95% CI: 0.3–2.8), and cardiomyopathy 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2–2.4). Prevalence of multi-morbidity was 4.7% (95% CI: 2.6–6.8). Prevalence was significantly higher among older participants, widowed participants and individuals with an opportunistic infection.


Conclusion 
Non-communicable diseases are common among people living with HIV. There is need to encourage early diagnosis and treatment of non-communicable diseases in PLHIV in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W2968525284,"The main objective of this work was to investigate whether mitochondrial fusion occurs in the skeletal muscle of well-trained athletes in response to high-intensity exercise. Well-trained swimmers (n = 9) performed a duration-matched sprint interval training (SIT) and high-intensity high-volume training (HIHVT) session on separate days. Muscle samples from triceps brachii were taken before, immediately after, and 3 h after the training sessions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was applied to assess mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, expression of genes coding for regulators of mitochondrial fusion and fission were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR. In addition, mitofusin (MFN)2 and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) were quantified by Western blot analysis. TEM analyses showed that mitochondrial morphology remained altered for 3 h after HIHVT, whereas SIT-induced changes were only evident immediately after exercise. Only SIT increased MFN1 and MFN2 mRNA expression, whereas SIT and HIHVT both increased MFN2 protein content 3 h after exercise. Notably, only HIHVT increased OPA1 protein content. Mitochondrial morphologic changes that suggest fusion occurs in well-adapted athletes during exercise. However, HIHVT appears as a more robust inducer of mitochondrial fusion events than SIT. Indeed, SIT induces a rapid and transient change in mitochondrial morphology.-Huertas, J. R., Ruiz-Ojeda, F. J., Plaza-Díaz, J., Nordsborg, N. B., Martín-Albo, J., Rueda-Robles, A., Casuso, R. A.

https://openalex.org/W2967411105,"Invasive spread of glioblastoma (GBM) is linked to changes in chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan (CSPG)-associated sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that are selectively up-regulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We hypothesized that inhibiting CS-GAG signaling in the TME would stem GBM invasion. Rat F98 GBM cells demonstrated enhanced preferential cell invasion into oversulfated 3-dimensional composite of CS-A and CS-E [4- and 4,6-sulfated CS-GAG (COMP)] matrices compared with monosulfated (4-sulfated) and unsulfated hyaluronic acid matrices in microfluidics-based choice assays, which is likely influenced by differential GAG receptor binding specificities. Both F98 and human patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) demonstrated a high degree of colocalization of the GSC marker CD133 and CSPGs. The small molecule sulfated GAG antagonist bis-2-methyl-4-amino-quinolyl-6-carbamide (surfen) reduced invasion and focal adhesions in F98 cells encapsulated in COMP matrices and blocked CD133 and antichondroitin sulfate antibody (CS-56) detection of respective antigens in F98 cells and human GSCs. Surfen-treated F98 cells down-regulated CSPG-binding receptor transcripts and protein, as well as total and activated ERK and protein kinase B. Lastly, rats induced with frontal lobe tumors and treated with a single intratumoral dose of surfen demonstrated reduced tumor burden and spread compared with untreated controls. These results present a first demonstration of surfen as an inhibitor of sulfated GAG signaling to stem GBM invasion.-Logun, M. T., Wynens, K.

https://openalex.org/W2967745862,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein ribonucleic enzyme that is essential for cellular immortalization via elongation of telomere repeat sequences at the end of chromosomes. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase holoenzyme, is a key regulator of telomerase activity. Telomerase activity, which has been detected in the majority of cancer cells, is accompanied by hTERT expression, suggesting that this enzyme activity contributes to an unlimited replication potential of cancer cells via regulation of telomere length. Thus, hTERT is an attractive target for cancer-specific treatments. We previously reported that pared-like homeodomain 1 (PITX1) is a negative regulator of hTERT through direct binding to the hTERT promoter. However, the mechanism by which the function of PITX1 contributes to transcriptional silencing of the hTERT gene remains to be clarified. Here, we show that PITX1 and zinc finger CCHC-type containing 10 (ZCCHC10) proteins cooperate to facilitate the transcriptional regulation of the hTERT gene by functional studies via FLAG pull-down assay. Co-expression of PITX1 and ZCCHC10 resulted in inhibition of hTERT transcription, in melanoma cell lines, whereas mutate-deletion of homeodomain in PITX1 that interact with ZCCHC10 did not induce similar phenotypes. In addition, ZCCHC10 expression levels showed marked decrease in the majority of melanoma cell lines and tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that ZCCHC10-PITX1 complex is the functional unit that suppresses hTERT transcription, and may play a crucial role as a novel tumor suppressor complex."

https://openalex.org/W2967902351,"Recently, there has been a rapid increase in studies on the relationship between brain diseases and gut microbiota, and clinical evidence on gut microbial changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) has accumulated. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a widely used neurotoxin that leads to PD pathogenesis, but whether 6-OHDA affects gut microbial environment has not been investigated. Here we performed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbial community of mice. We found that there were no significant changes in species richness and its diversity in the 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus gasseri and L. reuteri probiotic species in feces of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice was significantly decreased compared with those of sham-operated mice, while the commensal bacterium Bacteroides acidifaciens in 6-OHDA-treated mice was remarkably higher than sham-operated mice. These results provide a baseline for understanding the microbial communities of 6-OHDA-induced PD model to investigate the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2967931752,"To propose a consensus for prevention of vaginal stenosis in patients submitted to pelvic radiotherapy.In this methodological study, Delphi technique was applied for content validation on vaginal stenosis prevention. Data regarding content validation were collected from 32 specialists practicing in the oncology profession. The content validity index of items in the consensus was calculated based on the evaluations by the specialists.In the first round, of the 38 items evaluated, 29 items reached a Content Validity Index (CVI-I) greater than 80%, and 9 items had a CVI lower than 80%. Of the items that did not obtain agreement, 2 items were excluded, and 7 were reformulated and included in the second round. In the second round, all 7 items obtained a CVI-I greater than 80%. The final instrument consisted of 29 items validated in the first round, plus 7 items reformulated and consolidated in the second round. The judges agreed that it is the responsibility of the health professionals to consult the patients undergoing radiation therapy in the area of sexuality to patients. The radiation oncologist should be the first professional to address this issue and the nurse oncologist in the follow-up consultation should pass the guidelines to the patients as comprehensively as possible. Patients should be informed about vaginal dilation, regardless of whether they are sexually active or have a partner. They should also be informed of when they can resume sexual activity. The procedure of vaginal dilation should be individualized. The prescribed vaginal dilators should be used with a lubricant for a duration of at least 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times a week, as per the need of each patient (sexual activity and/or clinical follow-up) for an indefinite time. Patients should seek medical help in case they experience pain, discomfort, or bleeding during dilation.The Brazilian version of the consensus for vaginal stenosis prevention in patients submitted to pelvic radiotherapy was validated with 36 items in 7 categories related to Responsibility; Target population; Rationale; Vaginal dilator; Content instructions; Information provision; and Patient support. In Brazil, the educational practices on vaginal dilation for patients submitted to radiotherapy partly revealed similar difficulties as identified in other studies as well as countries with reference to specific guidelines for the start and duration of vaginal dilation. The final consensus developed in this study could strengthen the guidelines for education of patients in Brazil and provide a future scope to establish a single and safe guideline."
https://openalex.org/W2967117407,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing globally, and renal transplantation (RT) is the preferred renal replacement therapy to treat ESRD. Internationally, there are only a few countries with RT rates above 50 per million population (pmp), while most of the countries have RT rates between 30-40 pmp. The low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) makes up the majority for the RT rates below 20 pmp in which Malaysia belongs to despite its increasing ESRD rates. There is a need to explore the barriers to access RT with targeted solutions to improve the RT rates and service in LMIC. Thus, a qualitative study was undertaken in Malaysia to address this issue.A qualitative methodological approach was performed between March-May 2018. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore current RT policy and service availability. Key-informants were identified from a detailed stakeholder analysis of RT system in Malaysia. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded with ATLAS.ti software and underwent thematic analysis thoroughly.Eight key-informants participated in the study. Barriers and related solutions were classified using the socio-ecological model (SEM). As reported, the barriers and solutions of RT in Malaysia are the results of a complex interplay of personal, cultural, and environmental factors. Key barriers are linked to public's attitude and perception towards RT and the unaccommodating practices in the healthcare fraternity for RT. Key-informants provided a systematic solution that shed light on how RT could be improved at each SEM level via effective communication, education and inter-agency collaboration.The SEM provided a framework to foster a better understanding of current practice, barriers, and solutions to RT in Malaysia. This study is the first to explore the barriers and related solutions to RT comprehensively as a whole. Implications of these findings could prompt a policy change for a better RT service delivery model not just for Malaysia but also for other LMIC. Further stakeholder engagement and evaluation of the systems are required to provide insight into best practices that will help to improve the RT rates and service in Malaysia."

We have traced all the patents arising from government funding since the year 2000. About 1.5 percent of all R&D procurement contracts have led to at least one patent for a total of about 13,000 patents. However, contracts connected to patents account for 36 per cent of overall contract value. The gestation lag from the signing date of the contract to the patent filing is on average 33 months and does not depend on the type of R&D performed. Patents that are produced faster also seem to be more valuable. We find strong decreasing returns to contract size. Conditional on generating at least one patent, a 1-percent increase in the size of an R&D contract is associated with 0.12 percent more patents."
https://openalex.org/W2969107363,"A multi-trait selective breeding program of Macrobrachium rosenbergii was initiated in China in 2015. In this program, the M. rosenbergii resources were widely collected from four countries, the origin of the founders was verified with 16 microsatellites and the pedigree was reconstructed, and the optimum contribution selection was used to make the mating design. In this study, we evaluated the genetic parameters and selection response for the harvest body weight (HBW) of M. rosenbergii after being communally reared for 95-109 days. The data were collected from two generations that comprised 25,212 progenies from 150 sires and 198 dams. The residual maximum-likelihood methodology was employed to evaluate the variance components, by fitting an animal model. The accuracy of estimated breeding values increased by 0.38% after pedigree reconstruction using microsatellite markers. The estimated heritability (h2) for HBW was moderate (0.212 ± 0.049) and the common environmental coefficient (c2) was low (0.063 ± 0.017) when all the data were used for the analysis. Within generations, h2 was moderate to high (0.198 ± 0.080 to 0.338 ± 0.049). c2 could only be estimated in G1, which was 0.055 ± 0.030. The average HBW of males was significantly larger than that of females (P < 0.01). h2 estimated for female HBWs were higher than that for males within generations, while h2 estimated for female HBWs were lower than that for males across generations. But they were not significantly different (P > 0.05). The genetic correlations between sexes were moderate to high within each generation (0.529 to 0.763). Two methods were used to estimate the realized response. One method was calculated from the differences between the least squares means of the selected population HBW and that of control population HBW, which was 14.01%. The other method was calculated from the differences between the EBVs of the selected population HBW and that of control population HBW, which was 11.52%. The predicted responses derived from two sets of genetic parameters acquired from within- and across- generation datasets were 11.68% and 10.67%, respectively. The present study provides valuable information for breeding programs of M. rosenbergii."

In that context, phenomena driven by Turing instabilities are particularly relevant to describe patterning in a number of biological processes. While the conditions that determine the appearance of Turing patterns and their wavelength can be easily obtained by a linear stability analysis, the estimation of pattern amplitudes requires cumbersome calculations due to non-linear terms. Here we introduce an expansion method that makes possible to obtain analytical, approximated, solutions of the pattern amplitudes. We check and illustrate the reliability of this methodology with results obtained from numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2967850494,"The mating pathway in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been used to reveal new mechanisms of signal transduction. The pathway comprises a pheromone receptor, a heterotrimeric G protein, and intracellular effectors of morphogenesis and transcription. Polarized cell growth, in the direction of a potential mating partner, is accomplished by the G-protein βγ subunits and the small G-protein Cdc42. Transcription induction, needed for cell-cell fusion, is mediated by Gβγ and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold protein Ste5. A potential third pathway is initiated by the G-protein α subunit Gpa1. Gpa1 signaling was shown previously to involve the F-box adaptor protein Dia2 and an endosomal effector protein, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34. Vps34 is also required for proper vacuolar sorting and autophagy. Here, using a panel of reporter assays, we demonstrate that mating pheromone stimulates vacuolar targeting of a cytoplasmic reporter protein and that this process depends on Vps34. Through a systematic analysis of F-box deletion mutants, we show that Dia2 is required to sustain pheromone-induced vacuolar targeting. We also found that other F-box proteins selectively regulate morphogenesis (Ydr306, renamed Pfu1) and transcription (Ucc1). These findings point to the existence of a new and distinct branch of the pheromone-signaling pathway, one that likely leads to vacuolar engulfment of cytoplasmic proteins and recycling of cellular contents in preparation for mating."
https://openalex.org/W2969056266,"To study the strengthening mechanism and effect underlying the reinforcement of a fractured rock mass with grouting, compressive shear tests were conducted with an RMT-150B rock mechanics test system. Prefabricated structural surfaces were strengthened with a new inorganic dual-liquid grouting material at five water-cement ratios (0.6-1.5). The effects of these water-cement ratios of the grouting on the deformation, strength, and failure characteristics of the prefabricated structural surface were analyzed. The results show that reinforcement with grouting significantly influenced the bearing capacity of the structural surface. The shear strength of the structure was significantly improved and the deformation resistance of the structural surface was enhanced. The shear stress-displacement curves, generated in compressive shear tests of the grouting-reinforced structures, were all nonlinear. The shearing process comprised three stages: elasticity, yield, and failure. Decreasing the water-cement ratio of the grouting material weakened the plasticity of the grouted structural surface and enhanced its brittleness. The deformation type changed from plastic slip to brittle shear. The shear strength, cohesion, and angle of internal friction of the grouting-reinforced structural surface increased with decreasing water-cement ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2967030209,"Cryptococcus gattii is a capsular fungal pathogen, which causes life-threatening cryptococcosis in immunocompetent individuals. This emerging pathogen is less likely to be recognized by innate immunity compared to traditional Cryptococcus neoformans strains. Previous studies indicate that C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), including dectin-1 and dectin-2, play a role in recognizing cryptococcal cells; however, it remains to be elucidated whether the receptors physically associate with C. gattii yeast cell surfaces. Based on the previous findings, we hypothesized that culture conditions influence the expression or exposure of CLR ligands on C. gattii. Therefore, in the present study, we first investigated the culture conditions that induce exposure of CLR ligands on C. gattii yeast cells via the binding assay using recombinant fusion proteins of mouse CLR and IgG Fc, Fc dectin-1 and Fc dectin-2. Common fungal culture media, such as yeast extract–peptone–dextrose (YPD) broth, Sabouraud broth, and potato dextrose agar, did not induce the exposure of dectin-1 ligands, including β-1,3-glucan, on both capsular and acapsular C. gattii strains, in contrast to Fc dectin-1 and Fc dectin-2 bound to C. gattii cells growing in the conventional synthetic dextrose (SD) medium [may also be referred to as a yeast nitrogen base with glucose medium]. The medium also induced the exposure of dectin-1 ligands on C. neoformans, whereas all tested media induced dectin-1 and dectin-2 ligands in a control fungus Candida albicans. Notably, C. gattii did not expose dectin-1 ligands in SD medium supplemented with yeast extract or neutral buffer. In addition, compared to YPD medium-induced C. gattii, SD medium-induced C. gattii more efficiently induced the phosphorylation of Syk, Akt, and Erk1/2 in murine dendritic cells (DCs). Afterwards, the cells were considerably engulfed by DCs and remarkably induced DCs to secrete the inflammatory cytokines. Overall, the findings suggest that C. gattii alters its immunostimulatory potential in response to the environment."

In the present study, we isolated 12 strains resistant to Magnaporthe oryzae from western Sichuan subalpine soil. Among them, CQ07 exhibited remarkable activity against M. oryzae. The result of 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that CQ07 is approximately 99% similar to Bacillus australimaris. The sterilized culture filtrate of CQ07 inhibited the growth of M. oryzae, which motivated us to deduce the influence of CQ07 on the pathogenicity of M. oryzae. As shown by experimentation, sterilized culture filtrate (10 μl/ml) of CQ07 can delay and even suppress the germination of conidia and prevent the formation of appressorium in vitro and in vivo. In addition, by simulative field tests, the spraying of conidia suspension diluted with sterilized culture filtrate of CQ07 reduced infection of rice blast. To better control rice blasts, understanding the infection mechanism of M. oryzae and inhibiting the mechanism of the antagonistic strain is of great importance."
https://openalex.org/W2968767790,"Subacute and chronic infections with the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are associated with an increased risk of psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in T. gondii-induced neuronal disorders. Recently, we reported that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was required to initiate the innate immune response in cultured mouse brain cells. However, how TLR2 contributes to latent infection with T. gondii remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the role of TLR2 in brain pathology and behavior using wild-type (TLR2+/+) and TLR2-deficient (TLR2-/-) mice. The behavioral analyses showed that TLR2 deficiency increased the anxiety state of the uninfected and infected animals alike, and TLR2 deficiency showed no relationship with the infection. In the contextual and cued fear-conditioning tests, T. gondii infection decreased the mouse freezing reaction while TLR2 deficiency increased it, but there was no interaction between the two factors. Our histopathological analysis showed that the TLR2+/+ and TLR2-/- mice had similar brain lesions at 30 days post infection (dpi) with T. gondii. Higher numbers of parasites were detected in the brains of the TLR2-/- mice than in those from the TLR2+/+ mice at 30 dpi, but not at 7 and 14 dpi. No significant differences were observed in the proinflammatory gene expression levels in the TLR2+/+ and TLR2-/- mice. Therefore, it appears that TLR2 signaling in the brain might contribute to the control of parasite growth, but not to brain pathology or the impaired fear memory response induced by infection with T. gondii."
https://openalex.org/W2967002357,"The development of inhibitors of islet amyloid formation is important as pancreatic amyloid deposition contributes to type-2 diabetes and islet transplant failure. The Alzheimer's Aβ peptide and human amylin (h-amylin), the polypeptide responsible for amyloid formation in type-2 diabetes, share common physio-chemical features and some inhibitors of Aβ also inhibit amyloid formation by h-amylin and vice versa. Thus, a popular and potentially useful strategy to find lead compounds for anti-amylin amyloid agents is to examine compounds that have effects on Aβ amyloid formation. The triphenylmethane dye, brilliant blue G (BBG, Sodium;3-[[4-[(E)-[4-(4-ethoxyanilino)phenyl]-[4-[ethyl-[(3-sulfonatophenyl)methyl]azaniumylidene]-2-methylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]methyl]-N-ethyl-3-methylanilino]methyl]benzenesulfonate) has been shown to modulate Aβ amyloid formation and inhibit Aβ induced toxicity. However, the effects of BBG on h-amylin have not been examined, although other triphenylmethane derivatives inhibit h-amylin amyloid formation. The compound has only a modest impact on h-amylin amyloid formation unless it is added in significant excess. BBG also remodels preformed h-amylin amyloid fibrils if added in excess, however BBG has no significant effect on h-amylin induced toxicity towards cultured β-cells or cultured CHO-T cells except at high concentrations. BBG is shown to interfere with standard thioflavin-T assays of h-amylin amyloid formation and disaggregation, highlighting the difficulty of interpreting such experiments in the absence of other measurements. BBG also interferes with ANS based assays of h-amylin amyloid formation. The work highlights the differences between inhibition of Aβ and h-amylin amyloid formation, illustrates the limitation of using Aβ inhibitors as leads for h-amylin amyloid inhibitors, and reinforces the difficulties in interpreting dye binding assays of amyloid formation."
https://openalex.org/W2968759777,"Although ascites is a distressing complication observed commonly in the course of advanced cancer, there is no effective treatment established for malignancy-related ascites. We conducted a nationwide survey of cancer physicians in Japan who treat malignancy-related ascites in order to determine what kind of therapeutic approach is thought to be significant and what kind of diuretic prescriptions are thought to be standard for malignancy-related ascites. From 2017 to 2018, we sent a one-page memo to oncologists in Japan asking them to participate in a questionnaire-style survey that they could complete online. The significance of each of the nine representative interventions was measured on a 5-stage Likert scale. At the same time, participants were asked about what type and dosage of diuretics they thought to be standard as a treatment for malignancy-related ascites. Ultimately, 187 oncologists responded to our invitation. The interventions that were particularly significant were reducing hydration volume, paracentesis, and symptom management with analgesics. The respondents indicated that the importance of diuretics was significantly lower than that of these three interventions. Furthermore, 86.2% of the respondents in Japan regarded the use of loop diuretics ± aldosterone antagonists as the standard of diuretic therapy for malignancy-related ascites, and the most common regimen was 20 mg of oral furosemide ± 25 mg of spironolactone daily at the start, and 30–40 mg ± 50 mg daily at the time of initial escalation. Although our study revealed that the attitude of oncologists in Japan toward therapeutic options for malignancy-related ascites was nearly consistent with that of previous reports from other countries, it was newly found that they seemed to commonly be concerned with preventing overhydration of terminally ill cancer patients and that analgesics were also thought to be a significant form of intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2968379674,"Background Although kidney transplant improves reproductive function in women with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), pregnancy in kidney transplant recipients’ remains challenging due to the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 7,966 women who were aged 15–45 years and received a kidney transplant between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011 from the United States Renal Data System with Medicare as the primary payer for the entire three years after the date of transplantation. Unadjusted and adjusted rates of pregnancy in the first three post-transplant years were calculated, using Poisson regression for the adjustment. Factors associated with pregnancy, including race, were examined using logistic regression. Results Overall, 293 pregnancies were identified in 7966 women. The unadjusted pregnancy rate was 13.8 per thousand person-years (PTPY) (95% confidence interval (CI), 12.3–15.5). Pregnancy rates were roughly constant in the years 2005–2011 except in 2005 and 2010. The rate of pregnancy was highest in Hispanic women (21.4 PTPY; 95% CI, 17.2–26.4) and Hispanic women had a higher likelihood of pregnancy as compared to white women (OR, 1.56; CI, 1.12–2.16). Pregnancy rates were lowest in women aged 30–34 years and 35–45 years at transplant, and women aged 30–34 years and 35–45 years at transplant were less likely to ever become pregnant during the follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 0.69; CI, 0.49–0.98 and OR, 0.14; CI 0.09–0.21 respectively) as compared to women aged 25–29 years at time of transplant. Women had higher rates of pregnancy in the second and third-year post-transplant (16.0 PTPY, CI 13.2–19.2 and 16.9 PTPY, CI 14.0–20.4) than in the first-year post-transplant (9.0 PTPY, CI 7.0–11.4). In transplant recipients, pregnancy was more likely in women with ESKD due to cystic disease (OR, 2.42; CI, 1.02–5.74) or glomerulonephritis (OR, 2.14; CI, 1.07–4.31) as compared to women with ESKD due to diabetes. Conclusion Hispanic race, younger age, and ESKD cause due to cystic disease or glomerulonephritis are significant factors associated with a higher likelihood of pregnancy. Pregnancy rates have been fairly constant over the last decade. This study improves our understanding of factors associated with pregnancy in kidney transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2968258850,"Recent innovations in e-commerce have led to the emergence of online retailing platforms, where millions of products are sold. Most of these products are sold by third-party sellers who pay a fee for the e-retailer (called the platform owner). We investigate how the e-retailer manages the various products in the presence of consumer heterogeneity and diseconomies of scope. Our analytical results indicate that the e-retailer prefers the platform-selling mode when consumers have stronger heterogeneity or when the value of a product is high; moreover, the consumer heterogeneity benefits the e-retailer and hurts the supplier. We also analyze the effect of the relationship of among categories on the e-retailer’s choice. We show that the relationship among categories can invert the existing format. In addition, we find that the e-retailer may be better off and raise the number of products under strong diseconomies of scope when the categories are complements, and the opposite is true when the categories are substitutable."
https://openalex.org/W2967304302,"Since 2013, epidemics caused by novel H7N9 avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) have become a considerable public health issue. This study investigated the evolution of these viruses at the population level. Compared to H7 and N9 before 2013, there were 18 and 24 substitutions in the majority of novel H7N9 AIVs, respectively. Nine of these in HA and six in NA were rare before 2013, and four of these in HA and two in NA displayed host tropism. S136(128)N and A143(135)V are located on the receptor binding sites of the HA1 subunit and might be important factors in determining the host species of novel H7N9 AIV. On an overall scale, the evolution of H7 and N9, both in terms of time distribution and host species, is under negative selection. However, both in HA and NA, several sites were under positive selection. In both the overall epidemics and the human-derived H7N9 AIVs, eight positive selection sites were identified in HA1, with some located within the known antigen epitopes or the receptor binding site(RBS) domain. This may induce variations in H7N9 AIV with positive selection. It is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of novel H7N9 AIVs, both in human and bird population to determine whether a new virus has emerged through selection pressure and to prevent future epidemics from occurring."

Moreover, within nucleoli, there are functionally specialized regions that do not mix with one another as the organelle supports ribosome biogenesis. However, the amorphous yet structurally distinct outer regions of the nucleoli serve an additional function. The outermost layer, the granular component (GC), aids in stress responses by serving as a storage reservoir for unfolded proteins (Frottin et al., 2019Frottin F. Schueder F. Tiwary S. Gupta R. Körner R. Schlichthaerle T. Cox J. Jungmann R. Hartl F.U. Hipp M.S. The nucleolus functions as a phase-separated protein quality control compartment.Science. 2019; : eaaw9157Google Scholar). Upon heat shock of cells in culture, a subset of nucleoplasmic proteins unfold or misfold and move into the GC. When the stress abates, GC-localized Hsp70 aids in refolding and the proteins return to duty throughout the cell. What’s fascinating is that the properties of the GC change as it accommodates the unfolded proteins, shifting from a liquid to a state with reduced fluidity and then returning to normal after the stress passes. The implication is that as individual cells experience different environments, their nucleoli could adopt different physical states and function differently as a consequence. In the most extreme case, prolonged heat shock causes nucleoli to swell and effectively harden, abolishing the recovery response (Frottin et al., 2019Frottin F. Schueder F. Tiwary S. Gupta R. Körner R. Schlichthaerle T. Cox J. Jungmann R. Hartl F.U. Hipp M.S. The nucleolus functions as a phase-separated protein quality control compartment.Science. 2019; : eaaw9157Google Scholar). There is thus a finite capacity for the GC in this proteostatic role, which has implications for disease. While it may not always be the case that a more solid-like state creates a detrimental physiological context, there are examples where a shift from a soluble form of a protein to a highly ordered solid has clear pathological associations. It has been known since the late 1800s that individuals with asthma produce secretions in their airways that harbor crystals, which became widely known as Charcot-Leyden crystals in the medical field. Such crystals have been attributed to the protein Galectin-10 (Gal10), a product of eosinophils. However, it’s not been possible to distinguish whether Gal10 crystals were a cause or consequence of an activated immune response. That has changed with work characterizing both natively isolated and in vitro-generated crystals (Persson et al., 2019Persson E.K. Verstraete K. Heyndrickx I. Gevaert E. Aegerter H. Percier J.M. Deswarte K. Verschueren K.H.G. Dansercoer A. Gras D. et al.Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment.Science. 2019; 364: eaaw4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Administration of Gal10 crystals in the mouse lung promotes innate and adaptive immunity and leads to hallmark inflammatory features of asthma, while a Gal10 mutant that cannot form crystals does not. The question is then whether disrupting established crystals can reverse the pro-inflammatory pathology. Lambrecht, Savvides, and co-workers find that monoclonal antibodies capable of dissolving Gal10 crystals in vitro resolve crystals isolated from patient samples and ameliorate symptoms arising following crystal administration in a humanized murine model of airway inflammation. While it’s not clear that every solid or solid-like assembly (such as the “oversaturated” nucleolus) will contribute to or be reflective of disease, this success with an antibody approach undoubtedly presages efforts to perturb the physical state of other condensates or protein deposits as a therapeutic modality. The soluble-to-solid transition of Gal10 provides an example of a phase transition with a pathological consequence. This shift from soluble to solid can also be preventative. In the case of iron homeostasis, cells have developed mechanisms to tightly control free iron availability that, in some cases, rely on packing high concentrations of iron into dense structures. Ferritin is one of the most familiar, but there are bacteria that lack ferritin and ferritin-related proteins. For a group of Firmicutes in this category, the answer to high-density iron storage appears to be giant protein shells, even larger than ferritin complexes. These particles are a variation of encapsulins that have been previously associated with stress responses (Giessen, 2016Giessen T.W. Encapsulins: microbial nanocompartments with applications in biomedicine, nanobiotechnology and materials science.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2016; 34: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The iron-mineralizing encapsulin-associated Firmicute system (IMEF) assembles into a huge structure (42 nm in diameter) that can house between 20,000 and 80,000 iron atoms, which is 10–20 times more than typical ferritins (Giessen et al., 2019Giessen T.W. Orlando B.J. Verdegaal A.A. Chambers M.G. Gardener J. Bell D.C. Birrane G. Liao M. Silver P.A. Large protein organelles form a new iron sequestration system with high storage capacity.eLife. 2019; 8: e46070Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The protein shell includes a cargo protein with oxidase activity and features negatively charged pores to allow iron entry. Because the particle likely participates in iron homeostasis, it is necessary to maintain the iron in a mobilizable form. Spectroscopic analysis of the IMEFs reveals that the organization within the particles is amorphous, a property that has been observed previously for bacterial ferritins. The model that emerges is one where the influx of iron atoms into the IMEF shell is controlled by pores, keeping the iron concentration low enough for the internally localized oxidases to facilitate controlled mineralization without allowing uncontrolled and harmful precipitation. This structured and yet dynamic organization recalls similar principles for the nucleolus although the underlying interactions are decidedly different. In related work, Sigmund et al., 2019Sigmund F. Pettinger S. Kube M. Schneider F. Schifferer M. Schneider S. Efremova M.V. Pujol-Martí J. Aichler M. Walch A. et al.Iron-Sequestering Nanocompartments as Multiplexed Electron Microscopy Gene Reporters.ACS Nano. 2019; 13: 8114-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar report similar findings for this encapsulin-cargo system and demonstrate that it can be adapted as a contrast tool for electron microscopy. This kind of environment-responsive yet physically constrained behavior occurs in tissues as well. The liver is the only internal organ capable of extensive regeneration. Despite its plasticity, it maintains a highly organized three-dimensional architecture. Its functional units, millimeter-sized lobules, house hepatocytes that clear substances out of the blood and secrete bile. Hepatocytes thus need to maintain connections to both the circulatory system (via hepatic sinusoids), from where substances are absorbed, and to the bile canaliculi, into which bile is secreted. Hepatic sinusoids and bile canaliculi form two intertwined networks that are never in physical contact. Hence, these “plumbing” connections impose physical constraints on the cells and their spatial organization. Looking at the organization of hepatocytes within a lobule, Morales-Navarrete et al., 2019Morales-Navarrete H. Nonaka H. Scholich A. Segovia-Miranda F. de Back W. Meyer K. Bogorad R.L. Koteliansky V. Brusch L. Kalaidzidis Y. et al.Liquid-crystal organization of liver tissue.eLife. 2019; 8: e44860Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar offer insights into this microstructure and how the organization is set up. By combining high-resolution imaging and concepts from soft matter physics, they develop a model for orientation of individual hepatocytes within the larger tissue. Hepatocytes have multiple apical and basal domains and are not appropriately described with more conventional models for cell polarity. Zerial and colleagues define a concept termed “biaxial polarity” that utilizes two axes (bipolar and ring) that allows them to characterize the orientations of the complex apical and basal surfaces. Across a lobule, individual hepatocytes show a range of orientations, but overall, their apical bipolar axes align to follow flow lines between the two major veins within the lobule. This alignment without rigid order is a property of liquid crystals, most familiar from LCD screens. Each hepatocyte has an intrinsic capacity to polarize, while intercellular contacts with the sinusoidal endothelial cells (e.g., those mediated by integrins) set the liquid crystal order of the lobule (Morales-Navarrete et al., 2019Morales-Navarrete H. Nonaka H. Scholich A. Segovia-Miranda F. de Back W. Meyer K. Bogorad R.L. Koteliansky V. Brusch L. Kalaidzidis Y. et al.Liquid-crystal organization of liver tissue.eLife. 2019; 8: e44860Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The combination of homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions leads cells to self-organize such that single layers of hepatocytes are separated by the sinusoids and intercalated by the bile canaliculi, enabling proper liver structure and function. This self-organization and the resulting liquid crystal properties ensure robust function, where tissue remodeling can replenish the architecture without requiring large-scale changes to a lobule. Could this self-organizing behavior be perturbed by changing the conditions within the liver? Do other tissues show similar liquid-crystal properties? As with subcellular particles and organelles, questions about the material state of tissues and organs and how it governs their function await."
