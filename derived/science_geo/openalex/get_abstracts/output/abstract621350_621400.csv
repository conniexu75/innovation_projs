https://openalex.org/W2899372932,"Recent studies have shown that hyperuricemia is commonly associated with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Elevated serum uric acid has been demonstrated to be associated with obesity in the adult population in many countries; however, there is still a lack of evidence for the Bangladeshi population. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of hyperuricemia and determine the relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and obesity among the Bangladeshi adults.In this cross-sectional study, blood samples were collected from 260 adults (142 males and 118 females) and analyzed for SUA and lipid profile. All participants were categorized as underweight (n = 11), normal (n = 66), overweight (n = 120) and obese (n = 63) according to the body mass index (BMI) scale for the Asian population. Based on SUA concentration the participants were stratified into four quartiles (Q1: < 232 μmol/L, Q2: 232-291 μmol/L, Q3: 292-345 μmol/L and Q4: > 345 μmol/L).The mean age and BMI of the participants were 32.5 ± 13.3 years and 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m2, respectively. The average level of SUA was 294 ± 90 μmol/L with a significant difference between males and females (p < 0.001). Overall, the estimated prevalence of hyperuricemia was 9.3% with 8.4% in male and 10.2% in female participants. There were significant increases in the prevalence of obesity (17.4%, 22.2%, 28.6% and 31.8%, respectively, p < 0.01 for trend) across the SUA quartiles. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that SUA quartiles were independently associated with the presence of obesity (p < 0.01).Present study indicates a significant positive relationship between SUA and obesity among the Bangladeshi adults. Therefore, routine measurement of SUA is recommended in obese individuals to prevent hyperuricemia and its related complications."
https://openalex.org/W2899039933,"We develop and calibrate a dynamic production function model to assess how noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) will affect U.S. productive capacity in 2015-2050. In this framework, aggregate output is produced according to a human capital-augmented production function that accounts for the effects of projected disease prevalence. NCDs influence the economy through the following pathways: 1) when working-age individuals die of a disease, aggregate output undergoes a direct loss because physical capital can only partially substitute for the loss of human capital in the production process. 2) If working-age individuals suffer from a disease but do not die from it, then, depending on the condition's severity, they tend to be less productive, might work less, or might retire earlier. 3) Current NCD interventions such as medical treatments and prevention require substantial resources. Part of these resources could otherwise be used for productive investments in infrastructure, education, or research and development. This implies a loss of savings across the population and hampers economy-wide physical capital accumulation. Our results indicate a total loss of USD94.9 trillion (in constant 2010 USD) due to all NCDs. Mental health conditions and cardiovascular diseases impose the highest burdens, followed by cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. In per capita terms, the economic burden of all NCDs in 2015-2050 is USD265,000. The total NCD burden roughly corresponds to an annual tax rate of 10.8% on aggregate income."
https://openalex.org/W2899013745,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor growth is enhanced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), yet the mechanisms by which tumor cells and TAMs communicate are not fully understood. Here we show that exosomes secreted by PDAC cell lines differed in their surface proteins, lipid composition, and efficiency of fusing with THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. Exosomes from AsPC-1, an ascites-derived human PDAC cell line, were enriched in ICAM-1, which mediated their docking to macrophages through interactions with surface-exposed CD11c on macrophages. AsPC-1 exosomes also contained much higher levels of arachidonic acid (AA), and they fused at a higher rate with THP-1-derived macrophages than did exosomes from other PDAC cell lines or from an immortalized normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) H6c7. Phospholipase A2 enzymatic cleavage of arachidonic acid from AsPC-1 exosomes reduced fusion efficiency. PGE2 secretion was elevated in macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes but not in macrophages treated with exosomes from other cell lines, suggesting a functional role for the AsPC-1 exosome-delivered arachidonic acid in macrophages. Non-polarized (M0) macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had increased levels of surface markers indicative of polarization to an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype (CD14hi CD163hi CD206hi). Furthermore, macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had significantly increased secretion of pro-tumoral, bioactive molecules including VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, MMP-9, and TNFα. Together, these results demonstrate that compared to exosomes from other primary tumor-derived PDAC cell lines, AsPC-1 exosomes alter THP-1-derived macrophage phenotype and function. AsPC-1 exosomes mediate communication between tumor cells and TAMs that contributes to tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2898855232,"Background Antihypertensive treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in AD, and thus RAS-acting AHTs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs)) may offer differential and additional protective benefits against AD compared with other AHTs, in addition to hypertension management. Methods In a retrospective cohort design, we examined the medical and pharmacy claims of a 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2007 to 2013, and compared rates of AD diagnosis for 1,343,334 users of six different AHT drug treatments, 65 years of age or older (4,215,338 person-years). We compared AD risk between RAS and non-RAS AHT drug users, and between ACEI users and ARB users, by sex and race/ethnicity. Models adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, underlying health, and comorbidities. Findings RAS-acting AHTs were slightly more protective against onset of AD than non-RAS-acting AHTs for males, (male OR = 0.931 (CI: 0.895–0.969)), but not so for females (female OR = 0.985 (CI: 0.963–1.007)). Relative to other AHTs, ARBs were superior to ACEIs for both men (male ARB OR = 0.834 (CI: 0.788–0.884); male ACEI OR = 0.978 (CI: 0.939–1.019)) and women (female ARB OR = 0.941 (CI: 0.913–0.969); female ACEI OR = 1.022 (CI: 0.997–1.048)), but only in white men and white and black women. No association was shown for Hispanic men and women. Conclusion Hypertension management treatments that include RAS-acting ARBs may, in addition to lowering blood pressure, reduce AD risk, particularly for white and black women and white men. Additional studies and clinical trials that include men and women from different racial and ethnic groups are needed to confirm these findings. Understanding the potentially beneficial effects of certain RAS-acting AHTs in high-risk populations is of great importance."
https://openalex.org/W2898890131,"To develop and examine the content and face validity of the Patient Engagement In Research Scale (PEIRS) for assessing the quality of patient engagement in research projects from a patient partner perspective.Our team of researchers and patient partners conducted a mixed qualitative and quantitative study in three phases. Participants were English-speaking adult patients (including informal caregivers, family members, and friends) with varying experiences as partners in research projects in Canada. 1) Questionnaire items were generated following thematic analysis of in-depth interviews and published literature. 2) A three-round e-Delphi survey process via email correspondence was undertaken to refine and select the items for a provisional PEIRS. 3) Two rounds of cognitive interviewing elicited participants' understanding and opinions of each item and the structure of the PEIRS.One hundred and twenty items were generated from 18 interviews and organized across eight themes of meaningful engagement of patients in health research to form an initial questionnaire. The e-Delphi survey and cognitive interviewing each included 12 participants with a range of self-reported diseases, health-related conditions, and use of healthcare services. The e-Delphi survey yielded a 43-item provisional PEIRS. The PEIRS was then reduced to 37 items organized across seven themes after 1) refinement of problems in its instructions and items, and 2) the combining of two themes into one.We developed a 37-item self-reported questionnaire that has demonstrated preliminary content and face validity for assessing the quality of patient engagement in research."
https://openalex.org/W2898773503,"Maintaining crop outputs to feed its large population with limited resources while simultaneously mitigating carbon emissions are great challenges for China. Improving the efficiency of resource use in crop production is important in reducing carbon emissions. This paper constructs a methodological framework combining emergy-based indicator accounting and a nonseparable undesirable output slack-based measurement (SBM) data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. This framework is used to explore the efficiency of inputs and outputs and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potential for crop production systems, using Zhejiang province, China, as a case study. It is found that an emergy synthesis and a nonseparable undesirable output SBM-DEA framework is compatible with the case study. Crop production in Zhejiang province has relied heavily on an increase in agrochemical inputs to maintain agricultural output. Energy and chemical fertilizer use are determined as the province's major carbon emissions sources. Although carbon emissions per unit of monetary output has decreased sharply, the carbon emissions per unit emergy output has increased, demonstrating a high carbon intensity reality. The DEA highlighted the differences in crop production efficiency, resource factor redundancy and carbon mitigation potential in the different prefectures of the province. To conclude this research, policies to support low carbon agriculture development, including subsidizing low carbon agriculture technology development and expansion and the cancellation of subsidies to high carbon production factors, such as chemical fertilizer production and sales, are discussed to conclude the research."
https://openalex.org/W2898758996,"Despite increased antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage and the raised CD4 threshold for starting ART, opportunistic infections (OIs) are still one of the leading causes of death in sub-Saharan Africa. There are few studies from resource-limited settings on long-term reporting of OIs other than tuberculosis.Patients starting ART between April 2004 and April 2005 were enrolled and followed-up for 10 years in Kampala, Uganda. We report incidences, patterns and risk factors using Cox proportional hazards models of OIs among all patients and among patients with CD4 cell counts >200 cells/μL.Of the 559 patients starting ART, 164 patients developed a total of 241 OIs during 10 years of follow-up. The overall incidence was highest for oral candidiasis (25.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 20.5-31.6 per 1000 person-years of follow-up), followed by tuberculosis (15.3, 95% CI: 11.7-20.1), herpes zoster (12.3, 95% CI: 9.1-16.6) and cryptococcal meningitis (3.0, 95% CI: 1.7-5.5). Incidence rates for all OIs were highest in the first year after ART initiation and decreased with the increase of the current CD4 cell count. Factors independently associated with development of OIs were baseline nevirapine-based regimens, time-varying higher viral load, time-varying lower CD4 cell count and time-varying lower hemoglobin. In patients developing OIs at a current CD4 cell count >200 cells/μL, factors independently associated with OI development were time-varying increase in viral load and time-varying decrease in hemoglobin, whereas a baseline CD4 cell count <50 cells/μL was protective.We report high early incidences of OIs, decreasing with increasing CD4 cell count and time spent on ART. Ongoing HIV replication and anemia were strong predictors for OI development independent of the CD4 cell count. Our findings support the recommendation for early initiation of ART and suggest close monitoring for OIs among patients recently started on ART, with low CD4 cell count, high viral load and anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2799129786,"Interactions between people and ecological systems, through leisure or tourism activities, form a complex socio-ecological spatial network. The analysis of the benefits people derive from their interactions with nature—also referred to as cultural ecosystem services (CES)—enables a better understanding of these socio-ecological systems. In the age of information, the increasing availability of large social media databases enables a better understanding of complex socio-ecological interactions at an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. Within this context, we model and analyze these interactions based on information extracted from geotagged photographs embedded into a multiscale socio-ecological network. We apply this approach to 16 case study sites in Europe using a social media database (Flickr) containing more than 150,000 validated and classified photographs. After evaluating the representativeness of the network, we investigate the impact of visitors’ origin on the distribution of socio-ecological interactions at different scales. First at a global scale, we develop a spatial measure of attractiveness and use this to identify four groups of sites. Then, at a local scale, we explore how the distance traveled by the users to reach a site affects the way they interact with this site in space and time. The approach developed here, integrating social media data into a network-based framework, offers a new way of visualizing and modeling interactions between humans and landscapes. Results provide valuable insights for understanding relationships between social demands for CES and the places of their realization, thus allowing for the development of more efficient conservation and planning strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2899212787,"The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) across healthcare settings and analyze direct healthcare expenditures related to SSTIs in 2000 and 2012 in the United States.We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. Population-based incidence rates were examined for all healthcare settings that include inpatient visits, emergency department visits and ambulatory visits for SSTIs. The direct costs of healthcare services utilization were reported. Population-based prescribing rates for each antimicrobial class during ambulatory visits were compared.A total of 2.4 million patients experienced an SSTI in 2000 compared to 3.3 million in 2012 (40% increase). From 2000 to 2012, the incidence of patients with at least one hospital visit for SSTIs increased 22%, ambulatory care visits increased 30%, and emergency department visits increased 40%. The incidence of SSTIs in children and adolescents declined 50% (from 150 to 76 per 10,000 person; RR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.38-0.67; p<0.001) whereas SSTIs in older adults (> 65 years of age) increased almost 2-fold (from 67 to 130 per 10,000 person; RR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.44-2.61; p<0.001). The annual incidence of SSTI in adults did not change significantly from 2000 to 2012 (from 84 to 81 per 10,000 person; RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.71-1.31; p = 0.41). The total estimated direct healthcare costs of SSTIs increased 3-fold from $4.8 billion in 2000 to $15.0 billion in 2012, largely driven by an 8-fold increase in ambulatory expenditures for SSTIs. Total population-based antimicrobial prescription rates for SSTIs increased 4-fold from 2000 to 2012 (from 59.5 to 250.4 per 10,000 person).The highest healthcare utilization for SSTI treatment occurred in the ambulatory care setting and also accounted for the largest increase in overall direct expenditures from 2000 to 2012."
https://openalex.org/W2899294156,"Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) has traditionally been considered a crop that requires shade, and consequently it is implemented under agroforestry systems (AFs) in order to regulate the level of incident solar radiation. However, optimal shade levels for this tree crop may vary depending on the climate conditions of where it is grown. Here we analyzed the physiological performance of cacao under three different AFs in the Colombian Amazon that differed in solar radiation patterns: high (HPAR), medium (MPAR), or low (LPAR) mean daily incident radiation. The physiological performance was characterized using photosynthetic variables in leaves such as light- and CO2-response curves, chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, and total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, in conjunction with other leaf functional traits. Cacao trees exposed to HPAR showed an improved physiological performance as compared to those from the other two AFs. Compared to MPAR and LPAR, cacao trees in HPAR doubled the rate of net carbon assimilation and reached higher maximum rates of RuBisCO carboxylation and RuBP regeneration. Moreover, cacao trees in HPAR presented photoprotection mechanisms that avoided photoinhibition, which was accompanied by a greater non-photochemical quenching coefficient and biochemical and morphological adjustments (low chlorophyll but higher carotenoid contents and low specific leaf area) compared to cacao trees from the other AFs. Overall, our results show that, due to the high cloud cover in the Colombian Amazon, cacao plantations under conditions of sparse shade maximized their carbon use, showing an improved physiological performance as a result of higher photosynthetic rates and energy dissipation mechanisms. If the crop were managed with sparse shade, the paradigm that favors the cultivation of cacao under shade would be called into question in the Colombian Amazon and other regions with similar climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2899461683,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has often been used as the source of choice for biomarker discovery with the goal to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. For this study, we selected 15 CSF protein markers which were identified in previously published clinical investigations and proposed as potential biomarkers for PD diagnosis. We aimed at investigating and confirming their suitability for early stage diagnosis of the disease. The current study was performed in a two-fold confirmatory approach. Firstly, the CSF protein markers were analysed in confirmatory cohort I comprising 80 controls and 80 early clinical PD patients. Through univariate analysis we found significant changes of six potential biomarkers (α-syn, DJ-1, Aβ42, S100β, p-Tau and t-Tau). In order to increase robustness of the observations for potential patient differentiation, we developed-based on a machine learning approach-an algorithm which enabled identifying a panel of markers which would improve clinical diagnosis. Based on that model, a panel comprised of α-syn, S100β and UCHL1 were suggested as promising candidates. Secondly, we aimed at replicating our observations in an independent cohort (confirmatory cohort II) comprising 30 controls and 30 PD patients. The univariate analysis demonstrated Aβ42 as the only reproducible potential biomarker. Taking into account both technical and clinical aspects, these observations suggest that the large majority of the investigated CSF proteins currently proposed as potential biomarkers lack robustness and reproducibility in supporting diagnosis in the early clinical stages of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2898881278,"Background The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a valid and reliable instrument for measuring children’s mental health, is available in parent- and teacher versions, making it an ideal tool for assessing behavioural and emotional problems in young children. However, few studies have evaluated inter-parent agreement on the SDQ, and in most studies on SDQ agreement, parent scores are either provided by only one parent or have been combined into one parent score. Furthermore, studies on SDQ inter-rater agreement usually only reflect degree of correlation, leaving the agreement between measurements unknown. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine both degree of correlation and agreement between parent and teacher SDQ reports, in a community sample of preschool-aged children in Sweden. Methods Data were obtained from the Children and Parents in Focus trial. The sample comprised 4,469 children 3–5-years-old. Mothers, fathers and preschool teachers completed the SDQ as part of the routine health check-ups at Child Health Centres. Inter-rater agreement was measured using Pearson correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation (ICC). Results Results revealed poor/fair agreement between parent and teacher ratings (ICC 0.25–0.54) and good/excellent agreement between mother and father ratings (ICC 0.66–0.76). The highest level of agreement between parents and teachers was found for the hyperactivity and peer problem subscales, whereas the strongest agreement between parents was found for the hyperactivity and conduct subscales. Conclusions Low inter-rater agreement between parent and teacher ratings suggests that information from both teachers and parents is important when using the SDQ as a method to identify mental health problems in preschool children. Although mothers and fathers each provide unique information about their child’s behaviour, good inter-parent agreement indicates that a single parent informant may be sufficient and simplify data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2899103701,"Robots and virtual reality are gaining popularity in the intervention of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To shed light on children’s attitudes towards robots and characters in virtual reality, this study aims to examine whether children with ASD show the uncanny valley effect. We varied the realism of facial appearance by morphing a cartoon face into a human face, and induced perceptual mismatch by enlarging the eyes, which has previously been shown as an effective method to induce the uncanny valley effect in adults. Children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children participated in a two-alternative forced choice task that asked them to choose one they liked more from the two images presented on the screen. We found that TD children showed the effect, i.e., the enlargement of eye size and the approaching realism reduced their preference. In contrast, children with ASD did not show the uncanny valley effect. Our findings in TD children help resolve the controversy in the literature about the existence of the uncanny valley effect among young children. Meanwhile, the absence of the uncanny valley effect in children with ASD might be attributed to their reduced sensitivity to subtle changes of face features and their limited visual experience to faces caused by diminished social motivation. Last, our findings provide practical implications for designing robots and virtual characters for the intervention of children with ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2899245300,"The purpose of this work is the design, implementation and evaluation of a mechanically flexible receive-only coil array for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T that can be applied to various target organs and provides high parallel imaging performance.A 23-channel array was designed based on a rigid-flex printed circuit board (PCB). The flexible multi-layer part contains the copper traces forming the coil elements. The rigid part of the PCB houses the solder joints and lumped elements. The coil housing consists of rigid caps mounted above the rigid parts. Adhesive PTFE sheets cover all flexible parts. The developed array was tested on the bench as well as in phantom and in vivo MRI experiments employing parallel imaging acceleration factors up to six.Efficient mutual decoupling between receive elements and detuning between receive array and body coil was achieved. An increased signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to commercial reference coils is demonstrated, especially in regions close to the developed array and for high parallel imaging acceleration factors. Exemplary in vivo images of head, ankle, knee, shoulder and hand are presented.Based on high sensitivity close to the array and low g-factors, this flexible coil is well suited for studies of occipital and temporal cortex, as well as musculoskeletal targets like knee, ankle, elbow and wrist."
https://openalex.org/W2898658081,"Intestinal mucus layer disruption and gut microflora modification in conjunction with tight junction (TJ) changes can increase colonic permeability that allows bacterial dissemination and intestinal and systemic disease. We showed previously that Citrobacter rodentium (CR)-induced colonic crypt hyperplasia and/or colitis is regulated by a functional cross-talk between the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. In the current study, mucus analysis in the colons of CR-infected (108 CFUs) and Notch blocker Dibenzazepine (DBZ, i.p.; 10μmol/Kg b.w.)-treated mice revealed significant alterations in the composition of trace O-glycans and complex type and hybrid N-glycans, compared to CR-infected mice alone that preceded/accompanied alterations in 16S rDNA microbial community structure and elevated EUB338 staining. While mucin-degrading bacterium, Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) along with Enterobacteriaceae belonging to Proteobacteria phyla increased in the feces, antimicrobial peptides Angiogenin-4, Intelectin-1 and Intelectin-2, and ISC marker Dclk1, exhibited dramatic decreases in the colons of CR-infected/DBZ-treated mice. Also evident was a loss of TJ and adherens junction protein immuno-staining within the colonic crypts that negatively impacted paracellular barrier. These changes coincided with the loss of Notch signaling and exacerbation of mucosal injury. In response to a cocktail of antibiotics (Metronidazole/ciprofloxacin) for 10 days, there was increased survival that coincided with: i) decreased levels of Proteobacteria, ii) elevated Dclk1 levels in the crypt and, iii) reduced paracellular permeability. Thus, enteric infections that interfere with Notch activity may promote mucosal dysbiosis that is preceded by changes in mucus composition. Controlled use of antibiotics seems to alleviate gut dysbiosis but may be insufficient to promote colonic crypt regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2898823634,"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) constitutes the active ingredient of many successful bioinsecticides used in agriculture. In the present study, the genetic diversity and toxicity of Bt isolates was investigated by characterization of native isolates originating from soil, fig leaves and fruits from a Turkish collection. Among a total of 80 Bt isolates, 18 of them were found carrying a vip3 gene (in 23% of total), which were further selected. Insecticidal activity of spore/crystal mixtures and their supernatants showed that some of the Bt isolates had significantly more toxicity against some lepidopteran species than the HD1 reference strain. Five isolates were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the Cry protein composition of their crystals. The results identified the Cry1Ac protein and a Cry2A-type protein in all isolates, Cry1Ea in 3 of them and Cry1Aa in one. The sequence analysis of the new vip3 genes showed that they had a high similarity to either vip3Aa, vip3Af or vip3Ag (94–100%). The vip3Aa gene of the 6A Bt isolate was cloned and sequenced. The protein was named Vip3Aa65 by the Bacillus thuringiensis Nomenclature Committee. The expressed and purified Vip3Aa65 protein was tested against five lepidopteran species and its toxicity compared to that of a reference protein (Vip3Aa16). Both proteins had similar toxicity against Grapholita molesta and Helicoverpa armigera, whereas Vip3Aa65 was less active than Vip3Aa16 against three species from the Spodoptera genus. A tetrameric structure of the Vip3Aa65 protein was detected by gel filtration chromatography. The study revealed some isolates with high insecticidal activity which can be considered promising candidates to be used in pest control."
https://openalex.org/W2898639335,"Collisions between birds and military aircraft are common and can have catastrophic effects. Knowledge of relative wildlife hazards to aircraft (the likelihood of aircraft damage when a species is struck) is needed before estimating wildlife strike risk (combined frequency and severity component) at military airfields. Despite annual reviews of wildlife strike trends with civil aviation since the 1990s, little is known about wildlife strike trends for military aircraft. We hypothesized that species relative hazard scores would correlate positively with aircraft type and avian body mass. Only strike records identified to species that occurred within the U.S. (n = 36,979) and involved United States Navy or United States Air Force aircraft were used to calculate relative hazard scores. The most hazardous species to military aircraft was the snow goose (Anser caerulescens), followed by the common loon (Gavia immer), and a tie between Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and black vulture (Coragyps atratus). We found an association between avian body mass and relative hazard score (r2 = 0.76) for all military airframes. In general, relative hazard scores per species were higher for military than civil airframes. An important consideration is that hazard scores can vary depending on aircraft type. We found that avian body mass affected the probability of damage differentially per airframe. In the development of an airfield wildlife management plan, and absent estimates of species strike risk, airport wildlife biologists should prioritize management of species with high relative hazard scores."
https://openalex.org/W2898837419,"The sequelae of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) includes HIV infection, engagement in HIV risk behaviors, substance misuse, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Although Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately infected with HIV in the U.S.-especially in urban locations such as New York City-there is limited research with larger samples of Black MSM of varied HIV status regarding the prevalence of CSA and the potential negative consequence with respect to a ""syndemic,"" i.e., the co-occurrence of adverse conditions such as HIVrisk, substance misuse, and IPV.Black MSM (N = 1,002) recruited in New York City from 2009-2015 completed a screening assessment eliciting self-reported data on age, CSA, self-reported HIV status, number of male sexual partners, number of acts of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), substance misuse, and IPV. Hypothesis testing utilized logistic and linear regression models with self-reported data on CSA (independent variable) and indicators of the following syndemic factors: HIV risk, substance misuse, and IPV.More than one-fourth (28.1%) met criteria for experiencing CSA. CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of being HIV-positive (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0); number of male sexual partners (b = 2.0, SE = 0.5, p = .002) and condomless acts of anal intercourse (b = 4.3, SE = 1.6, p = .007); odds of binge drinking (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0) and illicit substance use (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.0); and odds of experiencing current IPV (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.3). CSA was associated with significantly greater odds of concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.9, p < .001); concurrently experiencing 2 or more syndemic factors was significantly associated with having a riskier HIV status (for being HIV-positive: AOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1, p = .02; for having an unknown HIV status: AOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.9-12.9, p = .04).Among Black MSM, CSA is a prevalent problem and is a significant antecedent to HIV, substance misuse, and IPV indicators and risk. Addressing CSA may be a valuable approach to remedy the syndemic of HIV, substance misuse, and violence that has burdened MSM, especially Black MSM, in the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W2899044742,"The etiology of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), the precursor state of multiple myeloma (MM), is mostly unknown and no studies have been conducted on the effect of diet on MGUS or progression from MGUS to MM. We aimed to explore the association between common foods and MGUS and progression to MM. Data from the population-based AGES Study (N = 5,764) were utilized. Food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake during adolescence, midlife, and late life. Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light-chain assay was performed to identify MGUS (n = 300) and LC-MGUS cases (n = 275). We cross linked our data with the Icelandic Cancer Registry to find cases of MM in the study group. We found that intake of fruit at least three times per week during adolescence was associated with lower risk of MGUS when compared to lower fruit consumption (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.95). We additionally found that intake of fruit at least three times per week during the late life period was associated with decreased risk of progressing from MGUS to MM (HR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.89) when compared to lower intake. Adolescent intake of fruit may reduce risk of MGUS, whereas fruit intake after MGUS onset may reduce risk of progressing to MM. Our findings suggest that diet might alter the risk of developing MGUS and progression to MM."

As the effect of frequent cloudy or rainy days in other seasons on plant growth and yield remains unclear, we investigated the effect on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and compensation by supplemental LED inter-lighting. Plants were grown under 30% shade cloth on 0%, 40%, or 60% of days. Lower leaves were illuminated with red and blue LED inter-lighting modules from right after first anthesis, or not illuminated. Shading during 40% and 60% of days diminished daily light integral (DLI) by 26% and 40%, respectively, and reduced shoot dry weight by 22.0% and 23.3%, yield by 18.5% and 23.3%, and fruit soluble solids content by 12.3% and 9.3%. In contrast, supplemental inter-lighting improved the light distribution within plants and compensated DLI, and maintained similar yield and soluble solids content in both shade treatments as in the control. These results clearly show that supplemental LED inter-lighting could efficiently compensate for a shortage of light for plant growth, photosynthesis and thus yield under the lack of sunshine."

In certain hosts, gastrointestinal infection is linked to treatment avoidance and self-infection at disease susceptible sites. GIT C. pecorum has been detected in livestock and koalas, however GIT prevalence rates within the koala are yet to be established.Paired conjunctival, urogenital and rectal samples from 33 koalas were screened for C. pecorum and C. pecorum plasmid using 16S rRNA and CDS5-specific quantitative PCR assays, respectively. Amplicon sequencing of 359 bp ompA fragment was used to identify site-specific genotypes.The overall C. pecorum prevalence collectively (healthy and clinically diseased koalas) was 51.5%, 57.6% and 42.4% in urogenital, conjunctival and gastrointestinal sites, respectively. Concurrent urogenital and rectal Chlamydia was identified in 14 koalas, with no cases of GIT only Chlamydia shedding. The ompA genotype G dominated the GIT positive samples, and genotypes A and E' were dominant in urogenital tract (UGT) positive samples. Increases in C. pecorum plasmid per C. pecorum load (detected by PCR) showed clustering in the clinically diseased koala group (as assessed by scatter plot analysis). There was also a low correlation between plasmid positivity and C. pecorum infected animals at any site, with a prevalence of 47% UGT, 36% rectum and 40% faecal pellet.GIT C. pecorum PCR positivity suggests that koala GIT C. pecorum infections are common and occur regularly in animals with concurrent genital tract infections. GIT dominant genotypes were identified and do not appear to be related to plasmid positivity. Preliminary results indicated a possible association between C. pecorum plasmid load and clinical UGT disease."
https://openalex.org/W2898865288,"Dietary diversity-eating a more varied diet, may be one of the important components of a healthy diet. We aimed to examine whether dietary diversity score was associated with lower prevalence of obesity.This is a cross-sectional study of 402 married immigrant participants enrolled in the Filipino Women's diet and health study (FiLWHEL). Dietary information was obtained using the 24-hour recall method. Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and waist circumference were directly measured. Dietary diversity score was calculated by summing up the reported number of food groups and additional scores for diversity within food groups were derived. We defined general obesity as body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2 and abdominal obesity as waist circumference of ≥80 cm. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using the multivariable logistic regression accounting for several potential confounders.Dietary diversity score was inversely associated with abdominal and general obesity; odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.49 (0.30-0.82) (p for trend = 0.009) for abdominal obesity and 0.47 (0.28-0.81) (p for trend = 0.008) for general obesity when we compared the third tertile of diversity scores with the first tertile. In the analyses of diversity within food groups, greater diversity in other vegetables was associated with 49% or 50% lower prevalence of abdominal or general obesity, respectively. Furthermore, poultry diversity score was associated with 56% lower prevalence of general obesity.Our study suggests the evidence that high dietary diversity appears to be related to low prevalence of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2899276831,"The objective of this study was to compare the performance of several commonly used machine learning methods to traditional statistical methods for predicting emergency department and hospital utilization among patients receiving publicly-funded home care services.We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of publicly-funded home care recipients in the Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant region of southern Ontario, Canada between 2014 and 2016. Gradient boosted trees, neural networks, and random forests were tested against two variations of logistic regression for predicting three outcomes related to emergency department and hospital utilization within six months of a comprehensive home care clinical assessment. Models were trained on data from years 2014 and 2015 and tested on data from 2016. Performance was compared using logarithmic score, Brier score, AUC, and diagnostic accuracy measures.Gradient boosted trees achieved the best performance on all three outcomes. Gradient boosted trees provided small but statistically significant performance gains over both traditional methods on all three outcomes, while neural networks significantly outperformed logistic regression on two of three outcomes. However, sensitivity and specificity gains from using gradient boosted trees over logistic regression were only in the range of 1%-2% at several classification thresholds.Gradient boosted trees and simple neural networks yielded small performance benefits over logistic regression for predicting emergency department and hospital utilization among patients receiving publicly-funded home care. However, the performance benefits were of negligible clinical importance."
https://openalex.org/W2899471995,"Intracranial electrodes are a vital component of implantable neurodevices, both for acute diagnostics and chronic treatment with open and closed-loop neuromodulation. Their performance is hampered by acute implantation trauma and chronic inflammation in response to implanted materials and mechanical mismatch between stiff synthetic electrodes and pulsating, natural soft host neural tissue. Flexible electronics based on thin polymer films patterned with microscale conductive features can help alleviate the mechanically induced trauma; however, this strategy alone does not mitigate inflammation at the device-tissue interface. In this study, we propose a biomimetic approach that integrates microscale extracellular matrix (ECM) coatings on microfabricated flexible subdural microelectrodes. Taking advantage of a high-throughput process employing micro-transfer molding and excimer laser micromachining, we fabricate multi-channel subdural microelectrodes primarily composed of ECM protein material and demonstrate that the electrochemical and mechanical properties match those of standard, uncoated controls. In vivo ECoG recordings in rodent brain confirm that the ECM microelectrode coatings and the protein interface do not alter signal fidelity. Astrogliotic, foreign body reaction to ECM coated devices is reduced, compared to uncoated controls, at 7 and 30 days, after subdural implantation in rat somatosensory cortex. We propose microfabricated, flexible, biomimetic electrodes as a new strategy to reduce inflammation at the device-tissue interface and improve the long-term stability of implantable subdural electrodes."
https://openalex.org/W2899315255,"Introduction The aging of workers generally implies an increased number of workers with health problems or psychological diseases because of the growing distance between personal resources and job demands; the first may decrease, while the second are stable. In the preschool setting, the demands remain constant because children are always aged 0–3 years, while the preschool teacher’s personal resources decrease with age. It is, therefore, necessary to propose multilevel interventions aimed at supporting work sustainability and workers’ resources. Method This study involved twenty-seven preschools (324 teachers with an average age of 48.7 years): the control group included seventeen schools (190 teachers with an average age of 48.5 years), five schools were assigned to experimental group one (69 teachers with an average age of 48.8), and five schools were assigned to experimental group two (65 teachers with an average age of 49.1). In this context, we proposed two protocols of multilevel intervention comprising three solutions; two of these were common to both experimental groups: psychological counseling and psychosocial intervention. The third solution differed between groups: environmental redefinition (for group one); gymnastic and vocal hygiene (for group two). We hypothesized that the interventions improve teachers’ work abilities, increase well-being, and decrease stress and burnout. Furthermore we hypothesized that there would be an improvement in the organizational climate of trust and in social job resources. Results Data analysis showed that the interventions were effective. In particular, the experimental groups reported significant decreases in psychological exhaustion (EG2: ß = -1.48; p = .00), indolence (EG1: ß = -1.36; p = .00), and stress (EG2: ß = -0.94; p = .00). Furthermore, the experimental groups significantly increased their enthusiasm towards work (EG2: ß = 1.21; p = .01), vertical trust (EG1: ß = 0.54; p = .01), and the perception of coworker social support (EG2: ß = 0.54; p = .01). The protocol that involved the GC2 was particularly effective. Conclusions These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention in a particular job setting (preschool classroom), emphasizing the need for implementing solutions aimed at supporting workers’ well-being, especially in light of an aging workforce."
https://openalex.org/W2899199611,"Quality by Design (QbD), a current trend employed to develop and optimise various critical pharmaceutical processes, is a systematic approach based on the ethos that quality should be designed into the product itself, not just end tested after manufacture. The present work details a step-wise application of QbD principles to optimise process parameters for production of particles with modified functionalities, using dry particle coating technology. Initial risk assessment identified speed, air pressure, processing time and batch size (independent factors) as having high-to-medium impact on the dry coating process. A design of experiments (DOE) using MODDE software employed a D-optimal design to determine the effect of variations in these factors on identified responses (content uniformity, dissolution rate, particle size and intensity of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) C = O spectrum). Results showed that batch size had the most significant effect on dissolution rate, particle size and FTIR; with an increase in batch size enhancing dissolution rate, decreasing particle size (depicting absence of coated particles) and increasing the FTIR intensity. While content uniformity was affected by various interaction terms, with speed and batch size having the highest negative effect. Optimal design space for producing functionalised particles with optimal properties required maximum air pressure (40psi), low batch size (6g), speed between 850 to 1500 rpm and processing times between 15 to 60 minutes. The validity and predictive ability of the revised model demonstrated reliability for all experiments. Overall, QbD was demonstrated to provide an expedient and cost effective tool for developing and optimising processes in the pharmaceutical industry."
https://openalex.org/W2898987151,"Heterophoria is the relative deviation of the eyes in absence of fusional vergence. Fusional vergence can be deprived by, for example, occluding one eye while the other fixates a visual target. Then, the occluded eye will presumably deviate from its initial position by an amount that corresponds to the heterophoria. Its assessment in clinical practice is crucial for the diagnosis of non-strabismic binocular dysfunctions such as convergence insufficiency. Traditional clinical methods, like the cover test or the modified Thorington test, suffer from practitioner's subjectivity, impossibility to observe the occluding eye or unusual viewing conditions. These limitations could be overcome by using eye tracking systems to measure objectively the heterophoria. The main purpose of this study was to compare the performance of an automated and objective method to measure near heterophoria using an eye-tracker with two conventional methods: the cover-uncover test and the modified Thorington test. The eye tracking method gave us the possibility to measure the heterophoria as the deviation of the occluded eye (mimicking the cover test) or as the deviations of the occluded and fixating eyes (adhering to the theoretical definition of heterophoria). The latter method provided smaller results than the former, although on average the differences might not be clinically relevant. The proposed objective method exhibited considerably better repeatability than the two conventional clinical methods. It showed better agreement with the modified Thorington test than with the cover-uncover test, and a similar level of agreement was obtained between the two clinical methods. To conclude, the use of eye-trackers to measure heterophoria provides objective and more repeatable measures. As eye-trackers become common tools in clinical settings, their use to measure heterophoria should be the new gold standard."
https://openalex.org/W2899023679,"We have identified nine highly connected and differentially expressed gene subnetworks between aggressive primary tumors and metastatic lesions in endometrial carcinomas. We implemented a novel pipeline combining gene set and network approaches, which here allows integration of protein-protein interactions and gene expression data. The resulting subnetworks are significantly associated with disease progression across tumor stages from complex atypical hyperplasia, primary tumors to metastatic lesions. The nine subnetworks include genes related to metastasizing features such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia and cell proliferation. TCF4 and TWIST2 were found as central genes in the subnetwork related to EMT. Two of the identified subnetworks display statistically significant association to patient survival, which were further supported by an independent validation in the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas data collection. The first subnetwork contains genes related to cell proliferation and cell cycle, while the second contains genes involved in hypoxia such as HIF1A and EGLN3. Our findings provide a promising context to elucidate the biological mechanisms of metastasis, suggest potential prognostic markers and further identify therapeutic targets. The pipeline R source code is freely available, including permutation tests to assess statistical significance of the identified subnetworks."
https://openalex.org/W2899155496,"In recent years there is increasing evidence that elevated progesterone levels during ovarian stimulation for IVF / ICSI have a negative impact on the ART-outcome. However, different progesterone assays were used in the previous studies and different assays might produce varying results. This retrospective study evaluated the reproducibility and reliability of different progesterone assays with a special focus on progesterone levels below 1.5 ng/ml, as this range is crucial for early detection of progesterone rise during ovarian stimulation for IVF. A total of 413 blood samples were categorized in different progesterone ranges and whether they were retrieved on the day of final oocyte maturation and the results were compared regarding their reproducibility and reliability. To compare the reproducibility between the different progesterone assays, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was calculated and interpretation of the ICC results was done according to Cicchetti, ranging from poor to excellent. The correlation of the assays was excellent when all samples were compared including samples retrieved on day of final oocyte maturation, however in the ranges of progesterone levels 1.0 ng/ml to < 1.5 ng/ml, 0.8 ng/ml to < 1.0 ng/ml and < 0.8 ng/ml, the ICC varied between poor and excellent. The assays ""gen III"" and ""Architect"" showed an excellent reproducibility of progesterone results throughout all ranges of progesterone levels. This analysis demonstrates, that different progesterone assays have a limited reproducibility and that the results depend on the assay used and the range of progesterone level. This fact leads to two important conclusions. Firstly the limited reproducibility might lead to substantially different treatment decisions in ovarian stimulation treatment for IVF and secondly critical interpretation of thresholds, provided by meta-analysis, is crucial despite the risk that the so far gained clinical experience might become irrelevant and has to be adjusted to the results, obtained by each assay."
https://openalex.org/W2898744809,"Hyperuricaemia is associated with various metabolic dysfunctions including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and in general metabolic syndrome, which are all associated with increased risk of cancer. However, the direct association between elevated uricemia and cancer mortality still remains unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of hyperuricemia, the Urahplt2/plt2 (PLT2) mouse, to investigate the effect of high uric acid levels on anti-tumor immune responses and tumor growth. In normo-uricaemic C57BL/6 mice injected with B16 melanomas, immunotherapy by treatment with Poly I:C at the tumor site delayed tumor growth compared to PBS treatment. In contrast, Poly I:C-treated hyper-uricaemic PLT2 mice were unable to delay tumor growth. Conventional and monocyte-derived dendritic cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes (dLN) of C57BL/6 and PLT2 mice were similarly increased after Poly I:C immunotherapy, and expressed high levels of CD40 and CD86. CD8+ T cells in the tumor-dLN and tumor of both WT and PLT2 mice were also increased after Poly I:C immunotherapy, and were able to secrete increased IFNγ upon in vitro restimulation. Surprisingly, tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in dLN were less abundant in PLT2 mice compared to C57BL/6, but showed a greater ability to proliferate even in the absence of cognate antigen. These data suggest that hyperuricaemia may affect the functionality of CD8+ T cells in vivo, leading to dysregulated T cell proliferation and impaired anti-tumor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2898924858,"Indo-Pacific red lionfish (Pterois volitans) have invaded the western Atlantic, and most recently the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), at a rapid pace. Given their generalist habitat affinities and diet, and strong ecological overlap with members of the commercially valuable snapper-grouper complex, increased density and abundance of lionfish could result in significant competitive interactions with nGOM commercially important species. We experimentally investigated the intensity of behavioral interactions between lionfish and indigenous, abundant and economically important juvenile nGOM red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and other increasingly abundant juvenile tropical snapper species (gray snapper-L. griseus and lane snapper-L. synagris) in large outdoor mesocosms to examine snapper vulnerabilities to lionfish competition. When paired with lionfish, red snapper swimming activity (i.e., time swimming and roving around experimental tank or at structure habitat during experiments) was significantly lower than in intraspecific control trials, but gray and lane snapper swimming activities in the presence of lionfish did not significantly differ from their intraspecific controls. Additionally in paired trials, red and lane snapper swimming activities were significantly lower than those of lionfish, while no significant difference in swimming activities was observed between lionfish and gray snapper. We found that red snapper prey consumption rates in the presence of lionfish were significantly lower than in their intraspecific 3-individual control trials, but when paired together no significant differences in prey consumption rates between red snapper and lionfish were observed. When paired with lane or gray snapper, lionfish were observed having comparatively higher prey consumption than snappers, or as observed in lionfish intraspecific 1-individual controls. However, lane and gray snapper consumption rates in the presence of lionfish did not significantly differ from those in intraspecific controls. These findings suggest that competition between juvenile snappers and invasive lionfish may be variable, with lionfish exhibiting differing degrees of competitive dominance and snappers exhibiting partial competitive vulnerability and resistance to lionfish. While the degree of intensity at which these interactions may occur in nGOM reefs may differ from those observed in our findings, this study enables greater understanding of the potential ecological effects of red lionfish on native reef fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2898942007,"Externalizing problems (EP), including rule-breaking, aggression, and criminal involvement, are highly prevalent during adolescence, but the adult outcomes of adolescents exhibiting EP are characterized by heterogeneity. Although many youths’ EP subside after adolescence, others’ persists into adulthood. Characterizing the development of severe EP is essential to prevention and intervention efforts. Multiple predictors of adult antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and legal outcomes of a large sample (N = 1205) of clinically- or legally-ascertained adolescents (ages 12–19 years) with severe EP were examined. Many psychosocial predictors hypothesized to predict persistence of EP demonstrated zero-order associations with adult outcomes, but accounted for little unique variation after accounting for baseline conduct disorder symptoms (CD) and demographic factors. Baseline measures of intelligence, which explained independent variation in legal outcomes, provided the only consistent exception to this pattern, though future work is needed to parse these effects from those of socioeconomic factors. CD severity during adolescence is a parsimonious index of liability for persistence of EP into adulthood that explains outcome variance above and beyond all other demographic and psychosocial predictors in this sample."

Therefore, staging laparoscopy (SL) prior to laparotomy is advised to spare patients the morbidity, inconvenience and expense of futile major surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the added value of SL with laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) and laparoscopic near-infrared fluorescence imaging (LFI).All patients undergoing curative intended surgery of pancreatic or periampullary cancer were included prospectively in this single arm study. Patients received an intravenous infusion of 10 mg indocyanine green (ICG) one or two days prior to surgery to allow LFI. Suspect lesions were analyzed via biopsy or resection. Follow-up visits after surgery occurred every three months.A total of 25 patients were included. Suspect lesions were identified in 7 patients: liver metastases (n = 2; identified by inspection, LUS, and LFI), peritoneal metastases (n = 1; identified by inspection only), and benign lesions (n = 4; identified by inspection or LUS). Quality of LFI was good in 67% (10/15) of patients dosed one day and 89% (8/9) dosed two days prior to surgery. A futile laparotomy was averted in 3 patients (12%). Following SL the primary tumor was resected in 20 patients. Two patients (10%) developed metastases within 3 months after resection.Despite current preoperative imaging modalities metastases are still identified during surgery. This study shows limited added value of LUS during SL in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer. LFI was of added value due to its high negative predictive value in case of suspect hepatic lesions identified by inspection."
https://openalex.org/W2898778864,"Low birth rates and infertility are growing concerns for many countries. The Artificial Reproduction Act (ARA) was implemented in 2007 to better support the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in Taiwan. This study aims to examine trends in the use of ART and to determine impacts of the ARA on ART use.This study used data from the Health Promotion Administration in Taiwan. We used auto-regression models to examine the recent trends (1998-2017) in fertility related indicators and the use of ART. An interrupted time series design and segmented linear regression models were applied to analyze the changes in number of ART treatment cycles and birth rates by ART following the ARA.The number of births by ART has gradually increased, with an annual growth rate of 21.55%. The rate of births by ART increased from 0.86% in 1998 to 1.44% in 2007, and to 4.33% in 2016 (annual growth rate: 41.23%). We estimated a relative increase of 78.51% (95%CI: 46.13%, 110.90%) in the number of births by ART and a relative increase of 35.67% (95%CI: 18.87%, 52.47%) in rate of births by ART 5 years following the ARA was implemented.ART has been seen as an approach to improve fertility. Our analysis suggests that the ART use and births associated from ART use both increased in Taiwan following the implementation of ARA. This experience in Taiwan may offer important lessons for other countries that are facing low fertility challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2898782196,"Polymorphisms in coagulation genes have been associated with early-onset ischemic stroke. Here we pursue an a priori hypothesis that genetic variation in the endothelial-based receptors of the thrombomodulin-protein C system (THBD and PROCR) may similarly be associated with early-onset ischemic stroke. We explored this hypothesis utilizing a multi-stage design of discovery and replication.Discovery was performed in the Genetics-of-Early-Onset Stroke (GEOS) Study, a biracial population-based case-control study of ischemic stroke among men and women aged 15-49 including 829 cases of first ischemic stroke (42.2% African-American) and 850 age-comparable stroke-free controls (38.1% African-American). Twenty-four single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in THBD and 22 SNPs in PROCR were evaluated. Following LD pruning (r2≥0.8), we advanced uncorrelated SNPs forward for association analyses. Associated SNPs were evaluated for replication in an early-onset ischemic stroke population (onset-age<60 years) consisting of 3676 cases and 21118 non-stroke controls from 6 case-control studies. Lastly, we determined if the replicated SNPs also associated with older-onset ischemic stroke in the METASTROKE data-base.Among GEOS Caucasians, PROCR rs9574, which was in strong LD with 8 other SNPs, and one additional independent SNP rs2069951, were significantly associated with ischemic stroke (rs9574, OR = 1.33, p = 0.003; rs2069951, OR = 1.80, p = 0.006) using an additive-model adjusting for age, gender and population-structure. Adjusting for risk factors did not change the associations; however, associations were strengthened among those without risk factors. PROCR rs9574 also associated with early-onset ischemic stroke in the replication sample (OR = 1.08, p = 0.015), but not older-onset stroke. There were no PROCR associations in African-Americans, nor were there any THBD associations in either ethnicity.PROCR polymorphisms are associated with early-onset ischemic stroke in Caucasians."
https://openalex.org/W2899452182,"Ideal configuration or layout of highways should resemble the actual demands for the roads represented by Origin-Destination (OD) information. It would be beneficial if existing highways can be evaluated for their configurational fitness against the current demands, and newly planned highways can carefully be designed in terms of their layouts and topologies that would reflect the demands. Analysis techniques used for complex networks in the matured field of network theory can be applied for the highway layout health monitoring against the current OD information. This paper proposes a methodology of measuring the fitness of existing highways by comparing their structural configuration against conceptual OD networks using well-established techniques in network theory for complex networks. In the first phase, this paper conducts an empirical analysis and finds that both structural highway network and OD network follow the “power law” distribution as they are weighted by capacity and traffic volume respectively. It is also found that the power law coefficient of the OD network dynamically changes throughout the day and week. In the second phase, a noble methodology of weighting and measuring the health, of structural highway networks against OD networks by means of comparing their power law coefficients is proposed. It is found that the proposed method is effective at detecting deviations from ideal structural configurations associated with actual demands."
https://openalex.org/W2899177548,"Conserving populations of environmentally vulnerable insect species requires a greater understanding of the factors that determine their abundance and distribution, which requires detailed knowledge of their population and community ecology. Chemical ecological tools such as pheromones can be used for non-destructive monitoring of scarab beetle populations, enabling European countries to detect and, in some cases, map the range of some of these species, proving a valuable technique for monitoring elusive saproxylic beetles. In this paper, we investigated the behavioural and chemical ecology of the noble chafer, Gnorimus nobilis L., a model insect species of conservation concern across a Europe-wide distribution, and a red-listed UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species. We identified a potential pheromone of adult beetles using electrophysiological recordings, behavioural measurements and field trials in the UK. Gnorimus nobilis is highly unusual in that although both sexes produce, at high metabolic cost, the natural product 2-propyl (E)-3-hexenoate, it only attracts males. This pattern of chemical signalling makes the classification of the compound, based on current semiochemical terminology, somewhat problematic, but in our view, it should be termed an aggregation pheromone as a consequence of the production pattern. Since both sexes emit it, but apparently only males respond positively to it, 2-propyl (E)-3-hexenoate may reflect an intermediate evolutionary stage towards developing into a sex-specific signal. From an applied perspective, our study provides a model for the non-invasive surveillance of cryptic vulnerable insect species, without the need for habitat searching or disturbance, and continuous human monitoring."

https://openalex.org/W2899337523,"The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), is the most important insect pest for the cultivation of olives worldwide. Considerable research efforts have been invested in the past decades to develop eradication or suppression tactics for use within an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approach that includes a sterile insect technique (SIT) component. One of the major obstacles encountered in the development of SIT for olive fruit fly was the inferior quality of the mass-reared flies, expressed among others evident primarily by sterile males having a different timing of peak mating and a lower mating propensity in comparison with their wild counterparts. In this study we assessed the mating behaviour and mating compatibility of olive fruit flies originating from four countries of the Mediterranean region (Croatia, France, Italy, Spain) in walk-in field cages and post zygotic compatibility (expressed as % egg hatch) under laboratory conditions. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis whether a hybrid strain (Greece (domesticated)/Israel (wild)) adapted to laboratory rearing conditions showed any mating barriers with all the four “wild” populations. Finally, we examined the effect of colonization on the mating compatibility of the four newly established populations over three consecutive generations. The results showed no pre-zygotic (mating barriers) or post-zygotic isolations (measured by egg hatch%) among the olive fruit fly populations from the four countries tested. Also, there was no evidence of mating barriers between the hybrid strain and the wild populations of the Mediterranean region."
https://openalex.org/W2899398279,"Background The WHO reported the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is huge in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated there are lots of burden to obtain treatment in these countries. This survey intended to show the delay of their first visit to a psychiatric department and the factors that influence the delay. To elucidate the factors affecting medical accessibility for people with mental illness, we propose the concept of duration of untreated mental illness (DUM), which is the duration between the onset or first symptom of mental illness and the first visit to a psychiatric department or clinic. Methods Participants were 109 Cambodian adults (18 years old and up) who had a psychiatric consultation in one of the following hospitals. We analyzed the relationships between DUM and patients’ background; age, gender, economic status, education level, occupation, hospital access, and diagnosis. Results The average DUM of all participants was 34.8 ± 42.4 months, ranging from 0 to 240 There was no significant difference in DUM by difference in hospital, gender, age, hospital access, education level, occupation, or economic status. Only patient diagnosis was related to DUM. The DUM for patients with schizophrenia and epilepsy was long, while the DUM for patients with neurosis and substance use were short. Conclusion To compare DUM with that of other low- and middle-income countries, DUM of our survey is extremely long. However, those reports were from urban areas within the low- and middle-income countries. We considered our report to include a very important sample showing the condition of psychiatric services in rural areas of low-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2899433506,"With the development of outsourcing data services, data security has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Attribute-based encryption is a valid solution to data security in cloud storage. There is no existing scheme that can guarantee the privacy of access structures and achieve attribute-based encryption with keyword search and attribute revocation. In this article, we propose a new searchable and revocable multi-data owner attribute-based encryption scheme with a hidden policy in cloud storage. In the new scheme, the same access policy is used in both the keyword index and message encryption. The advantage of keyword index with access policy is that as long as a user's attributes satisfy the access policy, the searched ciphertext can be correctly decrypted. This property improves the accuracy of the search results. The hidden policy is used in both the ciphertext and the keyword index to protect users' privacy. The new scheme contains attribute revocation, which is suitable for the actual situation that a user's attributes maybe changed over time. In the general bilinear group model, the security of the scheme is demonstrated, and the efficiency of the scheme is analyzed."

The 5 year survival rate remains extensively low owing to intrinsic resistance to conventional therapy which can be attributed to the genetic modulators involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, this study aims to generate a model for early diagnosis and timely treatment of liver metastasis in lung cancer patients.mRNA expression of 15 genes was quantified by real time PCR on lung cancer specimens with (n = 32) and without (n = 30) liver metastasis and their normal counterparts. Principal Component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and hierarchical clustering were conducted to obtain a predictive model. The accuracy of the models was tested by performing Receiver Operating Curve analysis.The expression profile of all the 15 genes were subjected to PCA and LDA analysis and 5 models were generated. ROC curve analysis was performed for all the models and the individual genes. It was observed that out of the 15 genes only 8 genes showed significant sensitivity and specificity. Another model consisting of the selected eight genes was generated showing a specificity and sensitivity of 90.0 and 96.87 respectively (p <0.0001). Moreover, hierarchical clustering showed that tumors with a greater fold change lead to poor prognosis.Our study led to the generation of a concise, biologically relevant multi-gene panel that significantly and non-invasively predicts liver metastasis in lung cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2898846784,"Coastlines are the boundary between the ocean and land and are an important line feature in spatial data. Coastlines must be adapted via map generalization when they are stored in multi-scale spatial databases. This article presents a new method of coastline generalization that considers the buffer consistency from the original coastline to the generalized coastlines. This method uses the geographical distance field to identify the feature points and bends that influence the buffer consistency from the original coastline to the generalized coastline, and the process is also used to simplify the bends and maintain the concave and convex characteristics in the generalization. This method is compared to the bend-simplification method, and the results indicate that the proposed method can preserve the shape characteristics of coastlines. Moreover, the seaward buffer boundaries from the original coastline to the generalized coastline are consistent when the distance is greater than the tolerance of the coastline generalization."
https://openalex.org/W2898943656,"Pseudogenes are non-functional sequences in the genome with homologous sequences that are functional (i.e. genes). They are abundant in eukaryotes where they have been extensively investigated, while in prokaryotes they are significantly scarcer and less well studied. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of orthologs of Mycobacterium leprae pseudogenes in prokaryotes. The leprosy pathogen M. leprae is of particular interest since it contains an unusually large number of pseudogenes, comprising approximately 40% of its entire genome. The analysis is conducted in both broad and narrow phylogenetic ranges.We have developed an informatics-based approach to characterize the evolution of pseudogenes. This approach combines tools from phylogenomics, genomics, and transcriptomics. The results we obtain are used to assess the contributions of two mechanisms for pseudogene formation: failed horizontal gene transfer events and disruption of native genes.We conclude that, although it was reported that in most bacteria the former is most likely responsible for the majority of pseudogenization events, in mycobacteria, and in particular in M. leprae with its exceptionally high pseudogene numbers, the latter predominates. We believe that our study sheds new light on the evolution of pseudogenes in bacteria, by utilizing new methodologies that are applied to the unusually abundant M. leprae pseudogenes and their orthologs."
https://openalex.org/W2899408890,"The paper presents the application of Grade Correspondence Analysis (GCA) and Grade Correspondence Cluster Analysis (GCCA) for ordering and grouping -omics datasets, using transcriptomic data as an example. Based on gene expression data describing 256 patients with Multiple Myeloma it was shown that the GCA method could be used to find regularities in the analyzed collections and to create characteristic gene expression profiles for individual groups of patients. GCA iteratively permutes rows and columns to maximize the tau-Kendall or rho-Spearman coefficients, which makes it possible to arrange rows and columns in such a way that the most similar ones remain in each other's neighbourhood. In this way, the GCA algorithm highlights regularities in the data matrix. The ranked data can then be grouped using the GCCA method, and after that aggregated in clusters, providing a representation that is easier to analyze-especially in the case of large sets of gene expression profiles. Regularization of transcriptomic data, which is presented in this manuscript, has enabled division of the data set into column clusters (representing genes) and row clusters (representing patients). Subsequently, rows were aggregated (based on medians) to visualise the gene expression profiles for patients with Multiple Myeloma in each collection. The presented analysis became the starting point for characterisation of differentiated genes and biochemical processes in which they are involved. GCA analysis may provide an alternative analytical method to support differentiation and analysis of gene expression profiles characterising individual groups of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2898760831,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe infections, such as pneumonia and bacteremia. Several studies demonstrated that flagellar motility is an important virulence factor for P. aeruginosa infection. In this study, we determined whether sulfated vizantin affects P. aeruginosa flagellar motility in the absence of direct antimicrobial activity. We found that 100 μM sulfated vizantin suppressed P. aeruginosa PAO1 from penetrating through an artificial mucin layer by affecting flagellar motility, although it did not influence growth nor bacterial protease activity. To further clarify the mechanism in which sulfated vizantin suppresses the flagellar motility of P. aeruginosa PAO1, we examined the effects of sulfated vizantin on the composition of the flagellar filament and mRNA expression of several flagella-related genes, finding that sulfated vizantin did not influence the composition of the flagellar complex (fliC, motA, and motB) in P. aeruginosa PAO1, but significantly decreased mRNA expression of the chemotaxis-related genes cheR1, cheW, and cheZ. These results indicated that sulfated vizantin is an effective inhibitor of flagellar motility in P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2899006289,"A basic process in regulating behavior that helps us to disentangle meaningful from distracting information is the binding of stimulus and response features into stimulus-response episodes or “event files”. Recent studies have shown that even irrelevant information is bound into event files; distractor repetition on the next trial can trigger the response encoded in this episode, which is indicated by faster reaction times. The present study was conducted to get further insight into the electrophysiological underpinnings of those distractor-based retrieval. For that, we analyzed the N2, a negative deflection in event-related potentials that has been associated with a multitude of processes occurring when relevant and irrelevant stimuli compete with each other within a given trial or even in sequences of trials. Our study showed that distractor which did not provide useful information regarding the required behavior led to more negative N2 amplitudes, whereas distractors that provide useful response-related information were associated with less negative N2 amplitudes. Our results are explained as an adaptive mechanism that helps to hedge against invalid stimulus-response-bindings before an error occurs to increase efficiency of human behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2899097197,"Although the phylogenetic framework of Davalliaceae is known, the classification of Chinese Davalliaceae is still controversial. In this study, a molecular phylogenetic tree of 60 accessions, including 29 species produced in China, was constructed using five plastid DNA markers—atpB, atpB-rbcL, rbcL, rbcL-accD, and accD. New data on studied specimens, field investigations, and scanning electron microscopy analysis of leaf epidermis and spores were used to reclassify Chinese Davalliaceae. The taxonomic position of Davallia canariensis was confirmed based on new evidence and a new key to sections of Chinese Davalliaceae was proposed. The taxonomically controversial genus Paradavallodes was confirmed as a polyphyletic group, and it was assigned to Davallia sect. Trogostolon and Davallia sect. Davallodes. Further, species endemic to China were delimited, 21 species were admitted to six sections of Davallia, two new combinations were proposed, two new synonyms were defined and a new key to Chinese species of Davalliaceae was presented."
https://openalex.org/W2899204974,"Assessing the cytoplasmic uptake of fluorescently-tagged drugs in heterogeneous cell types currently involves time-consuming manual segmentation of confocal microscopy images. We developed a set of methods that incorporate map algebra techniques to facilitate and expedite image segmentation, particularly of the parenchyma of intermediate cells in the stria vascularis of the inner ear. Map algebra is used to apply a convolution kernel to pixel neighborhoods to create a masking image to select pixels in the original image for further operations. Here, we describe the utility of integrated intensity-based, percentile-based, and local autocorrelation-based methods to automate segmentation of images into putative morphological regions for pixel intensity analysis. Integrated intensity-based methods are variants of watershed segmentation tools that determine morphological boundaries from rates of change in integrated pixel intensity. Percentile- and local autocorrelation-based methods evolved out of the process of developing map algebra- and integrated intensity-based tools. We identified several simplifications that are surprisingly effective for image segmentation and pixel intensity analysis. These methods were empirically validated on three levels: first, the algorithms were developed based on iterations of inspected results; second, algorithms were tested for various types of robustness; and third, developed algorithms were validated against results from manually-segmented images. We conclude the key to automated segmentation is supervision of output data."
