https://openalex.org/W1900565974,"Members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors associate with myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as MyoD to activate skeletal myogenesis. MEF2 proteins also interact with the class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5, resulting in repression of MEF2-dependent genes. Execution of the muscle differentiation program requires release of MEF2 from repression by HDACs, which are expressed constitutively in myoblasts and myotubes. Here we show that HDAC5 shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when myoblasts are triggered to differentiate. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signalling, which stimulates myogenesis and prevents formation of MEF2-HDAC complexes, also induces nuclear export of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by phosphorylation of these transcriptional repressors. An HDAC5 mutant lacking two CaMK phosphorylation sites is resistant to CaMK-mediated nuclear export and acts as a dominant inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis, whereas a cytoplasmic HDAC5 mutant is unable to block efficiently the muscle differentiation program. Our results highlight a mechanism for transcriptional regulation through signal- and differentiation-dependent nuclear export of a chromatin-remodelling enzyme, and suggest that nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HDACs is involved in the control of cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2116045064,"In eukaryotic cells, replicated DNA strands remain physically connected until their segregation to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase. This “sister chromatid cohesion” is essential for the alignment of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle during metaphase. Cohesion depends on the multisubunit cohesin complex, which possibly forms the physical bridges connecting sisters. Proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Scc1 subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition is essential for sister chromatid separation and depends on a conserved protein called separin. We show here that separin is a cysteine protease related to caspases that alone can cleave Scc1 in vitro. Cleavage of Scc1 in metaphase arrested cells is sufficient to trigger the separation of sister chromatids and their segregation to opposite cell poles."

https://openalex.org/W2014012985,"In yeast, anaphase depends on cohesin cleavage. How anaphase is controlled in vertebrates is unknown because their cohesins dissociate from chromosomes before anaphase. We show that residual amounts of the cohesin SCC1 remain associated with human centromeres until the onset of anaphase when a similarly small amount of SCC1 is cleaved. In Xenopus extracts, SCC1 cleavage depends on the anaphase-promoting complex and separin. Separin immunoprecipitates are sufficient to cleave SCC1, indicating that separin is associated with a protease activity. Separin activation coincides with securin destruction and partial separin cleavage, suggesting that several mechanisms regulate separin activity. We propose that in vertebrates, a cleavage-independent pathway removes cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase, whereas a separin-dependent pathway cleaves centromeric cohesin at the metaphase-anaphase transition."

https://openalex.org/W1971801697,"It has been proposed but never proven that cohesion between sister chromatids distal to chiasmata is responsible for holding homologous chromosomes together while spindles attempt to pull them toward opposite poles during metaphase of meiosis I. Meanwhile, the mechanism by which disjunction of homologs is triggered at the onset of anaphase I has remained a complete mystery. In yeast, cohesion between sister chromatid arms during meiosis depends on a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit called Rec8, whose mitotic equivalent, Sccl, is cleaved at the metaphase to anaphase transition by an endopeptidase called separin. We show here that cleavage of Rec8 by separin at one of two different sites is necessary for the resolution of chiasmata and the disjunction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1650051076,"We report here the discovery of the smallest possible carbon nanotube. This has a diameter of 4 Å, which is the narrowest attainable that can still remain energetically stable, as predicted by theory. These nanotubes are confined inside multiwalled carbon nanotubes and their diameter corresponds to that of a C20 dodecahedron with a single carbon atom at each of its twenty apices. Unlike larger carbon nanotubes, which, depending on their diameter and helicity, can be either metallic or semiconducting, these smallest nanotubes are always metallic."
https://openalex.org/W2081663028,"Cadmium is very toxic at low concentrations, but the basis for its toxicity is not clearly understood. We analyzed the proteomic response of yeast cells to acute cadmium stress and identified 54 induced and 43 repressed proteins. A striking result is the strong induction of 9 enzymes of the sulfur amino acid biosynthetic pathway. Accordingly, we observed that glutathione synthesis is strongly increased in response to cadmium treatment. Several proteins with antioxidant properties were also induced. The induction of nine proteins is dependent upon the transactivator Yap1p, consistent with the cadmium hypersensitive phenotype of the YAP1-disrupted strain. Most of these proteins are also overexpressed in a strain overexpressing Yap1p, a result that correlates with the cadmium hyper-resistant phenotype of this strain. Two of these Yap1p-dependent proteins, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, play an important role in cadmium tolerance because strains lacking the corresponding genes are hypersensitive to this metal. Altogether, our data indicate that the two cellular thiol redox systems, glutathione and thioredoxin, are essential for cellular defense against cadmium.

In particular, cadmium is very toxic and probably carcinogenic at low concentrations. However, the biological effects of this metal and the mechanism of its toxicity are not yet clearly understood. It has been proposed that Cd2+ ions might displace Zn2+ and Fe2+ in proteins (1Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar), resulting in their inactivation and in the release of free iron, which might generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH⋅) (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, a major effect of cadmium is oxidative stress (3Brennan R.J. Schiestl R.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 356: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), particularly lipid peroxidation (1Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether these effects are responsible for the extreme toxicity of the metal. Living organisms use several mechanisms to counter cadmium toxicity. In bacteria, efflux pumps are able to export toxic ions outside the cell (4Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, Cd2+ is sequestered by metallothioneins through their high cysteine content (5Hamer D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cadmium can also be detoxified by chelation to GSH or to phytochelatin, a glutathione polymer of general structure (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly synthesized from GSH in plants and in the yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Cd2+-phytochelatin and Cd2+·(GSH)2 complexes are transported into the vacuole by ATP-binding cassette transporters (6Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M.

Dev. 1999; 9: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Strains lacking either transcription factor are sensitive to H2O2 and are defective in the induction by H2O2 of several enzymes with antioxidant properties (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Yap1p is also important in cadmium tolerance because yap1-deleted strains are very sensitive to cadmium, and strains overexpressingYAP1 are hyper-resistant to this toxic metal (12Wu A.L. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of Skn7p to the cadmium response is more complex, becauseskn7-deleted strains are hyper-resistant to cadmium (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), suggesting that Skn7p is not only dispensable for this response but might also repress genes that are important for cadmium tolerance. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we have identified several proteins induced by cadmium in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a framework to the mechanisms of Cd2+ toxicity and cellular protection against this toxic metal. In particular, our results highlight the importance of both glutathione and of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system in the cellular defense against cadmium. Studies were performed with the wild-type strain YPH98 (13Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MATa ura3–52lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1Δ1 leu2-Δ1). All disruptants and strains used in this study were isogenic derivatives of YPH98. The strain overexpressing YAP1 and the mutantskn7Δ::TRP1 were previously described (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Strains tsa1Δ::TRP1,trx1Δ::TRP1,trx2Δ::LEU2,trx1Δ::TRP1-trx2Δ::LEU2and trr1Δ::TRP1 were previously described (14Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Strains yap1Δ::TRP1,gre2Δ::TRP1,ahp1Δ::TRP1 andgpx3Δ::TRP1 were constructed in this work. The strain gsh1ΔPro2–2 has been described. 1D. Spector, J. Labarre, and M. Toledano (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 276, in press. The strain overexpressing YAP1 (mcYAP1) was obtained by transformation of strain YPH98 by a 2-μm plasmid pRS425 carrying a 2.5-kilobaseEcoRI genomic YAP1 fragment. Cells were grown in liquid medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB, Difco), 2% glucose supplemented with uracil, adenine, lysine, tryptophan, and leucine at a final concentration of 30 mg/liter. TheYAP1-overexpressing strain was grown in the same medium but without leucine. Aliquots from an exponential growth culture (A 600, 0.5) were serially diluted in water (10-fold at each step). Ten μl were spotted onto rich broth (YPD) plates containing different cadmium sulfate concentrations: 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 μm. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 to 5 days, and the colony-forming units were counted. Ten-ml cultures were inoculated with a colony and cultivated overnight aerobically at 30 °C with shaking. Two-ml aliquots of mid-log phase culture (A 600, 0.4) were withdrawn and treated with 0, 0.5, 1, or 1.5 mm cadmium sulfate. 15 or 45 min after cadmium addition, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (200 μCi) for 15 min for analysis of protein expression or for 40 min for analysis of glutathione synthesis rate. [35S]methionine-labeled cells (1 ml) were collected by centrifugation, washed in 200 μl of water, and resuspended in 50 μl of water. Cells were then boiled for 5 min to extract metabolites (15Ramos F. Thuriaux P. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and centrifuged to obtain the35S-labeled metabolites in the supernatant. For analysis, the metabolites were oxidized by adding equal volume of supernatant and performic acid (16Kumari K. Khanna P. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This treatment converts both oxidized and reduced forms of glutathione to glutathione-sulfonic acid. Samples (0.1 μl) were then applied on cellulose thin layer chromatography in the following solvent system: butanol-1/acetic acid/water (90:15:33). The 35S-labeled metabolites were quantified by phosphor technology (Phosphor-Imager, Molecular Dynamics). Protein extraction and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were performed as previously described (17Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with a Millipore Investigator apparatus. The radioactive gels were recorded by PhosphorImager and were analyzed with two-dimensional gel analysis software (Melanie II, Bio-Rad). The spot intensities were obtained in pixel units and normalized to the total radioactivity of the gel. The cadmium stimulation index was calculated as the ratio of spot intensity between cadmium and standard conditions. Proteins with a stimulation index of higher than 1.8 are reported in Table I. Proteins with a stimulation index lower than 0.60 (repressed proteins) are: ACS2, ADH1, ADH2, ADK1, ALD6, ARG1, BEL1, COF1, CPA2, EFB1, EFT1, EGD1, EGD2, FBA1, GDH1, GLN1, GPP1, HIS4, HOM2, ILV2, ILV3, ILV5, KRS1, LYS9, LYS20, PDC1, PUB1, PRO2, RPA0, RPA2, RPL45, RPS5, SSB1, SSB2, TDH2, TIF1, TIF45, TIF51A, TPI1, VMA1, YEF3, YJL200C, and YKL056C. The other analyzed proteins with stimulation indices lower than 1.8 and higher than 0.60 are not reported in Table I (with the exception of CTT1, TRR1, and SOD1). Mutant and wild-type strains were compared by their ratio of spot intensities under different cadmium conditions. The experiments were performed at least twice with similar results, and the mean value was reported here.

These previously uncharacterized proteins were identified by a peptide mass mapping approach using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Standard protocols and buffers were used (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Strains gre2Δ::TRP1 andgpx3Δ::TRP1 were prepared by a one step PCR2 amplification protocol that replaced the entire GRE2 or GPX3open-reading frame by the TRP1 gene (22Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Danouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The mutantyap1Δ was created by a one-step gene disruption technique (23Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which removed the YAP1 coding sequence from theBamHI site (+186) to the KpnI site (+1650) relative to the ATG and replaced it with the TRP1 gene. The ahp1Δ::TRP1 strain used in the present work was generated by one back-cross of the previously described ahp1Δ::TRP1 (14Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with a wild-type strain. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed essentially as previously described (19Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).ACT1 reverse transcriptase-PCR products were used as internal standards. We analyzed the proteomic response to cadmium to identify activities, which could be potentially important for the resistance to this toxic compound. Exponentially growing cells were untreated or treated with 1 mm cadmium for 60 min, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and analyzed by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). The changes in spot intensity between untreated and treated cells were quantified by phosphorimager and software analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). More than 50 proteins were induced by a factor greater than 2 after cadmium treatment (Table I). Concomitantly, about 40 other proteins were significantly repressed. A lower dose of cadmium (0.5 mm) or shorter period of treatment (15 min) gave a similar pattern of protein expression, but with lower induction levels. Proteins induced by cadmium included enzymes with antioxidant properties, heat shock proteins, proteases, enzymes of the sulfur amino acid biosynthesis pathway, carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, and other unclassified proteins or with unknown function. Conversely, proteins repressed by cadmium were mainly components of the translational apparatus and metabolic enzymes. The particularly high induction level of enzymes of the sulfur amino acid pathway (Fig.2) suggested an increased synthesis of cysteine and perhaps of GSH, which is essential in the cellular detoxification of cadmium. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured GSH synthesis rate by TLC after [35S]methionine pulse labeling. After cadmium treatment, the synthesis rate of GSH was increased more than 4-fold (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). As expected, in extracts from cells lackingGSH1 (encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), no GSH was produced (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). The production of another35S-labeled compound was also augmented in response to cadmium treatment, but we could not identify this molecule.Figure 3Glutathione synthesis rate is increased after cadmium treatment. Autoradiograms of thin layer chromatography of intracellular metabolites from [35S]methionine-labeled cells. A and B, the wild-type and the mutant strains were left untreated (−) or treated with 0.5 mmCd2+ for 30 min (+) and labeled with [35S]methionine for 40 min. Cells were further processed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The radioactive spots observed on the figure are the sulfonic acid forms of cysteine and glutathione.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The stimulation of GSH biosynthesis correlated with a more than 10-fold increase of GSH1 mRNA level after 1 h of cadmium treatment (not shown and Ref. 24Stephen D.W. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As metallothioneins are cysteine-rich and potentially important for cadmium detoxification, we also analyzed CUP1 mRNA levels and found no increased expression of this gene in response to cadmium, but rather a slight repression. These results strongly suggest that the cysteine biosynthesis pathway was induced to allow enhanced glutathione synthesis. Strains lacking the transcriptional activator Yap1p are very sensitive to cadmium and conversely, strains overexpressing this regulator are hyper-resistant (12Wu A.L. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, strains lacking the transcriptional activator Skn7p are hyper-resistant to this toxic metal (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the cadmium proteomic response in strains lacking either YAP1 (yap1Δ) or SKN7(skn7Δ) or overexpressing YAP1(mcYAP1) (Fig. 4). The comparative measure of the proteomic response between these mutants and the wild-type cells is given in Table I. The yap1Δ strain had a weaker induction of 9 of the 57 responsive proteins, by a factor of 2 or more. These included four antioxidant defense proteins (the superoxide dismutase Sod2p, the alkyl hydroperoxidase Ahp1p, the thioredoxin Trx2p, and the thioperoxidase Tsa1p) and five other proteins (Sam1p, Oye3p, Gre2p, YNL134C, and YNL274C). Except for Sam1p, all these proteins were significantly overexpressed in response to cadmium in mcYAP1. Additionally, most of the heat shock proteins and proteasome subunits were also overexpressed in mcYAP1 (Table I). In skn7Δ, only two proteins (Cdc48p and Shm2p) were not properly induced by cadmium. However, surprisingly, Ctt1p, Ccp1p, Sod1p, Oye3p, Gre2p, YNL134C, and several heat shock proteins and proteasome subunits were overexpressed in response to cadmium. Given the importance of GSH in cellular cadmium protection, we also measured the biosynthesis of GSH in these mutants as we did in the wild-type strain. The GSH biosynthesis rate was significantly decreased in yap1Δ and augmented in mcYAP1(Fig.3 B, lanes 5–7). However, GSH biosynthesis rate was not modified in skn7Δ. Proteins with both a defective cadmium induction in yap1Δ and an increased expression in mcYAP1 could be important for Cd2+ protection. 5 of 9 proteins matching this criteria were therefore evaluated for their role in Cd2+ tolerance (Fig.5 A). Deletion ofTRR1 encoding the thioredoxin reductase or of bothTRX1 and TRX2 resulted in a significant decreased tolerance to cadmium (Fig. 5). However, the deletion of either thioredoxin does not affect the tolerance to cadmium, showing that these two proteins can substitute for each other in this function. In contrast, strains carrying a deletion of either GRE2, TSA1,or AHP1 had a wild-type tolerance to cadmium (data not shown). Note that the ahp1Δ strain has a wild-type tolerance contradicting an earlier report (14Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that demonstratesahp1Δ is sensitive to this metal. However, the cadmium phenotype of this strain was shown related to an additional unidentified mutation (data not shown). One of the main Cd2+ toxic effects is believed to be the generation of toxic lipid peroxides. It was therefore surprising to find that the strain deleted of AHP1, the gene encoding an important alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, is not defective in cadmium tolerance. Because another enzyme, the glutathione peroxidase Gpx3p, is also active against organic peroxides (25Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-i. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), we analyzed the cadmium resistance of the GPX3-disrupted strain. Although this mutant is clearly sensitive to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH, Ref. 25Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-i. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and data not shown), it showed a normal cadmium resistance (Fig. 5). To gain insight into the biological effects of Cd2+and to identify activities relevant to its detoxification, we have analyzed the proteomic response to this toxic metal. Fifty-seven proteins were found to be induced by Cd2+, including enzymes of the cysteine and glutathione biosynthesis pathway and proteins with antioxidant properties. In addition, the induction of several of these proteins is controlled by the transcription factor Yap1p. The proteomic response to cadmium has revealed a strong induction of eight enzymes of the sulfur amino acid and GSH biosynthesis pathways, particularly the last enzyme of the cysteine biosynthesis pathway, Cys3p, and the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis, GSH1. This increased gene expression was correlated with a strong stimulation of GSH biosynthesis. These results are consistent with the notion that GSH acts as a first line of defense against cadmium toxicity by chelation and sequestration of the toxic metal. In yeast, cadmium is sequestered in the vacuole upon transport of Cd2+·(GSH)2 complexes by the membrane ATP-binding cassette Ycf1 (6Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The importance of this detoxification system is demonstrated by the hypersensitive phenotype resulting from the deletion of either YCF1 (26Szczypka M.S. Wemmie J.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22853-22857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) orGSH1 (27Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine biosynthetic pathway is also important as demonstrated by the cadmium hypersensitive phenotype of strains deleted for CYS4 (data not shown). This pathway is probably essential for the increased production of GSH under these stress conditions. The coordinated regulation of GSH1 expression with enzymes of the sulfur amino acids pathway may suggest that a common transcriptional mechanism is involved in these inductions. Consistent with this idea, a recent work (28Dormer U.H. Westwater J. McLaren N.F. Kent N.A. Mellot J. Jamieson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32611-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has shown that the GSH1induction by cadmium is dependent upon the transcription factors Met4p, Met31p, Met32p, and Cbf1p, which belong to the transcriptional complex of MET genes. It was also found that the GSH1promotor contains functional elements typical of MET genes (28Dormer U.H. Westwater J. McLaren N.F. Kent N.A. Mellot J. Jamieson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32611-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sulfur amino acid pathway is not induced but rather repressed under most of the other stress conditions examined, including the oxidative stress (19Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the osmotic stress (29Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and the heat shock response (30Boy-Marcotte E. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boudsocq A. Jacquet M. Labarre J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is remarkable that among the enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, only those of the sulfur amino acid biosynthetic pathway are induced, which is consistent with a very specific control mechanism. Cd2+ is not a redox active metal ion. However, it could cause oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, perhaps by displacing protein-bound Fe2+, allowing this ion to become available for the Fenton reaction. This hypothesis is based on previous studies showing an increase in lipid peroxidation products after exposure to Cd2+ (1Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar, 31Gupta S. Athar M. Behari J.R. Srivastava R.C. Ind. Health. 1991; 29: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Howlett N.G. Avery S.V. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 48: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Howlett N.G.

In addition, yeast strains deleted for cytosolic copper and zinc and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2) are hypersensitive to cadmium (3Brennan R.J. Schiestl R.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 356: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The observation that several antioxidants such as Ahp1p, Ccp1p, Tsa1p, and Sod2p are induced by cadmium is consistent with this hypothesis. We also found that strains deleted for AHP1 orGPX3, which encode two main organic peroxide-scavenging activities, are not sensitive to cadmium, which does not support the idea that cadmium toxicity is related to the cellular generation of lipid peroxidation products. However, we cannot rigorously rule out the possibility that yeast tolerance to cadmium-generated lipid peroxidation products involves specific activities other than Ahp1p or Gpx3p, which have not yet been elucidated. It is also possible that cadmium indirectly contributes to oxidative stress by affecting the cellular thiol redox balance. We indeed found that Trx2p is significantly induced by cadmium and that strains deleted for both TRX1 and TRX2 or for TRR1 are hypersensitive to this metal. In support of such a mechanism, a recent work has shown that cadmium inactivates thioredoxins, thioredoxin reductases, and glutathione reductases (35Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Therefore, given the essential nature of these systems (36Muller E.G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), thiol transferase inactivation could be the primary deleterious effect of cadmium. In addition, the inactivation of the thiol transferase pathway could also result in an increase in cellular lipid peroxidation products as a consequence of their unavailability of the main electron donors for the thiol and GSH peroxidases. The observation that YAP1-deleted strains were hypersensitive to cadmium (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 12Wu A.L. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and strains overexpressing YAP1 were hyper-resistant (27Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that this transcriptional activator might control genes important for cadmium tolerance.YCF1 and GSH1 are two of them (27Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wemmie J.A. Szczypka M.S. Thiele D.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the importance of the Ycf1p-GSH detoxification system, these two genes are probably the primary targets by which Yap1p exerts a control of cadmium tolerance. In accord with this notion, we found that cadmium-induced GSH synthesis is controlled by Yap1p. We also discovered that nine other genes required the presence of Yap1p for their proper induction by cadmium. These mostly include antioxidant defense genes also induced by H2O2 in a Yap1-dependent manner (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Several other proteins of the Yap1p H2O2-inducible regulon (Ccp1p, Ssa1p, Hsp78p, Hsp82p, Mpr1p, Uba1p, Cys3p, Tal1p, Zwf1p, Dak1p, and Tps1p) were still induced by Cd2+ in yap1Δ (see Table I), suggesting the existence of other control pathways for the cadmium response. This pathway does not involve the Yap1p homologous factor Yap2p, because a strain deleted for both YAP1 andYAP2 had the same proteomic response to cadmium than theyap1Δ strain (not shown). Interestingly, most of the cadmium-inducible Yap1p-dependent proteins were also overexpressed in aYAP1 multicopy strain after cadmium treatment. ThisYAP1 gene dosage effect, which was not observed in the H2O2response 3C. Godon, J. Lee, J. Labarre, and M. Toledano, unpublished results. correlate well with the hyper-resistance of the YAP1-overexpressing strain toward Cd2+ but not toward H2O2. Skn7p is an important regulator of the H2O2 response that cooperates with Yap1p to activate the expression of several genes in response to H2O2 (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, although Yap1 is also important for the cadmium response, the function of Skn7p in this response is more complex because skn7Δ is hyper-resistant to this metal (9Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This resistance phenotype could not be explained by a defective Cd2+ intracellular transport or alternatively, by the overproduction of metallothioneins (data not shown) or glutathione (this work). However, this could be explained by the observation that several proteins of the cadmium stimulon were superinduced in the skn7Δ mutant, supporting the idea that Skn7p may act to repress these genes upon cadmium treatment. This was particularly striking for heat shock proteins and for some Yap1p-dependent proteins of unknown function (YNL134C, Gre2p, or Oye3p). Interestingly, the YAP1 multicopy strain overexpresses nearly the same set of proteins, suggesting a correlation between the cadmium hyper-resistance phenotype and the overexpression of these proteins. Some of these proteins, yet to be studied, might be important for cadmium resistance. We thank A. Sentenac for encouragement and critical discussions, D. Thomas for providing cys4Δstrain, J. Lee for mRNA analysis, and J. Garin and S. Kieffer for mass spectrometry analysis."

But the physiological significance of this observation and its potential therapeutic value are obscured by the fact that some asthmatic patients respond to these compounds with a paradoxical bronchospasm3,5. The mechanisms underlying these contrasting responses remain unresolved. Here we show that the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide exerts dual effects on bronchial responsiveness in rodents: it strongly inhibits bronchospasm and cough evoked by the chemical irritant, capsaicin, but causes bronchospasm when the constricting tone exerted by the vagus nerve is removed. Both effects are mediated through peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors found on axon terminals of airway nerves. Biochemical analyses indicate that anandamide is synthesized in lung tissue on calcium-ion stimulation, suggesting that locally generated anandamide participates in the intrinsic control of airway responsiveness. In support of this conclusion, the CB1 antagonist SR141716A enhances capsaicin-evoked bronchospasm and cough. Our results may account for the contrasting bronchial actions of cannabis-like drugs in humans, and provide a framework for the development of more selective cannabinoid-based agents for the treatment of respiratory pathologies."

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It is a tripeptide consisting of glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. The antioxidant effect of GSH is dependent on the reduced sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine. Levels of intracellular GSH are maintained by a series of synthetic enzymes that regulate production of this tripeptide. Because of its relatively high intracellular concentration, GSH is transported out of cells into the extracellular environment. Once in the extracellular environment, there is little or no cellular uptake of intact glutathione. Rather, GSH is metabolized by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT, EC 2.3.2.2), a plasma membrane enzyme whose catalytic site faces the extracellular environment (reviewed in Ref. 2Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.Z. Wan D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185PubMed Google Scholar). GGT removes the γ-glutamyl group from GSH, after which cysteinylglycine can be cleaved by a membrane dipeptidase. The released cysteine can then be transported into the cell and used as a substrate for de novo synthesis of GSH. This γ-glutamyl cycle is thought to maintain cellular GSH levels. Despite reports of GGT-related enzymes (3Heisterkamp N. Rajpert-De Meyts E. Uribe L. Forman H.J. Groffen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6303-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or direct uptake of intact GSH by cells (4van Klaveren R.J. Demedts M. Nemery B. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1392-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the γ-glutamyl cycle involving GGT is generally thought to be the major pathway by which cells utilize extracellular GSH for the de novo synthesis of intracellular GSH (5Griffith O.W. Bridges R.J. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5405-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that primary human memory T cells express higher level of GGT than naive T cells (6Karp D.R. Carlisle M.L. Mobley A.B. Nichols T.C. Oppenheimer-Marks N. Brezinschek R.I. Holers V.M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because these cells are specialized to access extravascular inflammatory sites (7Brezinschek R.I. Lipsky P.E. Galea P. Vita R. Oppenheimer-Marks N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3062-3077PubMed Google Scholar), this observation suggests that increased GGT expression may provide an adaptive advantage in permitting these cells to resist oxidative stress and/or grow more effectively. This possibility is supported by the finding that T cells at sites of inflammation with increased oxidative stress, such as the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients, uniformly express high levels of GGT (6Karp D.R. Carlisle M.L. Mobley A.B. Nichols T.C. Oppenheimer-Marks N. Brezinschek R.I. Holers V.M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The role of up-regulated GGT on lymphocytes is not clear. It has been suggested that the expression of GGT on other cell types might be involved in the facilitation of cellular proliferation. GGT expression in mouse fibroblasts and hepatoma cells promotes their growth under conditions of reduced extracellular cysteine and/or depletion of intracellular glutathione (8Rajpert-De Meyts E.

GGT also has been shown to blunt cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide or cisplatin (11Shi M. Gozal E. Choy H.A. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Hanigan M.H. Gallagher B.C. Townsend D.M. Gabarra V. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whether the role of GGT in protecting cells from oxidative stress or thiol depletion involves resynthesis of intracellular GSH is not known. For example, GGT expression has been correlated with enhanced tumor cell growth, whereas a GGT-related difference in GSH levels was not observed (12Hanigan M.H. Gallagher B.C. Townsend D.M. Gabarra V. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of GGT expression by B cells has been suggested to account for the ability of nylon-wool adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells to cleave γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (13Novogrodsky A. Tate S.S. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2414-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), although the function of B cell GGT has not been delineated. Because GSH plays a major role in cellular defense against free radicals and GGT exerts an important influence in GSH metabolism, we hypothesized that the expression of GGT might serve to confer a survival advantage to B cells exposed to oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of Ramos B cells expressing GGT to survive oxidative stress. All amino acids, peptides, l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO), acivicin, and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma. RPMI 1640, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, phosphate-buffered saline, and G418 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

Ramos/GGT cells were infected with the retroviral vector, LGGTSN, that expresses the human GGT cDNA regulated by the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Ramos/X cells were infected with the parental retroviral vector, LXSN. Both cell lines were selected in G418 and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 0.25 mg/ml of this antibiotic and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. GGT expression on primary B cells and Ramos transfectants was determined by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibody, 3A8 (15Nichols T.C. Guthridge J.M. Karp D.R. Molina H. Fletcher D.R.

GGT enzymatic activity in whole cell lysates was determined using a commercially available kinetic assay for the conversion ofl-γ-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroanilide to 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoate in the presence of glycylglycine (Sigma). To accomplish this, 107 cells were lysed at 107/ml in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. 50 μl of cell lysate (150–300 μg of protein) was added to 1.0 ml of the substrate solution provided. The change in the absorbance of the solution at 405 nm was monitored for 3 min. Units of GGT/μg of protein were calculated based on the molar extinction coefficient of the nitrobenzoate product. One unit is defined as the generation of 1 μmol of product/min. To study the role of extracellular cyst(e)ine on the levels of ROS and cell death, Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells were first collected from logarithmically growing cultures in standard RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 2 × 105cells were then plated in 24-well plates and incubated in 1 ml of cyst(e)ine-free medium at 37 °C. Cyst(e)ine-free medium was prepared from methionine-free, cyst(e)ine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented withl-glutamine (4 mm), l-methionine (200 μm), and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, inhibitors of cyst(e)ine transport or glutamyl cycle enzymes were added at the time that the cells were shifted to cyst(e)ine-free medium. These include BSO (100 μm), acivicin (200 μm), alanine (10 mm), or homocysteic acid (5 mm). Cell death was measured by flow cytometry using PI staining. After incubation, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. PI was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, just before analysis using the FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) flow cytometer. Total cell death was measured as the percentage of cells stained with PI. The hypotonic PI method was used to measure apoptosis. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in a hypotonic PI solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, and 50 μg/ml PI) and incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Cells containing a hypo-diploid DNA content by flow cytometry were defined as apoptotic cells. Ten thousand cells were counted in each sample, and the data were analyzed with CellQuest™ (Becton Dickinson) software to determine the percentage of dead cells and the percentage of apoptotic cells. Cellular GSH levels were analyzed by flow cytometry using MBBr and PI (6Karp D.R. Carlisle M.L. Mobley A.B. Nichols T.C. Oppenheimer-Marks N. Brezinschek R.I. Holers V.M. Int.

Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 20 μl of a 4 mm stock solution of MBBr in 100% ethanol was added. The sample was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. PI (1 μg/ml) was added just before measurement to gate out dead cells. The mean fluorescence intensity for the live cells was recorded using the FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Ten thousand cells were measured in each sample. FluorosbriteTM carboxy BB 6-μm microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) were analyzed before each experiment to normalize the fluorescence intensity measurement conditions. To determine the level of background staining, N-ethylmaleimide (100 μm) was added to a parallel sample immediately before MBBr staining. N-Ethylmaleimide is a sulfhydryl-reactive agent that rapidly depletes intracellular thiols. The mean fluorescence intensity of theN-ethylmaleimide-treated sample was subtracted from the mean fluorescence intensity of the experimental sample, and the difference was defined as the cellular GSH level of the live cells. The GSH level of fresh cells was also determined using a Glutathione Assay Kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), which is based on the nonenzymatic reaction of thiols with a quinolinium chromogen (17Chaudiere J. Aguini N. Yadan J.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.6 × 107 cells were lysed in 400 μl of 5% metaphosphoric acid, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. A 40-μl aliquot was diluted with 100 μl of a buffer comprised of 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2 mmdiethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, and 0.025% Lubrol. 10 μl of a 12 mm solution of 4-chloro-1-methyl-7-trifluoromethyl-quinolinium methylsulfate in 0.2n HCl was added with mixing, followed by 50 μl of 30% NaOH. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance at 400 nm was measured and compared with a standard curve of freshly prepared GSH in metaphosphoric acid. All assays were performed in triplicate, and the GSH content was expressed as nmol/106 cells. The relative level of intracellular ROS was analyzed by flow cytometry using 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and PI. 10 μm (final) of 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate or vehicle alone was added to each sample 30 min before the end of the incubation with different stressors. Just before analysis, PI was added to each sample as described above, and the samples were analyzed using the FACScan flow cytometer. Ten thousand cells were analyzed in each sample, and dead cells were gated out by PI staining. The mean fluorescence intensity for the cells that were not stained with 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was subtracted from that of cells stained with 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, and the difference was defined as the relative level of ROS for the live cells. Using a recently developed monoclonal antibody (3A8) to human GGT (15Nichols T.C. Guthridge J.M. Karp D.R. Molina H. Fletcher D.R. Holers V.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and flow cytometry, expression of GGT by human T lymphocytes was previously found to increase with cellular activation (6Karp D.R. Carlisle M.L. Mobley A.B. Nichols T.C. Oppenheimer-Marks N. Brezinschek R.I. Holers V.M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The same approach was used to assess the level of GGT expression on human B lymphocytes. Resting B cells express little or no surface GGT by 3A8 staining (Fig. 1). However, with activation, there was marked up-regulation of GGT. Similarly, the Ramos B cell line failed to express GGT. The Ramos cell line was chosen as a model for mature B cells not only because it does not express surface GGT, but also it had been extensively used to study B cell signaling and apoptosis (18Grammer A.C. Swantek J.L. McFarland R.D. Miura Y. Geppert T. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lens S.M. den Drijver B.F. Potgens A.J. Tesselaar K. van Oers M.H. van Lier R.A.

To study the impact of GGT on B cell function, this transformed B cell line was transfected with the cDNA for human GGT under the control of a murine retroviral promoter (16Henson S.E. Nichols T.C. Holers V.M. Karp D.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1845-1852PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected Ramos/GGT cells express high levels of GGT on their surface, whereas Ramos/X (vector control transfectant) expresses little or no surface GGT. The level of GGT staining on the Ramos/GGT cells was approximately five times the level on the activated peripheral blood B cells. This apparent difference in GGT expression per cell is offset by the larger size of the Ramos lymphoblastoid cells with respect to peripheral blood B cells (approximately twice the diameter; thus four times the surface area). Finally, the transfection resulted in a high level of GGT enzymatic activity in the Ramos/GGT cells (97.1 ± 1.7 milliunits of enzyme activity/mg cellular protein), whereas no GGT enzymatic activity could be detected in the parental Ramos or Ramos/X cells, confirming previous observations (16Henson S.E. Nichols T.C. Holers V.M. Karp D.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1845-1852PubMed Google Scholar). GSH enters cells as the intact tripeptide poorly, if at all, under physiological conditions (3Heisterkamp N.

A. 1978; 75: 5405-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The function of GGT has been presumed to be to facilitate the recapture of extracellular GSH. Flow cytometric and biochemical assays were therefore carried out to quantify the intracellular levels of GSH in the Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells during log phase growth. First, MBBr fluorescence of living cells was quantified. MBBr is capable of binding to all intracellular thiols. The majority of the signal, however, will reflect GSH, the dominant intracellular thiol. This was confirmed by incubating cells with BSO, to block de novo GSH biosynthesis. The MBBr signal was reduced 60–70% by BSO treatment (data not shown) in agreement with other studies (21Sen C.K. Roy S. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, the MBBr concentration and time of incubation were kept to a minimum in these experiments to produce a signal that is proportional to the intracellular GSH concentration (22Hedley D.W. Chow S. Cytometry. 1994; 15: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Contrary to the expected result, Ramos/X had significantly higher levels of GSH in comparison with Ramos/GGT (TableI). This finding was corroborated by a second assay performed on cell lysates prepared from cells taken directly from culture. This chromogenic assay employs a quinolinium reagent that reacts with either cysteine or GSH to form products with similar absorption coefficients (17Chaudiere J. Aguini N. Yadan J.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, the concentration of intracellular GSH is 40–80 times that of cysteine (23Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 24Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar). Thus, it is formally possible but highly unlikely that these results reflect a much greater intracellular cysteine level in Ramos/X cells compared with Ramos/GGT.Table IIntracellular GSH levels, reactive oxygen species and cell death in log phase cultures of Ramos/X and Ramos/GGTCell LineRamos/XRamos/GGTGSH (nmol/106 cells, colorimetric assay)1.97 ± 0.24 (n = 6)1.21 ± 0.20 (n = 6)1-ap < 0.05.GSH (mean fluorescent intensity of MBBr staining)144.9 ± 11.5 (n = 15)88.6 ± 5.7 (n = 15)1-bp < 0.001 for comparison of Ramos/GGT with Ramos/X.Reactive oxygen species (mean fluorescent intensity of DCF staining)46.3 ± 5.0 (n = 15)33.7 ± 4.2 (n = 15)1-ap < 0.05.Dead cells (percentage propidium iodide positive)17.4 ± 1.1 (n = 15)13.0 ± 0.8 (n = 15)1-cp < 0.01.Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT transfectants were harvested from log phase growth in RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum.

Data shown are the means ± S.E. from four separate experiments for colorimetric GSH levels and 15 experiments for the others.

Open table in a new tab Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT transfectants were harvested from log phase growth in RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum. The intracellular GSH level was measured both colorimetrically and by reaction with MBBr. Reactive oxygen species were quantified by flow cytometry using dichlorofluorescein (DCF); the percentage of dead cells was determined by exclusion of PI. Data shown are the means ± S.E. from four separate experiments for colorimetric GSH levels and 15 experiments for the others. The Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis. Spontaneous cell death in both transfected cell lines was low, although there was a small but significant increase in the number of dead cells in Ramos/X compared with Ramos/GGT (17.4% versus 13.0%,p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). Intracellular ROS, measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, was also significantly lower in Ramos/GGT compared with Ramos/X (mean fluorescence intensity of 33.7 versus 46.3; p < 0.05). Thus, expression of GGT in Ramos cells appeared to lower their relative level of ROS and protect them modestly from cell death but unexpectedly also appeared to result in a decrease in intracellular GSH levels. Standard tissue culture medium contains high concentrations of cystine. For example, both Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 have ∼200 μm cystine, compared with the 40 μm found in human serum. Therefore, GGT expression may not provide a particular advantage in this situation. However, it may be beneficial when cyst(e)ine is limiting. To examine this, Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells were incubated in medium lacking cyst(e)ine. Under this form of oxidative stress (extracelular thiol depletion), significantly more Ramos/X cell died than did Ramos/GGT cells. The increase in the percentage of dead Ramos/X cells was noted within 3 h in cyst(e)ine-free medium and continued to increase thereafter (Fig.2 A). Approximately one-half of the spontaneous death of Ramos cells in cyst(e)ine-free medium was apoptotic as measured by the appearance of hypodiploid nuclei, and the remainder was a result of necrosis. Despite the marked differences in the spontaneous death of Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells, there was a comparable percentage decline in intracellular GSH levels when Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells were cultured in cysteine-free medium (Fig.2 B). At all time points examined, Ramos/X manifested both a greater percentage of dead cells and a higher level of cellular GSH in the residual live cells. However, intracellular ROS were significantly greater in the live Ramos/X cells relative to the Ramos/GGT (Fig.2 C). The rapid rise in relative levels of ROS in the live cells appeared to precede the marked increase in the percentage of dead cells that appeared in both Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT with longer incubations. These results suggest that relative levels of ROS and cell death may be controlled by the expression of GGT in Ramos cells, whereas cellular levels of GSH are not. Acivicin, an irreversible inhibitor of GGT activity was used to confirm that expression of GGT determined the differences in cell death. This compound also inhibits other enzymes that utilize glutamine as a substrate, such as those involved in nucleoside biosynthesis (25Jayaram H.N. Cooney D.A. Ryan J.A. Neil G. Dion R.L. Bono V.H. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1975; 59: 481-491PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it can contribute to the background level of cell death (26Graber R. Losa G.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As seen in Table II, the addition of 50 μm GSH to Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells cultured in cyst(e)ine-free, GSH-free medium was able to prevent cell death in 20–40% of the Ramos/X cells and 50–70% of the Ramos/GGT cells. The ability of GSH to prevent death of Ramos/GGT cells was inhibited by acivicin. The effect of acivicin on Ramos/X cells was variable, and in some experiments, it caused a small increase in cell death in the Ramos/X culture, consistent with its pleiotropic effects. Therefore, the effects of acivicin confirm that the expression of GGT seen in the Ramos/GGT cells helps to protect them from oxidation-induced cell death by the metabolism of GSH.Table IIThe effect of the GGT inhibitor acivicin on oxidation-induced cell deathRamos/XRamos/GGT%%Experiment 1: Medium alone9898 + 50 μm GSH7848 + 10 μm acivicin9898 + 50 μmGSH and 10 μm acivicin7361Experiment 2: Medium alone9899 + 50 μmGSH6427 + 10 μm acivicin9898 + 50 μm GSH and 10 μmacivicin7445Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in cyst(e)ine-free, GSH-free medium alone or with 50 μm GSH, 10 μm acivicin, or both. Each experiment represents the analysis of a single culture for each condition. The values represent the percentages of dead cells in each culture as determined by uptake of propidium iodide. Open table in a new tab Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in cyst(e)ine-free, GSH-free medium alone or with 50 μm GSH, 10 μm acivicin, or both. Each experiment represents the analysis of a single culture for each condition. The values represent the percentages of dead cells in each culture as determined by uptake of propidium iodide. Extracellular GSH is cleaved by GGT producing glutamate and the dipeptide, cysteinylglycine, which is subsequently hydrolyzed by an extracellular membrane-bound dipeptidase (27Curthoys N.P. Huhey R.P. Enzyme. 1979; 24: 383-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cysteine that is produced can be taken up by cells in either its reduced or oxidized form (2Lieberman M.W. Barrios R. Carter B.Z. Habib G.M. Lebovitz R.M. Rajagopalan S. Sepulveda A.R. Shi Z.Z. Wan D.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1175-1185PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this pathway was involved in the GGT-dependent protection of cells from oxidative stress, Ramos/GGT cells were cultured in cyst(e)ine-free medium containing homocysteic acid, an xc− system competitor, and alanine, an ASC system competitor (23Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), to inhibit uptake of cystine and cysteine, respectively (Fig.3). The survival advantage manifested by Ramos/GGT was blocked by the combination of both compounds. Under these experimental conditions, the blockade of cyst(e)ine uptake causes an increase in the intracellular ROS of both Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells (p < 0.001, Student's t test). This suggests that the activity of GGT as well as the capacity to take up cyst(e)ine were critical determinants in the survival advantage of Ramos/GGT cells. These results complement similar studies documenting a GGT-dependent accumulation of [35S]cysteine derived from radiolabeled extracellular GSH in mouse hepatoma cells (9Hanigan M.H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Survival of the two Ramos transfectants in cyst(e)ine-free, GSH-free medium was dependent on GSH released from the cells and metabolized by GGT. To analyze the metabolic steps involved in cell survival, different sulfhydryl-containing compounds were tested. Death of both Ramos/X and Ramos/GGT cells was nearly 100% after culture in cyst(e)ine-free GSH-free medium for 24 h (Fig.4). The addition of 10 μmGSH protected Ramos/GGT cells from death but did not affect the survival of Ramos/X cells. Higher concentrations of GSH protected both cell lines, although the degree of survival of Ramos/GGT was greater than Ramos/X at all concentrations of GSH tested. The mechanism by which Ramos/X is protected from cell death by GSH is not known. The GGT assay can detect activity down to 10 milliunits/ml, and no activity was seen when either the Ramos/X cells or the fetal calf serum used to culture them were tested. One possible explanation is the possible presence of the enzyme, GGT-rel (3Heisterkamp N. Rajpert-De Meyts E. Uribe"

Two types of fatty acid synthase architectures exist in nature, and the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety operates quite differently in each type. The type I, or associated system, found in metazoans, consists of a single large polypeptide containing multiple active centers. In this system, the prosthetic group with its attached nascent fatty acid swings between the active sites in the multifunctional complex. This contrasts with the type II or dissociated system found in bacteria and plants in which the active centers reside in discrete protein molecules. Here, the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety is covalently attached to acyl carrier protein (ACP),1 a small protein that sequentially delivers the lipid intermediates to the active site of each enzyme in the pathway.ACP is a small, acidic and highly conserved protein with a molecular mass of 8847 Da (1Cronan Jr., J.E.

However, analysis of the primary structures of these enzymes does not reveal a common ACP-binding motif. The interaction must be specific to enable the prosthetic group to deliver its cargo precisely to the active site, but it must also be relatively weak to allow rapid on and off rates for the substrates. It is also anticipated that conformational changes facilitate the entry and exit of the extended prosthetic group from the active site. Biophysical (18Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J.

However, crystal structures reveal that the active sites of the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes are generally located at the bottom of hydrophobic clefts or tunnels with varying dimensions (for two examples, see Refs. 21Leesong M.

The active site is at the base of a 20-Å-deep tunnel, and a bound CoA molecule in the crystal structure reveals that the interactions with the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety are mainly hydrophobic in character.

Using this approach, we have identified specific surface features on both proteins that are critical to their interaction and propose a model by which ACP can deliver and extract substrates from FabH and other fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group is a central and universal feature in the mechanism of fatty acid biosynthesis that provides two crucial functionalities to the process: a long and flexible arm that can reach into active sites and a terminal sulfhydryl group for the attachment of acyl groups through a thioester linkage. Two types of fatty acid synthase architectures exist in nature, and the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety operates quite differently in each type. The type I, or associated system, found in metazoans, consists of a single large polypeptide containing multiple active centers. In this system, the prosthetic group with its attached nascent fatty acid swings between the active sites in the multifunctional complex. This contrasts with the type II or dissociated system found in bacteria and plants in which the active centers reside in discrete protein molecules. Here, the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety is covalently attached to acyl carrier protein (ACP),1 a small protein that sequentially delivers the lipid intermediates to the active site of each enzyme in the pathway. ACP is a small, acidic and highly conserved protein with a molecular mass of 8847 Da (1Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B.

In Escherichia coli, it is encoded by the acpP gene that is located within a cluster of other fatty acid biosynthetic genes (2Rawlings M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) show that the protein is an asymmetric monomer composed of three α-helices packed into a bundle with an extended and flexible loop at one end (6Holak T.A.

Genet. 1991; 8: 377-385Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The fatty acid intermediates are attached to the terminal sulfhydryl of the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, which in turn, is covalently attached to serine 36 via a phosphodiester linkage (8Vanaman T.C. Wakil S.J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6420-6431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to fatty acid biosynthesis, ACP also supplies acyl groups for the synthesis of a variety of bacterial biomolecules, including glycerolipids (9Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the involvement of ACP in these various synthetic pathways means that it must interact with a plethora of functionally different enzymes. However, analysis of the primary structures of these enzymes does not reveal a common ACP-binding motif. The interaction must be specific to enable the prosthetic group to deliver its cargo precisely to the active site, but it must also be relatively weak to allow rapid on and off rates for the substrates. It is also anticipated that conformational changes facilitate the entry and exit of the extended prosthetic group from the active site. Biophysical (18Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J.

However, crystal structures reveal that the active sites of the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes are generally located at the bottom of hydrophobic clefts or tunnels with varying dimensions (for two examples, see Refs. 21Leesong M.

Therefore, the fatty acid intermediate must dissociate from ACP and be injected into the active site cavity. The physicochemical and structural basis of these interactions is not known. β-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) is a condensing enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the elongation of fatty acids. Its two substrates, acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP, bind sequentially in a ping-pong enzyme mechanism to produce acetoacetyl-ACP (23Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

The active site is at the base of a 20-Å-deep tunnel, and a bound CoA molecule in the crystal structure reveals that the interactions with the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety are mainly hydrophobic in character. The weak interaction between FabH and ACP thioesters (ca. 5 μm) (27Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

For this reason, experiments were performed to determine whether α-Syn could be phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) in human cells. Indeed, α-Syn is phosphorylated within 2 min of pervanadate treatment in α-Syn-transfected cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurs primarily on tyrosine 125 and was inhibited by PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) family members at concentrations consistent with inhibition of Src function (4Hanke J.H.

The α-Syn gene was cloned and found to code for a protein containing 140 amino acids (5Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl.

Subsequently, mutations in α-Syn have been identified in families with autosomal dominant Parkinson's Disease (6Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H.

Additionally, in patients with sporadic PD, α-Syn immunoreactivity is detected in Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of PD (8Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar). Although, α-Syn is linked to the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, its role in the pathogenesis of these diseases is unknown. The recent observation that both mice and flies expressing a human α-Syn transgene recapitulate some characteristics of PD suggests that α-Syn could be involved directly in the development of this disease (9Feany M.B.

Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Among the three members of the Syn gene family (α, β, γ) α-Syn is the best characterized. It is most highly expressed in presynaptic neurons of the brain with greater abundance in areas of the hippocampus and cortex (3Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 11Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Iwai A.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). α-Syn is a small acidic protein containing three discernable regions: an amino-terminal amphipathic repeat region, which can form α-helices; a hydrophobic center region found in amyloid plaques; and an acidic carboxyl-terminal region. In solution, α-Syn takes on a natively unfolded confirmation; however, in the presence of small vesicles composed of acidic phospholipids it forms an α-helical structure. This structure is consistent with its observed binding to synaptic vesicles in vivo (13Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 14Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to be important in regulating synaptic function and plasticity (15Gurd J.W. Neurochem.

Although α-Syn was shown recently to be phosphorylated on serine, it has not been determined whether α-Syn is also phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (1Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S.

The possibility that α-Syn might be phosphorylated on tyrosine(s) was initially hypothesized primarily because of the conservation of the four tyrosine residues among α-Syn orthologs (3Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved nature of the tyrosine residues in α-Syn, at least one of these residues contains flanking sequences that share homology with established tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Given the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of many cellular processes, we examined whether α-Syn is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T, gift of Dr. David Baltimore, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using CaPO4(Stratagene) with α-Syn, FynT, Rlk-GFP, and wild-type and mutant c-Src (K295M) expression vectors (17Debnath J. Chamorro M. Czar M.J. Schaeffer E.M. Lenardo M.J.

HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) stably transfected with human α-Syn were obtained from Dr. Virginia Lee (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and cultured as above. PP2 was obtained from Calbiochem. α-Syn was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using human lymphoblastoid cell DNA. 2R. L. Nussbaum, unpublished data. PCR mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Amino-terminal FLAG-tagged α-Syn was constructed by PCR using the primer sequences GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGATGTATTCA (5′) and CCGCTCGAGGGCTTCAGGTTCGTAGTCTTGATA (3′) (Life Technologies, Inc.) by standard methods, and was ligated into pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequenced on both strands by Seqwright (Houston, TX). Human α-Syn was subcloned into pBlueBacHis vector, and virus production and expression in SF9 cells were performed as described (Invitrogen). The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1× protease mixture (Sigma), and the lysate was boiled for 10 min. The cleared lysate was bound to Talon resin (CLONTECH), and α-Syn was eluted with 1 m imidazole. α-Syn-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 100 mm NaCl and stored at −80 °C. Transiently transfected HEK293T cells and stably transfected HEK293 cells were harvested in CHAPS lysis buffer (0.5% CHAPS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× Protease mixture) or RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.3 mm sodium orthovanadate), snap frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −80 °C. Protein was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. FLAG-α-Syn was isolated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma), whereas untagged α-Syn was isolated using a monoclonal antibody (202) cross-linked to protein A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using dimethylpimelimidate (ICN) as the cross-linking agent (19Harlow E.

Immunoprecipitants were boiled 5 min in SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Total lysates were boiled in SDS loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Tris-Glycine, Novex), transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), immunoblotted using PY20 (Transduction Laboratories) (1:1500), Synuclein-1 (Transduction Laboratories) (1:5000), 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.)

Membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 for PY20, 4G10, and SRC2 immunoblots, and 5% nonfat milk/phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 for GFP, Synuclein-1, and FLAG immunoblots. Laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) was performed on multiple exposures from at least three experiments and analyzed using NIH Image software. HEK293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-α-Syn were labeled with H332PO4 (ICN) in phosphate-free DMEM medium for 4 h. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and autoradiography was performed.32P-labeled FLAG-α-Syn was excised from the membrane, hydrolyzed in HCL, and phosphoamino acids were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously (21Meisenhelder J. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 57: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were detected using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, model 425E). Kinase assays were performed using 250 ng of denatured rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) or 500 ng of baculovirus purified His-α-Syn as substrates (22Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Substrates were incubated with 0.5 or 2 units of p59fyn or p60c-src (Upstate Biotechnology) in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4 and 5 mmMnCl2 containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 25 °C for 7 min. Kinase reactions were terminated by addition of SDS loading buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (10–20%), and exposed to film. According to the manufacturer, the c-Src and Fyn preparations do not contain contaminating kinases. To determine whether α-Syn can be phosphorylated on tyrosine in a human cell line, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor pervanadate was utilized. Pervanadate, a complex of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide, is a competitive inhibitor of PTPs that works by irreversible oxidation and functions on intact cells because of its cell permeability (23Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated α-Syn from either pervanadate-treated transiently transfected HEK293T cells (Fig.1 A) or stably transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 C) expressing human α-Syn was separated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. Western analysis was then performed with either PY20, a phosphotyrosine specific antibody, or Synuclein-1 antibody, which specifically recognizes α-Syn (Fig. 1, A and C). 3C. E. Ellis, D. E. Cobin, and R. L. Nussbaum, unpublished observations. As illustrated in Fig. 1, A and C, α-Syn is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within 2 min of pervanadate treatment and increases incrementally over 20 min. Cells treated with sodium orthovanadate or hydrogen peroxide alone resulted in no change in α-Syn phosphorylation (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylated serine but not threonine residues were also observed, confirming the results reported previously (1Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, α-Syn is phosphorylated on tyrosine in both a time- and dose-dependent manner following inhibition of PTPs by pervanadate (Fig. 1, A and C, data not shown). To map the phosphorylated tyrosine residue(s), mutants were constructed by exchanging one or more of four tyrosine residues in α-Syn with either a phenylalanine or a stop codon (Fig.2). These mutant constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells and treated for 20 min with pervanadate. Western analysis performed on immunoprecipitated α-Syn, using PY20 and 4G10 phosphotyrosine specific antibodies or Synuclein-1 antibody, indicates that the Y125F mutant construct is the only single tyrosine mutation that results in a significant effect, reducing tyrosine phosphorylation to ∼5% of the wild-type control (Fig.3). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the other single tyrosine mutation constructs was not significantly different from the wild-type construct. Phosphorylation of the Y133F mutant construct appeared to be greater than the wild-type; however, this difference was not statistically significant (Student's t test). Interestingly, the Y133/136F double mutation resulted in an ∼75% reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn. Because neither single mutation alone results in a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation, a possible explanation for this decrease is that this double mutation disrupts the interaction of α-Syn with a protein involved in phosphorylating tyrosine 125. Longer exposures reveal a very low level of phosphorylation of tyrosines 39, 133, and 136, but no phosphorylation in untransfected control cells or in Y39F/Y125stop-transfected cells, which do not contain any tyrosine residues. These data suggest that the majority of tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn in pervanadate-treated HEK293T cells occurs on tyrosine 125.Figure 3α-Syn is phosphorylated primarily on tyrosine 125 in pervanadate-treated human HEK293T cells. A, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with various FLAG-α-Syn constructs or empty vector (control lane) and treated with pervanadate for 20 min. Cells were harvested, α-Syn isolated, and Western analysis was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 except that instead of using duplicate membranes for normalization, the membranes were consecutively stripped and reprobed with 4G10 and Synuclein-1 antibodies respectively, following immunoblotting with the PY20 antibody.B, values for each mutant construct were semi-quantitatively determined by normalizing the optical density values obtained by laser densitometry from immunoblots using PY20 antibody compared with values obtained using Synuclein-1 antibody. The mean values for each mutant construct, determined from multiple film exposures and from at least three separate experiments, are plotted as a percentage of the value obtained for the wild-type construct (± S.E., B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effects of the PD mutations on the tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn, mutant constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells and compared with the wild-type construct. Tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type α-Syn in pervanadate-treated cells does not differ significantly from that of cells transfected with PD mutation constructs (A30P and A53T, data not shown). Additionally, the effect of mutating serines at positions 87 and 129 to alanine on tyrosine phosphorylation was determined, because these serines were shown previously to be phosphorylated (1Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serines 87 and 129 is not necessary for phosphorylation of tyrosine 125 under the conditions tested (data not shown). To help elucidate the PTK(s) that may be involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation observed with pervanadate, PP2, a selective inhibitor of the Src family of PTKs, was incubated with the cells as indicated in Fig. 4 (4Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Western analysis revealed that these cells do express Src family members (data not shown). Wild-type α-Syn was transfected into HEK293T cells and pretreated with various concentrations of PP2 or a Me2SO-vehicle control for 1 h prior to treatment with pervanadate. Western analysis was then performed on immunoprecipitated α-Syn using the PY20 and Synuclein-1 antibodies, and mean values for each PP2 treatment group were plotted as a percentage of the vehicle-treated control (Fig.4). PP2 inhibits the pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn with an EC50 of ∼1 μm, a concentration reported to inhibit effectively the function of Src family PTKs in human T-cells, suggesting that Src family PTKs are able to phosphorylate α-Syn expressed in HEK293T cells (4Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). To determine more directly whether Src family members can phosphorylate α-Syn in these cells, cotransfection experiments were performed utilizing c-Src and Fyn expression vectors as depicted in Fig.5 A. Additionally, a mutant c-Src (K295M), which inactivates the kinase by disrupting its phosphotransfer activity, and Rlk, a nonreceptor PTK whose expression is limited to T-cells and mast cells, were utilized as controls (24Snyder M.A. Bishop J.M. McGrath J.P. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Hu Q. Davidson D. Schwartzberg P.L. Macchiarini F. Lenardo M.J. Bluestone J.A. Matis L.A.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 245-251PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type (Fig. 5 A) and various mutant α-Syn constructs (Fig. 5 B) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells along with the PTK expression constructs. Western analysis was then performed on immunoprecipitated α-Syn using the PY20 and FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5, A, panels 1 and2; B), or on total lysates using SRC2 and GFP antibodies (Fig. 5A, panels 3 and 4). As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, c-Src and Fyn, but not the mutant c-Src (K295M) or Rlk·GFP, cotransfected with FLAG-α-Syn results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn. Western analysis of total lysates confirmed not only that c-Src, Fyn, and Rlk·GFP are expressed, but also that these PTKs are active in these cells, because large increases in tyrosine phosphorylation is observed in cells transfected with these PTKs compared with untransfected and mutant c-Src (K295M)-transfected cells (data not shown). Although Rlk is active in these cells, it does not phosphorylate α-Syn under these conditions, indicating that not all cotransfected PTKs are capable of phosphorylating α-Syn. As observed in Fig. 3 with pervanadate, c-Src cotransfected with the Y125F α-Syn mutant construct also results in a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with the wild-type construct, whereas other single amino acid changes do not differ significantly (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that tyrosine 125 is also the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in c-Src-cotransfected cells. Src family PTKs could be phosphorylating α-Syn directly, or indirectly by acting through Src-activated pathways involving other kinase(s). To help distinguish between these two possibilities, in vitro kinase assays using purified c-Src, Fyn, and α-Syn were performed. α-Syn (250 or 500 ng) was incubated with 0.4 or 2 units of p59fyn or p60c-src in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. Enolase (250 ng) was used as a positive control, because it is a substrate for c-Src and Fyn (22Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 27Kypta R.M. Hemming A. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed. Results using 2 units of kinase and 500 ng of α-Syn are shown in Fig. 5 C. α-Syn was phosphorylated in vitro by both Fyn (panel 1) and c-Src (panel 2), whereas no phosphorylation was observed in experiments where α-Syn was incubated without PTKs or if bovine serum albumin was provided as a substrate (data not shown). Fyn and c-Src could also phosphorylate α-Syn at lower concentrations of kinase (0.4 units) and substrate (250 ng) than those shown in Fig. 5 C(data not shown). To compare the relative ability of Fyn and c-Src to phosphorylate α-Syn, the ratio of the α-Syn signal versus the enolase signal for each kinase was compared. The ability of Fyn and c-Src to phosphorylate enolase under the conditions tested was approximately the same per unit of kinase, although not readily apparent because different exposure times are shown in panels 1 and2 in Fig. 5 C. Relative to enolase, Fyn phosphorylated α-Syn ∼120 times better than c-Src as determined by laser densitometry of multiple exposures. It is of great interest to determine the specific function(s) of α-Syn because of its potential importance in the pathogenesis of PD. Studying post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can be very useful in gaining insight into protein function. α-Syn is phosphorylated on serine residues; however, tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn had not been established (1Okochi M.

Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A protein alignment of α-, β-, and γ-Syns revealed that all four of the tyrosine residues of α-Syn, located at positions 39, 125, 133, and 136, are conserved in all identified orthologs and β-Syn paralogs, whereas only the tyrosine at position 39 is conserved in γ-Syn, suggesting that these residues may be functionally important (3Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The data presented in this manuscript indicate that α-Syn is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to pervanadate inhibition of PTPs. This tyrosine phosphorylation occurs primarily on tyrosine 125 and is inhibited by PP2, implicating the involvement of the Src family of PTKs. Additionally, specific members of the Src family of PTKs, c-Src and Fyn, phosphorylate α-Syn directly in cotransfection experiments and in in vitro kinase assays using purified kinases. The data indicate that α-Syn can be phosphorylated by the Src family of PTKs and suggest that α-Syn is a possible substrate for Src family members in the brain; although, additional experiments are necessary to determine the PTK(s) that phosphorylate α-Syn in vivo. Sequences flanking tyrosine 125, as depicted in Fig. 2, closely resemble those of the optimal substrate sequences for PTKs determined using an oriented peptide library technique (28Cantley L.C. Songyang Z. Adv. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1997; 31: 41-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, this tyrosine 125 site (DNEAYEMP) is similar to the c-Src optimal substrate sequence which was determined to be DEEIY(G/E)EF. The amino acids flanking tyrosine 125 at positions −4, −2, and +1 are identical to this optimal substrate sequence, whereas the alanine at position −1 is similar to the isoleucine in the ideal sequence in that they are both hydrophobic residues. Although the methionine and proline residues at positions +2 and +3, relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine, are not optimal substrate residues for c-Src phosphorylation, they are optimal residues for phosphorylation by other PTKs (28Cantley L.C. Songyang Z. Adv. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1997; 31: 41-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the tyrosine 125 site is consistent with optimal substrate sequences of PTKs including c-Src. It is difficult to speculate on the functional consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn, because its normal function has not been elucidated definitively. α-Syn is primarily a soluble protein expressed in presynaptic neurons, but is also loosely associated with synaptic vesicles (29Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). α-Syn is also implicated in regulating a form of dopamine plasticity in an α-Syn knockout mouse model, and maintenance of the distal pool of synaptic vesicles in primary hippocampal cultures (30Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Covalent modification, such as phosphorylation, is a likely candidate for regulation of α-Syn at the synapse and could be important in modulating its function. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in synaptic vesicles and is important for regulating synaptic function in the brain (15Gurd J.W. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Pang D.T. Wang J.K. Valtorta F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to block long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the squid giant synapse modulates synaptic transmission by increasing calcium currents, both implicating PTKs in synaptic plasticity (16O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant S.G. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 33Llinas R. Moreno H. Sugimori M. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fyn and c-Src are also thought to be involved in spatial learning and synaptic plasticity (34Salter M.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R.

A. 2000; 97: 8098-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, Fyn knockout mice exhibit an impairment in memory and learning, which is thought to be caused by alterations in long-term potentiation (35Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The Src family of nonreceptor PTKs is expressed ubiquitously with increased expression in neurons and hematopoietic cells (37Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). The possibility that members of the Src family of PTK(s) may be involved in the modification of α-Syn is intriguing because of overlap in brain region specific expression and subcellular localization between c-Src and α-Syn. Both proteins are expressed highly in the brain and also have overlapping expression in various regions, for example, in the hippocampus (3Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 11Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36Zhao W. Cavallaro S. Gusev P. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8098-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subcellularly, both of these proteins are loosely associated with synaptic vesicles in presynaptic neurons (12Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar,38Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). c-Src has also been shown to be active at the synapse by phosphorylating synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin and synaptogyrin (38Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). The apparent 120-fold-increased phosphorylation of α-Syn by Fynversus c-Src, relative to enolase, raises two interesting possibilities that could account for this increase (Fig.5 C). The first is that α-Syn is a more preferred substrate for Fyn than for c-Src. The second is that some enhancing factor is copurifying with Fyn because it was purified by sequential chromatography from a membrane fraction of bovine thymus, whereas recombinant human c-Src was purified from baculovirus. We believe that the latter explanation is more likely because no significant difference in the relative amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of α-Syn exists in cotransfection experiments comparing c-Src and Fyn despite similar protein expression (Fig. 5 A, panels 1–3). This hypothesized factor enhances greatly the in vitro activity of Fyn for α-Syn, but not enolase, and therefore is specific for α-Syn. To prove this hypothesis Fyn and c-Src must be isolated by an equivalent means, allowing for direct comparison and ultimately one must isolate and identify this “enhancing factor”. Although the functional consequences of phosphorylation of the tyrosine 125 residue of α-Syn remain to be elucidated, it could regulate its ability to bind synaptic vesicles and/or be important in regulating protein/protein interactions. It has been reported that phosphorylation of the serine 129 residue of α-Syn results in a reduction in binding to phospholipid containing liposomes (2Pronin A.N. Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Additionally, phosphorylation regulates the association of the synaptic vesicle protein, Synapsin I to synaptic vesicles (39Hosaka M. Hammer R.E. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation may allow for the dynamic regulation of α-Syn binding to synaptic vesicles. Interestingly, Synapsin I has also been shown to interact with c-Src and reportedly increases c-Src tyrosine kinase activity (40Onofri F. Giovedi S. Vaccaro P. Czernik A.J. Valtorta F. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Benfenati F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12168-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, the microtubule-associated protein Tau was identified as a binding partner of α-Syn (41Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Hojrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Colocalization of Tau and α-Syn was also demonstrated in axons. Tau associates with the C-terminal region (residues 89–140) of α-Syn, through its microtubule binding domain. Jensen and co-workers (41Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Hojrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) hypothesized that this interaction between α-Syn and Tau could link synaptic vesicles with microtubules. Tau has also been shown to both colocalize and interact directly with the Src PTK family member, Fyn (42Lee G. Newman S.T. Gard D.L. Band H. Panchamoorthy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3167-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypothetically, Tau could bring Src PTK family members, such as Fyn, into close proximity to α-Syn, thereby enhancing the activity of these kinases for α-Syn. It is also conceivable that the association of α-Syn and Tau could be regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 125, and that in certain populations of synaptic vesicles could regulate their attachment to microtubules. This could allow α-Syn to bind and release Tau in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and thereby contribute to the maintenance of the distal pool of synaptic vesicles. We thank Drs. Virginia Lee and Susan Reuter for the HEK293 cells stably transfected with human α-Syn and Drs. Melanie Hartsough, Nelson Cole, and Michael Czar for helpful discussions."

By using a peptide inhibition assay, we have defined the minimal “core” LXXLL motif as an 8-amino acid sequence spanning positions −2 to +6 relative to the primary conserved leucine residue. In yeast two-hybrid assays, core LXXLL motif sequences derived from steroid receptor co-activator (SRC1), the 140-kDa receptor interacting protein (RIP140), and CREB-binding protein (CBP) displayed differences in selectivity and affinity for nuclear receptor ligand binding domains. Although core LXXLL motifs from SRC1 and RIP140 mediated strong interactions with steroid and retinoid receptors, three LXXLL motifs present in the global co-activator CBP were found to have very weak affinity for these proteins. Core motifs with high affinity for steroid and retinoid receptors were generally found to contain a hydrophobic residue at position −1 relative to the first conserved leucine and a nonhydrophobic residue at position +2. Our results indicate that variant residues in LXXLL core motifs influence the affinity and selectivity of co-activators for nuclear receptors.

Our results indicate that variant residues in LXXLL core motifs influence the affinity and selectivity of co-activators for nuclear receptors. Ligand-dependent gene expression mediated by nuclear receptors involves the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators to the ligand binding domain (LBD).1 The LBD is structurally conserved among the NR family and consists of between 10 and 12 α-helices folded in a globular domain (1Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). A central hydrophobic pocket accommodates the cognate ligand, which upon binding induces a conformational change in the LBD, exposing a co-activator docking site on the LBD surface. Sequence conservation, mutational analyses, and crystal structures have indicated that the co-activator docking site is made up of residues from helices 3, 5, and 12, which form a hydrophobic channel conserved among the NR family members. The integrity of this surface is essential for co-activator binding and as a consequence the transactivation function (AF-2) of the LBD (reviewed in Ref. 2Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that a short α-helical sequence, the LXXLL motif, is necessary and sufficient for mediating the interaction of the co-activators RIP140, SRC1 and CBP/p300 with NRs (3Heery D.M.

In addition, the SRC1a isoform has an additional LXXLL motif at its C terminus (16Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The 140-kDa protein RIP140 contains nine functional LXXLL motifs that show variable affinity for the LBD of ERα (3Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). We have also shown that CBP (and its paralog p300) contains two conserved LXXLL motifs near the N terminus of the protein, which account for its weak interaction with ER and RAR (3Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Some nuclear receptor-binding proteins such as NR-binding SET domain-containing protein contain variant motifs such as FXXLL (18Huang N. vom Baur E. Garnier J.M. Lerouge T. Vonesch J.L. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3398-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, a leucine-rich helix (LXX(I/H)IXXX(I/L)) termed the co-repressor of nuclear receptor box mediates the binding of the silencing mediator of the co-repressors for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCOR) proteins to the unliganded forms of NRs (19Hu X.

A similar arrangement was observed in the crystal structures of the liganded TRβ and ERα LBDs complexed with a peptide corresponding to motif 2 of GRIP1 (6Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W.

The three conserved leucines were found to align on the face of the α-helix which packs against the hydrophobic channel on the LBD surface. Two charged residues that are highly conserved among LBDs (a glutamic acid in helix 12 and a lysine residue in helix 3) and that are especially critical for AF-2 function appear to act as a charge clamp to hold the LXXLL α-helix in position (22Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobbs J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Wilson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). In all three structures, both AF-2 surfaces in the LBD homodimer were occupied with one LXXLL α-helix. The PPARγ/SRC1 NID structure indicates that, as a consequence of having multiple LXXLL motifs, a single p160 co-activator protein can contact both AF-2 surfaces in NR dimers. Consistent with this, we and others (5Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 16Kalkhoven E.

Similarly, the co-activator TRAP220/DRIP205, which was isolated on the basis of interaction with class II receptors TR and VDR, contains two functional LXXLL motifs (NR-1 and NR-2), which have been shown to make selective contacts with VDR and RXR in the VDR/RXR heterodimer (10Rachez C. Gamble M. Chang C.P. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2718-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5433-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A strong interaction was identified between NR-2 and VDR, whereas a weaker interaction was observed between the NR-1 motif and RXR. In contrast, other putative co-activators appear to contain a single functional LXXLL motif, e.g.TIF1 (4Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and ASC-2/RAP250/NRC (13Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M.

Thus, the number and sequence of LXXLL core motifs, and possibly flanking sequences, will influence the selectivity and affinity of co-activators for different NRs.In this study we have defined the minimal or core LXXLL sequence capable of binding to NRs. By comparing the interactions of LXXLL core motifs derived from three different co-activators with a panel of NR LBDs, we have identified elements of the LXXLL core sequence that influence the affinity and selectivity of co-activators for NRs.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have defined the core LXXLL motif as eight amino acids, requiring two residues N-terminal to the first conserved leucine (+1) and at least one residue C-terminal to the 3rd conserved leucine (+5) (Fig. 6). Consistent with this, it has been previously observed that peptides of 13 and 14 amino acids in length encompassing motif 2 of GRIP1 strongly compete the interaction of the GRIP1 NID with the TRβ LBD, whereas the hexapeptide LLRYLL did not (6Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the LBD of TRβ in complex with a synthetic peptide corresponding to motif 2 of GRIP1 showed that the peptide adopts an amphipathic α-helix conformation of nearly 3 turns from Lys-688 to Gln-695. Residues outside this sequence were unstructured or in an extended coil conformation. In contrast, the peptide in solution was found to be in a random coil formation, thus α-helicity appears to be induced by the interaction with the TRβ LBD. The α-helical structure in motif 2 induced by binding the TRβ LBD involves amino acids KILHRLLQ and correlates exactly with the boundaries −2 to +6 that we have defined as the minimum length of a LXXLL motif sufficient for binding to AF-2. In addition, in a phage display screen for peptides that bind to liganded ERα LBD, more than 30% of the isolated LXXLL sequences commenced at position −2. The shortest C-terminal boundary isolated in the same screen terminated at +7 (38Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C.Y. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Fowlkes D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the minimal NR binding module is an 8-amino acid α-helix.A number of studies have indicated that co-activators show differential but overlapping binding preferences for NRs. Although there are reports of interactions of fragments of CBP with steroid and retinoid receptors, we and others (51Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have found these interactions to be far weaker than the interaction of p160 proteins with steroid or retinoid receptors (Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 D). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments failed to show association of ERα and CBPin vivo, under conditions where the ERα/SRC1 and PPARγ/CBP association was readily observed (39Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 10: 1594-1604Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Similarly, others (17McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.-M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

In contrast interactions of CBP and PPARs seem to be more robust, although still considerably weaker than PPARγ/p160 interactions (39Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated that LXXLL core motifs derived from SRC1a, RIP140, and CBP show distinct preferences for steroid and retinoid receptors. By analysis of the core motif sequences, it is apparent that positions −1 and +2 (and perhaps +3) have a strong impact on the ability of core motifs to bind to different NR LBDs. We noted that the LXXLL motifs showing the strongest interactions with the panel of LBDs selected tended to have a hydrophobic residue at position −1 (Fig. 6). For example, motifs 2 and 3 of SRC1/TIF2/ACTR, and motif 4 of SRC1a, all of which display high affinity for ERα and other NRs, contain a leucine or isoleucine residue at the −1 position. In addition, in an affinity selection of randomized peptides that bind the LBD of ERα, ∼30% of LXXLL sequences selected contained a hydrophobic residue at −1 (38Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C.Y. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Fowlkes D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In another study using a “focused” peptide library, 12/17 sequences affinity selected with ERα LBD contained a leucine or isoleucine residue at the −1 position (46Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SRC1 motif 1 has a lysine residue at position −1. Although this does not appear to affect its interaction with ERα in our experiments, motif 1 displayed significantly reduced binding to RARα, RXRα, AR, and PR (Fig. 2). Consistent with this, it has been shown that a peptide based on motif 1 sequence was inferior to other SRC1 LXXLL motif peptides in competition of ERα/SRC1 interaction in vitro (47Mak H.Y. Hoare S. Henttu P.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).CBP has been reported to interact weakly with RAR and RXR via the N-terminal 400 amino acids (Fig. 5; see Refs. 31Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that deletion of the first 400 residues of CBP did not affect its ability to bind RAR (31Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This suggested that additional binding site(s) distal to the N terminus are present in CBP or that CBP interaction with NRs can be indirect. CBP contains three LXXLL motifs, and we have demonstrated here that these mediate weak ligand-dependent interactions of the N- and C-terminal fragments of CBP with steroid and retinoid receptors. None of the LXXLL sequences in CBP contain a hydrophobic residue at position −1. In a recent study of interaction of these sequences with the LBDs of PPARγ and RXRα, the CBP LXM-1 motif was shown to bind to PPARγ but not RXRα (45Shao G. Heyman R.A. Schulman I.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same authors reported that the replacement of the glutamine at −1 with leucine significantly increased the ability of CBP LXM-1 to bind RXRα. This is consistent with our finding that co-activators with high affinity for steroid and retinoid receptors generally contain LXXLL motifs with a hydrophobic residue at position −1. Thus, while we and others (40Li J. O'Malley B. Wong J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 48Kraus W.L. Manning E.T. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown CBP is required for the function of steroid and retinoid receptors, we propose that at least some NRs recruit CBP indirectly via the p160s.Although 8 of the 9 nine LXXLL motifs present RIP140 have a hydrophobic residue at position −1 (the exception being L4), not all demonstrate high affinity binding to the panel of LBDs tested. For example, we noted that motif L5 of RIP140 has very low affinity for NRs, despite satisfying the requirement in having a leucine at position −1 (Fig. 3). This may be due to the presence of a leucine residue at position +2, which is rare among the LXXLL motifs identified to date. The presence of a bulky hydrophobic side chain at this position may be detrimental to the formation of an amphipathic α-helix. However, there are examples of core motifs that tolerate a hydrophobic residue at +2, notably motif 1 of SRC1 which shows reduced affinity for NRs, and the functional LXXLL motif of human ASC-2/NRC/RAP250, which has a valine at position +2 (13Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H. Cheong J.H. Lee Y.C. Meltzer P.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

Further studies will be required to determine the repertoire of amino acids tolerated within core motif sequences.Structural studies have shown that lysine and glutamic acid residues in the LBD that are almost universally conserved among the NR family may act to clamp to the LXXLL α-helix at the AF-2 surface (6Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar,22Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B.

This involves contacts with residues outside the core motif. In addition, it has been shown that CBP can acetylate a lysine residue just upstream of motif 1 in ACTR and that this modification appears to reduce the binding of ACTR to NRs (49Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In addition, reports by several groups (47Mak H.Y. Hoare S. Henttu P.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 50Needham M. Raines S. McPheat J. Stacey C. Ellston J. Hoare S. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) indicate that sequences flanking the core motif affect the affinity and selectivity of co-activators for NRs. Thus, sequence flanking the core motif may also influence the interaction of co-activators with NRs. Understanding the determinants of LXXLL motif/LBD interactions will facilitate the design of peptides and other antagonists capable of disrupting specific NR/co-activator interactions. Ligand-dependent gene expression mediated by nuclear receptors involves the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators to the ligand binding domain (LBD).1 The LBD is structurally conserved among the NR family and consists of between 10 and 12 α-helices folded in a globular domain (1Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). A central hydrophobic pocket accommodates the cognate ligand, which upon binding induces a conformational change in the LBD, exposing a co-activator docking site on the LBD surface. Sequence conservation, mutational analyses, and crystal structures have indicated that the co-activator docking site is made up of residues from helices 3, 5, and 12, which form a hydrophobic channel conserved among the NR family members. The integrity of this surface is essential for co-activator binding and as a consequence the transactivation function (AF-2) of the LBD (reviewed in Ref. 2Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a short α-helical sequence, the LXXLL motif, is necessary and sufficient for mediating the interaction of the co-activators RIP140, SRC1 and CBP/p300 with NRs (3Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar).

Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, and p120GAP are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for p21Ras (Ras) and negatively regulate output by accelerating GTP hydrolysis on Ras. Neurofibromin and p120GAP differ markedly outside of their conserved GAP-related domains (GRDs), and it is therefore unknown if the respective GRDs contribute functional specificity. To address this question, we expressed the GRDs of neurofibromin and p120GAP in primary cells from Nf1 mutant mice in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that expression of neurofibromin GRD, but not the p120GAP GRD, restores normal growth and cytokine signaling in three lineages of primaryNf1-deficient cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Furthermore, utilizing a GAP-inactive mutant NF1 GRD identified in a family with NF1, we demonstrate that growth restoration is a function ofNF1 GRD GAP activity on p21Ras.

Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (1Brodeur G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 637-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Side L. Taylor B.

Med. 1997; 336: 1713-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and ∼10% of heterozygous Nf1 mutant mice also develop a JMML-like myeloproliferative disorder. JMML bone marrows and other NF1-associated tumors frequently show loss of constitutional heterozygosity at NF1 , consistent with its tumor suppressor function. Although neurofibromin is a large protein, the GRD is the only segment known to function in growth control. Like p120GAP, the GRD of neurofibromin binds Ras with high affinity and induces a 105-fold increase in the rate of GTP hydrolysis. The high degree of sequence homology within the catalytic domains of p120GAP and neurofibromin led to the hypothesis that these proteins may be functionally interchangeable (3Bollag G. McCormick F. Nature. 1992; 356: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, Nf1 andGap mutant mice have distinct phenotypes, and mutations in the human p120GAP catalytic domains are not associated with any disease state. Moreover, neurofibromin and p120GAP differ markedly in their non-GAP domains. p120GAP is a smaller protein that contains a number of modules common to signaling proteins including Src homology-2 and Src homology-3 and pleckstrin homology domains. None of these domains are present in neurofibromin. In fact, neurofibromin is most closely related to products of the yeast IRA1 andIRA2 genes, and its GRD can complement the heat shock phenotype of IRA mutant strains resulting from hyperactive Ras (4Ballester R. Marchuk D. Boguski M. Saulino A. Letcher R. Wigler M. Collins F. Cell. 1990; 63: 851-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar).Nf1-deficient hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts provide an excellent system for dissecting the role of neurofibromin in regulating cell growth, because efficient vectors for transducing genes into these cells are available. Furthermore, Ras signaling and cell growth can be assayed in these primary cell populations. A hallmark of both human JMML cells and of murine Nf1-deficient myeloid progenitor cells is a selective hypersensitivity of cultured CFU-GM progenitors to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (5Emanuel P. Bates L. Castleberry R. Gualtieri R. Zuckerman K. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1017-1024PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas homozygous Nf1 mutant (Nf1−/−) embryos die in utero, adoptive transfer ofNf1−/− fetal liver cells consistently induces a JMML-like myeloproliferative disorder in irradiated recipients (6Largaespada D.

PrimaryNf1−/− hematopoietic cells demonstrate constitutive activation of Ras-ERK signaling with hyperactivation in response to GM-CSF and other cytokines (7Zhang Y. Vik T. Ryder J. Srour E. Jacks T.

Similarly, mast cells and fibroblasts have a hyperproliferative phenotype in response to stem cell factor (SCF) (9Ingram D. Yang F. Travers J. Wenning M. Hiatt K. New S. Hood A. Shannon K. Williams D. Clapp D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10Atit R. Crowe M. Greenhalgh D. Wenstrup R. Ratner N. J. Invest.

Each retrovirus expressespac sequences that confer puromycin resistance. Recombinant GRD peptide expression was analyzed by immunoblotting utilizing an antibody specific to a KT3 epitope tag incorporated into both GRD peptides (13Martin G. Viskochil D. Bollag G. McCabe P. Crosier W. Haubruck H. Conroy L. Clark R. O'Conell P. Cawthon R. Innis M. McCormick F. Cell. 1990; 63: 843-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of transducedNf1−/− fibroblasts shows that NF1GRD and p120GAP GRD are expressed at similar levels in primary cells (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated GRD peptides had similar GAP activity stimulating equivalent phosphate release from GTP-loaded Ras (Fig. 1 C). Together these data demonstrate that recombinant NF1 and p120GAP GRD peptides are expressed at equivalent levels in fibroblasts and accelerate GTP hydrolysis on Ras.To examine whether expression of NF1 GRD and/or p120GAP GRD can correct the hypersensitivity of Nf1−/−myeloid progenitors to GM-CSF, CFU-GM colonies were enumerated in methylcellulose cultures of transduced Nf1−/−and wild type fetal liver cells. Colony growth was assayed over a range of GM-CSF concentrations in the presence of puromycin.Nf1−/− progenitors transduced with either the control virus or with the p120GAP GRD virus demonstrate a hypersensitive pattern of CFU-GM colony growth (Fig.2 A). Retroviral mediated expression of full-length p120GAP in Nf1−/−myeloid progenitors also failed to restore normal cytokine responsiveness (data not shown). In contrast,Nf1−/− myeloid progenitors expressingNF1 GRD displayed a normal pattern of CFU-GM colony growth in response to GM-CSF in six independent experiments. Similar data were observed when the proliferative rates of transducedNf1−/− fetal liver CFU-GM were analyzed following stimulation of c-Kit+ cells with saturating concentrations of SCF, a second cytokine known to induce hyperproliferation of Nf1-deficient progenitors (7Zhang Y.

Thus, expression of NF1 GRD alone is sufficient to correct the hyper-responsiveness and aberrant proliferation ofNf1-deficient myeloid cells.Figure 2In vitro proliferation of NF1 GRD-expressing cells.

MEFs isolated from Nf1−/− embryos exhibit increased proliferation in culture compared with wild type MEFs (18Brannan C. Perkins A. Vogel K. Ratner N. Nordlund M. Reid S. Buchberg A. Jenkins N. Parada L. Copeland N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar,19Rosenbaum T. Boissy Y. Kombrinck K. Brannan C. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Ratner N. Development. 1995; 121: 3583-3592PubMed Google Scholar). Triplicate cultures of transduced fibroblasts from individual embryos were established, and proliferation was assessed by thymidine incorporation 48 h later. Nf1-deficient MEFs transduced with the control virus or with the p120GAP GRD virus demonstrated a 4-fold higher rate of thymidine incorporation compared with wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, expression of recombinant NF1 GRD restored the rate of DNA synthesis inNf1-deficient MEFs to wild type levels. Similar data were observed when proliferation was evaluated by cell counting (data not shown). Therefore, these data confirm the specificity of the NF1 GRD to reduce the hyperproliferation of another primary cell type.Studies of leukemic cells from children with NF1 and murineNf1−/− hematopoietic cells have shown elevated levels of GTP-bound Ras and hyperactivation of ERK in response to hematopoietic cytokines (6Largaespada D. Brannan C. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y. Vik T. Ryder J. Srour E. Jacks T. Shannon K. Clapp D. J. Exp.

Genet. 1996; 12: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of GRD sequences could reduce ERK activity to wild type levels inNf1−/− hematopoietic cells,Nf1−/− c-Kit+ cells were transduced with the respective retroviruses, selected in puromycin, and assayed for ERK kinase activity in response to GM-CSF. Nf1-deficient cells transduced with the control virus or with the p120GAP GRD virus had markedly elevated ERK activity in response to GM-CSF compared with wild type c-Kit+ cells (Fig.3 A). In contrast, ERK activation in GM-CSF-stimulated Nf1−/− cells transduced with the NF1 GRD-encoding vector was comparable to wild type cells. A similar pattern of ERK activation was observed when MEFs transduced with the respective retroviruses were stimulated with EGF (Fig. 3 B). These biochemical data inNf1-deficient hematopoietic progenitors and fibroblasts show that expression of NF1 GRD selectively reduces hyperactive Ras-ERK signaling previously shown to be important in mitogenesis. In addition, we have observed that NF1 GRD but notp120GAP GRD corrects hyperactivation of Akt, a downstream effector of the Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (data not shown). Collectively, these biochemical observations are consistent with the correction of the hyperproliferative phenotype seen in cell culture assays.Figure 3ERK2 activity in c-Kit+ myeloid cells and MEFs.

We have recently demonstrated that bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) generated from Nf1+/−mice exhibit increased proliferation to SCF (9Ingram D. Yang F. Travers J. Wenning M. Hiatt K. New S. Hood A. Shannon K. Williams D. Clapp D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have now observed that Nf1−/− mast cells derived from fetal livers also have increased proliferation in response to SCF compared with wild type mast cells or Nf1−/−mast cells expressing NF1 GRD (data not shown). Given these observations, we next utilized a mast cell “knock-in” model to evaluate the effects of transgene expression in vivo (21Rodewald H. Dessing M. Dvorak A. Galli S. Science. 1996; 271: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).W/W v mice are mast cell-deficient secondary to a mutation in the c-kit receptor. Many groups have recently established that embryonic or adult progenitor mast cells can fully reconstitute W/W v mice to wild type levels in all relevant organs (21Rodewald H. Dessing M. Dvorak A. Galli S. Science. 1996; 271: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 22Galli S. Tsai M. Wershil B. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 965-974PubMed Google Scholar, 23Secor V. Secor W. Gutekunst C. Brown M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, one group has recently proposed that in vivo reconstitution of mast cell precursors derived from embryonic stem cells is an approach to evaluate the in vivo function of a range of embryonic lethal mutations (24Tsai M. Wedemeyer J. Ganiatsas S. Tam S. Zon L. Galli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9186-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, direct injection of cultured mast cells into the peritoneum of these mice offers a sensitive measure of mast cell function in vivo. Since these mice contain no peritoneal mast cells and cultured mast cells can repopulate the peritoneum of these mice, equivalent numbers of transduced wild type or Nf1-deficient mast cells were injected into the peritoneums ofW/W v mice, and peritoneal mast cell numbers were examined 10 weeks following injection. In three independent experiments, mice transplanted with Nf1−/− mast cells had a 3-fold increase in peritoneal mast cells compared with mice transplanted with wild type mast cells or withNf1−/− mast cells expressing NF1 GRD (Fig. 4 A). We also assessed the ability of these reconstituted mast cells of the respective experimental groups to form clonal mast cell progenitors in vitro. Mast cell progenitors cultured from the peritoneum of mice transplanted with Nf1−/− cells expressing only reporter sequences had a 4-fold increase in mast cell progenitors compared with wild type cells and Nf1−/− mast cells expressing NF1 GRD (Fig. 4 B). Thus, introduction of Nf1 GRD sequences is sufficient to restore normal mast cell growth in vitro and in vivo.Figure 4In vivo mast cell proliferation.

We generated a GAP-inactive mutant ofNF1 GRD that harbors a mutation in the arginine finger loop (R1276P). This mutation, identified in NF1-associated malignancies, greatly reduces neurofibromin GAP activity (25Klose A. Ahmadian M. Schuelke M. Scheffzek K. Hoffmeyer S. Gewles A. Schmitz F. Kaufmann D. Peters H. Wittinghofer A. Nurnberg P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M. Wiesmuller L. Kabsch W. Stege P. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4313-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The R1276P mutant recombinant protein had no catalytic activity in a GAP assay (Fig.5 A), and expression failed to restore normal GM-CSF responsiveness to Nf1−/−hematopoietic progenitors (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, expression of this mutant GRD failed to correct the characteristic ERK2 hyperactivation observed in Nf1−/− MEFs (Fig.5 C). Thus, NF1 GRD exerts a Ras-specific function as regulation of cellular proliferation is dependent on Ras-GAP activity.Figure 5R1276P mutant NF1 GRD.

Precipitated ERK protein was then subjected to a kinase reaction employing Elk-1 fusion protein as substrate. Results are representative of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Despite its large size, the GRD encodes the only well established functional domain of neurofibromin. Previous studies in immortalized cell lines indicate that expressing NF1 GRD is sufficient to suppress the transformation capacity of an oncogenic K-Ras in a colon carcinoma cell line (27Li Y. White R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2872-2876PubMed Google Scholar). However, such data cannot implicate sufficiency of NF1 GRD to restore normal cellular proliferation. The large size of neurofibromin has led investigators to search for other functional domains outside of the GRD. Recently, a missense mutation was described in an NF1 patient that disrupts a protein kinase A (PKA) phospho-acceptor consensus sequence (28Fahsold R. Hoffmeyer S. Mischung C. Gille C. Ehlers C. Kucukceylan N. Abdel-Nour M. Gewies A. Peters H. Kaufmann D. Buske A. Tinschert S. Nurnberg P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 790-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and these investigators hypothesize that these sequences may define a second functional domain of neurofibromin. These data are of additional interest because of recent observations in Drosophila that have suggested a link between cAMP-mediated signaling andNF1 (29The I. Hannigan E. Cowley G. Reginald S. Zhong Y. Gusella J. Hariharan I. Bernards A. Science. 1997; 276: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although our construct does not contain this putative PKA consensus site, expression of recombinant NF1GRD was sufficient to restore normal growth and ameliorate the biochemical deficits observed in three cell types frequently implicated in NF1-associated malignancies. Thus, the role of the hypothesized PKA sequences in the human NF1 gene and its relationship toDrosophila function remain unclear. It may be possible that PKA can modulate GAP activity by an unidentified mechanism. For example, lipid regulation of neurofibromin GAP activity differs between full-length protein and its isolated GRD (30Bollag G. McCormick F. Clark R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Perhaps PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the full-length protein could expose a lipid-binding site and result in modulation of activity. Additionally, despite a retention of structural homology, it is possible that species differences between Drosophila and humans result in a divergence of function.Importantly, correction of the cellular and biochemical deficits ofNf1−/− cells by NF1 GRD is dependent on Ras GAP activity as the R1276P arginine-finger mutant, found in several distinct NF1 malignancies, failed to restore normal proliferation. This suggests that the primary role of these domains in these tested cell types is to modulate Ras activity.Although expressing p120GAP GRD or full-length p120GAP in primary cells induced similar levels of total GAP activity, this did not alter the cellular or biochemical deficits in Nf1−/−cells. This result is consistent with hyperactive Ras signaling in leukemia cells from patients with NF1 despite near-normal levels of total cellular GAP activity (20Bollag G. Clapp D. Shih S. Adler F. Zhang Y. Thompson P. Lange B. Freedman M. McCormick F. Jacks T. Shannon K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for our observations regarding the differential functions of the two GAPs is that neurofibromin and p120GAP may modulate different Ras isoformsin vivo. Alternatively, our experimental observations might be explained by differences in the catalytic or association kinetics ofNF1 GRD and p120GAP GRD with Ras. The crystal structure of the catalytic regions of the two GRDs has been resolved (26Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M. Wiesmuller L. Kabsch W. Stege P. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4313-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 31Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), analyzed kinetically (32Ahmadian M. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Bischoff F. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16409-16415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and described as retaining high structural homology. Both fragments possess a conserved Ras binding groove, an arginine finger necessary for catalysis, and stabilization components including a phenylalanine-leucine-arginine motif important in positioning of the arginine finger loop. However, differences in amino acid composition within each of these motifs were hypothesized to alter interactions with Ras. Specifically, two residues within the Ras binding groove of the NF1 GRD have been identified that have electrostatic or hydrogen bonding potential with Glu-37 and Glu-63 of Ras. The presence of neutral or oppositely charged residues at these same locations within p120GAP may be responsible, in part, for differential affinities of the two GAPs for Ras. Additionally, slight deviations in residues proximal to the arginine finger loop ofNF1 GRD are thought to impart more flexibility to this key catalytic motif (26Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M. Wiesmuller L. Kabsch W. Stege P. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4313-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Overall, these differences may translate into a major alteration in the kinetics of Ras-GTP complex formation with the respective GAPs. In support of these structural data, kinetic data in cell-free systems have demonstrated that the affinity of NF1GRD for Ras is severalfold higher than that of p120GAP at physiological concentrations of Ras-GTP (33Martin G. Yatani A. Clark R. Conroy L. Polakis P. Brown A. McCormick F. Science. 1992; 255: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the association and dissociation rate constants of p120GAP-Ras complex are faster than that of the neurofibromin-Ras complex (33Martin G. Yatani A. Clark R. Conroy L. Polakis P. Brown A. McCormick F. Science. 1992; 255: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our in vitro and in vivo studies in primary Nf1-deficient cells support these structural and in vitro biochemical predictions.Although the studies presented here suggest distinct roles ofNF1 GRD and p120GAP GRD in regulating Ras output in fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells, the contribution of individual residues and localization sequences within these domains to GTP hydrolysis remains unclear. In vitro mutagenesis of p120GAP and neurofibromin, followed by introduction of these sequences intoNf1−/− cells, may help define these functions. In addition, such studies may further define how each of these GAPs coordinates with other signaling proteins and the functional significance of these interactions. Future studies utilizing these techniques will provide a better understanding of the physiological roles of these two GAPs and may further define molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis when NF1-specific GAP function is perturbed. Mutations in NF1 cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),1 a common disorder characterized by increased risk of specific benign and malignant tumors that primarily arise from neural crest-derived tissues.

Dominant mutations have been isolated in the host gene mraY that confer E resistance.mraY encodes translocase I, which catalyzes the formation of the first lipid intermediate in bacterial cell wall synthesis, suggesting a model in which E inhibits MraY and promotes cell lysis in a manner analogous to cell wall synthesis inhibitors like penicillin. To test this model biochemically, we monitored the effect of E on cell wall synthesis in vivo and in vitro. We find that expression of Emyc, encoding an epitope-tagged E protein, from a multicopy plasmid inhibits the incorporation of [3H]diaminopimelic acid into cell wall and leads to a profile of labeled precursors consistent with MraY inhibition. Moreover, we find that membranes isolated after Emycexpression are drastically reduced in MraY activity, whereas the activity of Rfe, an enzyme in the same superfamily, was unaffected. We therefore conclude that E is indeed a cell wall synthesis inhibitor and that this inhibition results from a specific block at the MraY-catalyzed step in the pathway.

Bacteriophages with large genomes encode a holin-endolysin system. In the prototypic λ model, the S holin protein accumulates in the cell membrane and the R endolysin accumulates in the cytoplasm. At a genetically programmed time, S forms a membrane lesion to release the R endolysin into the periplasm where it can degrade the cell wall and cause lysis (1Young R. Wang I.-N. Roof W.D. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 120-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In contrast, bacteriophages with small genomes can only afford to encode a single lysis protein. Three unrelated single protein lysis systems are known: the E protein from φX174 (ssDNA,Microviridae), and the L and A2 proteins from MS2 (ssRNA, group I) and Qβ (ssRNA, group III) respectively (1Young R.

Billeter M. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1521-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of lysis caused by any of these proteins has been elusive. No cell wall-degrading activity has been associated with any of these phages, indicating that their lytic mechanism is distinct from the holin-endolysin system of the larger phages. Working from the premise that these phage proteins are targeting a host protein to promote lysis, we took a genetic approach to isolate lysis-resistant host mutants and identify the target genes. We recently isolated dominant mutations in Escherichia coli mraY that result in resistance to the bacteriophage φX174 E lysis protein (6Bernhardt T.G. Roof W.D. Young R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).mraY encodes translocase I, which catalyzes the formation of the first lipid intermediate in cell wall synthesis (7Ikeda M. Wachi M. Jung H. Ishino F. Matsuhashi M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a member of the UDP-GlcNAc/MurNAc1:polyisoprenyl-P GlcNAc/MurNAc 1-P transferase family of enzymes, which we will refer to as the GPT enzyme family (8Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MraY by the antibiotic mureidomycin results in lysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and depletion of MraY activity from E. colialso results in concomitant cell lysis (9Isono F. Inukai M. Takahashi S. Haneishi T. Kinoshita T. Kuwano T. J. Antibiot. 1989; 42: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Boyle D. Donachie W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6429-6432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with the isolation of E-resistant mraY mutants, suggest a model in which E inhibits MraY to elicit lysis by a mechanism similar to that of antibiotics like mureidomycin and penicillin that inhibit cell wall synthesis (see Fig.1 A) (11Bayles K.W. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 274-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Tomasz A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1979; 33: 113-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The bacterial cell wall is composed of polysaccharide chains of the repeating unitN-acetyl-glucosamine-β-1,4-N-acetyl-muramic acid (GlcNAcβ1,4MurNAc). Attached to the MurNAc sugar is a pentapeptide side chain (in E. coli,l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP-d-Ala-d-Ala). Adjacent polysaccharide strands are cross-linked by peptide bonds between the free amino group of meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) from one peptide chain and the carboxyl group of the penultimated-Ala of an adjacent peptide. The pathway for cell wall synthesis can be divided into three phases: (i) cytoplasmic reactions, (ii) membrane reactions, and (iii) periplasmic reactions (see Fig.2) (13Nanninga N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 110-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, UDP-GlcNAc is converted to UDP-MurNAc in two steps. In the first and committed step in cell wall biosynthesis, an enolpyruvyl moiety from phosphoenolpyruvate is added to C-3 by MurA. MurB catalyzes the reduction of the enolpyruvyl moiety to a lactyl group using reducing equivalents from NADPH. The pentapeptide is then extended from the lactyl group of UDP-MurNAc, one or two amino acid residues at a time, to generate UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. On the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, MraY catalyzes the transfer of P-MurNAc-pentapeptide from UMP to the lipid carrier undecaprenol-P, generating undecaprenol-P-P-MurNAc-pentapeptide or lipid I. GlcNAc is then added to lipid I from UDP-GlcNAc by MurG, generating lipid II. Lipid II is flipped, by an as yet unidentified flippase, to expose the disaccharide-pentapeptide monomer unit on the periplasmic face of the membrane. Once exposed to the periplasm, the disaccharide-pentapeptide is polymerized and cross-linked by multienzyme complexes, including the penicillin-binding proteins, to form the mature cell wall (14Holtje V. Microbiol. Molecular Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to test our model for the mechanism of E-induced lysis (see Fig. 1 A) biochemically by monitoring its effect on cell wall synthesis in vivo and in vitro. Bacterial cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (15Raab R. Neal G. Garrett J. Grimaila R. Fusselman R. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or minimal M9 media (16Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and l-amino acids (20 μg/ml His and Tyr; 30 μg/ml Gly, Ile, Phe, Pro, Ser, and Val; 40 μg/ml Trp; 50 μg/ml Arg; 60 μg/ml Ala and Asp; 70 μg/ml Asn and Lys; 80 μg/ml Glu; 90 μg/ml Gln; 100 μg/ml Met and Thr; 110 μg/ml Leu). Met and Thr were present at 100 μg/ml to reduce the size of the intracellular DAP pool (17Wientjes F.B. Pas E. Taschner P.E. Woldringh C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cultures were grown in the presence of 40 μg/ml kanamycin (Kan). When indicated, bacterial cultures were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Alexis, San Diego, CA) at a concentration of 1 mm. [3H]Racemic-DAP (1 mCi/ml; 45 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and [3H]UMP (1 mCi/ml; 35 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Unless otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Solvent systems used for chromatography were as follows: A, isobutyric acid:1 m NH4OH (5:3; v/v); B, ethanol:1m ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) (5:2); C, ethanol:1m ammonium acetate (pH 3.8) (5:2). E. coli K-12 strain ET505 (W3110 lysA::Tn10) was the host strain used in this study and was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (New Haven, CT) on the web. ThelysA mutation was required to prevent the conversion of added [3H]DAP to Lys, so that [3H]DAP is only incorporated into cell wall and its precursors. The plasmid pEmycZK has been described previously (6Bernhardt T.G. Roof W.D. Young R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and contains Emyc, encoding E with a C-terminal c-Myc epitope tag, cloned under control of the IPTG-inducible tac promoter (Fig.1 B). The control vector pJFlacZK is isogenic to pEmycZK, except that it does not contain Emyc (Fig. 1 B). It was constructed by inserting the lacZ gene in theHindIII site of pJF118EH (18Fürste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blöcker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene. 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and conversion to KanR as described previously for pEmycZK (6Bernhardt T.G. Roof W.D. Young R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). ET505 pEmycZK and ET505 pJFlacZK were grown in minimal M9 glucose media in 250-ml culture flasks at 37 °C to an A550 of ∼0.3 when a portion of each culture was transferred to a small prewarmed 50-ml flask containing sufficient [3H]DAP to give a final activity of 5 μCi/ml. Constant aeration of all cultures was maintained throughout the experiment. After a 10-min prelabeling period, both labeled and unlabeled cultures were induced with IPTG. Culture growth was monitored from the unlabeled culture, and [3H]DAP incorporation into cell wall was monitored in the labeled culture as described previously (17Wientjes F.B. Pas E. Taschner P.E. Woldringh C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 0.2-ml aliquots were removed at the indicated times and added directly to 0.8 ml of boiling 5% SDS. The samples were boiled for 1 h and allowed to cool to room temperature before filtering through a 0.22-μm mixed cellulose-ester filter (type-GS, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were washed with 30 ml of distilled H2O and allowed to dry completely, and the radioactivity associated with the cell wall was determined by counting the filters in a Beckman LS5000TD liquid scintillation counter using EcoscintA liquid scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). In control experiments, label incorporation into the cell wall was linear 10 min after addition of [3H]DAP, indicating that the precursor pools were in isotopic equilibrium. Cultures were grown as described above except that induction with IPTG was done at an A550 of 0.6. After 2 min, a portion of the culture was added to a prewarmed 50-ml flask containing sufficient [3H]DAP for a total activity of 35 μCi/ml. Constant aeration of all cultures was maintained throughout the experiment. After an 8-min pulse-labeling period, prior to any observable lysis, three 1-ml aliquots of labeled culture were removed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. The cell pellets were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold media and resuspended in 10 μl of dH2O. The cell suspension was spotted on Whatman 3MM paper, and labeled cell wall precursors were separated by development with solvent system A for ∼20 h as described (20Lugtenberg E.J. Haan P.D. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1971; 37: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each lane was cut into 1-cm strips and counted as described above. Cell wall, nucleotide, and lipid intermediate fractions ran at published RF values (0, 0.1, and 0.8, respectively). UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and -tripeptide were accumulated in Bacillus subtilis W23 in the presence of vancomycin and chloramphenicol or cycloserine and chloramphenicol, respectively, and purified through a Sephadex G-25 column (1.6 × 72 cm) as described previously (21Lugtenberg E.J. Schijndel-van Dam A. Bellegem T.v. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 20-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions from the G-25 column were assayed for the presence of N-acetyl sugars as described previously (22Ressig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Acetyl sugar-containing fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in a small volume of dH2O. The partially purified material was subjected to TLC analysis on Whatman Al-SIL-G plates using solvent systems A, B, and C and yielded a single UV-absorbing spot in each case. The UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and tripeptide were further purified on a 1-ml Hi-Trap Source Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) using a 0–0.4 m gradient of NH4HCO3 over 20 column volumes and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide preparation, fractions corresponding to the major UV-absorbing peak at 254 nm were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in 200 μl of dH2O. Mass spectrometry at the Texas A&M Laboratory for Biological Mass Spectrometry and quantitative amino acid analysis at the Texas A&M Protein Chemistry Laboratory confirmed that the preparation contained highly purified UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (m/z= 1194 and a Ala:Glu:DAP ratio of 3:1:1). The UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide preparation was processed as described for the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, and quantitative amino acid analysis confirmed its identity (Ala:Glu:DAP ratio of 1:1:1). ET505 pEmycZK and ET505 pJFlacZK were grown in 2 liters of LB-Kan at 37 °C to an A550 of ∼0.7 and induced with IPTG. Just before induction, MgCl2was added to 0.1 m to stabilize cells undergoing lysis (23Young K.D. Young R. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 45 min of induction, the cells were harvested and UDP-N-acetyl sugars were purified and characterized as described above for the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. For the preparation from ET505 pEmycZK, fractions corresponding to the major UV-absorbing peak in the anion exchange chromatogram were processed for amino acid analysis as described above. The retention time of the UDP-N-acetyl sugar that accumulated during Emycexpression was compared with those of authentic UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide and -pentapeptide standards using the anion exchange column described above with a 0–0.6 m gradient of NH4HCO3 over 20 column volumes and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 200 ml cultures of ET505 pEmycZK and ET505 pJFlacZK were grown in LB-Kan to an A550 of 0.6 and induced with IPTG. After 9 min of induction, before any observable lysis, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of French press buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted in a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments Inc.) at 16000 psi. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Finally, the membrane pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of French press buffer and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations of the membrane preparations were determined on aliquots solubilized in 1% SDS with the Bio-Rad DC detergent-compatible protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Membranes isolated from ET505 pEmycZK and ET505 pJFlacZK contained 17.4 and 21.2 mg/ml protein, respectively. MraY activity was assayed in the membrane preparations using an exchange assay monitoring the exchange of [3H]UMP for the UMP moiety of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (24Struve W.G. Sinha R.K. Neuhaus F.C. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 1 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 μl of 0.2 m MgCl2, 1 μl of 1 mm UMP, 1 μl of [3H]UMP (100,000 cpm), 1.5 μl of 4.8 mm UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, and 5-μl membranes. When indicated, 0.25 μl of a 5 mg/ml tunicamycin stock in methanol was added. Methanol alone did not affect the reaction. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by boiling for 3 min. After boiling, the membrane debris was pelleted by centrifugation at maximum speed for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed to a fresh tube, and the pellets were washed with 10 μl of distilled H2O and centrifuged as before. The wash was pooled with the previous supernatant, and 10 μl was spotted on a TLC plate (Whatman AL-SIL-G) and developed with solvent system C. UMP and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (0.02 μmol each) were spotted in each lane as standards. The UV-absorbing spots corresponding to UMP (RF = 0.6) and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (RF = 0.3) were scraped, and the radioactivity in each spot was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described above and normalized to total protein. Rfe activity was measured using an exchange assay monitoring the exchange of [3H]UMP for the UMP moiety of UDP-GlcNAc. Rfe reaction compositions were exactly as those for MraY except that 1.5 μl of 5 mm UDP-GlcNAc was added in place of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, and 1 μl of [3H]UMP (200,000 cpm) was used. The reactions were terminated and processed as described above except that solvent system A was used for TLC. UMP and UDP-GlcNAc (0.02 μmol each) were spotted in each lane as standards. The UV-absorbing spots corresponding to UMP (RF = 0.3) and UDP-GlcNAc (RF = 0.2) were scraped, and the radioactivity in each spot was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described above. The isolation of lysis-resistant mraY mutants suggested that E is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that blocks the MraY-catalyzed step in the pathway (Fig. 1 A). To test this model, we monitored the effect ofE expression on cell wall synthesis in vivo. The mature cross-linked cell wall is the only cellular material that remains insoluble when cells are boiled in 4% SDS (17Wientjes F.B. Pas E. Taschner P.E. Woldringh C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a convenient assay for monitoring cell wall synthesis is to measure the incorporation of [3H]DAP, an amino acid unique to the cell wall, into SDS-insoluble material (17Wientjes F.B. Pas E. Taschner P.E. Woldringh C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 331-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this assay we found that [3H]DAP incorporation into the cross-linked cell wall is inhibited 5 min after induction of pEmycZK well before any detectable effect on growth (Fig. 3). To determine the step in cell wall synthesis that is blocked by Emyc, we monitored the synthesis of cell wall precursors during Emycexpression from pEmycZK. After induction of Emyc, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]DAP for 8 min (Fig.4 A), and the major cell wall precursor fractions were separated by paper chromatography into cell wall, nucleotide intermediates (UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide and -pentapeptide), and lipid intermediates (lipids I and II) (20Lugtenberg E.J. Haan P.D. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1971; 37: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, only the nucleotide intermediates are labeled with [3H]DAP after Emyc induction, whereas all three fractions are labeled in the control strain. Because the ratio of the [3H]DAP-labeled UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide and -pentapeptide species in the nucleotide fraction could not be determined in this experiment, the data are consistent with an Emyc-mediated block at either the MurF- or the MraY-catalyzed steps of cell wall synthesis (Fig. 2). For a more precise determination of which nucleotide intermediates are synthesized following Emyc induction, we purified the UDP-N-acetyl sugars that accumulate duringEmyc expression and compared them to those isolated from the control strain (see “Experimental Procedures”). ByN-acetlylsugar assay (22Ressig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and A262measurements, ∼5 times more UDP-N-acetyl sugars were isolated after Emyc expression than in the control (1.6versus 0.3 μmol). Anion exchange chromatography of this material revealed one major UV absorbing peak eluting between 25 and 30 ml (Fig. 5 A), whereas the control preparation was a complex mixture containing multiple peaks of similar absorbance (Fig. 5 B). Using a slightly different elution gradient, authentic UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide and -pentapeptide standards are clearly separable, and the intermediate that accumulates during Emyc expression has an identical retention time to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. However, quantitative amino acid analysis found a 2:1:1 Ala:DAP:Glu ratio for the peak fractions shown in Fig.5 B, which is consistent with an equimolar mixture of the tripeptide and pentapeptide species. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but may be due to contaminants found in the preparation fromE. coli that are absent in the standard preparations fromB. subtilis. Based on the chromatographic analysis, we conclude that UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide is synthesized and accumulates to high levels after Emyc induction. Therefore, the step of cell wall synthesis inhibited by Emyc must be the one catalyzed by MraY. The in vivo experiments described above indicate that it is the MraY step that is blocked uponEmyc expression. To test this directly, we measured MraY activity in vitro using membranes isolated with and without prior expression of Emyc. MraY catalyzes the reaction, C55­P+UDP­MurNAc­pentapeptide⇌C55­P­P­MurNAc­pentapeptide+UMPREACTION Iwhere C55-P is undecaprenol-P. Because this reaction is readily reversible (24Struve W.G. Sinha R.K. Neuhaus F.C. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), addition of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and [3H]UMP to inner membrane vesicles, which contain the lipid substrate in addition to MraY, leads to the formation of [3H]UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. In this reaction, the UMP released from the enzyme as a result of the forward reaction is exchanged with [3H]UMP from solution, leading to the formation of [3H]UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide by the reverse reaction. We took advantage of this exchange reaction and monitored the formation of [3H]UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide as a measure of MraY activity. As shown in Fig.6 A, MraY activity is dramatically reduced in membranes isolated after Emycexpression relative to the activity in control membranes. This level of inhibition was similar to that caused by the MraY inhibitor tunicamycin (25Brandish P. Kimura K. Inukai M. Southgate R. Lonsdale J. Bugg T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1640-1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides MraY, the only other known member of the GPT enzyme family in E. coli is Rfe (8Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rfe catalyzes the formation of the first lipid intermediate in enterobacterial common antigen synthesis, undecaprenol-P-P-GlcNAc (26Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Emyc is a specific inhibitor of MraY like the antibiotic mureidomycin (27Inukai M. Isono F. Takatsuki A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or a general GPT enzyme inhibitor like tunicamycin (25Brandish P. Kimura K. Inukai M. Southgate R. Lonsdale J. Bugg T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1640-1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we measured Rfe activity in the membranes described above using an exchange reaction similar to that catalyzed by MraY. Rfe activity was nearly identical in membranes isolated with and without prior Emyc expression (Fig. 6 B). As expected, Rfe activity was completely inhibited by the general inhibitor tunicamycin (Fig.6 B). In a previous report we described the isolation of dominant mutants in the host gene mraY that resulted in resistance to E-induced lysis (6Bernhardt T.G. Roof W.D. Young R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that overexpression ofmraY from a medium-copy plasmid could also confer resistance (6Bernhardt T.G. Roof W.D. Young R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4297-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Given these results, we proposed a model in which E inhibits cell wall synthesis at the MraY-catalyzed step in the pathway to promote lysis (Fig. 1 A). The results presented in this study provide compelling biochemical support for this model. By monitoring cell wall synthesis in vivo, we observed complete inhibition of [3H]DAP incorporation into cell wall after only 5 min ofEmyc expression. We also found that the cytoplasmic nucleotide precursors are the last intermediates labeled with [3H]DAP (Fig. 4) and that UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide accumulates to high levels during Emyc expression (Fig. 5). Taken together, the in vivo experiments indicate that it is the MraY step in the pathway that is blocked. This blockage was demonstrated unequivocally by the finding that in vitro MraY exchange activity is almost completely inhibited in membranes containing Emyc (Fig. 6 A). There are several antibiotics that block the MraY step, and they can be classified based on their mode of inhibition. They are either direct inhibitors of MraY, like mureidomycin and tunicamycin (25Brandish P. Kimura K. Inukai M. Southgate R. Lonsdale J. Bugg T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1640-1644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brandish P. Burnham M. Lonsdale J. Southgate R. Inukai M. Bugg T. J. Biol.

Invest. 1981; 68: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The direct inhibitors all resemble the nucleotide substrate with additional hydrophobic moieties attached. They can be further subdivided as specific MraY inhibitors, like mureidomycin (27Inukai M. Isono F. Takatsuki A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), or general GPT enzyme inhibitors like tunicamycin (25Brandish P. Kimura K. Inukai M. Southgate R. Lonsdale J. Bugg T.

The indirect inhibitors limit the availability of the substrate undecaprenol-P by sequestering it or interfering with its recycling (30Stone K.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3223-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 35Banerjee D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2024-2028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to MraY, the general GPT enzyme inhibitors like tunicamycin inhibit the eukaryotic GPT enzyme involved in protein glycosylation, and the indirect inhibitors will bind its lipid substrate, dolichol-P (35Banerjee D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2024-2028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1980: 35-83Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, only specific MraY inhibitors are likely to have potential therapeutic applications in treating bacterial infections. E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein. Protein fusion analysis has revealed that only the amino-terminal 29 amino acids of the molecule, encompassing its putative transmembrane domain (TMD), are required for lytic function (37Buckley K.J. Hayashi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Maratea D. Young K. Young R. Gene. 1985; 40: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 2W. D. Roof and R. Young, unpublished results. With these observations in mind, E likely inhibits MraY in one of two ways, either by direct inhibition through a TMD-TMD interaction or by one of the indirect modes described above. To distinguish between these modes of inhibition, we monitored the effect of Emyc on the activity of the only other known E. coli GPT enzyme, Rfe, which catalyzes the formation of the first lipid intermediate in enterobacterial common antigen biosynthesis, undecaprenol-P-P-GlcNAc (26Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed no inhibition of Rfe activity in membranes containing Emyc (Fig. 6 B). If Emyc were a general or an indirect GPT inhibitor, it should have also inhibited Rfe. We therefore conclude that Emyc is a specific MraY inhibitor. This apparent specificity coupled with the small size of its lethal domain and its selectable lytic phenotype make E an attractive system to probe MraY function and inhibition. It may also help in the development of new specific MraY inhibitors with therapeutic applications. Coprecipitation and inhibition studies using a more purified system are underway to investigate E inhibition of MraY in more detail. Now that there is both biochemical and genetic evidence that cell wall synthesis inhibition is the mechanism of E-induced lysis, it is a reasonable hypothesis that other single protein lysis systems also act in the same way. We are currently taking similar genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate whether the Qβ A2and MS2 L lysis proteins are also cell wall synthesis inhibitors, and if so, at which step they act.

We also thank Jinny Johnson and Larry Dangott of the Texas A&M Protein Chemistry Laboratory for technical assistance and for performing the quantitative amino acid analysis and Bill Russell of the Texas A&M Laboratory for Biological Mass Spectrometry for performing mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W1989506178,"Interaction between the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and the DnaB helicase is critical for coupling the replicase and the primosomal apparatus at the replication fork (Kim, S., Dallmann, H. G., McHenry, C. S., and Marians, K. J. (1996) Cell 84, 643–650). In the preceding manuscript, we reported the identification of five putative structural domains within the τ subunit (Gao, D., and McHenry, C. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4433–4440). As part of our systematic effort to assign functions to each of these domains, we expressed a series of truncated, biotin-tagged τ fusion proteins and determined their ability to bind DnaB by surface plasmon resonance on streptavidin-coated surfaces. Only τ fusion proteins containing domain IV bound DnaB. The DnaB-binding region was further limited to a highly basic 66-amino acid residue stretch within domain IV. Unlike the binding of immobilized τ4 to the DnaB hexamer, the binding of monomeric domain IV to DnaB6 was dependent upon the density of immobilized domain IV, indicating that DnaB6is bound by more than one τ protomer. This observation implies that both the leading and lagging strand polymerases are tethered to the DnaB helicase via dimeric τ. These double tethers of the leading and lagging strand polymerases proceeding through the τ-τ link and an additional τ-DnaB link are likely important for the dynamic activities of the replication fork. Interaction between the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and the DnaB helicase is critical for coupling the replicase and the primosomal apparatus at the replication fork (Kim, S., Dallmann, H.

Like other replicases from eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the holoenzyme contains three functional subassemblies (for reviews see Refs. 1McHenry C.S. Annu. Rev.

The DNA polymerase III core contains the α, ε, and θ subunits and provides the polymerase function. The DnaX complex (τ2γδδ′χ,ψ) is a multiprotein ATPase that recognizes the primer terminus and loads the β processivity factor onto DNA. The τ and γ subunits are different translation products of thednaX gene (4McHenry C.S. Griep M.A. Tomasiewicz H. Bradley M. Molecular Mechanism in DNA Replication and Recombination. Alan R.

It interacts with the core polymerase to coordinate leading and lagging strand synthesis (8McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). τ also interacts with DnaB helicase to couple the replicase with the primosome and mediate rapid replication fork movement (10Kim S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These two important functions of τ reside in C-τ, a proteolytic fragment consisting of its unique C-terminal 213 amino acid residues. τ binds tightly to the α subunit; the shorter translation product γ does not. C-τ is a monomer and binds α with a 1:1 stoichiometry as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analyses (12Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Results from a recent study indicated that C-τ binds DnaB, can partially replace full-length τ in reconstituted rolling circle replication reactions, and effectively couples the leading strand polymerase with DnaB helicase at the replication fork (12Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DnaB helicase is composed of six identical subunits and is a stable hexamer over a wide range of concentration in the presence of magnesium ions (13Reha-Krantz L.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4043-4050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the preceding manuscript, we reported that τ comprises five potential structural domains (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). Domains I, II, and III are common to both γ and τ. Domain IV includes 66 amino acid residues of the C-τ sequence and the C-terminal 17 residues of γ. Domain V corresponds to the 147 C-terminal residues of the τ subunit. Based on these assignments, biotin-hexahistidine-tagged τ proteins lacking specific domains were produced. Results from binding studies employing these truncated fusion proteins indicated that the binding site of τ for α subunit lies within its C-terminal 147 amino acid residues (domain V). The objective of this study was to determine the domain(s) of the τ subunit involved in binding DnaB. Biotin-hexahistidine-tagged τ proteins lacking specific domains were expressed and purified. Analysis of DnaB binding to these truncated τ proteins by surface plasmon resonance permitted the assignment of the DnaB-binding domain of τ. E. coli DH5α and HB101 were used for initial molecular cloning procedures and plasmid propagation. E. coli BL21(λ DE3) was used for protein expression. Buffer L, Buffer W and HKGM Buffer were prepared as previously described (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein standards were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and prestained molecular mass markers were from Bio-Rad or Life Technologies, Inc. Ni2+-NTA1 resin, QIAquick Gel extraction kits, QIAquick PCR purification kits, and plasmid preparation kits were purchased from Qiagen. The Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent and ImmunoPure Streptavidin were from Pierce. CM5 sensor chips (research grade), P-20 surfactant,N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl)] carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were obtained from BIAcore Inc. Three biotin-tagged τ proteins C(0)τ, C-Δ147τ, and N-Δ413τ as well as holoenzyme subunits were prepared as previously described (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). Plasmids PA1-C-Δ213τ and pET11-N-Δ430τ were constructed to express the fusion proteins C-Δ213τ and N-Δ430τ, respectively. Fusion protein C-Δ213τ corresponds to γ, the shorter of the two potential dnaX products. In this construct, the 213 C-terminal residues found exclusively in the τ subunit are replaced by a peptide tag, which includes hexahistidine and a 13-amino acid residue biotinylation sequence. N-Δ430τ corresponds to C-τ; the N-terminal 430 amino acids found in both τ and γ are replaced by the hexahistidine/biotinylation tag. PA1 is a semi-synthetic E. coli RNA polymerase-dependent promoter containing two lac operators (16Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pET11 vector is under the control of the T7 promoter. The starting material for construction of plasmid PA1-C-Δ213τ was PA1-C(0)τ, which encodes the C-terminal tagged full-length τ protein (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). PCR primer C-213P1 (Table I) is complementary to a 110-nucleotide stretch upstream of the Rsr II site withindnaX. Primer C-213P2 (Table I) corresponded todnaX codons 423–430 preceded by a noncomplementarySpe I restriction site. PA1-C(0)τ was digested with Rsr II and Spe I. The PCR product generated by use of primers C-213P1/C-213P2 was cleaved with Rsr II andSpe I and then ligated into the linearized vector to generate plasmid PA1-C-Δ213τ.Table IOligonucleotides used for construction of truncated τ fusion proteinsOligonucleotide numberUseSequence1-aThe underlined regions are complementary to the DnaX gene sequence on the template.C-213p1C-Δ213τTACAACTTTCGCCTGCTGCACTTGC-213p2C-Δ213τGGACTAGTACTCTTTTTTGCTTTGGTTGCTCCCN-430p1N-Δ430τAACTGCAGAAGAGTGAACCGGCAGCCN-430p2N-Δ430τCTCGCATGGGGAGACCCCACAC1-a The underlined regions are complementary to the DnaX gene sequence on the template. Open table in a new tab Primers N-430p1 and N-430p2 (Table I) and plasmid PA1-N-Δ1τ, which encodes an N-terminal tagged τ protein (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar), were used to generate a PCR product for the construction of pET11-N-Δ430τ. The resultant PCR product consisted of aPst I restriction site within the noncomplementary 5′ region followed by dnaX codons 431–436 and a Kpn I site near the 3′ end. The Kpn I site located downstream of the natural dnaX stop codon. After digestion with Pst I andKpn I, the resultant 929-base pair fragment was used to replace the dnaE gene of vector pET11-N0 (16Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to produce plasmid pET11-N-Δ430τ. E. coli strain BL21 (λ DE3) containing the expression plasmids pET11-N-Δ430τ or PA1-C-Δ213τ was grown at 37 °C in 2 and 6 liters, respectively, of F medium (17Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside, biotin-treated, and harvested as described (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). The procedures for purification of C-Δ213τ and N-Δ430τ were similar to those described for other truncated τ fusion proteins (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). Briefly, induced cells (14 g for C-Δ213τ or 22 g for N-Δ430τ) were lysed in the presence of lysozyme (2.5 mg/ml), EDTA (5 mm), benzamidine (5 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) for 2 h at 4 °C and 6 min at 37 °C. For purification of C-Δ213τ, 0.226 g of ammonium sulfate was added to each milliliter of the resulting supernatant, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 23,300 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The pellets were then resuspended in Buffer L. Each suspension was mixed with 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin and pre-equilibrated with Buffer L, and the slurries were then packed into 1-ml columns. Columns were washed with ∼30 column volumes of buffer W containing 23 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were then eluted with buffer W containing 150 mm imidazole in a single step. 13 mg of C-Δ213τ were obtained in the preparation used for these studies. The purification of N-Δ430τ was as that for C-Δ213τ except that: 1) the supernatant proteins were precipitated with 65% ammonium sulfate, 2) 3 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA resin were used, 3) the columns were washed with buffer W containing 10 mm imidazole, and 4) elutions were effected by a 10–100 mm imidazole gradient in buffer W. 61 mg of purified N-Δ430τ were obtained in the preparation used for these studies. A BIAcoreTMinstrument was used for protein-protein binding studies. Research grade CM5 sensor chips were used in all experiments. Streptavidin was captured onto sensor chips byN-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl)] carbodiimide coupling as previously described (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). The biotinylated τ proteins were then injected over the immobilized streptavidin sensor chip. Binding analyses of τ to DnaB (0.025–1 μm) were performed in HKGM buffer at 20 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined using the BIAevaluation™ 2.1 software. DNA polymerization assays, protein determinations, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described in the preceding paper (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). The τ subunit binds to DnaB helicase and is the only subunit within the holoenzyme shown to interact with DnaB (10Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The unique C terminus of τ (C-τ) bound DnaB in a coupled immunoblotting method (12Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To confirm this observation and more precisely map the DnaB binding region of τ, a series of truncated τ proteins lacking specific domains were produced, and their interactions with DnaB helicase were quantified using BIAcore methodology. The τ fusion proteins employed in this study included C(0)τ (domains I-V), C-Δ147τ (domains I-IV), C-Δ213τ, which was equivalent to γ (domains I-III plus 17 amino acids of domain IV), N-Δ413τ (domains IV and V), and N-Δ430τ, which was equivalent to C-τ (the C-terminal 66 residues of domain IV plus domain V in its entirety). The truncated terminus of each fusion protein was tagged with a peptide containing both a hexahistidine sequence to aid in purification as well as a short biotinylation sequence. The biotinylation sequence enabled oriented immobilization of the fusion proteins onto BIAcore sensor chips via biotin-streptavidin binding. C(0)τ, C-Δ147τ, and N-Δ413τ were expressed and purified as previously described (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). C-Δ213τ and N-Δ430τ were expressed in the BL21 (λ DE3) strain by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside and reached similar expression levels (2–5% of total cell proteins). Both C-Δ213τ and N-Δ430τ were purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. After Ni2+-NTA purification, C-Δ213τ was obtained at 80% purity, and N-Δ430τ at 90% purity as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig.1). The activities of the fusion proteins were ascertained by their ability to replace γ or τ in DNA polymerase III reconstitution assays (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). The specific activity of C-Δ213τ was 5.5 × 106 units/mg, similar to that of full-length C(0)τ (5.7 × 106 units/mg). As expected, no holoenzyme reconstitution activity was detected for N-Δ430τ, which lacks the γ sequence required for assembly of the β processivity factor on DNA. The interaction between DnaB and C(0)τ was first characterized via use of BIAcore technology. C(0)τ (2025 RU) was immobilized onto a streptavidin sensor chip. DnaB solutions of varying concentrations were passed over the immobilized C(0)τ, and binding activity was monitored (Fig. 2 A). Attempts to fit the dissociation phase to a single first-order dissociation equation were unsuccessful, suggesting that a more complex mechanism was operative. To simplify the kinetic analysis, a limited interval (35–125 s following the starting point of dissociation) was analyzed from each binding curve and fit to a model in which two simultaneous independent dissociation processes occur. The two apparent dissociation rate constants k off major andk off minor (TableII) corresponded to 70–80% and 20–30% of the dissociating species, respectively.k off major was used to calculate the apparent association rate (k on). The apparentK d was calculated from k onand k off. The interaction between DnaB and C(0)τ had an apparent K d of 4 nm(Table II). Under the conditions employed in these studies, DnaB is known to exist as a hexamer (14Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and C(0)τ is a tetramer (18Dallmann H.G. Thimmig R.L. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29555-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The binding ratio of the DnaB hexamer (DnaB6) to the C(0)τ tetramer [C(0)τ4] was 0.72, indicating that these multimers likely interact with a 1(DnaB6): 1[C(0)τ4] stoichiometry.Table IIBinding of τ derivatives to DnaBτ derivativeApparent k onApparentk offApparentK d2-aResults are the averages of two separate experiments.MajorMinorm−1s−1s−1nmC(0)τI–V7 × 1053 × 10−3 (78%)0.03 (22%)4 ± 0.5C-Δ147τI–IV8 × 1054 × 10−3 (72%)0.04 (28%)5 ± 0.6N-Δ413τIV, V6 × 1053 × 10−3 (75%)0.04 (25%)5 ± 0.4N-Δ430τIV (80%), V6 × 1055 × 103 (80%)0.05 (20%)8 ± 0.6C-Δ213τI–IIINo detectable interaction2-a Results are the averages of two separate experiments. Open table in a new tab C-Δ213τ, equivalent to C-terminally tagged γ, was captured onto the streptavidin-derivatized sensor chip (3400 RU), followed by injection of DnaB (1 μm). No interaction between C-Δ213τ and DnaB was detected (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the previous finding that γ does not interact with DnaB helicase (10Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Next, DnaB samples (0.05–0.5 μm) were injected over immobilized C-Δ147τ (2860 RU) (Fig. 2 C). An apparentK d of 5 nm was obtained, which is similar to that of the C(0)τ-DnaB interaction (Table II). This suggests that C-Δ147τ contains elements sufficient for binding to DnaB at the same level observed for the intact τ subunit. C-Δ147τ (domains I-IV) bound DnaB, but C-Δ213τ (domains I-III) did not, localizing the region required for DnaB binding to somewhere within domain IV. To confirm that domain IV was the DnaB-binding domain, N-Δ430τ (1200 RU) was captured onto a BIAcore sensor chip, and its interaction with DnaB was assessed (Fig. 3 A). The dissociation phase did not fit to a single first-order dissociation equation, so the binding data were fit to the model that assumes two parallel dissociation processes. The apparent K d was about 8 nm, which was similar to that of the interaction between DnaB and C(0)τ (Table II). The sum of these results indicates that the DnaB binding site is located within the unique C-terminal 66 residues of the τ subunit. The C-terminal 17 amino acid residues of domain IV are lacking in N-Δ430τ. To investigate whether these 17 residues provide additional binding energy for the τ-DnaB interaction, DnaB binding studies using fusion protein N-Δ413τ were performed. However, the DnaB/N-Δ413τ interaction was characterized by an apparentK d of 5 nm, which is similar to that observed for the interaction of DnaB with N-Δ430τ (Fig.3 B and Table II). Thus, it is unlikely that the C-terminal 17 residues of domain IV contribute significantly to DnaB binding interactions. In the preceding experiment, the binding ratio of DnaB6 to the monomeric N-Δ430τ was less than 0.1. This value is significantly different from 0.72, the observed ratio for the interaction between DnaB6 and C(0)τ4. One potential underlying cause of the low binding ratio for the former interaction is the binding of DnaB6 to more than one immobilized N-Δ430τ molecule. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interactions of DnaB (1 μm) with sensor chips bearing differing amounts of N-Δ430τ (146 RU-2700 RU). The corresponding densities of the six different levels of N-Δ430τ tested are shown in TableIII. Binding of DnaB to immobilized N-Δ430τ at 146 RU was not observed. Increased binding ratios of DnaB to N-Δ430τ were observed for surfaces bearing greater densities of N-Δ430τ (Fig. 4). If we assume that each DnaB6 binds two (N-Δ430τ)1molecules, then the binding ratio of DnaB to N-Δ430τ is increased from 0.04 to 0.24 within the range of the amount of immobilized N-Δ430τ tested (Table III). The same apparent dissociation and association rate constants for the DnaB and N-Δ430τ interaction were obtained at different N-Δ430τ density as reported in Table II. These results are consistent with the multivalent binding of DnaB and N-Δ430τ. The observed K d is the product of the individual K d values for single site binding interactions. No binding was observed at low N-Δ430τ density, suggesting that the monomeric τ-DnaB6 interaction is too weak to be observed with the BIAcore methodology. The apparentK d values of the DnaB-N-Δ430τ interaction and DnaB-C(0)τ interaction were the same, suggesting that the interaction between DnaB and C(0)τ is also multivalent; more than one C(0)τ monomer binds each DnaB6. The binding ratio between DnaB and N-Δ413τ was also N-Δ413τ density-dependent and increased with increased immobilized N-Δ413τ density (data not shown).Table IIIDensity dependence of N-Δ430τ binding to DnaBImmobilized N-Δ430τDnaB BoundBinding ratio (DnaB6/(N-Δ430τ)23-bThe binding ratio of the DnaB hexamer to the N-Δ430τ or C(0)τ dimer was determined by the following equation: binding ratio = (RU of DnaB bound)/(RU of dimer immobilized) × (dimerM r)/(DnaB6 M r).RUDensity3-aThe concentrations of the immobilized N-Δ430τ and C(0)τ were calculated using the following equation (19): concentration (m) ≅ RU/100 × molecular weight of the immobilized species (M r).μmRU1465300368133700.047202613150.0811564199370.15199872425750.23270097835740.24Immobilized C(0)τDnaB BoundBinding ratio (DnaB6/(C(0)τ)23-bThe binding ratio of the DnaB hexamer to the N-Δ430τ or C(0)τ dimer was determined by the following equation: binding ratio = (RU of DnaB bound)/(RU of dimer immobilized) × (dimerM r)/(DnaB6 M r).RUDensityμmRU202527014370.36426256858750.353-a The concentrations of the immobilized N-Δ430τ and C(0)τ were calculated using the following equation (19Muller K.M.

Open table in a new tab To ensure that the observed binding ratio of the hexameric DnaB to the tetrameric C(0)τ was not density-dependent, the binding ratio of DnaB6 to C(0)τ was examined at an increased density (4262 RU) of C(0)τ on a sensor chip. In a previous experiment, 2025 RU of C(0)τ was used (Fig. 2 A), and a binding ratio of 0.72 DnaB6 to C(0)τ4 was observed. The C(0)τ concentrations in these two different experiments corresponded to 568 and 270 μm of C(0)τ as monomer, within the density range of N-Δ430τ used in the density dependence experiment (Table III). The observed binding ratio of DnaB6to C(0)τ4 was 0.69, which was not significantly different from the ratio obtained when using with 2025 RU of C(0)τ (TableIII). In the preceding paper, we detailed our use of limited proteolysis studies to identify five putative structural domains of the τ protein (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). Domains I–III are common to both τ and γ. Domain IV is composed of 17 amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of γ plus 66 amino acids from the unique C terminus of τ. Domain V is located at the C-terminal end of τ. One function of τ is to bind DnaB, coupling the holoenzyme with the primosome at the replication fork. C-τ, the unique C terminus of τ, bound DnaB in a coupled immunoblotting method (12Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In reconstituted rolling circle replication reactions, C-τ can partially replace full-length τ in coupling the leading strand polymerase with the DnaB helicase at the replication fork (12Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This study further defined the DnaB binding domain of τ by analyzing the interactions of DnaB with several truncated τ proteins. N-Δ413τ, N-Δ430τ, C-Δ147τ, and C(0)τ bound DnaB with similar apparent K d values. Because complicated binding kinetics were operative, the apparent K dvalues we obtained in this study were not the true constants. However, the resulting apparent K d values presumably contain the same systematic errors and therefore permit a quantitative comparison of relative affinities. The relative binding affinities of the different τ fusion proteins for DnaB indicate that τ amino acid residues 431–496 are sufficient for DnaB binding. This 66-residue stretch corresponds to the C-terminal portion of τ domain IV. Although similar apparent K d values were obtained for the interactions of DnaB6-C(0)τ4 and DnaB6-(N-Δ430τ)1, the binding ratios for the DnaB6-(N-Δ430τ)1 was density-dependent. We conclude that more than one N-Δ430τ monomer is required to bind DnaB6 and that the interactions between DnaB and τ involved multivalent binding. Thus, the true microscopic K d for binding of DnaB6 to a single N-Δ430τ was too weak to observe using a BIAcore. At higher N-Δ430τ densities, binding was observed between DnaB6 to two or more N-Δ430τ molecules; the observed macroscopic K d is roughly equal to the product of each of the constituent microscopic K dvalues. 2Assuming that the 8 nm apparentK d resulted from (N-Δ430τ)2-DnaB6 interactions, the affinity between DnaB and each monomeric N-Δ430τ would be in the 900 μm range provided that there was no cooperativity involved ((8 nm)1/2 = 900 μm). This low (900 μm) affinity range is consistent with the lack of detected interaction. Consistent with this interpretation, the number of DnaB6binding to a BIAcore chip surface increases with the density of immobilized N-Δ430τ. Increases in N-Δ430τ density would result in increased numbers of N-Δ430τ molecules becoming located within each DnaB6 binding sphere. The DnaB6 binding sphere is a function of the diameter of the distance between two binding sites within each DnaB6 molecule. Within each binding sphere, a certain number (n) of N-Δ430τ molecules can be accommodated; n is equal to the maximum potential binding stoichiometry of N-Δ430τ to DnaB6. Recently, a model for quantifying the principal aspects of multivalent binding was developed (19Muller K.M. Arndt K.M. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We used this model to estimate the probability of more than one N-Δ430τ molecules binding DnaB simultaneously. The proportion of spheres containing a given number of N-Δ430τ molecules was calculated assuming a binomial distribution. The DnaB-binding sphere was defined as the volume within which binding of the DnaB by two N-Δ430τ molecules can occur, and it was calculated using the following equation: V S = 4/3*π*D 3, where D is the distance between two binding sites on DnaB. The DnaB hexamer is a cyclic structure and contains six chemically identical subunits (14Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20San Martin M.C. Stamford N.P. Dammerova N. Dixon N.E. Carazo J.M. J. Struct.

Based on hydrodynamic and electron microscopic studies, the cyclic structure of the DnaB hexamer has an outside diameter of ∼140 Å and an inner channel of ∼40 Å. The expected DnaB binding sphere would be in the range from 4/3*π*(40 Å)3 to 4/3*π*(140 Å)3 (268–11480 nm3, respectively). If we assume that the interaction between τ and DnaB involves two N-Δ430τ molecules, the calculated DnaB binding sphere is 2500 nm3, within the possible range for an interaction between two τ protomers and DnaB6. The notion that two τ protomors bind each DnaB hexamer is consistent with the presence of a τ dimer at the replication fork (Fig.5). τ2 functions to dimerize the DNA polymerase III core to enable simultaneous synthesis of leading and lagging strands. We already know that the leading strand polymerase is tethered to DnaB (12Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The findings presented in this report indicate that the same DnaB molecule couples both of the leading and lagging strand polymerases. Thus, a double tethers exists between the leading and lagging strand polymerase, one is through the τ-τ link and the additional one through the τ-DnaB link. This second tether might help keep the lagging strand associated with the replication fork and may serve to help retarget the dissociated lagging strand polymerase to the next primer synthesized at the replication fork (Fig. 5). Our mapping results demonstrate that the DnaB helicase binds τ domain IV and that the polymerase α subunit binds domain V (15Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4433-4440Google Scholar). These findings indicate important roles that the C terminus τ plays in DNA synthesis."

Human factor XIII is the enzyme that forms blood clots, and therefore its activation process is highly controlled so that its catalytic activity is not exhibited under normal conditions. It is assumed that the structural changes caused by substrate binding as well as the proteolysis of the N terminus by thrombin are necessary to activate human factor XIII (25Hornyak T.J. Bishop P.D.

Because the activation process is very complex, the structure-function relationship of human factor XIII remains unclear, even though the crystal structure has been reported. To investigate the structure-function relationships of the TGases, the crystal structures of other TGases will be very helpful. The red sea bream liver transglutaminase (fish-derived TGase, FTG) is a member of the tissue-type TGases (29Yasueda H. Kumazawa Y. Motoki M. Biosci. Biotechnol.

FTG has some advantages for studying the structure-function relationship because FTG works as a monomer, whereas human factor XIII works as a homodimer, and FTG does not require an initial proteolysis in its activation process. It is expected that the activation process of FTG is similar to, but simpler than, that of human factor XIII. We describe the crystal structure of FTG determined at 2.5-Å resolution and its potential substrate binding sites. We also propose a novel aspect of the activation process, which involves the regulation of the enzymatic activity by a Cys residue adjacent to the catalytic Cys.

We describe the crystal structure of FTG determined at 2.5-Å resolution and its potential substrate binding sites. We also propose a novel aspect of the activation process, which involves the regulation of the enzymatic activity by a Cys residue adjacent to the catalytic Cys. transglutaminase fish-derived TGase dithiothreitol We thank Masaru Tanokura for the use of a cryostat and Mamoru Suzuki for help with the initial attempts at data processing with DENZO."
https://openalex.org/W2100443703,"Integrin receptors have been demonstrated to mediate either “inside-to-out” and “outside-to-in” signals, and by this way are capable of regulating many cellular functions, such as cell growth and differentiation, cell migration, and activation. Among the various integrin-centered signaling pathways discovered so far, we demonstrated that the modulation of the electrical potential of the plasma membrane (VREST) is an early integrin-mediated signal, which is related to neurite emission in neuroblastoma cells. This modulation is sustained by the activation of HERG K+ channels, encoded by the ether-à-go-go-related gene (herg). The involvement of integrin-mediated signaling is being discovered in the hemopoietic system: in particular, osteoclasts are generated as well as induced to differentiate by interaction of osteoclast progenitors with the stromal cells, through the involvement of integrin receptors. We studied the effects of cell interaction with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN) in a human leukemic preosteoclastic cell line (FLG 29.1 cells), which has been demonstrated to express HERG currents. We report here that FLG 29.1 cells indeed adhere to purified FN through integrin receptors, and that this adhesion induces an osteoclast phenotype in these cells, as evidenced by the appearance of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, as well as by the increased expression of CD51/αvβ3 integrin and calcitonin receptor. An early activation of HERG current (IHERG), without any increase in herg RNA or modifications of HERG protein was also observed in FN-adhering cells. This activation is apparently sustained by the β1 integrin subunit activation, through the involvement of a pertussis-toxin sensitive Gi protein, and appears to be a determinant signal for the up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin, as well as for the increased expression of calcitonin receptor.

In fulfilling these functions, integrins are not simply adhesion receptors, but can affect many signaling pathways, and therefore impinge upon complex cellular activities. Therefore integrin function itself is highly regulated, largely through the formation of specific associations with both structural and regulatory components within the cell. Recently, much research has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms, which control integrin function and transduce integrin-mediated signaling events. In particular, in the hemopoietic system, it is well known that adhesive interactions between hemopoietic precursors and the bone marrow microenvironment play a critical role in regulating hemopoiesis (1Simmons P.J. Levesque J.P. Zannettino A.C.W. Bailliere's Clin. Hematol. 1997; 10: 485-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Levesque J.P. Simmons P.J. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 579-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and that such interactions are often mediated by integrin receptors (3Hirsch E. Iglesias A. Potocnik A.J. Hartman U. Fassler R. Nature. 1996; 380: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4Papayanopoulou T. Priestley G.V. Nakamoto B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2231-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among hemopoietic precursors, the progenitors of osteoclasts are formed through a contact-dependent interaction between bipotential osteoclast-macrophage precursors and stromal cells, which express osteoclast forming activity (5Chambers T.J. Owens J.M. Hattersley G. Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Bikle D.D. Negrovilar A. Endocrine Reviews Monograph. Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1995: 266-270Google Scholar). Furthermore, osteoclast differentiation and activation leading to bone remodeling is finely regulated by interaction of osteoclasts with stromal cells (reviewed in Ref. 7Roodman G.D. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1229-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) through the involvement of integrin receptors, which are numerous on the osteoclast plasma membrane (8Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 154: S47-S56PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, osteoclast precursors can be envisaged as a good model wherein studying the relationships between the ECM, integrin-mediated signals, and the induction of cell differentiation/activation. Among the various integrin-centered signaling pathways discovered so far (9Hynes R.O.

Becchetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. DeFilippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Bianchi L.

Bianchi L. Rosati B. Gritti A. Vescovi A. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1996; 4: 369-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modulation is sustained by the activation of a peculiar type of K+ channels, the HERG channels (14Arcangeli A. Bianchi L. Becchetti A. Faravelli L. Coronnello M. Mini E. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 15Faravelli L. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J.

These are channels with limited hyperpolarizing potency, clamping VREST to substantially depolarized values (around −30 mV), and are expressed in the heart (16Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E.

Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822PubMed Google Scholar). We found that a human leukemia cell line, FLG 29.1 cell, expressed herg, and an HERG current (IHERG) with a very fast deactivation kinetics, which apparently justifies the low, depolarized value of their VREST (12Bianchi L. Wible B. Arcangeli A. Taglialatela M. Morra F. Castaldo P. Crociani O. Rosati B. Faravelli L. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 815-822PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schönnher R. Rosati B.

These cells derive from a patient with an M5a-type leukemia (21Bennet J.M. Catovsky D. Danirl M.T. Flandrin G. Galton D.A.J. Gralnik H.R. Sultan G. Br. J. Hematol. 1976; 33: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar) and represent immature preosteoclastic precursors, as revealed by their treatment with phorbol esters (22Gattei V. Bernabei P.A. Pinto A. Bezzini R. Ringressi A. Formigli L. Tanini A. Attadia V. Brandi M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). They are capable of adhering to bone endothelium, possibly through fibronectin (FN) molecules produced by the endothelial cells (23Formigli L. Zecchi-Orlandini S. Benvenuti S. Masi L. Pinto A. Gattei V. Bernabei P.A. Geheron Robey P. Collin-Osdoby P. Brandi M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and this interaction could influence the maturation of these cells through the osteoclastic pathway. We therefore used the preosteoclastic FLG 29.1 cells to study HERG K+channel-centered signals, elicited by integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM molecule FN, as a model for hemopoietic precursors, and their relationships with the process of osteoclastic differentiation. We report here that FLG 29.1 cells indeed adhere to purified FN through integrin receptors, and that this adhesion is accompanied by the appearance of osteoclast differentiation markers, namely tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), calcitonin receptor (CtR), as well as CD51/αvβ3 integrin. FN also induces the activation of IHERG, without any increase inherg RNA or modifications of HERG protein. This activation is apparently sustained by the β1 integrin subunit activation, through the involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein, and appears to be a determinant signal for the up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin, as well as for the increased expression of CtR. FLG 29.1 were obtained in Dr. P. A. Bernabei's laboratory (Hematological Unit, Florence, Italy) as previously reported (22Gattei V. Bernabei P.A. Pinto A. Bezzini R. Ringressi A. Formigli L. Tanini A. Attadia V. Brandi M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely cultured in RPMI medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) (complete medium) and incubated at 37 °C in 10% CO2. For experiments, cells were harvested from freshly seeded preparatory cultures and resuspended (2.5 × 105 cells/ml) in RPMI containing 250 μg/ml heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (RPMI + BSA) (for cell adhesion experiments) or in complete medium (for differentiation experiments). Cells were then plated onto either 35-mm Petri dishes (Costar) (for patch clamp experiments) or dishes in which glass slides had been accommodated (for immunocytochemistry experiments) or 10-cm Petri dishes (for RNA or protein extraction). Heat-inactivated BSA was prepared as described previously (11Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. DeFilippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Coating of culture dishes with FN or vitronectin (VN) was performed by adding the two proteins, prepared as reported in Ref. 11Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. DeFilippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, at 100 μg/ml in RPMI at 37 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, FN or VN solution was poured off and dishes were further incubated for 30 min with RPMI + BSA to saturate the free binding sites of the culture dish surface. Dishes were then immediately used for experiments or stored with PBS at 4 °C and used afterward (1 or 2 days). Experiments with substrate-bound as well as soluble anti-integrin antibodies were performed by using the following antibodies: (a) anti-β1 monoclonal antibodies: mAb BV7 (24Martin-Padura I. Bazzoni G. Zanetti A. Bernasconi S. Elices M.J. Mantovani A. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6124-6132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mAb TS2/16; (b) anti-β3 monoclonal antibody (mAb B212) (25Defilippi P. Truffa G. Stefanuto G. Altruda F. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7638-7645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (c) anti-α3monoclonal antibody (F2) (26Bartolazzi A. Kaczmarek J. Nicolo' G. Risso A.M. Tarone G. Rossino P. Defilippi P. Castellani P. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), and following the procedure essentially according to Arcangeli et al. (13Arcangeli A. Faravelli L. Bianchi L. Rosati B. Gritti A. Vescovi A. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1996; 4: 369-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the antibodies were diluted at 20 μg/ml in RPMI, and added to Petri dishes at 37 °C for 1 h. After coating the plastic surface, dishes were further incubated for 30 min with RPMI + BSA, as above, and thereafter immediately used for patch clamp experiments (see below). For experiments with soluble anti-β1 antibody (mAb TS2/16), the antibody was diluted at 20 μg/ml in RPMI medium + BSA, and cells were incubated in this solution at 2.5 × 105/ml for 10 min at room temperature, then transferred to BSA-coated Petri dishes, and incubated for further 15 min at 37 °C. Adhesion assay was performed essentially according to Arcangeli et al. (11Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. DeFilippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, stock cultures were radiolabeled during 36 h of exponential growth in RPMI medium containing 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (specific activity 24 Ci/mmol). After this time, cells were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in RPMI + BSA. Aliquots of cells (14 × 103) were inoculated into each well of 96-well clusters (Corning-Costar), previously coated with the adhesive proteins (see above). In the appropriate samples, blocking antibodies to FN-receptor (αFN-R; 1:50 dilution) (11Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Mannini A. Mugnai G. DeFilippi P. Tarone G. Del Bene M. Barletta E. Wanke E. Olivotto M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), β3 subunit (mAb B212, 9 μg/ml) (25Defilippi P. Truffa G. Stefanuto G. Altruda F. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7638-7645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or αv subunit (mAb L230) (10 μg/ml) were added at time 0. When the mAb B212 was used, cells were preincubated with the antibody for 20 min at 4 °C, according to Defilippiet al. (25Defilippi P. Truffa G. Stefanuto G. Altruda F. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7638-7645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When needed, GRGDSP (Telios) or GRGESP (Telios) were added just before cell seeding at 0.5 μg/ml (final concentration). After 60 min of incubation, the medium was aspirated off and adherent cells gently rinsed twice with PBS containing divalent cations; the cells were then solubilized with 50 μl of 1% SDS in 0.1n NaOH for 1 h. Radioactive solubilized cells were quantified by scintillation counting and compared on a percent basis with the radioactivities of the FN-seeded cells. For induction of cell differentiation, TPA (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10−3m and added to complete medium at a final concentration of 10−6m. Pertussis toxin (Calbiochem) dissolved in water was added to cell cultures at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, and cells were incubated in its presence for 14–20 h. After this time, cells were harvested and resuspended in RPMI + BSA in the absence of the toxin, and seeded on BSA-, FN-, or anti-β1 antibody (mAb TS2/16)-coated dishes for 1 h. Cells plated on dishes were incubated at 37 °C for various times. Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature with an amplifier Axopatch 1-D (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), replacing the Petri dishes every 30 min. The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann F. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar) was employed using pipettes (borosilicate glass; Hilgenberg, Germany) whose resistance was in the range 3–5 MΩ. Extracellular solutions were delivered through a 9-hole (0.6 mm), remote-controlled linear positioner placed near the cell under study. The standard extracellular solution contained (mm): NaCl 130, KCl 5, CaCl22, MgCl2 2, Hepes-NaOH 10, glucose 5, pH 7.4. The standard pipette solution at [Ca2+] = 10−7m contained (mm): K+ aspartate 130, NaCl 10, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 4, EGTA-KOH 10, Hepes KOH 10, pH 7.4. Gigaseal resistance were in the range 1–10 GΩ. Whole cell currents were filtered at 2 KHz. For precise measurement of the gating parameters of the inward rectifier channels, we carefully compensated pipette and cell capacitance and the series resistance before each voltage-clamp protocol run. The density of inward IHERG was calculated at [K+]o = 40 mm as the peak current elicited at a voltage of −120 mV after 20 s preconditioning at 0 mV, normalized by the cell capacitance. The values of the peak current refer to the current obtained after subtraction of the traces obtained in the presence of 5 mm Cs+ or 1 μm WAY 123,398, according to Ref. 19Arcangeli A. Rosati B. Cherubini A. Crociani O. Fontana L. Ziller C. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2596-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. The IHERG activation curves were measured according to Refs. 14Arcangeli A. Bianchi L. Becchetti A. Faravelli L. Coronnello M. Mini E. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. 1995; 489: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 15Faravelli L. Arcangeli A. Olivotto M. Wanke E. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar. Resting potential (VREST) was measured at 5 mm[K+]o in current-clamp mode (I = 0). The leakage conductance gL was calculated at 5 mm[K+]o by a ramp protocol ranging from −100 to +60 mV and lasting 1280 ms, from a holding potential of 0 mV, as the slope of the current trace obtained in the range −80 to −40 mV. The relatively slow rate of voltage change produced a negligible capacitive current. The cell capacitance was obtained directly by reading the position of the amplifier knob of the cell capacitance compensation. Input resistance of the cells was in the range 2–6 GΩ. For data acquisition and analysis, pClamp software (Axon Instruments) and Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) were routinely used. Total RNA was extracted from FLG 29.1 cells by the guanidinium/isothyocyanate method (28Maniatis T. Fritsh E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten or 20 μg of total RNA were loaded on a formaldehyde-formamide reducing agarose gel run at 80 mA for 3–4 h. Six micrograms of an RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) were also loaded. After staining with ethidium bromide, the gel was photographed and the position of the standards marked. RNA was then transferred by Northern blot onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized in Church Buffer (Na phosphate monobasic, 0.5 m, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing 108cpm/mg DNA of the appropriate probe (see below), at 65 °C overnight. Filter were then washed twice in Na phosphate 50 mm, SDS 1% for 5 min at room temperature, and once at 65 °C for 30 min, and exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at −70 °C for HERG probe, 5 min at −70 °C for 18S probe. A Bam HI-Hin dIII full-length (3.5 kilobase) fragment of the HERG gene cloned in SP64 vector (29Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar) kindly gifted by Dr. M. Keating (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT) was random priming labeled using [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the probe purified on Sephadex columns as described (28Maniatis T. Fritsh E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An 18S probe (Ambion) was labeled as above. Total RNA was extracted as reported above; cDNA was then synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using 200 units of reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Life Technologies), plus 200 μm of each dNTP and 2.5 μm random hexamers, in a 20-μl final reaction volume, for 50 min at 42 °C. 5 μl of such reaction were used to perform the specific amplification of the CtR, using 2.5 units of Platinum Taq polymerase (Life Technologies), 200 μm of each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm of the specific primers (see below). Amplification was performed in a Robocycler (Stratagene), after an activation step at 94 °C for 2 min, for 30 cycles with 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 60 s at 72 °C. The primers used were: 5′ sense oligonucleotide, GTATTGTCCTATCAGTTCTGCC; and 3′ antisense oligonucleotide, AGAGATAATACCACCGCAAGCG. These primers encompass a nucleotide region from 265 to 842 of the human CtR cDNA, and give rise to two bands, one 577 bp long, corresponding to the human CtR1 and one 529 bp long, corresponding to the human CtR2 (30Beaudreuil J. Taboulet J. Orcel P. Graulet M.A. Denne M.A. Baudoin C. Jullienne A. De Vernejoul M.C. Bone. 2000; 27: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments (not reported) demonstrated that under the conditions used in these experiments the amplification reaction was in the exponential phase, as reported by Beaudreuil et al.(30Beaudreuil J. Taboulet J. Orcel P. Graulet M.A. Denne M.A. Baudoin C. Jullienne A. De Vernejoul M.C. Bone. 2000; 27: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), thus allowing a semiquantitative analysis of the PCR products (see below). Moreover, the two bands obtained from such experiments were purified and sent off for sequencing, resulting in being 100% identical to the CtR sequences present in GeneBankTM. The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified as internal control, from 2 μl of the same cDNA, under the above conditions, and using the following primers, which comprise a sequence between nucleotide 457 and 595 of the gapdh gene: 5′ primer sense, AACAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCAA; 3′ primer antisense, CAGTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT. Samples of the PCR products (35 μl) were separated by gel electrophoresis on 3% agarose, and the bands, acquired by an HP 4C scanner, were analyzed by Scion Image software. Signals of the CtR cDNA were normalized using the values of the corresponding products from the gapdh amplifications. Cells prepared as above were placed on ice and washed twice with Hank's balanced salts (1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and biotinylated by adding 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in Hank's buffer for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with Hank's solution, labeling was repeated and the reaction was stopped by washing three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.6% BSA. Labeled cells were lysed in ice for 20 min with lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm, glycerol 10%, Triton X-100 1%, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride 1 mm, aprotinin 0.15 units/ml, leupeptin 10 μg/ml, NaF 100 mm, Na vanadate 2 mm). The supernatant was then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. For immunoprecipitation of integrin subunits, 0.5–1 mg of total cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies raised against the cytoplasmic tails of αv or β1 integrins (a gift from Prof. G. Tarone, University of Torino, Italy). Immunocomplexes were then bound to protein A-Sepharose beads and recovered by centrifugation. Bound material was eluted by boiling beads in nonreducing Laemmli buffer (Tris-HCl 62.5 mm, pH 6.8, glycerol 10%, SDS 0.2%, bromphenol blue 0.00125%), analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The membrane was incubated 30 min at 42 °C in T-TBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% Tween), containing 5% BSA, washed with T-TBS, and then biotinylated integrins were detected by incubating blots in TBS, 1% BSA, containing 0.2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) for 30 min, washed again with T-TBS, and developed with a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Images were then acquired by means of an HP4C scanner, and densitometric analysis performed using the QuantiScan software. Immunoblot with anti-PKCαantibodies was performed using a total cell protein extract. Cells, plated on 60-mm Petri dishes covered with BSA or FN, respectively, were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice with lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm, glycerol 10%, Triton X-100 1%, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride 1 mm, aprotinin 0.15 units/ml, leupeptin 10 μg/ml, NaF 100 nm, Na vanadate 2 mm). The supernatant was then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoblot with anti-HERG antibodies was performed using a crude membrane fraction obtained from cells seeded on 10-cm Petri dishes, covered with BSA or FN, respectively. For membrane extraction, all steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS, scraped off, and homogenized into 2.5 ml of TE buffer (Tris 10 mm,pH 7.5, EDTA 1 mm) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Pefabloc 0.5 mm, pepstatin 1 μm, benzamidine 1 mm, aprotinin 4 μg/ml, iodacetamide 1 mm, phenanthroline 1 mm, leupeptin 1 μg/ml). Debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3,600 × g for 10 min, and membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 40 min. The membrane-enriched pellet was then solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1% SDS. In any case, membrane as well as total cell proteins were then heated in reducing Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 3 min, separated by 7.5% (for experiments with anti-PKCα antibodies) or 6% (for experiments with anti-HERG antibodies) SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. After transfer, membranes were blocked for 4 h at room temperature with PBS + Tween-20 0.1% (T-PBS), containing 5% BSA (T-PBS-BSA) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PKCα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:3000 in T-PBS-BSA or with purified rabbit polyclonal anti-HERG antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Nerbonne, University of Washington, St. Louis, MO) diluted 1:500 in T-PBS-BSA. Membranes were washed 3 times with T-PBS and incubated with anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in T-PBS-BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with T-PBS, the immunoreactivity was determined by a chemiluminescent reaction (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were seeded on glass slides covered with BSA or FN, and incubated for 24 h as above. After this time, cells were air-dried, fixed, and then treated with a 1:50 dilution of the primary antibody (anti-vitronectin receptors, Celbio) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, solution in a humidified chamber for 30 min. Then the slides were treated with an alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase kit (TOP-Line Histology) according to manufacturer's procedure. Slides were then counterstained with Giemsa, and photographed through a Nikon microscope, then acquired through a Minolta scanner. Cells were cultured in slide-containing Petri dishes (see above), in complete medium. In the appropriate samples TPA (10−6m, final concentration) was added at time 0. At different times of incubation, cells in suspension were harvested and processed for cytospin slide preparations; cytospin preparations as well as cells remaining adherent on the glass slides were fixed in 60% acetone in citr"

In addition to playing critical roles in the structural organization of the holoenzyme, τ mediates intersubunit communications required for efficient replication fork function. We identified potential structural domains of this multifunctional subunit by limited proteolysis of C-terminal biotin-tagged τ proteins. The cleavage sites of each of eight different proteases were found to be clustered within four regions of the τ subunit. The second susceptible region corresponds to the hinge between domain II and III of the highly homologous δ′ subunit, and the third region is near the C-terminal end of the τ-δ′ alignment (Guenther, B., Onrust, R., Sali, A., O'Donnell, M., and Kuriyan, J. (1997) Cell 91, 335–345). We propose a five-domain structure for the τ protein. Domains I and II are based on the crystallographic structure of δ′ by Guenther and colleagues. Domains III–V are based on our protease cleavage results. Using this information, we expressed biotin-tagged τ proteins lacking specific protease-resistant domains and analyzed their binding to the α subunit by surface plasmon resonance. Results from these studies indicated that the α binding site of τ lies within its C-terminal 147 residues (domain V).

The polymerase of the enzyme and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease proofreading activities are contained within the heterotrimeric DNA polymerase III core (αεθ) subassembly. The holoenzyme contains seven different auxiliary subunits (β, γ, δ, δ′, τ, χ, and ψ) that confer a number of special properties requisite for replicative polymerase function (1McHenry C.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19127-19130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kornberg A. J. Biol.

These properties include a rapid elongation rate, high processivity, and the ability to communicate with primosomal proteins at the replication fork (5Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A.

The auxiliary subunits are divided between two functional assemblies: a β2 sliding clamp processivity factor, and the DnaX complex, a multiprotein ATPase that assembles the β2processivity factor onto the primer-template. Both the τ and γ subunits of the holoenzyme are expressed fromdnaX. Translation of dnaX gene yields the full-length τ subunit (71 kDa) as well as the γ subunit (47 kDa), which corresponds to the N-terminal two-thirds of the τ sequence (8McHenry C.S.

The τ subunit plays central roles in the structure and function of the holoenzyme. Interactions between the τ and α subunits result in the formation of a dimeric DNA polymerase III′ (αεθ)2τ2(12McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

The τ subunit binds tightly to α, but the shorter dnaX translation product (γ) does not. This observation suggested that the C-terminal portion unique to τ is critical for its interactions with the α subunit. Indeed, the α subunit and C-τ, an OmpT proteolytic fragment corresponding to the 215 C-terminal residues of τ, bind with a 1:1 stoichiometry (15Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interactions between the τ subunit and DnaB helicase (DnaB) are critical for rapid movement at the replication fork (16Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In systems using the reconstituted DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, τ subunit−DnaB interactions stimulate the rate of helicase unwinding more than 10-fold to levels approaching the rate of fork progression invivo. The C-terminal region found in τ but lacking in γ has been implicated in replication fork function. The C-τ fragment was shown to interact with DnaB and to effectively couple the leading strand polymerase with DnaB helicase at the replication fork (15Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The τ subunit also serves as a bridge between α and a χ-SSB interaction, strengthening the holoenzyme interactions with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein-coated lagging strand at the replication fork (20Kelman Z.

As part of the elongation complex, τ protects β2from removal by exogenous γ complex, increasing the processivity of the replicase to the megabase range (22Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4315-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Clearly, τ mediates its functions through interactions with other subunits. To identify distinct structural domains that might mediate these multiple interactions, we performed limited proteolytic digestion of recombinant, biotin-tagged τ. Based on these findings, we constructed plasmids encoding truncated τ fusion proteins lacking one or more putative structural domains. The relative binding of each resultant purified fusion protein to the α subunit was determined by surface plasmon resonance. These studies enabled the identification of domain V (147 C-terminal amino acid residues) as the α subunit-binding domain of τ. E. coli DH5α and HB101 were used for initial molecular cloning procedures and plasmid propagation. E. coli BL21 and BL21(λ DE3) were employed for protein expression. All proteases were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Sigma. d-Biotin was purchased from Sigma. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein standards were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and prestained molecular mass markers were from Bio-Rad or Life Technologies, Inc. Ni2+-NTA1 resin, QIAquick Gel extraction kits, QIAquick PCR purification kits, and plasmid preparation kits were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent and ImmunoPure Streptavidin are vended by Pierce. CM5 sensor chips (research grade), P-20 surfactant, NHS, EDC, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were obtained from BIAcore, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). The N- and C-terminal fusion vectors pPA1-N0 and pPA1-C0 were constructed as previously described (23Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The fusion peptides contained a short 13-amino acid biotinylation sequence, a hexahistidine sequence, and a thrombin cleavage site. The induced fusion proteins are under the control of either the T7 promoter of pET-11C vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) or the PA1/04/03 promoter/operator (referred to as PA1). PA1 is a semi-synthetic E. coli RNA polymerase-dependent promoter containing twolac operators (23Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 8973-8977Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The dnaX gene was derived from the pRT610A plasmid in which the dnaX gene was modified at the frameshifting site. This modification results in the specific expression of the τ subunit; the alternative expression product, γ, is not encoded by this construct (25Dallmann H.G. Thimmig R.L. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

PA1-N-Δ1τ plasmid (see Fig. 1 A) encodes the τ protein lacking only the first amino acid (methionine) with an N-terminal fusion peptide placed in frame. PA1-N-Δ1τ was generated by replacing the α-encoding gene dnaE from the vector used as the starting material (plasmid PA1-N0) with dnaX (see Fig. 1 A). Oligonucleotides 2782 and 2783 (Table I), which correspond to the codons for τ amino acids 2–10, were annealed and inserted into pBluescript (KS−) to generate pDG10. The remainder of thednaX gene sequence was from pDG50, which was derived from pRT610A via elimination of a Pst I restriction site. The 2187-base pair Nar I/Hin dIII restriction fragment from pDG50 was ligated to a similarly digested pDG10 vector to generate pDG100. The 2209-base pair Pst I/Sph I fragment from pDG100 replaced the corresponding fragment in the N-terminal fusion peptide-containing vector pPA1-N0 to yield pPA1-N-Δ1τ.Table IOligonucleotides used for construction of τ deletion fusion proteinsOligonucleotideUseSequence1-aThe underlined sequences are complementary to portions of the dnaX gene.2782N-Δ1τAGCTTGCTGTGGGCGCCATTTACGAGCCAGAACCTGGTAGCTCTGCA2783N-Δ1τGAGCTACCAGGTTCTGGCTCGTAAATGGCGCCCACAGCA3321C(0)τGGCGAAGCTAGCGGCAGAAGC3322C(0)τTACCAACTGCAGACTAGTAATGGGGCGGC-Δ147P1C-Δ147τTACAAVTTTVGCCTGCTGCACTTGC-Δ147P2C-Δ147τGGACTAGTCGCCTTCGGN-Δ413P1N-Δ413τAAAACTGCAGGCGGCGCGCCAGCAGTTGCN-Δ413P2N-Δ413τTGCAGACATACTGCGTTGTCGCTCTCCN-Δ496P1N-Δ496τAACTGCAGCTGAAAAAAGCGCTGGAACAN-Δ496P2N-Δ496τCTCGCATGGGGAGACCCCACAC1-a The underlined sequences are complementary to portions of the dnaX gene. Open table in a new tab Plasmid PA1-C(0)τ encodes the intact τ protein tagged with a C-terminal fusion peptide (see Fig. 1 B). TheNhe I/Pst I fragment at the C-terminal end of thednaX sequence within pRT610A was replaced with a PCR-generated fragment to produce pRT610AM, in which the stop codon was replaced with a Spe I cloning site. The 1963-base pairXba I-Spe I fragment from this plasmid was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the C-terminal fusion peptide-expressing vector pPA1-C0 to produce pPA1-C(0)τ. PCR was used to generate plasmid PA1-N-Δ413τ, which lacks the sequences encoding the N-terminal 413 amino acids of τ. Oligonucleotides N-Δ413P1 and N-Δ413P2 (Table I) were used with template pPA1-N-Δ1τ to PCR amplify a truncateddnaX fragment. N-Δ413P1 contained a Pst I site in the noncomplementary 5′ region followed by a complementary region extending from codons 414–419. N-Δ413P2 annealed to a region ofdnaX located 100 bases downstream of Nhe I site. To generate pPA1-N-Δ413τ, the amplified dnaX fragment was ligated into pPA1-N-Δ1τ following digestion of the plasmid with Pst I and Nhe I. Plasmid pET11-N-Δ496τ lacks the sequences encoding the N-terminal 496 amino acids of τ. Primers N-Δ496P1 and N-Δ496P2 were used with template pPA1-N-Δ1τ to generate a partialdna X fragment, which contained a Pst I site in the noncomplementary 5′ region and Kpn I restriction site more proximal to the 3′ end. The Kpn I restriction site was located downstream of the dnaX natural stop codon (see Fig.1 A). This PCR fragment replaced the dnaE gene inPst I/Kpn I-digested pET11-N0 (23Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to generate pET11-N-Δ496τ. Plasmid PA1-C-Δ147τ lacks the sequences encoding the C-terminal 147 amino acids of τ. PCR primer C-Δ147P1 annealed to adnaX sequence located 146 bases upstream of theRsr II cloning site. The other PCR primer C-Δ147P2 was complementary to the dnaX from codon 494–496, followed by a noncomplementary Spe I cloning site. The two primers were used with template pRT610A to generate a partial dnaX sequence. Following Rsr II and Spe I digestion, this fragment replaced the corresponding fragment in pPA1-C(0)τ (see Fig. 1 B) to generate pPA1-C-Δ147τ. For protein expression applications, E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with plasmids PA1-C(0)τ or PA1-N-Δ1τ. E. coli strain BL21(λ DE3) was used for each of the other expression plasmids. E. coli bearing plasmid PA1-N-Δ1τ was grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.8 in 6 liters of F medium (26Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria transformed with each of the other plasmids were grown to the same density under the same conditions, except that the volume of F medium was 2 liters. The induction process was started by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside (final concentration, 1 mm). Additional ampicillin (100 μg/ml) andd-biotin (10 μm) were added to the media at the same time. After 2 h of induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5860 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-sucrose buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% sucrose)/g of cells. Cells were quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. BL21 cells containing expression plasmids PA1-C(0)τ or PA1-N-Δ1τ were lysed in the presence of lysozyme (2 mg/g of cells), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm PMSF for 1 h on ice followed by a 4-min incubation at 37 °C (26Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For BL21(λ DE3) cells containing expression plasmids PA1-C-Δ147τ, PA1-N-Δ413τ, or pET11-N-Δ496τ, the lysis procedure was modified by increasing the concentrations of lysozyme (2.5 mg/g of cells) and EDTA (5 mm) and by extending the heat treatment step to 6 min at 37 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 23,300 ×g at 4 °C for 1 h to remove debris. For purification of N-Δ1τ, 0.226 g of ammonium sulfate was added to each milliliter of the resulting supernatant and precipitant was collected by centrifugation at 23,300 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein pellets were resuspended to ∼30 mg protein/ml in Buffer L (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm imidazole). Ni2+-NTA resin, previously equilibrated with Buffer L, was added to the suspensions for binding. Binding was conducted at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking. Slurries of Ni2+-NTA resin/τ fusion protein complexes were then packed into columns. Columns were washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer L and then with roughly 30 column volumes of Buffer W (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mmbenzamidine) plus 23 mm imidazole. Bound N-Δ1τ protein was eluted with 10 column volumes of a 23–150 mm imidazole gradient in Buffer W. The peak fraction eluted at about 60 mm imidazole. Wash and elution steps were performed at 4 °C. The purification procedures for C(0)τ, C-Δ147τ, N-Δ413τ, and N-Δ496τ were the same as above, except for modifications of the precipitation, binding, and washing steps for N-Δ413τ and N-Δ496τ and a simplified elution step for each of these four proteins. For N-Δ413τ and N-Δ496τ, supernatant proteins were precipitated by adding 0.36 g of ammonium sulfate to each milliliter of cell lysates. For these two fusion proteins, the imidazole concentrations in the binding and washing steps were 2 and 15 mm, respectively. The N-Δ413τ, N-Δ496τ, C(0)τ, and C-Δ147τ proteins were each eluted in single steps with 150 mm imidazole in Buffer W. Proteins were separated by overnight electrophoresis at 65 V on a 10–17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (0.75 × 18 × 16 cm). Gels were stained with a 0.1% solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid and then destained in a solution of 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 500 mA for 3 h in 25 mmTris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS. Membranes were dipped in methanol and then air-dried for 20 min. Membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (2 μg/ml) in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20 plus 0.5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times in TBS +0.05% Tween20. Blots were developed in a substrate solution containing nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (0.33 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt (0.165 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2. Reactions were stopped by washing the membranes with distilled water. C(0)τ digestions were carried out in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Proteolytic digestions of C-Δ213τ were in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 mmMg(CH3CO2)2. At different time points, 15-μl aliquots from reaction mixtures were removed, mixed with 8 μl of stop buffer (0.18 m Tris, pH 6.8, 30% sucrose, 6% SDS, 180 mm dithiothreitol), and then immediately boiled for 2 min. Each aliquot contained 3 μg of protein. Digestion products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for biotin blots. After digestion, the selected biotinylated fragments were purified from others by using Ni2+-NTA chromatography with the same buffers used for N-Δ1τ except that urea was added to the binding and washing buffer at 8 m final concentration. These purified biotinylated fragments were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0) and 10% methanol at constant current (0.4 A) for 3 h. The membranes were washed with 20% aqueous methanol and then subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis using standard Edman chemistry (James McManaman, University of Colorado Cancer Center Protein Core Laboratory). Concentrations of all purified proteins were determined by UV spectroscopy using their extinction coefficients. Concentrations of τ fusion proteins were determined by the Pierce Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin (fat-free; Sigma) was used as a standard. Activities of τ fusion proteins were measured by their requirement for reconstitution of holoenzyme activity and by measuring DNA synthesis from a primed M13Gori template (26Cull M.G. McHenry C.S.

Assay mixtures (25 μl) contained 500 pmol of M13Gori (as nucleotide), 165 units (40 ng) of DnaG primase, 1.6 μg of E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein, 250 fmol each of DNA polymerase III core (αεθ), β, δδ′, χψ, and the test τ fusion protein (20–50 fmol). Reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 48 μm dATP, 48 μm dCTP, 48 μm dGTP, 18 μm[3H]TTP (specific activity, 520 cpm/pmol TTP), and 200 μm rNTP. Assay mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, quenched by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and then filtered through GF/C filters (26Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of 1 pmol of dNTPs/min at 30 °C. A BIAcoreTMinstrument was used for protein binding analyses. CM5 research grade sensor chips were used for all experiments. The carboxymethyl dextran matrix of the sensor chip was activated by the NHS/EDC coupling reaction as previously described (27Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The matrix was activated using a 220-μl injection of a mixture of 0.2 m EDC and 0.05m NHS in water to maximize the conversion of the carboxyl groups of the sensor chip matrix to NHS esters. Streptavidin and bovine IgG were sequentially captured onto the matrix by injecting over the chip in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) buffer at 0.2 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. IgG was used to partially block the negatively charged carboxyl groups on the sensor chip surface. Unreacted NHS ester groups were inactivated using 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5). Typically, 2000 response units (RU) of streptavidin were immobilized. The biotinylated τ proteins were then injected over the immobilized streptavidin in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 surfactant). For kinetic analyses, less than 200 RU of τ fusion protein were immobilized. Binding studies of τ to the α subunit (12.5–50 nm) were performed at 20 °C in HKGM buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2, and 0.005% P-20 surfactant). A flow rate of 25 μl/min was used for kinetic analyses. Kinetic parameters were determined using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software. We constructed plasmids PA1-C(0)τ (Fig.1 A) and PA1-N-Δ1τ (Fig. 1 B), which encode C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ, respectively. Our nomenclature system for truncated fusion proteins indicates the number of terminal residues deleted following the Δ; the preceding N or C indicates the terminus from which the amino acids were deleted. The fusion peptide is located at the truncated terminus. N-Δ1τ, for example, indicates that one amino acid was deleted from the N terminus of the τ sequence and that the fusion peptide was added to the new N terminus. The expressed C(0) τ and N-Δ1τ represented ∼5% of the total cell protein, as determined by densitometric scans of Coomassie-stained gels. C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ were purified via Ni2+-NTA metal chelating chromatography (Table II). The hexahistidine sequence within the fusion peptide specifically interacts with Ni2+ cheated to the column resin. Lysates (FrI) were prepared from 21 g of C(0)τ or 50 g of N-Δ1τ expression cells. Both C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ were recovered at >85% purity after Ni2+-NTA chromatography. The activity peaks of the eluted fractions of both C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ corresponded to each of their protein peaks (data not shown). Both C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ were fully active compared with wild-type τ protein in DNA polymerization assays. C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ were the only biotinylated proteins in the corresponding eluted fractions examined by the biotin blot analysis (data not shown).Table IIPurification of C(0)τ and N-Δ1τ from overproducing cellsProtein nameFractionTotal proteinActivitySpecific activitymgunits (106)units/mg (103)C(0)τILysate300150500IIAmmonium sulfate521102200IIINi2+-NTA (1 ml)8475700N-Δ1τILysate128040320IIAmmonium sulfate220291300IIINi2+-NTA (3 ml)35206000 Open table in a new tab Limited proteolyses were performed to identify protease-sensitive interdomain hinges of the τ protein. Eight different proteases that encompass a broad spectrum of substrate specificities were tested: chymotrypsin, endoprotease Glu-C (SV8), papain, subtilisin, trypsin, thermolysin, endoprotease Asp-N, and endoprotease Lys-C. We first investigated the effects of varying the protease: C(0)τ ratios and incubation times on the observed proteolytic products. Varying incubation times distinguished the initial cleavage products and also established the differences between stable and unstable fragments. Results from a typical experiment employing chymotrypsin proteolysis are shown in Fig.2. At short incubation times, 56-, 52-, 48-, and 24-kDa products were observed along with full-length τ (Fig.3, lanes 1–3 and8–10). At longer incubation times, the 56- and 52-kDa products were diminished, whereas the 48- and 24-kDa products and several small bands (<20 kDa) became more intense (Fig. 2, lanes 4–7 and 11–14).Figure 3Biotin blots of C(0)τ and C-Δ213τ proteolysis products. After digestion, samples were boiled immediately with the addition of SDS sample buffer, resolved on 10–17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to biotin blots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, C(0)τ was subjected to limited proteolysis with six proteases.

After separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the digested products were transferred to membranes. Biotin blot analyses were used to identify terminal fragments (Fig. 3 A). Several cleavage products resulted from each protease digestion. Several bands with similar mobilities were generated via digestion with different proteases, suggesting that certain regions of C(0)τ were subject to cleavage by multiple proteases. For example, bands of roughly 38 kDa were obtained by digestion with thermolysin, papain, or subtilisin. Bands migrating at ∼30 kDa were obtained with either chymotrypsin or subtilisin, and products of about 22 kDa were obtained after digestion with chymotrypsin, SV8, or papain. These observations suggested that C(0)τ contains several protease-sensitive regions. To facilitate mapping of the cleavage sites closer to the N terminus of τ, C-Δ213τ, which is equivalent to the γ protein plus the fusion peptide at its C terminus, was subjected to limited proteolysis. The conditions for each protease were optimized as described above. Products with apparent molecular masses of 45 kDa were obtained after digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N, endoproteinase Lys-C, or chymotrypsin (Fig. 3 B). These and other cleavage products vanished after longer endoproteinase Ly"

It is an unusual cell-cell adhesion protein that does not exhibit any obvious relationship to the four known classes of adhesion molecules. In this study, the disulfide-bonding pattern of the GA733-2 antigen was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing of purified tryptic peptides treated with 2-[2′-nitrophenylsulfonyl]-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine or partially reduced and alkylated. Numbering GA733-2 cysteines sequentially from the N terminus, the first three disulfide linkages are Cys1–Cys4, Cys2–Cys6, and Cys3–Cys5, which is a novel pattern for a cysteine-rich domain instead of the expected epidermal growth factor-like disulfide structure. The next three disulfide linkages are Cys7–Cys8, Cys9–Cys10, and Cys11–Cys12, consistent with the recently determined disulfide pattern of the thyroglobulin type 1A domain of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1 and 6. Analysis of glycosylation sites showed that GA733-2 antigen containedN-linked carbohydrate but that no O-linked carbohydrate groups were detected. Of the three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, Asn175 was not glycosylated, whereas Asn88 was completely glycosylated, and Asn51 was partially glycosylated. These data show that the extracellular domain of the GA733-2 antigen consists of three distinct domains; a novel cysteine-rich N-terminal domain (GA733 type 1 motif), a cysteine-rich thyroglobulin type 1A domain (GA733 type 2 motif), and a unique nonglycosylated domain without cysteines (GA733 type 3 motif).

Moreover, recent studies correlate high GA733-2 expression with malignant tumor development in other types of cancer lesions, raising intriguing questions about the role of this antigen in tumor progression (for review see Ref. 10Balzar M. Winter M.J. de Boer C.J. Litvinov S.V. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The GA733-2 antigen was originally defined by the CO17-1A monoclonal antibody (mAb) and GA733 mAb (11Herlyn M. Steplewski Z. Herlyn D. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because a randomized phase II trial with mAb CO17-1A in colorectal carcinoma patients has demonstrated a significant decrease in recurrence and mortality of mAb-treated patients versus control patients (13Riethmuller G. Schneider-Gadicke E. Schlimok G. Schmiegel W. Raab R. Hoffken K. Gruber R. Pichlmaier H. Hirche H. Pichlmayr R. Buggisch P.

Oncol. 1998; 16: 1788-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), GA733-2 antigen has attracted substantial attention as a target for immunotherapy for treating human carcinomas. More recently, it has been reported that a recombinant adenovirus expressing the full-length GA733-2 antigen has the capability to induce humoral, cellular, and protective immunity to the antigen resulting in significant and specific inhibition of the colorectal carcinoma cell growth in mice, which implies that this recombinant adenovirus may have potential as a vaccine for colorectal carcinoma patients (15Li W. Berencsi K. Basak S. Somasundaram R. Ricciardi R.P. Gonczol E. Zaloudik J. Linnenbach A. Maruyama H. Miniou P. Herlyn D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 763-769PubMed Google Scholar). The GA733-2 antigen has been shown to function as a calcium-independent homophilic cell adhesion molecule that does not exhibit any apparent homology to the four known cell adhesion molecule superfamilies (16Litvinov S.V. Velders M.P. Bakker H.A. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Although the functional consequence of GA733 antigen-mediated adhesion on tumorigenesis is unclear, emerging evidence correlates increased GA733-2 antigen expression with increased cell proliferation and a less differentiated cell phenotype as demonstrated in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (17Litvinov S.V. van Driel W. van Rhijn C.M. Bakker H.A. van Krieken H. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 865-875PubMed Google Scholar). The GA733-2 gene encodes for a 314-amino acid polypeptide that includes a 23-amino acid signal sequence, a 242-amino acid extracellular domain, a 23-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 26-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (18Szala S. Froehlich M. Scollon M. Kasai Y. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Linnenbach A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3542-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of GA733-2 antigen (GA733-2EC) has three potential N-linked glycosylation sites and an N-terminal cysteine-rich region containing 12 cysteines. It has been proposed that this N-terminal portion is comprised of an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif followed by a thyroglobulin type 1A motif based on relatively weak homology (19Simon B. Podolsky D.K. Moldenhauer G. Isselbacher K.J. Gattoni-Celli S. Brand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2755-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Molina F. Bouanani M. Pau B. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, structural evidence to support this hypothesis has not yet been reported. In addition, analysis of glycosylation sites on the GA733-2 antigen is of interest because changes in glycoprotein glycosylation typically accompany malignant transformation (for review see Ref. 21Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). For example, a recent study showed that modulation of the glycosylation of CD44 regulated cell adhesion during tumor growth and metastasis (22Cichy E. Pure E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18061-18069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two of the three possible N-glycosylation sites in GA733-2EC are located in the N-terminal cysteine-rich region, which appears to contain the epitope for the CO17-1A mAb used in the clinical trial described above (10Balzar M. Winter M.J. de Boer C.J. Litvinov S.V. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely thatN-glycosylation of GA733-2 antigen may play roles in cell adhesion and/or tumor targeting. A better understanding of the special features of the GA733-2 antigen may provide insights into the function(s) of this antigen and should facilitate the rational design of mutants for structure-function studies. In this study, we determined the linkages of the six disulfide bonds and the sites of N-linked glycosylation in GA733-2EC using MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing of purified peptides. The data show that the cysteine-rich region has two distinct domains with six cysteines forming three disulfides in each domain. Surprisingly, the first cysteine-rich domain does not belong to the EGF-like domain family as previously predicted (10Balzar M. Winter M.J. de Boer C.J. Litvinov S.V. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 19Simon B. Podolsky D.K. Moldenhauer G. Isselbacher K.J. Gattoni-Celli S. Brand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Instead, it has a unique disulfide linkage pattern. In contrast, assignment of disulfides in the second cysteine-rich domain is in agreement with the disulfide pattern of a thyroglobulin type 1A motif, recently determined in insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 and 6 (23Neumann G.M. Bach L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14587-14594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and consistent with its apparent sequence homology (20Molina F. Bouanani M. Pau B.

Of the three potentialN-glycosylation sites, Asn51 was partially glycosylated, Asn88 was completely glycosylated, and Asn175 did not contain any carbohydrate moieties.

The column was washed with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, pH 6.0), and proteins were eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. The pH of the peak fractions was immediately raised to approximately pH 6 using 2 mTris-HCl, pH 6.0, followed by dialysis against PBS. Protein samples were concentrated to 7–8 mg/ml using Centriprep and Centricon concentrators with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrated protein solution was then injected into two TSK columns G3000 SWXL and G2000 SWXL (Toso-Haas, Japan) connected in series and separated at 0.8 ml/min using PBS, pH 6.0. The quality of purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the GA733 mAb. The concentration of GA733-2EC was determined byA 280 in a 1-cm pathlength cell, using a molar absorption coefficient (εg/l) of 0.926, calculated from the GA733-2EC sequence according to Pace et al. (27Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar). For disulfide assignments, a tosylphenylalanine chloromethylketone-trypsin F7m column was used for initial fragmentation of GA733-2EC after equilibrating the column with 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 3 m urea, pH 6.5, at 22 °C. Purified GA733-2EC (400 μg/134 μl) was treated with urea (final concentration, 3 m) and loaded onto the trypsin column. The protein solution percolated through the column by gravity over the period of ∼1 h, and the eluate was reloaded a total of six times followed by overnight incubation in the column without flow at 22 °C. The column was then centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 s to collect the digested peptide. Residual peptides were removed with two successive elutions using 200-μl aliquots of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 3 m urea, pH 6.5, followed by centrifuging at 2,000 rpm for 5 s. GA733-2EC was digested with trypsin in solution under physiological conditions at a ratio of 1:500 (w/w) enzyme to substrate at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 0.15 mm). The sample was denatured and reduced by adding 7m urea and 10 mm TCEP (final concentration) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The fragments were separated by HPLC gel filtration using two TSK columns G3000 SWXL and G2000 SWXL connected in series with 0.6 ml/min flow rate in 7 m urea, 20 mmTris-Cl, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.0. Collected fractions were immediately dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, to remove urea and TCEP. Peptides were separated by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC on a ZORBAX 300SB-C18 column (2.1-mm inner diameter × 150 mm, Hewlett Packard Co.) using a System Gold HPLC (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Various gradient conditions were used as described in figure legends with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile). Where required, tryptic digests were reduced prior to RP-HPLC by adding 20 mm TCEP in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 2% trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration) was then added prior to injection onto the HPLC column. The purified tryptic fragment containing glycosylation (T1) was treated withN-glycosidase A. The peptide solution (3 μg/250 μl in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) was mixed with 14 μl ofN-glycosidase A (0.1 μg/μl stock solution). The mixture was then incubated overnight at 37 °C followed by RP-HPLC to separate deglycosylated peptide. Deglycosylated T1-N (1.4 μg) in the presence of 5 m guanidine-HCl was cleaved with BNPS-skatole essentially as previously described (28Crimmins D.L. Mische S.M. Denslow N.D. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M.

TCEP partial reduction of complexes with multiple disulfides was performed as previously described (29Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The purified peptide complex (100 pmol/70 μl in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was mixed with the same volume of 50 mm TCEP in 50 mm citrate, pH 3.5, and incubated for 3 min at 22 °C. Alkylation of peptides was performed by adding the TCEP-reduced peptide solution into the same volume of 1 m iodoacetamide in 100 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.3% trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration). Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (1.3 milliunits/6.3 μl) was added to the peptide solution (33 pmol/50 μl in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1m guanidine-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and incubated overnight at 60 °C to remove N-terminal pyroglutamic acid from the purified partially reduced and alkylated peptides. Automated Edman degradation was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer as previously described (30Reim D.F. Speicher D.W. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.10.1-38Google Scholar). Molecular mass determination was performed by MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The accelerating voltage was set to 20 kV. Data were acquired either in the linear or reflector mode of operation. Spectra were externally calibrated with protein A (44,614 Da), chymotrypsinogen (25,657.1 Da), ubiquitin (8,567.49 Da), insulin β chain (3,496.96 Da), and bradykinin (1,061.24 Da). Intact GA733-2EC and the tryptic 22-kDa fragment from partial digestion in solution (10 pmol/2 μl) were mixed 1:1 with a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid, Sigma) in 33% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 6-kDa fragment from partial tryptic digestion of GA733-2EC in solution was analyzed using α-cyano-4-hydoxy cinnamic acid (Sigma) in 33% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the matrix. Peptides with molecular masses smaller than 5 kDa were directly applied to the MS sample plate that was precoated with a saturated solution of nitrocellulose and α-cyano-4-hydoxycinnamic acid (1:4 w/w) in 2-propanol and acetone (1:1 v/v) as previously described (31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7783) Google Scholar). The recombinant extracellular domain of GA733-2 (GA733-2EC) was purified from Hi Five insect cell culture supernatant by GA733 mAb-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by HPLC gel filtration. The purified protein migrated on SDS-PAGE as a diffuse doublet with apparent masses of ∼31 and 33 kDa (Fig.1). MALDI-MS analysis of purified GA733-2EC showed two broad peaks with average masses (MH+) of 28,332 and 29,349 Da. Because the calculated mass of the GA733-2EC is 27,372 Da after removal of the signal peptide, these data suggest that the molecule is heterogeneously glycosylated, resulting in two major populations with average carbohydrate masses of about 960 and 1,977 Da. The broad peak shapes of the doublet in the mass spectrum are indicative of additional mass heterogeneity of these two major populations of molecules. N-terminal sequence analysis of GA733-2EC indicated that the majority of the protein has a blocked N terminus, although a low level sequence representing about 1% of the protein amount loaded to the sequencer was detected. The low level sequence (AAQEEC … ) indicated a minor alternative cleavage of the signal peptide after residue 21 of the unprocessed full-length protein. Subsequent MALDI-MS analysis and pyroglutamate aminopeptidase digestion of tryptic T2 peptide complex (Tables Iand III) showed that the predominant signal peptide cleavage occurred after residue 23 and the N terminus of the mature protein is pyroGlu (see below). Hence the amino acid residues of the mature protein are numbered starting with this pyroGlu residue (Fig.2). The GA733-2EC eluted from the HPLC gel filtration column as a single symmetrical peak between the 44- and 17-kDa protein standards. Rechromatogrphy of the protein at high and low protein concentrations yielded consistent elution volumes (data not shown). These data suggest that recombinant GA733-2EC is a globular monomer with a native-like fold.Table IMALDI-MS and N-terminal sequence analyses of tryptic peptide complexesPeptide fractionAssignmentPeptide mass 1-aAverage masses of single-charged molecules (MH)+.CommentsObservedCalculatedT1 complex[Cys83, Cys91, Cys95]-[Cys113] 1-bSquare brackets indicate a single peptide, and the cysteines in the peptide are indicated with their location in the sequence as superscripts.[A84-R102+3Hex-2HexNAc]-[T104-R115]4444.14442.7Heterogeneous glycosylation[A84-R102+3Hex-2HexNAc-1Fuc]-[T104-R113]4590.44588.8[A84-R102+3Hex-3HexNAc]-[T104-R115]4647.04645.9T1 complex-reduced[A84-R102+3Hex-2HexNAc]2893.52893.1[A84-R102+3Hex-2HexNAc-1Fuc]3039.73039.3[A84-R102+3Hex-2HexNAc]3096.63096.3A84-R102+4Hex-3HexNAc]3259.53258.5[T104-R115]1398.91398.5[R103-R115]1555.11554.7Incomplete cleavageT2 complex[Cys4, Cys6]-[Cys15,Cys23, Cys25, Cys36] 1-bSquare brackets indicate a single peptide, and the cysteines in the peptide are indicated with their location in the sequence as superscripts.[pyroE1-K10]-[L11-K38]1-cThe assignment of peptide pyroE1-K10 was not determined by Edman sequencing but by MALDI-MS because of the blocked N terminus.4238.34237.8T2 complex-reduced[pyroE1-K10]1229.5 1-dThe mass of pyroE1-K10 was obtained after RP-HPLC separation of the reduced peptides from the T2 complex.1228.3[L81-K38]3014.73016.5T3 complex[Cys43]-[Cys76] 1-bSquare brackets indicate a single peptide, and the cysteines in the peptide are indicated with their location in the sequence as superscripts.[C43-K47]-[A59-K83]3286.73288.7Cys43-Cys76T3 complex-reduced[C43-K47]593.9593.8[A59-K83]2698.22697.9Data obtained by MALDI-MS for the major disulfide-containing tryptic peptides complexes isolated by RP-HPLC before and after reduction with TCEP.1-a Average masses of single-charged molecules (MH)+.1-b Square brackets indicate a single peptide, and the cysteines in the peptide are indicated with their location in the sequence as superscripts.1-c The assignment of peptide pyroE1-K10 was not determined by Edman sequencing but by MALDI-MS because of the blocked N terminus.1-d The mass of pyroE1-K10 was obtained after RP-HPLC separation of the reduced peptides from the T2 complex.

A representative RP-HPLC chromatogram of a GA733-2EC digest using an immobilized trypsin column after reduction (Fig.3 A) is compared with the chromatogram of a replicate aliquot that was not reduced prior to RP-HPLC (Fig. 3 B). All peaks in the nonreduced chromatogram and most peptides in the reduced chromatograms were analyzed by MALDI-MS. Peptides that could not be unambiguously identified by mass analysis were subjected to Edman sequencing (data not shown). Three major peaks and several minor peaks observed in the nonreduced digest (T1–T3, T2*, and T3* in Fig. 3 B) were not seen in the reduced digest, indicating that they contained disulfide-linked peptides. In addition, several new peaks appeared in the reduced tryptic digest chromatogram that corresponded to cysteine-containing peptides released from disulfide linkages by reduction. The identities of these peptides are indicated by inclusive residue numbers of the GA733-2EC sequence (Fig. 3, A and B). Peaks T1–T3 from the nonreduced tryptic digest were further analyzed to determine the disulfide linkages in GA733-2EC. T2* and T3* were identified as incomplete cleavages of T2 and T3, respectively. MALDI-MS and Edman sequencing analyses of the tryptic peptide complexes shown in Fig. 3 B are summarized in Table I. The T1 peptide complex contains four cysteines in two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, Ala84–Arg102 and Thr104–Arg115. Asn88 is entirely in a glycosylated form with some heterogeneity of the carbohydrate moiety, as indicated by the broad and multiple peaks in the RP-HPLC chromatogram (Fig. 3, A and B). The complex also exhibited heterogeneous trypsin cleavage, i.e. a complex of Ala84–Arg102 with either Arg103–Arg115 or Thr104–Arg115. The T2 peptide complex contains six cysteines in two polypeptide chains: pyroGlu1–Lys10 and Leu11–Lys38. The T3 complex has two cysteines in two polypeptide chains, Cys43–Lys47 and Ala59–Lys83, giving one direct disulfide assignment of Cys43–Cys76. Fig. 3 Cshows a summary of additional processing of the T1 and T2 complexes to complete disulfide assignments of these complexes. To minimize complexity in data analysis, T1 was deglycosylated withN-glycosidase A. BNPS-skatole cleavage of deglycosylated T1 (T1-N in Fig. 3 C) was subsequently performed to obtain peptides containing one disulfide bond"

To investigate the role of IKKγ/NEMO in the assembly of the IKK complex, we conducted a series of experiments in which the chromatographic distribution of extracts prepared from cells transiently expressing epitope-tagged IKKγ/NEMO and the IKKs were examined. When expressed alone following transfection, IKKα and IKKβ were present in low molecular weight complexes migrating between 200 and 400 kDa. However, when coexpressed with IKKγ/NEMO, both IKKα and IKKβ migrated at ∼600 kDa which was similar to the previously described IKK complex that is activated by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α. When either IKKα or IKKβ was expressed alone with IKKγ/NEMO, IKKβ but not IKKα migrated in the higher molecular weight IKK complex. Constitutively active or inactive forms of IKKβ were both incorporated into the high molecular weight IKK complex in the presence of IKKγ/NEMO. The amino-terminal region of IKKγ/NEMO, which interacts directly with IKKβ, was required for formation of the high molecular weight IKK complex and for stimulation of IKKβ kinase activity. These results suggest that recruitment of the IKKs into a high molecular complex by IKKγ/NEMO is a crucial step involved in IKK function.

In the current study, we utilized a biochemical approach to address the function of IKKγ/NEMO in the recruitment of IKKα and IKKβ into the IKK complex. We demonstrated that the amino terminus of IKKγ/NEMO that interacts with IKKβ is crucial for formation of the high molecular weight IKK complex. Moreover, we found that IKKγ/NEMO stimulates the ability of IKKβ but not IKKα to phosphorylate IκBα. These results further establish that IKKγ/NEMO association with the IKK complex is critical for stimulation of IKK kinase activity. The murine IKKγ/NEMO coding sequence (28Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

An amino-terminal deletion that contains amino acid residues 101–412 of IKKγ/NEMO was constructed by PCR followed by cloning of the product into pCMV5/Myc1. The carboxyl-terminal deletions of IKKγ/NEMO containing either amino acids 1–270 or 1–312 were constructed utilizing PCR to generate these fragments followed by cloning into pCMV5/Myc1. The leucine zipper mutations were constructed by substitution of leucine residues at positions 315, 322, and 329 with methionine in the IKKγ/NEMO gene cloned into pCMV5/Myc1.

The phosphoprotein products were visualized by autoradiography. COS cells (1.3 × 105) were transfected with either 0.5 μg of IKKβ alone or in the presence of 0.5 μg of wild-type or mutant IKKγ/NEMO mutants. After 24 h post-transfection, cells were grown overnight in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by incubating 3 h in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

Quantitation by RNase protection assay showed maximal increases of 3.4-, 3.0-, 3.8-, and 4.9-fold in relative 5-HT1A mRNA levels after 48 h of stimulation of splenocytes with lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin, respectively, as compared with unstimulated cells. Mitogens did not alter 5-HT1A mRNA stability (t 12 = 26 h), but induction of 5-HT1A mRNA was blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) and by inhibition of nuclear factor-κB signaling.

Kelley K.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar). In functional studies using selective agonists and antagonists, it has been shown that the 5-HT1A receptor is implicated in the regulation of T cell responses including human T-cell proliferation (13Aune T.M.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that mitogen-stimulated B lymphocyte proliferation in rodents is up-regulated by 5-HT via specific interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor (18Iken K. Chheng S. Fargin A. Goulet A.C. Kouassi E. Cell Immunol. 1995; 163: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, immune and inflammatory responses may be regulated in part through 5-HT1A receptor expression in B and T lymphocytes. A recent review of the role of 5-HT in the immune system and in neuroimmune interactions has underscored the necessity of characterizing the distribution of the various 5-HT receptors in different immune cell populations, preferably by using molecular biological methods (7Mossner R. Lesch K.P. Brain Behav. Immun. 1998; 12: 249-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The previous studies cited above using essentially functional and radioligand binding criteria suggest that 5-HT1A receptor expression is increased following mitogenic stimulation of both murine B cells (18Iken K. Chheng S. Fargin A. Goulet A.C. Kouassi E. Cell Immunol. 1995; 163: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and human T cells (13Aune T.M. McGrath K.M. Sarr T Bombara M.P. Kelley K.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous and inducible transcription factor involved in many immune and inflammatory responses, including activation and proliferation of B and T lymphocytes stimulated by mitogens such as LPS, PHA, and PMA (19Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 20Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar, 21Sha W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). NF-κB is mainly composed of p50 and p65 subunits, which are normally retained in the cytosol of nonstimulated cells by inhibitory molecules, IκB. In response to stimuli, IκB are rapidly phosphorylated and degraded, allowing translocation of NF-κB complexes into the nucleus and activation of NF-κB elements (22Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). In this report, we used RNase protection assay to quantitate the expression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in unstimulatedversus mitogen-stimulated mouse splenocytes. In addition, we took advantage of the availability of pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB (23Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 24Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baueuerle P.A. J. Exp.

Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) to explore its role in regulation of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression following mitogenic stimulation. Additionally, we used an affinity-purified anti-5-HT1A antiserum (26El Mestikawy S. Riad M. Laporte A.M. Vergé D. Duval G. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 118: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to evaluate the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor protein in the splenocytes. Our data demonstrate that 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and protein are markedly increased following mitogenic stimulation of B and T lymphocytes with similar quantitative variation in these lymphocyte populations. Furthermore, our data indicate that up-regulation of mitogen-stimulated B and T lymphocyte 5-HT1A receptor occurs at the transcriptional level, and that mitogen-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB may be one of the important signaling mechanisms involved. Female BALB/c mice, 6–12 weeks of age, were purchased from Charles River (St-Constant, Canada) and maintained in our animal facilities until use. All culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Canada). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT), and dialyzed against PBS to remove molecules of molecular weight <12–14 kDa.Escherichia coli LPS (serotype 0111:B4), PHA, ConA, PMA, and 5-HT hydrochloride were from Sigma,R(+)-8-OH-DPAT hydrobromide (R-DPAT) and WAY100635 maleate from RBI (Natick, MA), and ionomycin from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [3H]Thymidine (specific activity 2 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Mississauga, Canada), and [3H]WAY100635 (specific activity 81 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Anti-5-HT1A antiserum was produced as described previously (26El Mestikawy S. Riad M. Laporte A.M. Vergé D. Duval G. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 118: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and all other Ab were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). BALB/c mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Spleens were then aseptically harvested and gently teased into a single-cell suspension in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Red blood cells were removed by osmotic shock with NH4Cl, and splenocytes were resuspended in a culture medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in a total volume of 200 μl. Cells were stimulated by incubation for different periods of time in the presence or absence of LPS (10 μg/ml), PHA (20 μg/ml), ConA (5 μg/ml), or a combination of PMA (1 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml). In some experiments, splenocytes were incubated with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (ICN, Saint-Laurent, Canada), to distinguish between existing and newly transcribed mRNA. To prevent the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, splenocytes were incubated for 48 h with mitogens in the presence of 10–50 μg/ml SN50 (Calbiochem), 5–50 μmpyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC, Sigma), or 0.01–10 μg/ml gliotoxin (Sigma). As controls for SN50 and gliotoxin specificity, their respective inactive analogues SN50M (50 μg/ml) and methylthiogliotoxin (1–10 μg/ml) were also used. Cell counting and viability were assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and all chemicals were used at noncytotoxic concentrations. Purification of B and T lymphocytes was achieved by negative selection of splenocytes using flow cytometry sorting with Ab directed against granulocytes and macrophages (anti-CD11b-PE), NK cells (anti-Ly49C, 5E6-PE), and T lymphocytes (anti-Thy-1.2-PE), or B lymphocytes (anti-CD19-FITC), as described previously (27Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Miyake K. Sha W. Gerondakis S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Dead cells were stained with the vital dye propidium iodide (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Resting and activated lymphocytes were gated appropriately and separated in two different regions using forward scatter and side scatter profiles. Cells that were negative for the indicated cell surface markers and for propidium iodide staining were sorted on a FACStar-Plus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The purity of the resulting B or T cells was assessed by flow cytometry with anti-Thy-1.2-PE and anti-CD19-FITC, and it ranged between 93% and 97%. Splenocytes were incubated for 30 min with or without 5 × 10−5mWAY100635 before stimulation for 72 h with mitogens in the presence or absence of 10−4m 5-HT or 5 × 10−5m R-DPAT, and cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for the last 6 h of incubation. Cell nuclei were harvested, and radioactivity was counted with a Wallac System 1409 scintillation counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Determinations of [3H]thymidine uptake were made in triplicate wells, and results were expressed as arithmetic means of counts per minute (cpm) ± S.E. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell suspensions by Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer instruction. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was treated for 15 min at 37 °C with 2 units of amplification grade DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) to remove genomic DNA. After denaturation for 10 min at 75 °C, cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 42 °C by adding Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μm random hexamer primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Canada). A 1/8 volume of the resulting first strand cDNA was used as template during the subsequent PCR amplification in a PCR machine (GeneAmp PCR System 9600, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the buffer provided with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2, in the presence of 200 μm dNTPs, and 250 nm primers (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 25 μl. The thermocycle conditions were 22 cycles of 94 °C, 60 s, 62 °C, 60 s, 72 °C, 60 s. There was also an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min and a terminal extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The sense primer for 5-HT1A was 5′-ACCCCGACGCGTGCACCATCAG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCAGGCGGGGRCATAGGAG-3′ derived, respectively, from the second extracellular loop and the third intracytoplasmic loop of the rat and mouse 5-HT1A genes, which gave a 413-bp PCR product. This set of primers allowed detection of 5-HT1A mRNA in several positive controls including the cell lines LZD-7 and LM1A, which are derived from the mouse fibroblasts Ltk- cells transfected with the rat and mouse 5-HT1A cDNA, respectively, and in RNA extracts from rat and mouse brain. The sense primer for GAPDH was 5′-CAACGACCCCTTCATTGACCTC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GGAAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGC-3′, which gave a 602-bp PCR product. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with UV light. Detection and quantitation of 5-HT1A mRNA expression was carried out using an RNase protection assay (Direct Protect Lysate Ribonuclease Protection Assay Kit from Ambion) with 18 S ribosomal RNA as an internal standard. To prepare the template for 5-HT1A riboprobes, the first 860 bp of the mouse 5-HT1A cDNA were cut from the M1A-KS+ vector (11Charest A. Wainer B.H. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Pst I enzyme. This cDNA fragment was subsequently inserted in the antisense orientation with respect to the T3 RNA polymerase promoter found in the pBluescript II KS+ plasmid (Promega). To synthesize radiolabeled 5-HT1A antisense cRNA, the plasmid was linearized with the enzyme Bss HII and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion) and 50 μCi of 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP (Mandel, Guelph, Canada) using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting transcripts were then treated with 2 units of RNase-free DNase I at 37 °C for 15 min. The 18 S ribosomal RNA antisense probe was synthesized using a 18 S cDNA template (Ambion), which was transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 30 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Total RNA was extracted from samples of 106 cells in 50 μl of Lysis/Denaturing solution (Ambion) and coprecipitated with the freshly radiolabeled 5-HT1A (0.25 μCi) and 18 S (0.015 μCi) riboprobes, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. A volume of 500 μl of a RNase mix containing 5 units of RNase A and 200 units of RNase T1 (Ambion) was then added to the samples and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the unprotected riboprobes and RNA. The reaction was stopped by adding proteinase K and sodium sarkosyl, and by re-incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. The protected fragments were precipitated with 500 μl of isopropanol, resuspended in a gel loading buffer, and resolved on a 8 m urea, 5% acrylamide gel. The sizes of the expected protected fragments were 124 and 80 bp for 5-HT1Aand 18 S, respectively. Radiolabeled RNA transcripts from Century Marker Template set (Ambion) were used as size markers. The results were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (GS-525 Molecular Imager System, Bio-Rad). Relative 5-HT1A levels were calculated by normalizing the 5-HT1A mRNA band to that of the 18 S ribosomal RNA. A rabbit polyclonal anti-rat 5-HT1A receptor antiserum was used for this study. It is directed against a synthetic antigenic polypeptide that is derived from the third intracytoplasmic loop of the rat 5-HT1A receptor, with 92% homology with the corresponding region of mouse 5-HT1A protein. Extensive characterization of this antiserum has been reported elsewhere (26El Mestikawy S. Riad M. Laporte A.M. Vergé D. Duval G. Gozlan H. Hamon M. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 118: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and it cross-reacts with mouse 5-HT1A receptor. Samples of 106 cells were permeabilized with absolute ethanol (95%) at 4 °C for 30 min, and fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated overnight with anti-rat 5-HT1A receptor antiserum (1:1000) in Ab buffer consisting of PBS containing 1% (v/v) normal goat serum (Cederlane, Hornby, Canada). After several washings in PBS (three times for 10 min each time), cells were incubated in PE-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:250) for 1 h, and washed again in PBS (three times for 10 min each time). Cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using the LYSIS program provided by the manufacturer. For double staining of B or T lymphocytes, cells were stained first with FITC-conjugated anti-CD19 Ab or FITC-conjugated anti-Thy-1.2 Ab, and then with the anti-5-HT1A receptor antiserum followed by goat anti-rabbit-Ig-PE as described above. Cells (106) were layered 1 h at room temperature on microscope slides pretreated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. Slides were rinsed with PBS (50 mm, pH 7.4), fixed for 1 h at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and washed in PBS. Cells were then preincubated for 1 h in a blocking solution of PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% gelatin to saturate nonspecific sites, and incubated for 2 h with a 1/1000 dilution of rabbit anti-5-HT1A antiserum. After washes in PBS (three times for 10 min each time), the slides were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgGs diluted 1/1000 in blocking solution, rinsed in PBS (three times for 10 min each time), and incubated for 1 h with a 1/1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. This was followed by successive washes in PBS (two times for 10 min each time) and in Tris-HCl buffer (0.05 m, pH 7.4; two 10-min washes), and then incubated in hydrogen peroxide (0.01%) in the presence of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (0.05%) in Tris-HCl buffer. The reaction was stopped by several washes in the same buffer. The slides were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, followed by toluene, and coverslipped with DPX mountant (Fluka, Oakville, Canada). Immunocytochemical control consisted of processing slides as above, except for replacement of the anti-5-HT1A antiserum by preimmune rabbit serum at the same dilutions. Staining was examined by light microscopy (final magnification, ×400). Binding studies of [3H]WAY100635 were performed on unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, following the procedures described previously by us for [3H]8-OH-DPAT (18Iken K. Chheng S. Fargin A. Goulet A.C. Kouassi E. Cell Immunol. 1995; 163: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), except that [3H]WAY100635 was used at 0.5–15 nm, and that the Whatman GF/B filters through which cell suspensions were filtered were presoaked in a 0.5% aqueous solution of polyethylenimine for 30 min to limit nonspecific binding of the radioligand (28Gozlan H. Thibault S. Laporte A-M. Lima L. Hamon M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that 5-HT increases mitogen-stimulated murine B lymphocyte proliferation through a 5-HT1A receptor-mediated mechanism (18Iken K. Chheng S. Fargin A. Goulet A.C. Kouassi E. Cell Immunol. 1995; 163: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we used mouse splenocytes stimulated by the T cell mitogen PHA to determine whether T lymphocyte proliferation is influenced by 5-HT1A receptor ligands. Preliminary dose reponse studies indicated that 5-HT (10−11 to 10−4m) and the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist R-DPAT (10−11 to 10−4m) increased PHA-stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with optimal concentrations of 10−4m and 5 × 10−5m, respectively. Those maximally effective concentrations were used in combination with the relatively selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 to evaluate receptor specificity of 5-HT and R-DPAT action. Fig.1 A shows that 5 × 10−5m WAY100635 effectively abrogated 5-HT- and R-DPAT-mediated enhancement of activated T lymphocyte proliferation, thus implicating the 5-HT1Areceptor in the control of T cell proliferation. The combination of PMA plus ionomycin is known to bypass antigen receptor signaling in both B and T lymphocytes, engendering a potent activation and proliferation of these cells (29Truneh A. Albert F. Golstein P. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Nature. 1985; 313: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 30Klaus G.G. O'Garra A. Bijsterbosch M.K. Holman M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Li Y.S. Kouassi E. Revillard J.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1721-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test whether 5-HT1A ligands can influence B and T cell proliferation in this model, splenocytes were stimulated with a mitogenic combination of PMA (1 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml), in the presence of 5-HT or R-DPAT, with or without WAY100635. Fig. 1 B shows that 5-HT and R-DPAT increased splenocyte proliferation induced by PMA plus ionomycin, and that WAY100635 reversed agonist-induced mitogenic potentiation, further indicating a role for 5-HT1A receptor activation. Thus, we chose the model of mouse splenocytes incubated in the presence or absence of PMA plus ionomycin for most of the following experiments to further characterize the 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and protein which are expressed in B and T lymphocytes. The 5-HT1A receptor belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors are characterized by the presence of seven putative transmembrane domains showing a high degree of similarity between members of this family, whereas most sequence differences are seen in the extracellular and intracellular loops (6Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). We used primers derived from the second extracellular loop, and from the third cytoplasmic loop, to carry out PCR assays for 5-HT1A receptor on cDNA generated by RT of total RNA isolated from splenocytes before and after mitogenic stimulation with PMA (1 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (500 ng/ml). RNA samples from the mouse Ltk− and LM1A cell lines were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Fig.2 shows the presence of a 5-HT1A transcript in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes that was identical in size to the signal obtained in LM1A cells. Among a total of six experiments, 5-HT1A mRNA was expressed in all splenocyte samples stimulated by PMA plus ionomycin. In marked contrast, 5-HT1A mRNA was not detectable (n = 4) or only barely detectable (n = 2), in samples of unstimulated splenocytes, and in the latter case only if the amount of cDNA introduced in the PCR reaction was increased by a factor of at least 4-fold. Each of the RNA samples were also subjected to PCR assays without RT, and no DNA fragment was obtained, indicating that the product observed represented amplification of 5-HT1A cDNA, and did not result from amplification of contaminating genomic DNA. A quantitative analysis of 5-HT1Aup-regulation following treatment with various B and T cell mitogens was performed using the RNase protection assay. Splenocytes were incubated for different periods of time in the presence of culture medium (unstimulated control), LPS, PHA, ConA, or a combination of PMA plus ionomycin, and 5-HT1A mRNA levels were determined and normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA expression. Fig.3 shows that 5-HT1A mRNA was expressed in unstimulated splenocytes and was increased by all four mitogens in a time-dependent manner. The level of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was significantly enhanced after 24 h of incubation, reached a maximum at 48 h, and declined toward the level in unstimulated cells after 72 h of culture. As shown in Table I, relative to 5-HT1A mRNA level in freshly isolated splenocytes, the level of increase in 5-HT1A mRNA in splenocytes treated for 48 h with mitogens was 3.4-, 3.0-, 3.8-, and 4.9-fold with LPS, PHA, ConA, or PMA plus ionomycin, respectively. There was no increase in 5-HT1A expression in cells incubated for 48 h in the absence of mitogen. The level of 5-HT1Aexpression correlated positively with the frequency of mitogen-induced blast transformation which averaged 41%, 47%, 83%, and 88% in splenocytes stimulated for 48 h with LPS, PHA, ConA, and PMA plus ionomycin, respectively (Table I).Table IBlast transformation and up-regulation of 5-HT1A mRNA expression in mitogen-stimulated mouse splenocytesMitogenNo. of replicated experimentsBlast transformation1-aResting and blast cells were distinguished by flow cytometry based on their forward scatter-side scatter profiles, and the values indicated represent the percentage of blast cells within the total cell population.Increase in 5-HT1A mRNA expression1-bRelative levels of 5-HT1AmRNA were determined by RNase protection assay using 18 S rRNA as an internal standard. -Fold increase in 5-HT1A expression induced by mitogens was calculated by using the relative 5-HT1Alevel in freshly isolated splenocytes as a reference.%-foldNo mitogen75 ± 20.98 ± 0.17LPS441 ± 63.43 ± 1.41PHA447 ± 133.03 ± 1.26ConA483 ± 163.76 ± 1.42PMA-ionomycin788 ± 114.90 ± 1.90Freshly isolated mouse spleen cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence of culture medium or mitogen: LPS (10 μg/ml), PHA (20 μg/ml), ConA (5 μg/ml), or a c"

Fusion proteins containing either DnaX domains I–III or domains III–V bound δδ′ and χψ subunits. A DnaX protein only containing domains I and II did not bind δδ′ or χψ. The binding affinity of χψ for DnaX domains I–III and domains III–V was the same as that of χψ for full-length τ, indicating that domain III contained all structural elements required for χψ binding. Domain III of τ also contained δδ′ binding sites, although the interaction between δδ′ and domains III–V of τ was 10-fold weaker than the interaction between δδ′ and full length τ. The presence of both δ and χψ strengthened the δ′-C(0)τ interaction by at least 15-fold. Domain III was the only domain common to all of τ fusion proteins whose interaction with δ′ was enhanced in the presence of δ and χψ. Thus, domain III of the DnaX proteins not only contains the δδ′ and χψ binding sites but also contains the elements required for the positive cooperative assembly of the DnaX complex. The DnaX complex of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme assembles the β2 processivity factor onto the primed template enabling highly processive replication. The key ATPases within this complex are τ and γ, alternative frameshift products of the dna X gene. Of the five domains of τ, I–III are shared with γ In vivo, γ binds the auxiliary subunits δδ′ and χψ (Glover, B. P., and McHenry, C. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 3017–3020). To localize δδ′ and χψ binding domains within γ domains I–III, we measured the binding of purified biotin-tagged DnaX proteins lacking specific domains to δδ′ and χψ by surface plasmon resonance. Fusion proteins containing either DnaX domains I–III or domains III–V bound δδ′ and χψ subunits. A DnaX protein only containing domains I and II did not bind δδ′ or χψ. The binding affinity of χψ for DnaX domains I–III and domains III–V was the same as that of χψ for full-length τ, indicating that domain III contained all structural elements required for χψ binding. Domain III of τ also contained δδ′ binding sites, although the interaction between δδ′ and domains III–V of τ was 10-fold weaker than the interaction between δδ′ and full length τ. The presence of both δ and χψ strengthened the δ′-C(0)τ interaction by at least 15-fold. Domain III was the only domain common to all of τ fusion proteins whose interaction with δ′ was enhanced in the presence of δ and χψ. Thus, domain III of the DnaX proteins not only contains the δδ′ and χψ binding sites but also contains the elements required for the positive cooperative assembly of the DnaX complex. nitrilotriacetic acid single-stranded DNA-binding protein polymerase chain reaction resonance unit Processive and efficient replication of genomic DNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is facilitated by three conserved functional components: a DNA polymerase, a sliding clamp processivity factor and a multiple-subunit complex that loads the processivity factor onto a primed-template. In Escherichia coli, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is responsible for duplication of the genome in a rapid and processive manner. The holoenzyme contains ten different types of subunits and is composed of two DNA polymerase III cores (αεθ): two β2 sliding clamp processivity factors and the clamp-loading DnaX complex. The DnaX complex contains the DnaX proteins plus auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ. The distributive DNA polymerase III core becomes highly processive when the DnaX complex assembles the β processivity factor around DNA in an ATP-dependent process (for reviews see Refs. 1McHenry C.S.

The dna X gene produces two distinct proteins, τ and γ, which have differential interactions with replication proteins in the cell (4Kodaira M. Biswas S.B. Kornberg A. Mol. Gen.

Results presented in the first two reports in this series demonstrate that it is the C-terminal portion of τ, absent in the γ protein, that allows the full-length DnaX gene product to interact with both the DnaB helicase and the DNA polymerase III core. These τ-mediated interactions impart rapid fork movement and coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis, respectively (6Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J.

The focus of this investigation is the protein sequence common to both τ and γ. Functional homomeric DnaX complexes (τ complex, τ3δ1δ′1χ1ψ1, and γ complex, γ3δ1δ′1χ1ψ1) can be assembled in vitro (11Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Thus, the N-terminal 430 residues common to both τ and γ have the minimal protein sequence necessary not only to bind the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ but also to load the β processivity factor onto a primed template in an ATP-dependent manner. Within the DnaX complex, δ′ and ψ bind directly to γ; δ binds δ′, and χ binds ψ (13Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

The χ and ψ subunits also form a 1:1 complex and increase the affinity of DnaX for δ and δ′ so that a functional DnaX complex can be assembled at physiological subunit concentrations (16Olson M.W. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29570-29577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The χ subunit also interacts with SSB, consistent with the finding that χ-ψ-DnaX bridges strengthen the interactions between the holoenzyme and the SSB-coated lagging strand at the replication fork (17Kelman Z.

The focus of this report is to determine which structural domain(s) within the portion of DnaX common to both γ and τ (domains I–III) are responsible for binding the auxiliary subunits. To this end, the relative binding of δδ′ and χψ to a series of truncated DnaX proteins lacking specific structural domains was measured using surface plasmon resonance. E. coli strains DH5α and HB101 were used for initial molecular cloning procedures and plasmid propagation.E. coli strain BL21(λ DE3) was used for protein expression. CM5 sensor chips (research grade), P-20 surfactant, N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were obtained from BIAcore Inc. Ni2+-NTA1 resin, the QIAquick Gel extraction kit, QIAquick PCR purification kit, and the plasmid preparation kit were purchased from Qiagen. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein standards were from Life Technologies, Inc. d-Biotin was obtained from Sigma. Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent and Immunopure streptavidin were from Pierce. Buffer L, Buffer W, HBS buffer, and HKGM buffer were prepared as previously described (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plasmid PA1-N-Δ221τ encodes the fusion protein N-Δ221τ. The starting material for construction of plasmid PA1-N-Δ221τ was plasmid PA1-N-Δ1τ, which encodes the τ protein with the initiating methionine replaced by an N-terminal fusion peptide. PCR primer N-221p1 contained aPst I sequence at the noncomplementary 5′-region followed by a complementary sequence extending from codons 222 to 228 of dnaX(Table I). Primer N-221p2 was complimentary to a region located 102 bases downstream of the Nhe I site withindnaX. The resultant PCR fragment was digested withPst I and Nhe I and ligated into the linearized pPA1-N-Δ1τ to generate plasmid PA1-N-Δ221τ.Table IOligonucleotides used for construction of truncated τ fusion proteinsOligonucleotide numberUseSequence1-aThe underlined sequences are complementary to the dnaX gene template.N-221p1N-Δ221τAACTGCAGGACCAGGCGATTGCCAGCGGN-221p2N-Δ221τTGCAGACATACTGCGTTGTCGCTCTCCC-261p1C-Δ261τGCGAGATGCCTTAAGTCC-261p2C-Δ261τGGACTAGTTGCCGTTGGC-422p1C-Δ422τTTAAGTCTGACCAC-422p2C-Δ422τCTAGTGGTCAGAC1-a The underlined sequences are complementary to the dnaX gene template. Open table in a new tab Plasmid PA1-C-Δ261τ encodes the truncated fusion protein C-Δ261τ. To construct the plasmid PA1-C-Δ261τ, a partial dnaX gene sequence encoding the C-terminal 261 amino acids of τ was deleted from the previously constructed plasmid PA1-C(0)τ, which encodes the C-terminal tagged full-length τ protein (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PCR primer C-Δ261P1 was complementary to a region of dnaX located 430 bases upstream of the internal Rsr II site. Primer C-Δ261P2 was complementary to the dnaX from codons 380 to 382 followed by a noncomplementary Spe I cloning site (Table I). After digestion with Rsr II and Spe I, the resultant PCR fragment was ligated into the linearized pPA1-C(0)τ to generate pPA1-C-Δ261τ. Plasmid pET11-C-Δ422τ, which lacked the sequence encoding the C-terminal 422 amino acids of τ, was constructed as follows. pET11-C(0)τ was digested with Afl II and Spe I to delete a dnaX sequence encoding from residue 218 to the 3′ end (residue 643) of τ. The annealed oligonucleotides C-422p1 and C-422p2 containing the sequence encoding τ amino acid residues 218–221 were ligated into the linearized pET11-C(0)τ vector to generate pET11-C-Δ422τ (Table I). Plasmids PA1-C-Δ261τ, PA1-N-Δ221τ, and pET11-C-Δ422τ were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (λ DE3) for expression of proteins C-Δ261τ, N-Δ221τ, and C-Δ422τ, respectively. The transformed BL21 (λ DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of F medium (20Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced, biotin-treated, and harvested as previously described (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). C(0)τ, N-Δ1τ, and the other holoenzyme subunits were expressed and purified as previously described (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Induced BL21 cells containing the expression plasmids introduced in this study were lysed in the presence of lysozyme (2.5 mg/g of cells), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The expressed proteins C-Δ261τ, N-Δ221τ, and C-Δ422τ were precipitated from their corresponding lysate supernatants by addition of 0.226, 0.258, and 0.361 g of ammonium sulfate to each milliliter of the lysates, respectively. The fusion proteins were purified using Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography as previously described for PA1-N-Δ1τ (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), except that the bound C-Δ261τ was eluted stepwise in Buffer W containing 150 mmimidazole. For purification of C-Δ422τ, the imidazole concentration was 2 mm instead of 1 mm in the binding buffer and 15 mm instead of 23 mm in the washing buffer; the bound proteins were eluted stepwise as for C-Δ261τ. For purification of N-Δ221τ, the imidazole concentration was 15 mm in the washing buffer; the bound N-Δ221τ was eluted with 10 column volumes of 15–100 mm imidazole gradient in buffer W. The imidazole concentration in the peak fraction of N-Δ221τ was ∼55 mm. A BIAcoreTMinstrument was used for protein-protein binding analyses. CM5 research grade sensor chips were used for all experiments. Streptavidin was coupled to the sensor chip surface by theN-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide coupling (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Biotin-tagged τ fusion proteins (700–1600 RU) were then captured onto sensor chips via streptavidin-biotin interaction. τ-χψ binding studies were conducted in HKGM buffer at a flow rate of 25 μl/min at 20 °C. τ-δ′ and τ-δδ′ binding studies were performed in HKGM buffer containing 2% glycerol and 2 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 20 °C. In these studies, δ and δ′ were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature before injecting over the τ derivatized sensor chips. Kinetic parameters were determined using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software unless indicated otherwise. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis at constant current (20 mA) on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels. The gels were stained and destained as previously described (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Activities of τ fusion proteins were measured by their requirement for reconstitution of holoenzyme activity as previously described (19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We constructed three plasmids, each encoding specific structural domains of τ under control of an inducible promoter. Plasmid PA1-N-Δ221τ encoded protein N-Δ221τ (domains III–V), plasmid PA1-C-Δ261τ encoded protein C-Δ261τ (domains I–III), and plasmid pET11-C-Δ422τ encoded protein C-Δ422τ (domains I-II) (Fig.1). Each of these proteins contained a hexahistidine sequence to facilitate purification using Ni2+-NTA metal affinity chromatography and a short biotinylation sequence to enable immobilization on streptavidin-coated BIAcore sensor chips. The biotin tag also enabled detection of fusion proteins using biotin blots (21Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The expression levels of C-Δ261τ, N-Δ221τ, and C-Δ422τ were ∼3%, 2, and 0.5% of the total cell protein, respectively. After one round of Ni2+-NTA chromatography, N-Δ221τ and C-Δ261τ preparations at greater than 80% of purity were obtained; the purity of C-Δ422τ was ∼30%, as determined by densitometric scanning of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the eluted proteins fractions (Fig. 1). Biotin blots verified that these fusion proteins were the only biotinylated proteins in the eluted fractions (results not shown). The biotinylated proteins are presumably the only proteins captured onto the streptavidin sensor chips. This assumption was verified for a similarly purified protein (see footnote 2 in Ref. 19Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The activities of C-Δ261τ through its purification were measured in holoenzyme reconstitution assays. Purified C-Δ261τ had a specific activity of 5.3×106 units/mg, which is comparable with that of C(0)τ (Table II). As expected, N-Δ221τ was inactive in this same assay because its ATPase motif (domains I and II) was deleted. C-Δ422τ (domains I and II) was also inactive in this assay, suggesting that domains I–III represent the minimum protein required to assemble the β processivity factor onto the DNA template.Table IIPurification of τ deletion fusion proteinsProteinFractionTotal proteinActivitySpecific activity2-aFor comparison, the specific activity of C(0)τ of the Ni2+-NTA purified fractions is 5.7 × 106 units/mg.mgunits (106)units/mg (103)C-Δ261τILysate700200290IIAmmonium sulfate1201601000IIINi2+-NTA16855300N-Δ221τILysate1060No activityIIAmmonium sulfate2300IIINi2+-NTA430C-Δ422τILysate710No activityIIAmmonium sulfate314IIINi2+-NTA22-a For comparison, the specific activity of C(0)τ of the Ni2+-NTA purified fractions is 5.7 × 106 units/mg. Open table in a new tab The abilities of the truncated τ fusion proteins C-Δ261τ, N-Δ221τ, and C-Δ422τ to interact with χψ were measured by using BIAcore methodology. Because the χψ binding region is located within the N-terminal 430 amino acids of τ, a fusion peptide tag at the remote C terminus of τ would be unlikely to interfere with χψ binding. For this reason, C(0)τ was used as a positive control for examination of χψ binding to the truncated τ proteins. Biotin-tagged C(0)τ was immobilized onto a streptavidin sensor chip, and various concentrations of χψ (25–300 nm) were passed over immobilized C(0)τ so that binding of free χψ to immobilized C(0)τ could be measured. Representative binding curves (Fig.2 A) indicate that χψ bound rapidly to C(0)τ with an association rate of 2.4×105m−1 s−1. A dissociation rate of 2.5 × 10−3 s−1(Table III) was obtained; this rate was measured after saturating C(0)τ with χψ to minimize reassociation. The resultingK d 2K d values were obtained by dividing the measured dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant of a given interaction. In most cases, theK d values determined in this study were not true equilibrium K d values but were relative values used to compare the relative affinities of τ-derivatives for the same analytes.(10 ± 1 nm) was ∼5-fold higher than theK d reported for the native τ-χψ interaction. The observed difference between the K d values could be due to differences in experimental conditions between the two studies. For example, the present study used biotin-streptavidin rather than amine coupling and employed a 5-fold higher flow rate than did the other study.Table IIIInteractions of χψ with truncated and full-length τ fusion proteins: kinetic and equilibrium constantsImmobilized proteinsDissociation rate constant (k off)Association rate constant (k on)Dissociation constant (K D)Stoichiometry ratio of χψ/τ3-aThe stoichiometry of χψ/τ was determined by the following equation: stoichiometry = χψ response units/τ response units × τ Mr/χψ Mr. The tetrameric molecular weights of τ fusion proteins were used.NameDomainss−1m−1s−1nmC(0)τI–V2.5 × 10−32.4 × 10510 ± 10.66N-Δ1τI–V2.3 × 10−32.5 × 1059 ± 10.64C-Δ261τI–III1.5 × 10−31.4 × 10511 ± 10.72N-Δ221τIII–V2.2 × 10−35.3 × 1054 ± 0.20.73C-Δ422τI–IINo detectable interactionResults are the averages of two separate experiments, with the error expressed as the range of two data sets.3-a The stoichiometry of χψ/τ was determined by the following equation: stoichiometry = χψ response units/τ response units × τ Mr/χψ Mr. The tetrameric molecular weights of τ fusion proteins were used. Open table in a new tab Results are the averages of two separate experiments, with the error expressed as the range of two data sets. The interactions between χψ and the truncated fusion proteins N-Δ1τ, N-Δ221τ, C-Δ422τ, and C-Δ261τ were examined under the same experimental conditions as used for the χψ and C(0)τ interaction. N-Δ1τ, N-Δ221τ, and C-Δ261τ bound χψ, but C-Δ422τ did not (Fig. 2 B), indicating that domain III of τ, the only domain shared by all of the fusion proteins shown to bind χψ, is required for χψ binding. Similar binding stoichiometries were obtained for the interactions of χψ-N-Δ1τ and χψ-C-Δ261τ compared with that of the χψ-C(0)τ interaction (Table III). The K d for the interaction between χψ-N-Δ221τ was within 2.5-fold of that measured for the χψ-C(0)τ interaction. These variations are likely within range of accuracy of affinity measurements using a BIAcore and indicate that deletion of domains I and II or deletion of domains IV and V as well as the presence of the tag at the corresponding deletion end of the τ proteins did not decrease the affinity of the τ-χψ interaction. Thus, domain III of τ appears to be fully responsible for χψ binding. The interactions between δ′ and the full-length τ proteins with either an N- or C-terminal tag were characterized in binding studies utilizing the BIAcore instrumentation. δ′ samples were injected over the immobilized C(0)τ, and the binding curves are shown in Fig. 3 A. The interaction between δ′ and N-Δ1τ is characterized by weak binding similar to that observed for the δ′-C(0)τ interaction (TableIV). Although measurable, the weak binding observed is close to the limit of BIAcore detection.Table IVInteractions of δ′ with truncated and full-length τ fusion proteins: kinetic and equilibrium constantsImmobilized proteinsDissociation rate constant (k off)Association rate constant (k on)Dissociation constant (K D)Stoichiometry ratio of δ′/τ4-aThe stoichiometry of δ′/τ was determined by the following equation: stoichiometry = δ′ response units/τ response units × τM r/δ′ M r.

The tetrameric molecular weights of τ fusion proteins were used. Open table in a new tab Results are the averages of two separate experiments, with the error expressed as the range of two data sets. Next, the truncated DnaX proteins N-Δ221τ (domains III–V), C-Δ422τ (domains I-II), and C-Δ261τ (domains I–III) were captured onto streptavidin sensor chips so that the binding of δ′ to these proteins could be measured. The K dobserved for the δ′subunit-C-Δ261τ interaction was similar to that of the C(0)τ-δ′ interaction (Fig. 3 B and Table IV). These observations confirm that the δ′ binding region of τ is entirely within its N-terminal 382 amino acid residues (domains I–III). However, δ′ did not bind to N-Δ221τ or C-Δ422τ at concentrations of δ′ between 0.5–5 μm (Fig.3 B). Although we observed no interactions between δ′ and either domains I and II (C-Δ422τ) or domain III (N-Δ221τ), a lower limit for these K d values could be estimated by comparing N-Δ221τ -δ′ interaction with the C(0)τ-δ′ interaction. When 5 μm of δ′ was injected over the N-Δ221τ-derivatized sensor chip, no binding was observed. However, significant binding was obtained when 0.5 μm of δ′, a 10-fold less concentration, was injected over the C(0)τ derivatized sensor chip (Fig. 3); compatible amounts of C(0)τ and N-Δ221τ were on their respective derivatized sensor chips (see legend of Fig. 3for details). Thus, if there is an interaction between N-Δ221τ and δ′, the binding affinity is at least 10-fold weaker than that of the C(0)τ-δ′ interaction (500 nm). The δ subunit has a positive cooperative effect on the τ-δ′ interaction (22Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because interactions between δ′ and domain III or domains I and II of DnaX may have been too weak to be detectable by our methodology, we re-examined binding using δδ′ instead of δ′. This enabled us to evaluate whether the cooperative effects of δ strengthen the binding of δ′ to the various DnaX domain constructs to detectable levels. In the following studies, the concentrations of δ′ in all of the δδ′ samples tested were greater than the K d of δ-δ′ interaction, 3M. Song, H. G. Dallmann, P. Pham, R. Schaaper, and C. S. McHenry, manuscript in preparation. and the concentrations of δ were 5–10 fold higher than those of δ′. Thus, nearly all the δ′ in these experiments was bound to δ to form δδ′. When injected over immobilized C(0)τ (Fig.4 A), δδ′ bound C(0)τ with an association rate of 4 × 103m−1 s−1. The dissociation of δ and δ′ from the immobilized C(0)τ was complicated because two separate dissociation events were occurring simultaneously. One process was the dissociation of δδ′ from the immobilized C(0)τ, and the other was the dissociation of δ from δ′ still bound to immobilized C (0). Thus, the total dissociation rate measured in these studies was actually reflective of contributions from these two different processes.

Samples of δδ′ at the same concentrations used for analysis of the C(0)τ-δδ′ interaction were then passed over the N-Δ221τ and C-Δ422τ derivatized sensor chips. No binding of C-Δ422τ to δδ′ was observed, but N-Δ221τ bound δδ′ at each concentration of δδ′ that was tested (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that N-Δ221τ contains the δδ′ binding site. The K d of δδ′-N-Δ221τ interaction was 1.5 μm, which is only 10-fold weaker than that of the δδ′-C(0)τ interaction. 10 μm of the δ subunit alone was injected over the immobilized C(0)τ, C-Δ261τ, and N-Δ221τ. No interaction was observed (data not shown), consistent with the report that there is no interaction between τ and δ (13Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interactions between C(0)τ-δ′ and C-Δ261τ-δ′ could be easily detected under the same experimental conditions. Thus, the ability to detect the N-Δ221τ- δδ′ interaction resulted from the positive cooperative effect of δ on the τ-δ′ interaction; the deletion of domains I and II of τ did not abolish this cooperativity. Thus, domain III not only binds χψ and δδ′ but also contains the elements required for the positive cooperative effect of δ on the δ′-DnaX interaction. This is also evidenced by similar decreases in theK d values of C-Δ261τ-δ′ and N-Δ1τ-δ′ interactions in the presence of δ (Table V). An alternative explanation is that δ can weakly interact with DnaX; even though the interaction is too weak to be observed by itself the interaction could lead to an increase in binding of δ′ to DnaX because of the additivity of the binding energies. The observation that χψ increases both τ-δδ′ and γ-δδ′ binding affinity indicated that the sequence required for the positive cooperative effect of χψ is localized in the γ portion of DnaX (16Olson M.W.

We report here that EGF increases radiosensitivity in both human fibroblasts and lymphoblasts and down-regulates both ATM (mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T)) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). No further radiosensitization was observed in A-T cells after pretreatment with EGF. The down-regulation of ATM occurs at the transcriptional level. Concomitant with the down-regulation of ATM, the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor Sp1 decreased. A causal relationship was established between these observations by demonstrating that up-regulation of Sp1 DNA binding activity by granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor rapidly reversed the EGF-induced decrease in ATM protein and restored radiosensitivity to normal levels. Failure to radiosensitize EGF-treated cells to the same extent as observed for A-T cells can be explained by induction of ATM protein and kinase activity with time post-irradiation. Although ionizing radiation damage to DNA rapidly activates ATM kinase and cell cycle checkpoints, we have provided evidence for the first time that alteration in the amount of ATM protein occurs in response to both EGF and radiation exposure. Taken together these data support complex control of ATM function that has important repercussions for targeting ATM to improve radiotherapeutic benefit.

It is also likely that recognition of a specific form of DNA damage represents the trigger for ATM to activate a number of cell cycle checkpoints (8Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat.

Evidence for a direct involvement of ATM with p53 was provided by the demonstration that these two molecules interact directly (13Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and ATM phosphorylates p53 on serine 15 in response to DNA damage (14Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L.

Pre-existing ATM protein is rapidly activated by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic agents by an undescribed mechanism (13Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 14Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y.

Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation fails to change either the subcellular distribution or the total amount of cellular ATM protein (16Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K.

Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2707-2716PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATM protein levels are relatively constant throughout the cell cycle in human fibroblasts (17Brown K.D. Ziv Y.

These data point to a post-translational mechanism of activation for ATM. However, there is evidence for alteration in the amount of ATM under certain conditions. Although ATM is not detectable by immunohistochemical staining in quiescent myoepithelial cells lining normal breast ducts, significant expression is observed in the proliferative myoepithelium of sclerosing adenosis (19Clarke R.A. Kairouz R. Watters D. Lavin M.F. Kearsley J.H. Soon-Lee C. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition the amount of ATM protein changes dramatically in quiescent lymphocytes (PBMCs) in response to mitogenic agents (20Fukao T. Kaneko H. Birrell G. Gatei M. Tashata H. Kasahara K. Cross S. Kedar P. Watters D. Khanna K.K. Misko I. Kondo N. Lavin M.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter study a 6–10-fold increase in ATM in PBMCs was observed in response to PHA, reaching a maximum by 3–4 days. As the amount of ATM protein increased, so too did its protein kinase activity. Clearly this is a slow response compared with the rapid activation of ATM post-irradiation. Alteration in the amount of the ATM protein could occur by transcriptional control at the promoter. The housekeeping geneNPAT/E14/CAND3 lies ∼0.55 kb from the 5′ end of the ATM gene (21Byrd P.J.

These genes share a bidirectional promoter that contains CCAAT boxes and 4 consensus sites for the Sp1 transcription factor (21Byrd P.J. McConville C.M. Cooper P. Parkhill J. Stankovic T.

Further delineation of the ATM promoter is required to assist in understanding the transcriptional regulation of ATM. ATM is located predominantly in the nucleus of proliferating cells, which is in keeping with its role in DNA damage recognition and cell cycle control, but ATM has also been detected in cytoplasmic vesicles (16Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M.F.

Since ATM has been implicated in more general intracellular signaling and since it responds to mitogenic agents, we studied its possible regulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) that alters cellular response to radiation. EGF enhances the radiosensitivity of some cell types (25Balaban N. Moni J. Shannon M. Dang L. Murphy E. Goldkorn T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P.

Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1994; 30: 91-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We show here that EGF enhanced the radiosensitivity of both fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, and this was associated with a decrease in ATM. Reduction in ATM protein was accompanied by a decrease in the amount of Sp1 DNA binding activity. We also demonstrate that ATM protein is rapidly restored to constitutive levels by both granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and ionizing radiation, and this appears to be achieved by increasing Sp1 DNA binding activity. Normal human skin fibroblasts HSF7 and NFF were from healthy donors expressing ATM protein; A-T fibroblasts GM03395 were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories. Lymphoblastoid cells were established by Epstein-Barr virus transformation from healthy individuals, C3ABR, C28ABR, C35ABR, C2ABR, and C31ABR. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Irradiation of cells was performed at room temperature using a137Cs source delivering gamma rays at a dose rate of 2.8 Gy/min. EGF (R & D Systems) was added at a concentration of 50 ng/ml to the culture medium of log-phase cultures or serum-reduced fibroblasts for various times as indicated. The antibodies used are as follows: p53 monoclonal antibody (polyclonal antibody 1801) and polyclonal Sp1 antibody (Sp1pEp2) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal α-actin (A4700) was from Sigma; polyclonal anti-Ku and DNA-PKcs antibodies were obtained from Susan Lees-Miller, University of Calgary, Canada; anti-phosphorylated p53 serine 15 was obtained from New England Biolabs; and monoclonal ATM (CT1) and polyclonal ATM raised in sheep (ATM5BA) antibodies were generated in this laboratory. Logarithmically growing lymphoblastoid cells were incubated with or without EGF (50 ng/ml) for 16 h prior to exposure to ionizing radiation (2.5 Gy/min, 137Cs). Cell viability was determined at daily intervals between 1 and 4 days by adding 0.1 ml of 0.4% trypan blue to a 0.5-ml cell suspension as described previously, and viable cells were counted (30Zhang N. Chen P. Gatei M. Scott S. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8021-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). EGF treatment was carried out on log-phase cells for different times as indicated. After washing in PBS, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 40 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) and disrupted by at least 4 freeze-thaw cycles. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and 50–100 μg was used per sample. Protein samples were separated on 5 or 10% denaturing gels and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in 4% milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20, PBS for at least 1 h, the blot was incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, with the relevant primary antibody. The blot was washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS and incubated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h. Following several washing steps, the blot was developed using a chemiluminescence kit (DuPont). Changes in ATM mRNA in lymphoblastoid cells were determined by quantitative PCR as described (31Tashita H. Fukao T. Kaneko H. Teramoto T. Inoue R. Kasahara K. Kondo N. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In short, known amounts of a 402-bp DNA fragment corresponding to an ATM mutation lacking exon 38 (5319 G to A) was used as a competitor during amplification of the corresponding region in ATM cDNA from normal cells, which gives a 544-bp fragment (nucleotides 5122–5665). A series of 2-fold dilutions were employed to find the equivalence point and thus a measure of the amount of ATM mRNA. Expression of mRNA was also determined by Northern blotting. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from log-phase cells with an RNA isolation kit (Qiaquick, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 20 μg of RNA/lane was separated on a 1% agarose gel. Blotting of RNA on nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed overnight by capillary force followed by hybridization with an ATM cDNA probe. The DNA binding activity of transcription factor Sp1 was determined by modification of a method described previously (32Sahijdak W.M. Yang C.R. Zuckerman J.S. Meyers M. Boothman D.A. Radiat. Res. 1994; 138: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF), and incubated for 15 min on ice. After addition of 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, the cells were subsequently vortexed for 10 s and the nuclei pelleted by centrifugation (1 min, 13,000 × g at 4 °C). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) and rotated for 30–60 min at 4 °C to elute nuclear proteins. After additional centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until used in binding reactions. Approximately 35 fmol of 32P-radiolabeled double-strand Sp1 consensus sequence (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′;Promega) (labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase) was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 1 μg of herring sperm DNA and 20 μg of BSA in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) in a 20-μl reaction. Binding was for 25 min at room temperature before DNA-protein complexes were separated on a native 5% acrylamide gel. Exposure time to x-ray film was usually 30–45 min. The ATM promoter was amplified from human genomic DNA using primers (forward, 5-TCCCCCGGGGGAGATCAAAACCACAGCAGG, and reverse, 5-CCCAAGCTTGGGCGTTCTCTCGCCTCCTCCCGTG). The 615-bp amplification product was cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) using a SmaI/HindIII digest. This construct (pGL3-ATM) was cotransfected with the pRL-CMV vector (Promega) at a ratio of 2:1 into lymphoblastoid cells by electroporation (280 V, 960 microfarads, 1 pulse). Thirty six hours after electroporation the cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml EGF for a further 16 h before cell extracts were prepared. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega, E1910). Briefly, 100 μl of firefly luciferase substrate (LARII) and 20 μl of cell extract were mixed, and the reaction was immediately measured for 10 s. Then 100 μl of Renilla luciferase substrate including an inhibitor for firefly luciferase (Stop & Glow) was added, and light emission was detected for another 10-s interval. The ratio of both measurements (pGL/pRL) results in the relative luciferase activity, avoiding variabilities in transfection. The absolute values of luminescence measured (relative light unit) was generally in the range of 5·104–5·106. The untreated control was set to 1. ATM kinase activity after EGF treatment was determined using the method described by Canman et al.(15Canman C.E. Lim D.-S. Cimprich K.A. Taka Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). For whole cell lysate isolation, cells were lysed on ice in TGN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmDTT). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min, 2 mg of extract was precleared with mouse immunoglobulin G and protein A/G-Sepharose beads. ATM was immunoprecipitated with anti-ATM antibody (ATM5BA) and kinase activity determined as described. Engagement of the EGF receptor by EGF and other ligands initiates signal transduction pathways giving rise to mitogenesis and can also alter the radiosensitivity status of cells (25Balaban N. Moni J.

We determined whether EGF might increase the sensitivity of human fibroblasts and lymphoblasts by incubating cells in EGF for 16 h prior to exposure to radiation (1–4 Gy). The results in Fig.1 A demonstrate that EGF-treated lymphoblastoid cells are more sensitive to radiation, and this is observed over the radiation dose range 1–4 Gy (Fig.1 B). The effect of EGF treatment was significant for both dose and time course experiments for C3ABR; p = 0.0023 (α), p = 0.0053 (β) for dose and p= 0.0065 (α) and p = 0.07 (β) for time course. On the other hand treatment of A-T cells with EGF failed to increase the radiosensitivity of these cells (Fig. 1, A andB). A similar sensitization was observed in EGF-treated control fibroblasts, but again no further increase in sensitivity was revealed in EGF-treated A-T fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C). We observed that EGF receptor was activated under these conditions (results not shown). Since radiosensitivity and abnormalities in mitogenesis and other signaling pathways are characteristic of the A-T phenotype, we initially determined whether the radiosensitizing effect of EGF might be due to alteration in the amount of ATM protein in normal control cells. Immunoblotting with anti-ATM antibodies showed that the amount of ATM protein was reduced significantly with time after incubation with EGF in normal fibroblasts (Fig.2 A). No ATM was detected in negative control AT3ABR cells, as expected (16Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The same pattern of reduction was observed for the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PKcs, after EGF treatment, but Ku, the DNA damage recognition component of DNA-dependent protein kinase, remained largely unchanged (Fig. 2 A). It is evident that the amount of DNA-PKcs is normal in the A-T cell line, AT3ABR, when compared with C3ABR. EGF treatment of C3ABR lymphoblastoid cells revealed a similar pattern of loss of expression of ATM, down to 30% by 9 h post-treatment (Fig. 2 B). A similar pattern of decrease was also observed for DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1 B). To test the universality of these observations we employed several control lymphoblastoid cell lines. In all four control lines investigated, ATM protein decreased significantly after EGF treatment (Fig. 2 C). It is evident from the positive control (100 μg of extract from the lymphoblastoid cell line, C3ABR) that the amount of ATM protein in HSF7 fibroblasts (at equal loading) is considerably lower than that in lymphoblastoid cells (Fig. 2 A). Since EGF caused a marked decrease in the amount of ATM protein, it was possible that this was due to transcriptional down-regulation. To monitor changes to ATM mRNA in lymphoblastoid cells, we employed quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (31Tashita H. Fukao T. Kaneko H. Teramoto T. Inoue R. Kasahara K. Kondo N. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment (402 bp) corresponding to an ATM mutation (G5319A), which lacks exon 38, was used as a competitor for ATM cDNA amplification (nucleotides 5122–5665, 544 bp in size) in a series of 2-fold dilutions from C3ABR cells. After 8 h of treatment with EGF, an equivalent point was reached at 0.625 attomol/μl of competitor compared with 1.25 attomol/μl for untreated cells representing an ∼2-fold reduction in ATM mRNA in response to EGF (Fig.3 A). After 16 h of treatment with EGF the equivalent point was reached at ∼0.4 attomol representing a 3-fold reduction in ATM mRNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that ATM mRNA was reduced to 60% after incubation of normal fibroblasts (HSF7) with EGF for 8 h and reached a plateau at ∼30% of the untreated value at 12–24 h post-treatment, which parallels the changes shown by reverse transcriptase-PCR in lymphoblastoid cells (Fig. 3 B). A similar genomic organization at the ATM locus exists for the human and mouse genes where ATM and nuclear protein at the A-T locus (NPAT) are arranged ∼0.5 kb apart in a head-to-head configuration (Fig.5 A) (21Byrd P.J. McConville C.M. Cooper P. Parkhill J. Stankovic T. McGuire G.M. Thick J.A. Taylor A.M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Imai T. Yamauchi M. Seki N. Sugawara T. Saito T. Matsuda Y. Ito H. Nagase T. Nomura N. Hori T. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These two genes are transcribed from a central bidirectional promoter that contains several binding sites for the transcriptional factor, Sp1 (33Saito T. Matsuda Y. Ishii H. Watanabe F. Mori M. Hayashi A. Araki R. Fujimori A. Fukumura R. Morimyo M. Tatsumi K. Hori T. Abe M. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since ATM mRNA and protein were reduced after EGF treatment, we predicted that this might be due to interference with or reduced Sp1 DNA binding activity. Use of gel-shift analysis with an oligonucleotide-binding consensus sequence for Sp1 revealed the presence of a single, well defined, retarded band (Fig.4 A). The amount of Sp1 binding in extracts from C3ABR cells decreased with time after EGF treatment (Fig. 4 A). A decrease of ∼50% by 12 h post-treatment, leveling off at later times, paralleled the decrease in the amount of ATM mRNA and protein seen previously. To establish the specificity of this binding, we added anti-Sp1 antibody to the incubation mixture and observed a supershift of the retarded band (Fig.4 A, lower panel). A control antibody against p53 did not alter migration of the band. In addition excess cold Sp1 binding consensus oligonucleotide successfully competed for binding, whereas cold AP-1 binding oligonucleotide failed to do so (results not shown). Under these conditions the amount of Sp1 protein did not change (Fig.4 B). When Sp1 binding was determined in four additional cell lines a similar decrease was observed in all cases (Fig.4 C).Figure 4Effect of EGF on nuclear protein binding to an Sp1-binding consensus sequence in lymphoblastoid cells. A, nuclear extracts (20 μg), prepared at different times after EGF addition from C3ABR, were incubated with32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (22-mer) containing a single Sp1-binding site. Free and retarded fragments were separated on native 5% acrylamide gels. 1st lane is free fragment only. An Sp1 supershift assay was employed to establish the specificity of binding. Incubation of nuclear extract and labeled fragment was carried out followed by addition of 1 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice prior to gel electrophoresis. Anti-p53 antibody (Oncogene Science) was used as a control. Quantitation of binding activity was determined by densitometry.B, Sp1 levels were determined by immunoblotting 20 μg of nuclear extract from each sample in A. Actin was used as a loading control. C, several different lymphoblastoid cells (C3ABR, C28ABR, C35ABR, and C31ABR) were treated with EGF for 16 h prior to preparation of extracts for binding to the Sp1 consensus sequence as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the effect of EGF on the transcriptional regulation of ATM, we cloned the common promoter region between ATM and NPAT into a luciferase reporter construct (Fig.5) and carried out transient transfections in control lymphoblastoid cells. Exposure of transfected C3ABR cells to EGF for 16 h led to a significant down-regulation of luciferase activity in cells transfected with the ATM promoter construct in agreement with loss of Sp1 binding activity (Fig. 5). The parallel decrease of ATM and Sp1 binding activity together with the down-regulation of ATM promoter activity after EGF treatment suggested that the decrease in Sp1 binding led to reduced ATM. To test this we employed GM-CSF that has been shown to increase markedly the DNA binding activity of Sp1 (34Borellini F. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed above, treatment of cells with EGF for 16 h down-regulated the amount of Sp1 binding activity (Fig. 6 A, 3rd lane) and subsequent addition of GM-CSF to these cells caused a rapid (within 1 h) re"

The transport process is independent of the repeat structure of the polysaccharide, and translocation across the periplasm requires the cytoplasmic membrane-anchored protein KpsE and the periplasmic protein KpsD. In this paper we establish the topology of the KpsE protein and demonstrate that the C terminus interacts with the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane. By chemical cross-linking we show that KpsE is likely to exist as a dimer and that dimerization is independent of the other Kps proteins or the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide. No interaction between KpsD and KpsE could be demonstrated by chemical cross-linking, although in the presence of both KpsE and Lpp, KpsD could be cross-linked to a 7-kDa protein of unknown identity. In addition, we demonstrate that KpsD is present not only within the periplasm but is also in both the cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions and that the correct membrane association of KpsD was dependent on KpsE, Lpp, and the secreted polysaccharide molecule. Both KpsD and KpsE showed increased proteinase K sensitivity in the different mutant backgrounds, reflecting conformational changes in the KpsD and KpsE proteins as a result of the disruption of the transport process.

It requires the translocation of a high molecular weight negatively charged macromolecule across two lipid bilayers. Understanding this process offers potential benefits in terms of engineering polysaccharides of biomedical importance in bacteria and in designing new antimicrobials that inhibit this process. In contrast to protein secretion, our understanding of how capsular polysaccharide transport is achieved is currently scant. The expression of capsular polysaccharides (or K antigens) in Escherichia coli offers an experimentally tractable system in which to try to understand the mechanisms of polysaccharide transport. E. coli can express over 80 chemically and serologically distinct capsular polysaccharides that have been divided into four groups according to a number of biochemical and genetic criteria (1Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Group 2 capsules resemble those found on the surfaces of Neisseria meningitidis and Hemophilus influenzae and are often expressed by pathogenic E. coli isolates causing extraintestinal disease (2Robbins J.B. McCracken G.H. Gotschlich E.C. Orskov I. Hanson L.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 90: 267-271Google Scholar). The biochemistry and genetics ofE. coli group 2 capsules, as typified by the K1 and K5 antigens, have been studied in most detail (reviewed in Refs. 1Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 3Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, and4Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Group 2 capsules are synthesized by a hetero-oligomeric membrane-bound biosynthetic complex on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases that elongate the polysaccharide at its nonreducing end (5Rigg G.P. Barrett B. Roberts I.S. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A common export pathway, irrespective of the repeat structure of the particular polysaccharide molecule, is then used to translocate group 2 capsules from their site of synthesis onto the cell surface (3Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 6Roberts I.S. Mountford R. Hodge R. Jann K.B. Boulnois G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated by the KpsC, M, S, and T proteins, whereas translocation across the periplasm and outer membrane involves the KpsD and E proteins (1Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 3Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 4Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The KpsC and S proteins are believed to attach phosphatidyl-Kdo1 to the reducing end of the nascent polysaccharide chain, and this substitution permits the entry of the polysaccharide molecule into the export pathway (1Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 3Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 7Bronner D. Sieberth V. Pazzani C. Roberts I.S. Boulnois G.J. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5984-5992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the enzymology of this process still awaits elucidation. Translocation of the polysaccharide across the cytoplasmic membrane is achieved by the KpsM and T proteins that constitute an ABC-2 (ATP-binding cassette type 2) transporter (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), in which KpsM is the integral membrane protein and KpsT is the ATPase (9Smith A.N. Boulnois G.J. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Pavelka M.S. Wright L.F. Silver R.P. J.

Typically such ABC-2 transporters involved in polysaccharide export require two accessory proteins to complete the export process, a cytoplasmic membrane-periplasmic auxiliary protein (MPA), of which KpsE is an example, and an outer membrane auxiliary protein (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on computer analysis, a predicted topology has been suggested for MPA proteins in which the protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via N- and C-terminal membrane-spanning domains separated by a large periplasmic domain (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Typically, outer membrane auxiliary proteins are modified by the signal peptidase II to yield a lipoprotein (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and, in the case of group I capsular polysaccharides, have been shown to form aggregates in the outer membrane (13Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The role of KpsD as an outer membrane auxiliary protein is less clear as it has only limited homology to members of this family (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, KpsD has a typical N-terminal signal sequence and is believed to be a soluble periplasmic protein (14Silver R.P. Aaronson W. Vann W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5489-5495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such its role in the export of group 2 capsular polysaccharides is unclear. In this paper we demonstrate that the C terminus of KpsE interacts with the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane probably via an amphipathic α-helix. By chemical cross-linking we demonstrate that KpsE is likely to exist as a dimer and that dimerization is independent of the other Kps proteins or the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide. No interaction between KpsD and KpsE could be demonstrated by chemical cross-linking although in the presence of both KpsE and Lpp, KpsD could be cross-linked to a 7-kDa protein of unknown identity. In contrast, both KpsD and KpsE showed increased sensitivity to proteinase K when either KpsE or KpsD were absent. The KpsD protein was detected not only in the periplasm but also in both the cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions, and the correct membrane association of KpsD was dependent on KpsE, Lpp, and the secreted polysaccharide molecule. Collectively, the data suggest that the trans-periplasmic export of group 2 capsular polysaccharide involves KpsD acting as the link between the cytoplasmic membrane transporter and the outer membrane with KpsE acting to facilitate this transport process.

Proteinase K was added at a final concentration of 500 μg ml−1, and spheroplasts were incubated at 37 °C for the appropriate time before the enzyme was inhibited by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20%. Carboxypeptidases A and B were added to final concentrations of 200 and 100 μg ml−1, respectively, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before the enzyme was inhibited by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the pellet was washed with acetone, dissolved in the appropriate volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Cells were fractionated to give cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane fractions using a modification of the method of Maier et al. (22Maier C. Bremer E. Schmid A. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2493-2499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 400-ml culture was grown to an A 600 nm of 0.8 and cooled on ice. Cells were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in 25 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm DTT, and 20 mg of DNase I were added. Bacteria were disrupted by passing them three times through a French pressure cell at 20,000 pounds/square inch or by sonication (5-s bursts with 10-s intervals for 3 min) on ice, and unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (7,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation (80,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C), and the resultant supernatant containing the cytoplasmic and periplasmic fractions was then decanted and saved for further analysis. The pellet containing the membrane fraction was washed with 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm DTT. The membranes were resuspended in ∼1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm DTT and layered on top of a two-step sucrose gradient (7.5 ml of 54% (w/v) sucrose on a cushion of 3 ml of 70% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16–18 h at 6 °C, and fractions were collected from the sides of the tube with 23-gauge needles connected to 1-ml syringes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Following trichloroacetic acid precipitation the activity of the periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase and the cytoplasmic enzyme malate dehydrogenase were assayed according to the method of de Maagd and Lugtenberg (23de Maagd R.A. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1083-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to check for contamination of the membrane fractions with cytoplasmic and periplasmic enzymes. β-NADH oxidase activity was measured in all the fractions from the gradient as a marker for the cytoplasmic membrane fractions (24Dobrogozs W.J. Gerhardt P. Manual of Methods for General Microbiology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1981: 365-392Google Scholar), and the level of Kdo was used as a marker for the outer membrane (25Karkhanis Y.D. Zeltner J.Y. Jackson J.J. Carlo D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were typically found to exhibit less than 2% total alkaline phosphatase and 3% total malate dehydrogenase activities indicating that they were essentially free of periplasmic and cytoplasmic contamination. Cytoplasmic plus periplasmic fractions were found to contain less than 4% of the total amount of Kdo and 5% total β-NADH oxidase activity. Cytoplasmic membrane fractions were found to contain less than 2% of total amount of Kdo, and outer membrane fractions contained no more than 3% total β-NADH oxidase activity, suggesting that these fractions were also predominantly free from contamination from other fractions of the gradient. Cross-linking with was carried out as described previously (26Hammarton T.C. Analyses of the KpsE Protein of Escherichia coli K5Ph.D. thesis. University of Manchester, Manchester, UK1999Google Scholar). Previous attempts using β-lactamase fusions as topology probes had established that KpsE was anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain located between residues 28 and 49 (21). However, these studies failed to assign an unequivocal location for the C terminus of KpsE and to establish whether the predicted C-terminal transmembrane domain located between residues 362 and 379 spanned the cytoplasmic membrane as predicted for MPA2 proteins (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether the C terminus of KpsE is exposed in the periplasm, spheroplasts of the strain JM109[DE3] (pACYC184, pTH1), which expresses full-length KpsE protein (26Hammarton T.C. Analyses of the KpsE Protein of Escherichia coli K5Ph.D. thesis. University of Manchester, Manchester, UK1999Google Scholar), were incubated with either proteinase K or carboxypeptidases A and B. The digestion products were analyzed by Western blot using antisera to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, β-lactamase, KpsE, or EnvZ (Fig.1). The periplasmic enzyme, β-lactamase, was fully degraded by proteinase K and extensively degraded by carboxypeptidases A and B (Fig. 1). The extra bands of decreasing molecular weight seen in the presence of carboxypeptidases A and B can be explained by the slow release by these enzymes of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and glycine residues, all of which occur in the C-terminal 30 amino acids of β-lactamase. KpsE was also completely digested by proteinase K, confirming the presence of a large periplasmic loop (Fig. 1). The addition of carboxypeptidases A and B resulted in a limited digestion of KpsE, leading to a predominant truncated product ∼1.0 kDa smaller than wild type KpsE (Fig. 1) confirming that the C terminus of KpsE is exposed to the periplasm. No degradation of the cytoplasmic enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase could be detected (Fig. 1), confirming the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane. To confirm the carboxypeptidase results, Western blot analysis using antisera against EnvZ was performed. EnvZ is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with cytoplasmic N and C termini with an extended periplasmic domain (27Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.A. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No degradation of EnvZ was detectable following carboxypeptidase treatment (Fig. 1) confirming that the limited degradation of KpsE is due to the action of carboxypeptidase. To establish whether the hydrophobic C terminus of KpsE interacts with either the cytoplasmic or outer membrane, plasmid pTH56 was generated. This plasmid encodes the C-terminal 29 amino acids of KpsE fused in frame onto the C terminus of wild type β-lactamase. Cells of strain PA360(pTH56) were fractionated by a two-step sucrose gradient to give cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions and subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). As predicted, wild type β-lactamase encoded by pBR322 was located in the soluble periplasmic fraction (Fig. 2), whereas in the case of pTH56, the presence of the C terminus of KpsE resulted in the localization of a significant amount of the β-lactamase fusion protein to the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 2). The exposure of this fusion protein in the periplasm was confirmed by proteinase K treatment of spheroplasts prior to Western blot analysis. In both cases the proteins were digested by proteinase K, whereas no degradation of cytoplasmic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was observed indicating that the cytoplasmic membranes of the spheroplasts were intact throughout the experiment (data not shown). The observation that plasmid pTH56 conferred resistance to ampicillin at levels greater than 100 μg ml−1 and that the fusion was sensitive to carboxypeptidase digestion (data not shown) confirms that the β-lactamase fusion protein is functional and is anchored to the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane rather than being trapped in an unfolded state in the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, the C-terminal 29 amino acids of KpsE appear to be sufficient to localize β-lactamase, the archetypal soluble periplasmic protein, to the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting an intimate interaction between the C-terminal part of KpsE and the cytoplasmic membrane. The lack of other Kps proteins in strain PA360 would indicate that this association is not dependent on the interaction between the C terminus of KpsE and other Kps proteins. To determine the interactions between KpsE and other proteins involved in capsule transport, whole cells of strain MS101 (TableI) were treated with the chemical cross-linking agent DSP. Strains with specific defects either in capsule export or in the production of several major proteins in the bacterial envelope (see below) were also analyzed in this way. The cross-linked proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using antisera specific to KpsE and KpsD. In MS101 four major cross-linked complexes were detected after treatment with DSP when KpsE-specific antiserum was used (Fig.3, panel A). The most predominant cross-linked product had a molecular weight consistent with that of a dimer of KpsE. The three other cross-linked products had molecular weights of 110, 130 and in excess of 200 kDa (Fig. 3,panel A). Continued incubation with DSP resulted in higher molecular weight complexes that were difficult to resolve by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The same pattern of cross-linking was seen in mutants lacking either KpsD, KpsM, KpsT, KpsS, or outer membrane proteins Pal, Lpp, OmpT, LamB, OmpF, OmpA, and OmpC (data not shown) suggesting that these proteins were not being cross-linked to KpsE. Cross-linking using cells expressing kpsE as the only gene from the capsular cluster resulted in the same pattern of cross-linking to that observed in MS101 (data not shown) indicating that the probable dimerization of KpsE is not dependent upon the expression of the polysaccharide molecule or on the presence of other Kps proteins. In all cases the cross-linking could be reversed by incubation in the presence of 50 mm DTT (data not shown). The ability of the purified KpsE protein to dimerize in vitro (Fig. 3, panel B) would suggest that the cross-linked complex at 86 kDa is likely to be dimeric KpsE. When KpsD-specific antiserum was used to analyze the cross-linked products, a complex of 67 kDa was detected in MS101 but not in MSFE101 or MSCA102 (Fig. 4). Strain MSCA102 is an isogenic lpp mutant of MS101 that lacks the 7-kDa major outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp. However, Western blot analysis using Lpp-specific antisera failed to detect any cross-linking of Lpp to KpsD (data not shown). As such the 7-kDa protein that is cross-linked to KpsD cannot be Lpp, and its identity is as yet unknown. To demonstrate possible interactions between KpsE and KpsD, their proteinase K sensitivity in different mutant backgrounds was assessed by Western blot analysis following a time course proteolysis of E. coli spheroplasts. After 30 min of incubation with proteinase K, no proteolysis of KpsD was observed in spheroplasts from MS101 with limited proteolysis of KpsE after 30 min (Fig. 5, panels A and B). However, in MSFE101, where KpsE was absent from the bacterial envelope, KpsD was quickly degraded by proteinase K (Fig. 5,panel A). Likewise in strain MSTH101 (Table I) that lacks KpsD, KpsE was very sensitive to proteinase K (Fig. 5, panel B). In MSCA102, lacking Lpp, KpsD was reproducibly more sensitive to proteinase K digestion than in MS101 (Fig. 5, panel A), although compared with MSFE101, a significant proportion of KpsD was still resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 5, panel A). In contrast KpsE was rapidly degraded in MSCA102 (Fig. 5, panel B). In all cases there was no appreciable difference in the proteinase K sensitivity of periplasmic β-lactamase (data not shown) confirming that the spheroplasts of each strain were equally permeable to proteinase K. In the E. coli Tol-PAL system the periplasmic protein TolB has been shown to interact with the main peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane proteins Pal, OmpA, and Lpp (28Clavel T. Germon P. Vianney A. Portalier R. Lazzaroni J.-C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This interaction results in the localization of TolB both in the periplasm and the outer membrane (29Isnard M. Rigal A. Lazzaroni J.-C. Lazdunski C. Lloubes R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6392-6396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish if KpsD also interacts with the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, strains MS101, MSFE101, MSCA102, and MSCP101 were fractionated by a two-step sucrose gradient to give cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions, which together with the soluble periplasmic fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig.6). In MS101, KpsD was detected in all three fractions with the majority of the protein in the periplasm (Fig.6). In MSFE101 lacking KpsE, KpsD was detected exclusively as soluble protein in the periplasm with no protein detectable in either membrane fraction (Fig. 6). In MSCA102 KpsD was distributed evenly in both membrane fractions, with no soluble KpsD in the periplasmic fraction (Fig. 6). In strain MSCP101 (Table I), which has all of the polysaccharide export machinery but makes no polysaccharide, KpsD was detected exclusively in the outer membrane fraction (Fig. 6). The sensitivity of KpsE to carboxypeptidase demonstrates that its C terminus must be exposed in the periplasm and not be located in the cytoplasm as suggested previously for the MPA family of proteins (8Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, the observation that the C-terminal 29 amino acids of KpsE appear to be sufficient to localize β-lactamase, the archetypal soluble periplasmic protein, to the cytoplasmic membrane suggests an intimate interaction between the C terminus of KpsE and the cytoplasmic membrane. The decreased sensitivity of KpsE to carboxypeptidase digestion when compared with β-lactamase could be a consequence of the close association of the C terminus of KpsE with the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane, which makes the protein less accessible to the carboxypeptidase enzymes. A similar situation has been observed with TolR, the C terminus of which interacts with the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane and which has reduced sensitivity to carboxypeptidase digestion (30Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Popot J.L. Benedetti H. Samatey F. Lazdunski C. Portalier R. Geli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A helical wheel plot (31Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) of the C-terminal 20 amino acids of KpsE demonstrates the presence of a putative amphipathic α-helix with a segregation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on either side of the helix (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that the interactions between PBP5 (32Jackson M.E. Pratt J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), PBP6 (33Phoenix D.A. Peters S.E. Ramzan M.A. Pratt J.M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and TolR (30Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Popot J.L. Benedetti H. Samatey F. Lazdunski C. Portalier R. Geli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Lazdunski C. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journe L. Lloube S.R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane are mediated by C-terminal amphipathic α-helices in which hydrophobic residues are buried in the membrane interior and the hydrophilic residues are located on the other side of the helix and interact with the aqueous environment (35Gittins J.R. Phoenix D.A. Pratt J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the interaction between the C terminus of KpsE and the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane may be also mediated by an amphipathic α-helix. Taken as a whole these data establish the topology of KpsE, the archetypal MPA protein, and remove any ambiguity about the location of the C termini of this family of proteins involved in the transport of capsular polysaccharides across the periplasmic space in Gram-negative bacteria. The cross-linking data are consistent with KpsE functioning as a dimer, and the ability to dimerize was independent of the presence of other Kps proteins or the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide. The ability of KpsE to dimerize is likely to be mediated by a predicted coiled-coil structure present within KpsE (26Hammarton T.C. Analyses of the KpsE Protein of Escherichia coli K5Ph.D. thesis. University of Manchester, Manchester, UK1999Google Scholar). The cross-linking of KpsD to an unidentified 7-kDa protein is curious. The observation that this cross-linking was abolished in the absence of KpsE and Lpp suggested that KpsE and Lpp were required for this interaction. One must be cautious in assigning any specific role to Lpp in mediating this interaction, since mutations in lpp are known to have pleiotropic effects on the integrity of the periplasm (36Choi D.-S. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this could explain the differences in the pattern of KpsD cross-linking in an lpp mutant. The failure to cross-link KpsE and KpsD to each other could reflect that these proteins interact very transiently and/or via the exported polysaccharide molecule, making it impossible to detect the interaction with DSP cross-linking. It has been demonstrated in type I protein secretion in Gram-negative bacteria that the interaction between components in the secretion pathway is mediated by the exported protein molecule (37Letoffe S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 38Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Likewise, in the Tol system for the uptake of colicins, it has been suggested that the colicin itself may provide a bridge between its outer membrane receptor and periplasmic TolA protein (39Benedetti H. Lazdunski C. Lloubes R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1989-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As such it is possible that a similar situation exists in the transport of group 2 capsular polysaccharides, whereby the exported polysaccharide molecule plays a key role in linking the different components of the transport pathway together. The alteration in the proteinase K sensitivity of KpsD and KpsE in the different mutant backgrounds probably reflects conformational changes in the KpsD and KpsE proteins as a result of the disruption of the transport process. This supports the notion that these proteins are likely to interact in the transport process. Previously, KpsD has been assigned as a soluble periplasmic protein involved in group 2 polysaccharide transport (40Wunder D. Aaronson W. Hayes S. Bliss J. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4025-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of KpsD in both the cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions suggests that the trans-periplasmic export of group 2 capsular polysaccharides requires the interaction of KpsD with both membranes as well as being present in the periplasm. One interpretation is that KpsD may cycle between the membranes moving polymer across the periplasm in the process. In this model KpsD would engage with the polysaccharide as it is exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by the KpsMT transporter before docking with the outer membrane and transporting the polysaccharide across the periplasm. Alternatively, some form of trans-periplasmic export complex consisting of KpsD may be formed. Which ever model is correct it would appear that KpsE is vital to allow the interactions between KpsD and the respective membranes, and it is possible that KpsE functions to bring the membranes together to facilitate this process. The lack of soluble periplasmic KpsD in MSCA102 suggests that in the absence of Lpp the export process is disrupted such that either a trans-periplasmic complex cannot form or KpsD cannot cycle between the two membranes. Whether this reflects a specific role for Lpp in the transport process or is a consequence of pleiotropic effects of the lpp mutation on the integrity of the periplasm are as yet unresolved. The lack of detectable KpsD in either the periplasmic or cytoplasmic membrane fractions of strain MSCP101, which is unable to synthesize K5 polysaccharide, indicates that there is an absolute requirement for the polysaccharide molecule to be engaged in the translocation process for the trans-periplasmic export pathway to be operational. In the absence of polysaccharide the KpsD protein is detected in the outer membrane fraction. These results support the notion that the polysaccharide molecule itself may mediate interactions between proteins involved in the different stages of the transport process and extends our earlier observations that there is a direct coupling between polysaccharide biosynthesis and export (5Rigg G.P. Barrett B. Roberts I.S. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The translocation of polysaccharide across the outer membrane is still an area of conjecture. Unlike group 1 capsular polysaccharides, which have an outer membrane pore-forming protein (13Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), no such protein is encoded by group 2 capsule gene clusters. The observation that strain BL21[DE3]omp8(pPC6), which lacks OmpT, LamB, OmpF, OmpA and OmpC (41Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is still able to make a K5 capsule 3C. Arrecubieta and I. S. Roberts, unpublished results. would suggest that these major outer membrane proteins do not function in this capacity. Taken as a whole the data presented in the paper provide the first information on the transport of group 2 capsular polysaccharides across the periplasm and the roles of KpsE and KpsD in this process. The identification of homologues of these Kps proteins in other Gram-negative pathogens (3Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) indicate these findings will be applicable in the transport of capsular polysaccharides in these other medically important micro-organisms.

The mutation of Ob-Rb into one of its natural variants, Ob-Ra, results in severe obesity in rodents. We demonstrate here that diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ) interacts, via its ankyrin repeats, with the cytoplasmic portion of Ob-Rb in yeast two-hybrid systems, in protein precipitation experiments in vitro and in vivo. It does not interact, however, with the short form, Ob-Ra, which mediates the entry of leptin into the brain. Furthermore, we show byin situ hybridization that DGKζ is expressed in neurons of hypothalamic nuclei known to synthesize Ob-Rb and to participate in energy homeostasis. The mutant ob-/ob- anddb-/db- mice exhibit increased hypothalamic DGKζ mRNA level compared with their wild-type controls, suggesting a role for the leptin/OB-Rb system in regulating DGKζ expression. Further experiments show that hypothalamic DGKζ mRNA level is stimulated by the consumption of a high-fat diet. In addition, DGKζ mRNA is statistically significantly lower in rats and inbred mice that become obese on a high-fat diet compared with their lean counterparts. In fact, it is strongly, negatively correlated with both body fat and circulating levels of leptin.

Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Based on structure, eukaryotic DGKs are classified into five subgroups. These DGKs share a conserved catalytic domain and cysteine-rich regions. However, each group has unique domains that bind with calcium, phosphatidylinositols, and proteins. By Northern and Western blot, DGKs have been found in a wide variety of tissues, where different DGKs coexist in the same cells or tissue. Some DGK isoforms, including DGKζ, are expressed in high levels in brain, muscle, and white blood cells. They are associated with the cell membrane and are also present in the cytosol, nucleus, and other specific subcellular organelles (2Besterman J.M. Pollenz R.S. Booker Jr., E.L. Cuatrecasas P. Proc.

DGKζ is characterized by its four C-terminal ankyrin repeats and a unique region homologous to MARCKS phosphorylation site domain. DGKζ exists in both the cytosol and nucleus under the regulation of specific types of protein kinase C that phosphorylate the MARCKS site. In the nucleus, DGKζ modulates nuclear levels of diacylglycerol and increases the cell cycle duration, probably through effects on gene expression (10Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13Ding L. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Its role in regulating gene activity is also indicated by the findings that its expression is temporally and spatially regulated during embryonic development and correlates with the development of sensory neurons and regions undergoing apoptosis (13Ding L. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DGKζ may also participate as a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of complex lipids. This is suggested by the fact that DGKζ is widely and abundantly expressed throughout the body (14Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and that it can promiscuously use various kinds of long chain diacylglycerols as substrates, whether or not they are second messengers (11Bunting M.

Dietary fat is an important factor that contributes to the development of obesity. In rodents, it has been demonstrated that the concentration of fat in the diet, but not protein or carbohydrate, is strongly, positively correlated with the amount of body fat mass and that free access to a high-fat diet causes obesity and hyperinsulinemia (15West D.B. York B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: S505-S512Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Wang J. Alexander J.T. Zheng P., Yu, H.J. Dourmashkin J. Leibowitz S.F. Am. J.

These effects of dietary fat may be mediated, at least in part, by changes in the expression of genes in the brain that are involved in energy balance (18Leibowitz S.F. Akabayashi A. Wang J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Giraudo S.Q. Kotz C.M. Grace M.K. Levine A.S. Billington C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1578-1583PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chavez M.

Dietary fat also affects plasma levels of leptin, a hormone that exerts a key function in regulating food intake and body weight (21Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L.

Moreover, serum leptin levels are strongly, positively correlated with body fat mass (31Considine R.V. Sinha M.K. Heiman M.L. Kriauciunas A. Stephens T.W. Nyce M.R. Ohannesian J.P. Marco C.C.

We demonstrate several lines of evidence indicating an interaction between DGKζ and the cytoplasmic portion of Ob-Rb in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses demonstrate that DGKζ is expressed in neurons of the hypothalamus and that a high-fat diet stimulates DGKζ expression in hypothalamus. Moreover, hypothalamic DGKζ expression is found to be reduced in obese animals and strongly, inversely related to both body fat mass and serum leptin level. Based on these results, we propose that the enzymatic activity of DGKζ may be activated in response to a high-fat diet and that DGKζ may participate in the control of body fat accumulation. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and inbred mouse strains, AKR/J, SWR/J, C57BL/6j, and C57BL/6j ob-/ob- (Charles River Laboratories), and C57BL/3j and C57BL/3j db-/db- (Dr. Cai Li, Texas Southwestern Medical University, Dallas, TX), were individually housed and maintained on either a low-fat diet (10% fat, 25% protein, 65% carbohydrate, 3.75 Kcals/g), moderate-fat diet (30% fat, 25% protein, 45% carbohydrate, 3.98 Kcals/g), or high-fat diet (60% fat, 25% protein, 15% carbohydrate, 5.10 Kcals/g). Procedures for diet preparation, measurement of food intake and body weight, and dissection of body fat pads (inguinal, epididymal, intraperitoneal, or mesenteric) and hypothalamus, are described elsewhere (18Leibowitz S.F. Akabayashi A. Wang J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serum level of leptin was determined by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research). All other rat tissues were obtained from Harlan Bioproducts. Hypothalamus from 10 rats on a high-fat (60%) or low-fat (10%) diet were dissected and pooled for the purification of mRNA, which was then used for representational difference analysis as described (33Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment of rat Ob-Rbc, obtained by RT-PCR with primers 5′-TCACACCAGAGAATGAAAAAG-3′ and 5′-CACAGTTAAGTCACACATCTTA-3′, was used to screen a rat brain two-hybrid library (CLONTECH). By RT-PCR, the cDNA fragment of rat DGKζ was obtained with primers 5′-TTTTCATATGGAGCCGCGGGACCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGTCGACTACACAGCTGTCTCCTGGTCC-3′. DGKζ with all four ankyrin repeats deleted (DGKζΔa) was obtained with primers 5′-TTTTGAATTCATGGAGCCGCGGGACCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGTCGACAGTGCGGCATCCCCCTGCAG-3′. The ankyrin repeats of DGKζ (DGKζa) was obtained with primers 5′-TTTTGAATTCGCACTGCCCCAAGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGTCGACTACACAGCTGTCTCCTGGTCC-3′. The cDNA fragment of rat Ob-Rac was obtained by RT-PCR with primers 5′-TCACACCAGAGAATGAAAAAG-3′ and 5′-AAGAGTGTCCGCTCTCTTTTG-3′. The cDNA fragments for Ob-Rac and Ob-Rbc were subcloned into plasmid pET-32a(+) (Novagen) for expression as thioredoxin (Trx) fusion proteins in bacterial strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). To generate Ob-Rbt, pET-32a(+)-Ob-Rbc was digested by KpnI, followed by T4 DNA polymerase and ligation. The bacteria expressing Trx-Ob-Rbc and Trx-Ob-Rbt were solubilized in buffer TUNN (10 mm Tris, 8m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9. The proteins were purified with a Ni-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen) by washing sequentially with TUNN plus 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, and TUNN plus 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.3. The proteins were eluted with TUNN plus 20 mm imidazole, pH 5.6, and renatured by dialysis against 3 × 2 liters of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol at 4 °C for 36 h. DGKζ, DGKζΔa, and DGKζa were subcloned in-frame into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed in bacterial strain BL21, and purified as GST-DGKζa with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The purified proteins were combined with either 50 μl of 50% Ni-NTA Superflow-agarose resin or 50 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEGTA and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A. The mixture was shaken at 37 °C for 1 h, pelleted at 400 × g in a microcentrifuge, and washed 4 times with 1 ml of the above buffer. Proteins were separated in a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Trx, Trx-Ob-Rac, Trx-Ob-Rbc, and Trx-Ob-Rbt were assayed by a mouse monoclonal antibody against His·Tag (Oncogene Research Products). GST and GST-DGKζa were assayed by a goat polyclonal antibody against GST (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alkaline phosphatase conjugate secondary antibodies were from Sigma and detected with NBT/BCIP. For in vivo immunoprecipitation, 100 rat hypothalamus were homogenized in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 1 mm EGTA and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, followed by centrifugation at 24,000 × gat 4 °C for 1 h. This extract (7.8 mg/ml) was then divided into two parts and combined with 100 μg of goat anti-Ob-Rb antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) plus protein G-agarose beads (Upstate biotechnology) or with 100 μg of normal goat IgG (Oncogene Research Products) plus protein G-agarose beads, and shaken at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed 4 times, each with 12 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, by 400 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. After the final wash, the beads were transferred into a column and eluted with 0.3 ml of 65 °C water. DGKζ was assayed by a polyclonal rabbit anti-DGKζ antibody (11Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in Western blot. PCR was set up in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), and 1/20 volume of 1 μg of medial hypothalamus RNA reverse transcription reaction (20 μl) as template. Primers for actin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were included for simultaneous amplification with either DGKζ or Ob-Rbc. PCR was conducted in 18 cycles in a Thermal cycler 480 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR products were separated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel, stained by ethidium bromide, and digitally quantified by an imaging densitometer GS-700 (Bio-Rad). The results were averaged from four independent experiments. Antisense and sense riboprobes were transcribed in vitro from linearized DNA of plasmid pGEM-Teasy containing a cDNA fragment of DGKζ by using SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotin-UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The probe for DGKζ (736 base pairs) corresponded to 2054–2790 base pairs of the coding sequence at the 3′ end of the cDNA. In situ hybridization was performed on frozen brain sections of adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats on a high-fat diet as described (18Leibowitz S.F. Akabayashi A. Wang J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the signal was enhanced with tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and detected by nitro blue tetrazoliium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. In an attempt to clone genes that regulate food ingestion and body fat accrual, we used representational difference analysis (RDA) (33Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to identify genes that exhibit increased expression in the hypothalamus of rats maintained on a high-fat diet, which is known to enhance hypothalamic expression of peptides involved in energy balance (18Leibowitz S.F. Akabayashi A. Wang J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chavez M. Seeley R.J. Havel P.J. Friedman M.I. Matson C.A. Woods S.C. Schwartz M.W. J. Clin.

Brain Res. 1996; 721: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This method resulted in a large number of candidate clones. To choose the most promising clones from these candidates, we then explored if any of these encode proteins that interact with the long form receptor of leptin, which controls food intake and body weight and is also stimulated by a high-fat diet (35Iritani N. Sugimoto T. Fukuda H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,36Cha M.C. Jones P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1655-1660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid technique (37Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar) to screen a rat brain cDNA library for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Ob-Rb, and searched the resultant clones for DNA sequences that are identical to those generated by RDA. In the RDA experiment, cDNA fragments made from the hypothalamus of adult, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10/group) maintained for 3 weeks on a low-fat diet (10% fat, 3.75 Kcals/g) were subtracted from those of rats on a high-fat diet (60% fat, 5.1 Kcals/g), and the quantity of the resultant fragments was amplified by PCR (Fig. 1). After three rounds of subtractive hybridization and amplification, the resultant distinct DNA bands were cloned, obtaining 53 clones. Sequencing of these RDA products revealed a clone encoding part of the ankyrin repeats of DGKζ. In a GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system, the cytoplasmic domain immediately following the transmembrane region of rat Ob-Rb (Ob-Rbc) was used as the bait to screen a rat brain two-hybrid cDNA library. An initial screening of ∼2 × 106 yeast colonies yielded 436 clones, of which 57 clones tested positive by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) filter assay. Sequencing analysis revealed that two of these clones contain a 0.8-kilobase cDNA fragment that encodes a partial sequence of the ankyrin repeats of DGKζ (Fig.2). Comparison with the published sequence of rat DGKζ (14Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reveals that this partial sequence encodes the third and fourth ankyrin repeats of DGKζ, as well as the last 12 amino acids of the second repeat (Fig. 2).Figure 2The partial sequence of DGK ζ ankyrin repeats obtained by screening a two-hybrid cDNA library, compared with the sequence of the intact ankyrin repeats of rat DGK ζ. The four ankyrin repeats of DGKζ are underlined, with each of the repeats containing 33 amino acids. The partial sequence starts at 2530 base pairs and encodes the last 12 amino acids of the second repeat and the complete third and fourth repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above RDA experiment indicates that dietary fat stimulates hypothalamic DGKζ expression. We confirmed this, by quantitative RT-PCR, in an additional set of rats (n = 5–6/group) fed for 3 weeks on either a low-fat (10% fat), moderate-fat (30%) or high-fat (60%) diet. The results demonstrate that the DGKζ mRNA level (relative to actin) increases (+20%,p < 0.02) as dietary fat rises from 10 to 30%, and it increases even further (+36%, p < 0.001) in rats on a 60% fat diet (Table I). This increase in dietary fat concentration and DGKζ mRNA is accompanied by a significant rise in circulating levels of leptin (Table I). Body fat pad weights (retroperitoneal, inguinal, mesenteric, and epididymal), as well as body weight and total daily intake, are also elevated in the high-fat diet rats (Table I).Table IDietary fat stimulates hypothalamic DGKζ mRNA in ratsDiet (% fat)nDGKζ mRNALeptinBody fatBody weightTotal intakerelative to actinng/mlgmKcals/dayLow-fat (10%)50.64 ± 0.022.6 ± 0.414.0 ± 0.7387 ± 689.3 ± 2.2Moderate-fat (30%)60.77 ± 0.021-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.4.5 ± 0.91-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.15.4 ± 0.8402 ± 61-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.91.0 ± 1.7High-fat (60%)50.87 ± 0.031-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.1-bp < 0.05 compared to moderate-fat diet.6.7 ± 0.71-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.1-bp < 0.05 compared to moderate-fat diet.20.5 ± 1.21-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.1-bp < 0.05 compared to moderate-fat diet.414 ± 61-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.1-bp < 0.05 compared to moderate-fat diet.101.6 ± 3.71-ap < 0.05 compared to low-fat diet.1-bp < 0.05 compared to moderate-fat diet.Hypothalamus was excised from each individual rat or mouse and was used to purify total mRNA and synthesize the first strand cDNA. The cDNA fragments of DGKζ and actin were amplified by PCR for 20 cycles, which was determined to be within the exponential range. The PCR products were resolved on agarose gels, and their quantities were determined by a Bio-Rad GS-700 densitometer. The relative DGKζ mRNA level was obtained by comparing optical densities of DGKζ fragments with those of corresponding actin fragments and by averaging these data from four independent experiments.

The identification of DGKζ by the yeast two-hybrid technique indicates that DGKζ interacts with Ob-Rbc. Since only two DGKζ clones were obtained from the rat brain cDNA library, the binding of DGKζ to Ob-Rbc may be weak. To confirm this, we performed β-galactosidase activity assays in the GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system to measure the strength of this interaction. While the negative control generated 0.2 units of β-galactosidase activity, 5 units of activity were found in the interaction between DGKζ and Ob-Rbc. This contrasts with 108 units of β-galactosidase activity in a positive control interaction between p53 and T antigen. This low β-galactosidase activity confirms that the interaction between Ob-Rbc and DGKζ is weak and explains the low yield of DGKζ clones in the library screening. The interaction between DGKζ and Ob-Rbc was confirmed in a different LexA yeast two-hybrid system (38Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The growth of yeast on a control medium (Fig. 3, left) indicates the presence of vectors expressing DGKζ and Ob-Rbc fusion proteins in the yeast cells, and the blue colony color indicates the interaction between DGKζ and Ob-Rbc. When these yeasts were plated onto a test medium that selects for the interaction between the expressed fusion proteins, only the yeasts expressing both DGKζ and Ob-Rbc grew and turned blue within 3 days (Fig. 3, right). This experiment, again, demonstrates the interaction of DGKζ with Ob-Rbc. The identification of the ankyrin repeats of DGKζ in our two-hybrid library screening suggests that DGKζ may use its ankyrin repeats to interact with Ob-Rbc. To substantiate this observation, we then used anin vitro protein to protein interaction experiment to demonstrate that the ankyrin repeats by themselves are responsible for the interaction. In this experiment, we expressed rat DGKζ, a DGKζ with all four ankyrin repeats deleted (DGKζΔa), and the four ankyrin repeats of DGKζ (DGKζa) in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and purified them (Fig. 4, aand b). We also expressed Ob-Rbc in bacteria as a Trx fusion protein, solubilized from inclusion bodies by 8 m urea, purified, and renatured in a phosphate buffer. In the protein to protein interaction experiment in vitro, 20 μg of Trx-Ob-Rbc was found to co-precipitate with 1 μg of GST-DGKζ, but not with 1 μg of GST-DGKζΔa, when GST-DGKζ and GST-DGKζΔa were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 4 c, lanes 1 and 2). This result indicates that the ankyrin repeats are responsible for the interaction. To confirm this, we further found that 20 μg of Trx-Ob-Rbc co-precipitated with 1 μg of GST-DGKζa, but not with 1 μg of GST, when GST and GST-DGKζa were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 4 c, lanes 3 and 4). Reciprocally, 1 μg of GST-DGKζa co-precipitated with 20 μg of Trx-Ob-Rbc, but not with 20 μg of Trx, when Trx and Trx-Ob-Rbc were precipitated with Ni-NTA SuperflowTM resin (Fig. 4 c, lanes 5 and6). The partial ankyrin repeats identified by two-hybrid library screening, which contain the last two repeats and the last 12 amino acids of the second repeats, was also found to interact with Ob-Rbc in protein to protein interaction experiments in vitro (not shown). In addition, we found that 20 μg of Trx-Ob-Rbc was required for the interaction to be detected, which may indicate that only a small fraction of Trx-Ob-Rbc was correctly renatured and bound with DGKζa. To demonstrate that native Trx-Ob-Rbc interacts with DGKζa, we used soluble Trx-Ob-Rbc concentrated from the bacterial extract in the protein binding experiment and obtained the same result (not shown). This evidence indicates that DGKζ interacts with Ob-Rb v"

By transiently transfecting HT1080 and HepG2 cells with a series of 5′ and 3′ deletions in the hRFC-B and -A promoters, the minimal promoters were localized within 46 and 47 base pairs, respectively. Gel mobility shift assays with the hRFC-B basal promoter region revealed specific DNA-protein complexes involving a highly conserved GC-box and Sp1 or Sp3. In Drosophila SL2 cells, both Sp1 and the long Sp3 isoform potently transactivated the hRFC-B basal promoter; however, the short Sp3 isoforms were transcriptionally inert and resulted in a potent inhibition of Sp1 transactivation. For the hRFC-A basal promoter, a CRE/AP-1-like element was bound by the bZip superfamily of DNA-binding proteins. Cell-specific DNA-protein complexes were identified for hRFC-A (CREB-1 and c-Jun in HT1080 cells; CREB-1 and ATF-1 in HepG2 cells). When the GC-box and CRE/AP-1-like elements were mutated, a 60–90% decrease in promoter activity was observed in both cell lines.

Picciano M.F. Stokstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Mammalian cells lack the capability of synthesizing these essential cofactors. Furthermore, chemically, folates are hydrophilic anionic molecules with limited capacities to traverse biological membranes by diffusion alone. Accordingly, mammals have evolved highly sophisticated uptake processes for transporting folates into cells. The primary route for entry of reduced folates is the reduced folate carrier (RFC)1 (2Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol.

The biological role of RFC is to provide adequate rates of intracellular delivery of tetrahydrofolates to sustain DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In addition to the important role of RFC in tissue folate homeostasis, membrane transport via RFC is a critical determinant of the antitumor activity of antifolate therapeutics used in cancer chemotherapy (i.e. methotrexate (Mtx), Tomudex; 2–4) and alterations in RFC contribute to Mtx resistance (2Goldman I.D.

Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4442-4452Google Scholar). Similarly, in leukemic lymphoblasts from patients, a wide range of RFC was observed, and low levels of RFC transcripts were associated with small amounts of Mtx uptake (12Zhang L. Taub J.W.

Taken together, these studies argue that the levels of RFC gene expression can potentially have a major impact on clinical outcome after chemotherapy with Mtx. RFC gene expression can also influence normal tissue development and could conceivably contribute to disease states associated with decreased accumulations of folate cofactors, exacerbating the effects of folate deficiencies on the development of cardiovascular disease (15Refsun H.

Despite the close homologies between the rodent and human RFCs, the murine and hamster genes are notably smaller than the hRFC gene (23 and 15.3 kilobases,versus ∼29 kilobases, respectively) (26Murray R.C.

Gene. 1999; 233: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) RFCs, differing in their 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs). For the mouse RFC gene, the multiple 5′-UTRs arise from alternate noncoding exons that are regulated by two distinct promoters (27Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene. 1997; 189: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), each of which is regulated by multiple Sp1 binding sites (32Tolner B. Singh A. Esaki T. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene. 1999; 231: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our recent studies of the 5′ upstream regulation of the hRFC gene confirmed the presence of 5′ transcript heterogeneity resulting from multiple transcriptional start sites and variable splicing of alternate noncoding exons (designated exons 1 and 2 for the KS43 and KS32 5′-UTRs, respectively), each transcribed from separate GC-rich, TATA-less promoters (designated A and B or, previously, Pro32 and Pro43, respectively) (33Zhang L. Wong S.C. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar results were described for hRFC by Tolner et al. (30Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M.

Genet. 1998; 24: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report, we significantly extend this initial characterization of promoter structure and function by identifying the critical transcriptional elements involved in regulating basal levels of hRFC expression. Our results suggest a remarkable complexity of basal transcription that portends possibilities for tissue-specific hRFC transcriptional controls, in response to requirements for folate cofactors or other cell- or tissue-specific signals.

The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and the HepG2 human hepatoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Schneider's Drosophila SL2 cells were provided by Dr. Bonnie Sloane (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). HT1080 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated iron-supplemented calf serum (Hyclone Labs), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ¼g/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. HepG2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium unmodified with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C. SL2 cells were grown at room temperature in Schneider'sDrosophila medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. The full-length hRFC-B/-2016 (positions −2016 to −959) and hRFC-A/-958 (positions −958 to −277) promoters were prepared from a hRFC genomic clone (RFCg1–31) as described by Zhang et al. (33Zhang L. Wong S.C. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 5′-Deleted hRFC-B (hRFC-B/-1088 and hRFC-B/-1043) and -A (hRFC-A/-501 and hRFC-A/-455) constructs were prepared by successive exonuclease III and S1 nuclease digestions (34Gong M. Cowan K.H. Gudas J. Moscow J.A. Gene. 1999; 233: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas 3′ deletions (designated hRFC-B/MluI and hRFC-B/BsrBI) were introduced by restriction endonuclease digestions with MluI and BsrBI, respectively. hRFC-B/-1088 M1 and hRFC-B/-1088 M3, containing a mutated GC-box, and hRFC-A/-501 M1, containing a mutated CRE/AP-1-like element, were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: hRFC-B/-1088 M1, 5′-GGACGGACCCGAACACCCCGCAGCCGCG-3′; hRFC-B/-1088 M3, 5′-GGACCCGAACAAACCGCAGCCGCGCGCCCGCCGCGCCGCCTT-3′; hRFC-A/-501 M1, 5′-CGGCCCCCAGCCTGCCCTCCGCGTCCTCCTGGGGCGCCAAGTCCCA-3′. The polymerase chain reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C/30 s, 68 °C/45 s, 72 °C/45 s for 35 cycles. The amplicons were isolated from 2% LE-agarose and then subcloned into pGemT Easy plasmid (Promega). The inserts were subsequently subcloned into pGL3-Basic in the sense orientation. All mutations were verified by automated DNA sequencing. HT1080 and HepG2 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well dishes 24 h before transfection. The plates used for HepG2 cells were coated with 4 ¼g/ml poly-l-lysine. RFC-promoter constructs or empty pGL3-basic (4 ¼g for HT1080, 475 ng for HepG2 cells) were cotransfected with 25 ng of pRLSV40 plasmid using Lipofectin® (10 ¼g for HT1080, 3 ¼g for HepG2 cells) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were washed, and then the appropriate medium was added. After an additional 24–48 h, lysates were prepared, and firefly luciferase activity was assayed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega) in a Turner 20/20 luminometer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with Renillaluciferase. Drosophila SL2 cells (5 × 105cells/T12.5 cm2) were transfected with hRFC promoter constructs (1 ¼g) and 100 ng of pPacSp1, pPacO, pPacSp3, or pPacUSp3 using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 3 ¼l) in complete media. Transfections were allowed to continue for 48 h before the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed with the single luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Relative luciferase activities were normalized to protein concentrations of all the cell lysates. For all transfections, three or more experiments were performed in duplicate. Nuclear extracts from HT1080 and HepG2 cells were prepared by standard methods (35Ausuble F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). 5–10 ¼g of nuclear extract was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled hRFC-B (−1088 to −1043) and -A (−501 to −455) double-stranded oligonucleotides in a binding buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X, 6 ¼g of bovine serum albumin, 2 ¼g of poly[dI-dC], 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Oligonucleotide competition analysis was conducted with a 100–200-fold molar excess of commercial competitor oligonucleotides (CREB, AP-1, Sp1, mutant Sp1, and mutant CREB; Promega) or a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant hRFC-B and hRFC-A oligonucleotides. For the supershift assays, the DNA-protein complexes were pretreated with anti-Sp1 (Geneka) and Sp3, c-Jun, c-Jun/AP-1, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Nrf1, CREB-1, ATF-1, and ATF-2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4 or 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (pH 8.4) at 4 °C and at 35 mA. The gels were dried, and the complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extract proteins from HT1080 and HepG2 cells were electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (DuPont) (36Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection was with ATF-1, CREB-1, and c-Jun antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Light emission was recorded on x-ray film with various exposure times. Previously, our laboratory identified two unique promoters (designated A and B or Pro32 and Pro43) involved in regulating hRFC gene expression (33Zhang L. Wong S.C. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although regions of possible regulatory significance were suggested by 5′ deletion analysis, neither the minimal promoters nor the major transcription factors that regulate basal transcriptional activity were elucidated. Accordingly, we prepared a refined series of deletion reporter constructs to better localize the minimal hRFC-A and -B promoters. These constructs were transiently transfected in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and HepG2 human hepatoma cells, which express moderate to high levels of hRFC transcripts, with a 2-fold higher level of hRFC expression in HepG2 cells (data not shown). By using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends for both cell types, we found that each cell line uses both hRFC promoters, 2J. R. Whetstine and L. H. Matherly, manuscript in preparation. making them a good in vitro model for studying hRFC gene expression. For both cell lines, up to 928 bp could be deleted from the full-length construct (hRFC-B/-2016) with only a slight decrease (30%) of luciferase activity (Fig. 1, panel A). However, upon deletion of an additional 46 bp (to position −1043), promoter activity was completely abolished. When 141 bp were removed from the 3′-end of hRFC-B/-2016 (to position −1099) withMluI (hRFC-B/MluI), activity was similarly abolished. For promoter A, the levels of luciferase activity were reduced by ∼65% for both cell lines upon removal of 457 bp (hRFC-A/-501) from the full-length hRFC-A/-958 construct (Fig. 1, panel B). Luciferase activity was completely abolished by further deletion to position −455 (hRFC-A/-455) (Fig. 1, panel B). Removal of 261 bp from the 3′-end of the full-length hRFC-A/-958 construct (to position −541) with BsrBI (hRFC-A/BsrBI) abolished luciferase activity for promoter A. These data strongly suggest that the basal promoter for hRFC-B resides within the 46-bp region from −1088 to −1043, and the minimal promoter for hRFC-A can be localized to within the 47 bp between positions −501 and −455. The 46-bp basal promoter B is GC-rich (87%), lacks a TATA box, and contains a highly conserved GC-box (position −1081 to −1075), flanked by a potential GT-box (−1077 to −1071), both of which are recognized by the family of Sp transcription factors (Fig.2 A). To assess transcription factor binding to these conserved elements, a double-stranded oligonucleotide (−1088 to −1043), including these elements (hRFC-B/-1088 Wt) was used in gel mobility shift assays. The32P-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 5–10 ¼g of HT1080 or HepG2 nuclear extracts and analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. When incubated with the 46-bp basal promoter B oligonucleotide, both nuclear extracts resulted in three complexes (labeled 1,2, and 3; Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and9). All three complexes were competed with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled hRFC-B oligonucleotide (Self;lanes 3 and 10), establishing binding specificity. Likewise, the complexes were competed with a 100-fold molar excess of Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A,lanes 4 and 11). However, there was no competition with a 200-fold molar excess mutated Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A; lanes 5 and12) or with hRFC-B oligonucleotides in which the GC-box (hRFC-B/-1088 M1; Fig. 2 C) or both the GC- and GT-boxes (hRFC-B/-1088 M3; Fig. 2 C) were mutated (Fig.3 B, lanes 4, 6, 10, and12, respectively). However, when the flanking GT-box alone was mutated (hRFC-B/-1088 M2; Fig. 2 C), competition was unaffected (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 11). Thus, the highly conserved GC-box (CCCGCCC) at position −1081 to −1075 is the major binding element in the hRFC-B basal region. Based on our competition studies with the promoter B oligonucleotide, supershift analyses were performed. Antibodies to Sp1 and Sp3 were added to the nuclear extracts before the binding reactions. The Sp1 antibody resulted in a supershift in both cell lines (complexA; Fig. 3 A, lane 6 and 13). In the presence of the Sp3 antibody, both lower complexes (2and 3) were supershifted (complex B; Fig.3 A, lanes 7 and 14). When both antibodies were added simultaneously to each nuclear extract, all three complexes were supershifted (complex C; Fig. 3 A,lanes 8 and 15). In separate experiments (not shown), we found that purified Sp1 also bound the basal promoter B oligonucleotide. Collectively, these results demonstrate that both Sp1 and Sp3 can bind to the 46-bp minimal promoter B through the highly conserved GC-box at positions −1081 to −1075. The 47-bp hRFC-A basal promoter is 76% GC-rich, also TATA-less, and has a CRE/AP-1-like element at positions −485 to −471 (Fig. 2 B). In gel mobility shift assays with the 47-bp hRFC-A oligonucleotide (−501 to −455), a single DNA-protein complex was detected on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel for both HepG2 and HT1080 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 7). The complex was competed with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled basal promoter A oligonucleotide (Self; Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 8) and with excess (100-fold) commercial AP-1 and CREB consensus oligonucleotides (Fig. 4,lanes 4 and 10, 5 and 11, respectively). However, competition was significantly diminished with a commercial mutant CREB oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and12). When a single point mutation was introduced into the CRE/AP-1-like binding site in the hRFC-A oligonucleotide (hRFC-A/-501 M1, Fig. 2 C), competition was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 9). In data not shown, the bZip DNA binding domain from CREB-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) also formed a DNA-protein complex with the 47-bp hRFC-A oligonucleotide. Based on our competition results with hRFC-A consensus sequences, supershifts were conducted with antibodies to various members of the CREB/ATF and AP-1 families of transcription factors. On a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, CREB-1 antibody supershifted complexes in both HT1080 and HepG2 cells (complex A; Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and11, respectively). A supershifted complex was detected in HepG2 cells with an ATF-1 antibody (complex B; Fig.5 A, lane 12); however this shift was not detected in HT1080 cells (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Antibodies to c-Jun or c-Jun/AP-1 (recognizes all Jun family members), JunD, JunB, c-Fos (recognizes all Fos family members), or Nrf1 did not result in detectable supershifts for either HT1080 or HepG2 cell lines on a 6% gel (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–9, 13, and14; not shown for JunD, JunB, or Nrf1 for HepG2 cells). However, a supershift with c-Jun and c-Jun/AP-1 antibodies could be detected on a 4% gel in HT1080 cells (complex C; Fig.5 B, lane 1; data not shown for c-Jun/AP-1). Neither c-Jun nor c-Jun/AP-1 antibodies resulted in a supershift with the HepG2 nuclear extract (Fig. 5 B, lane 4, shows data for c-Jun antibody). For the other antibodies included on the 6% gel, shown in Fig. 5 A, identical results were obtained on a 4% gel (data not shown). Collectively, these results identify a multiplicity of transfactor binding associations with the hRFC-A basal promoter involving members of the superfamily of bZip DNA-binding proteins and the conserved CRE/AP-1-like motif at positions −485 to −471. The identification of complexes involving different members of the bZip superfamily with the hRFC-A minimal promoter suggests that the nature of the DNA-protein complexes formed may be cell-specific. This may reflect differences in the levels of the individual transcription factors between the cell lines. To assess this possibility, Western analysis was used. As shown in Fig.5 C, CREB-1 was detected at high levels in both cell lines, thus explaining the presence of CREB-1/hRFC-A complexes on our supershifts. However, c-Jun was detected only in HT1080 cells, and ATF-1 was identified only in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5 C). These striking differences between c-Jun and ATF-1 are in further agreement with our supershift data. Taken together, they suggest that different cellular levels of c-Jun, CREB-1, and ATF-1 determine the types of DNA-protein complexes that are observed. From our gel shift experiments (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), the GC-box (position −1081 to −1075) in hRFC-B and the CRE/AP-1-like sequence (−485 to −471) in hRFC-A were implicated in transactivation of the minimal promoters since the DNA-protein complexes were selectively abolished by competitive oligonucleotides (Sp1, and CREB and AP-1, respectively) and were supershifted with specific antibodies to the individual transcription factors (Sp1, Sp3, CREB-1, ATF-1, and c-Jun). However, commercial mutant oligonucleotides (Sp1 and CREB) or hRFC oligonucleotides with mutations in the highly conserved GC-box (hRFC-B/-1088 M1 and hRFC-B/-1088 M3) and the CRE/AP-1-like (hRFC-A/-501 M1) elements were no longer effective competitors (Figs. 3 and 4). To confirm important transactivating roles for these regions, reporter gene constructs for hRFC-B/-1088 and hRFC-A/-501 containing these point mutations were transiently expressed in HT1080 and HepG2 cells (Fig.6, A and B, respectively). In HT1080 cells (Fig. 6 A, upper panel), the hRFC-B/-1088 M1 and M3 constructs were only 10 and 7%, respectively, as active as wild-type, whereas only slightly greater levels (45 and 35%, respectively) were detected in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). In both HT1080 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 6, panel B), the hRFC-A promoter construct containing a mutated CRE/AP-1-like element (hRFC-A/-501 M1) resulted in a 60% decrease in luciferase activity compared with the hRFC-A/-501 wild-type construct. These data clearly demonstrate the critical transactivating roles for the GC-box in the hRFC-B minimal promoter and for the CRE/AP-1-like element in the hRFC-A basal region.

We found that the pretreatment of neutrophils with ethanol (0.8%) or 1-butanol (0.3%), which results in the accumulation of phosphatidylalcohol at the expense of phosphatidic acid (PA), decreased the phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of endogenous proteins (42, 115 kDa). When neutrophil cytosol was incubated in the presence or absence of PA, these and other endogenous proteins became Tyr-phosphorylated in a PA-dependent manner. In contrast, phosphatidylalcohols exhibited only 25% (phosphatidylethanol) or 5% (phosphatidylbutanol) of the ability of PA to stimulate Tyr phosphorylation in the cell-free assay. Similarly, other phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, polyphosphoinositides, and sphingosine 1-phosphate) showed little ability to stimulate Tyr phosphorylation. These data suggest that PA can function as an intracellular regulator of Tyr phosphorylating activity. Gel filtration chromatography of leukocyte cytosol revealed a peak of PA-dependent Tyr phosphorylating activity distinct from a previously described PA-dependent phosphorylating activity (Waite, K. A., Wallin, R., Qualliotine-Mann, D., and McPhail, L. C. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 15569–15578). Among the protein Tyr kinases expressed in neutrophils, only Fgr eluted exclusively in the peak of PA-dependent Tyr phosphorylating activity. Importantly, Fgr isolated from unstimulated neutrophil lysates showed increased activity in the presence of PA but not phosphatidylbutanol. Moreover, the pretreatment of neutrophils with 1-butanol decreased Fgr activity in cells stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl phenylalanine plus dihydrocytochalasin B.

They provide formidable killing mechanisms against invading organisms. Neutrophils sense their environment through a variety of cell surface receptors that allow the cells to respond to bacterial products, inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, complement cleavage products, and adhesion molecules. Upon receptor ligation, numerous signaling events ensue within the cell that culminate in a repertoire of functional responses appropriate for a given stimulus. Among the many signaling events induced, increased Tyr phosphorylation of proteins is commonly observed for a wide variety of neutrophil stimuli (1Rollet E. Caon A.C. Roberge C.J. Liao N.W.

Importantly, Tyr phosphorylation appears to play a central role in signaling pathways because treatment of neutrophils with inhibitors of protein Tyr kinases has been shown to interfere with most cellular functions (reviewed in Ref. 3Welch H.

The mechanism by which PA stimulates Tyr phosphorylation has not been addressed.Like Tyr phosphorylation, the activation of phospholipase D is an early cellular signaling event and has been linked to functional responses of the neutrophil (12Bonser R.W.

This enzyme metabolizes membrane phospholipids, in a stimulus-dependent manner, yielding PA and the free head group (e.g. choline or ethanolamine). Although slow to gain acceptance as a lipid second messenger, PA has now been reported to interact with or activate a variety of signaling components including protein Ser/Thr kinases (14Limatola C.

Acta. 1997; 1346: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) could be due to the interaction of PA with any of these signaling molecules or perhaps a protein Tyr kinase. In this report, we examined the stimulatory role of PA on Tyr phosphorylating activity in neutrophils, characterized this activity, and identified at least one protein Tyr kinase that appears to be regulated by PA. Our findings suggest a novel facet of protein Tyr kinase regulation and a new signaling role for PA.DISCUSSIONOur understanding of the cellular roles of protein Tyr kinases is rapidly expanding because of molecular techniques that allow for the manipulation of protein expression. In contrast, our understanding of the regulatory events leading to the activation and inactivation of these signaling molecules in the intact cell lags behind. Our findings show that Tyr phosphorylating activity in human neutrophils can be regulated in a positive manner by a cell membrane-derived lipid. This represents a novel facet of protein Tyr kinase regulation. Moreover, it links protein Tyr kinase activation to stimulus-induced membrane lipid metabolism, both of which are early signaling events in most cell types.The pattern of Tyr-phosphorylated proteins observed with PMA stimulation of neutrophils was similar to that described previously (11Ohguchi K. Kasai T. Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Berkow R.L. Dodson R.W. Blood. 1990; 75: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Dusi S. Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, certain proteins appear to be Tyr-phosphorylated in a manner sensitive to primary alcohols (Fig. 1). Our observations in primary neutrophils are in agreement with those made in HL-60 cells, a line with the capability to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells (11Ohguchi K. Kasai T. Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Together, these findings implicate phospholipase D and its product, PA, in the regulation of the Tyr phosphorylation response. In addition, exogenous PA has been shown to stimulate Tyr phosphorylation of neutrophil proteins by a mechanism that does not require its entry into cells (10Siddiqui R.A. English D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, neutrophil function appears to be enhanced by PA, acting as either an intracellular messenger or an inflammatory mediator (59English D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Our focus was on PA as an intracellular messenger. By using a cell-free system, we showed that PA stimulated Tyr phosphorylation (Fig. 2). However, PA metabolites, membrane phospholipids, and other signaling lipids failed to mimic this ability of PA (Table I). Importantly, phosphatidylalcohols, which are generated at the expense of PA upon incubation of cells with primary alcohols, also failed to mimic the ability of PA to stimulate Tyr phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Thus, the target(s) responsible for enhanced Tyr phosphorylation is (are) clearly able to discriminate among lipids (Table I and Figs. 3 and 4). This strengthens the link between the early signaling events of phospholipase D activation and Tyr phosphorylation.The activation of a protein Tyr kinase or the inhibition of a protein Tyr phosphatase provides the most straightforward explanation for PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation. The latter has not been reported, but PA activation of a protein Tyr phosphatase (SHP-1) has been observed (19Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since protein Tyr kinases can be activated by Tyr dephosphorylation (60Schwartzberg P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), this could explain our observations. However, reported properties of PA-stimulated SHP-1 activity differ significantly from those observed for PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation. SHP-1 activity was stimulated by PA as well as by phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and arachidonic acid and was inhibited by Mn2+ (19Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, these phospholipids were poor activators of Tyr phosphorylation (Table I); arachidonic acid was inactive (Table I), and Mn2+ easily replaced Mg2+ in our assay conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that SHP-1 activation by PA is responsible for the observed lipid-stimulated increase in Tyr phosphorylation. In addition, PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation required the presence of ATP (not shown); a protein Tyr phosphatase inhibitor (Na3VO4) was routinely included in the Tyr phosphorylation assay mixture; and protein Tyr kinase inhibitors diminished PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation (Table II). These observations argue against the involvement of a protein Tyr phosphatase in the PA response.Neutrophils express numerous protein Tyr kinases (2Berton G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Welch H. Mauran C. Maridonneau-Parini I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is limited information on the interaction of nonreceptor protein Tyr kinases with lipids. However, some of these enzymes localize to membranes via a myristoylated amino terminus (60Schwartzberg P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and Lyn and Fyn, both Src family protein Tyr kinases, have been reported to interact with glycolipids (61Kasahara K. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto T. Sanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29947-29953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 62Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Novotny V. Kikuchi G.E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The activity of purified Src was previously reported to be enhanced by acidic phospholipids (64Sato K.-I. Yamamato H. Otsuki T. Aoto M. Tokmakov A.A. Hayashi F. Fukami Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, our observation that PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylating activity is sensitive to inhibitors of protein Tyr kinases (Table II) suggests that a protein Tyr kinase is involved in the response. Among the more selective inhibitors tested, PP1, a Src family protein Tyr kinase inhibitor (48Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), blocked the PA-stimulated response by nearly 50%. This suggests that a member(s) of this protein Tyr kinase family may participate in the PA-stimulated response. We observed that Fgr, a Src family enzyme, eluted exclusively in the peak of PA-dependent Tyr phosphorylating activity obtained from the gel filtration fractionation of leukocyte cytosol (Fig. 5). Moreover, PA-dependent Tyr phosphorylating activity in Fgr-containing fractions was decreased by PP1. Since no other protein Tyr kinase examined exhibited a comparable elution profile, we pursued Fgr as a candidate enzyme for regulation by PA. Fgr is primarily a membrane-associated protein (65Notario V. Gutkind J.S. Imaizumi M. Katamine S. Robbins K.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3129-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 66Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2021-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar),2 yet we detected this protein Tyr kinase in the cytosolic fraction of cells disrupted by sonication. However, to maximize Fgr recovery from cells, we opted to isolate the protein by immunoprecipitation from whole cell lysates. We found that PA, but not phosphatidylbutanol, could activate Fgr (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, Fgr activation in the intact cell appears to be regulated in part by PA (Fig. 6 B). A variety of stimuli (e.g. opsonized zymosan, fMLP, PMA, the calcium ionophore A23187) are known to both elevate PA levels (12Bonser R.W. Thompson N.T. Randall R.W. Garland L.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 40Agwu D.E. McPhail L.C. Chabot M.C. Daniel L.W. Wykle R.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2021-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 68Yan S.R. Fumagalli L. Berton G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 69Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8783-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in suspended neutrophils. These observations suggest that stimulus-dependent Tyr phosphorylation of proteins is mediated, in part, by PA and Fgr.The unique elution pattern of Fgr led us to discover its sensitivity to PA. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that another protein Tyr kinase(s) is regulated by PA. Several observations suggest that Fgr is not alone in its regulation by PA. These include the following: 1) PA-dependent Tyr phosphorylating activity was present in elution fractions in which Fgr was not present; 2) the selective Src family protein kinase inhibitor did not completely abolish PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylating activity; and 3) other protein Tyr kinases coeluted with Fgr in the peak of PA-dependent Tyr phosphorylating activity.The mechanism by which PA might regulate the activity of Fgr is not yet clear. Fgr is a 55–58-kDa protein, yet it eluted from the gel filtration column in the void volume (Fig. 5). This suggests that Fgr probably associates with a protein complex. Both cellular and viral Fgr have been reported to associate with cellular proteins (70Ziemiecki A. Catelli M.-G. Joab I. Moncharmont B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 71Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8912-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 72Brunati A.M.

Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility of an indirect action of PA on the activation of Fgr, i.e. a known PA effector may be activated by PA, which in turn activates Fgr. The sensitivity of the PA-stimulated Tyr response to inhibitors of protein Ser/Thr kinases (Table II) suggests this possibility as well. Based on the data presented, we can rule out some of the known PA effectors that could potentially regulate Tyr phosphorylating activity. It is unlikely that protein kinase C is an upstream effector of a protein Tyr kinase in the cell-free system. The selective inhibitor of this protein Ser/Thr kinase had little effect on PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation (Table II), and the activators of protein kinase C (calcium, diacylglycerol ± PA, phosphatidylserine) were inhibitory or had no effect on PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation in the cell-free system. However, in the intact neutrophil, protein kinase C may play a role in the alcohol-sensitive Tyr phosphorylation due to its participation in the regulation of phospholipase D (74Frohman M.A. Sung T.-C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 75Houle M.G. Bourgoin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Among the other PA effectors, our data clearly indicate that the novel PA-activated protein Ser/Thr kinase present in neutrophil cytosol (16Waite K.A. Wallin R. Qualliotine-Mann D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15569-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is not an upstream regulator of a protein Tyr kinase. Activity associated with this protein kinase eluted from the gel filtration column in fractions distinct from those exhibiting PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation activity (Fig. 5). Finally, PKN, which is activated by free fatty acids, can also be activated by PA (76Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Richards A.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9729-9735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our cell-free assay, neither arachidonic acid nor oleic acid, both potent PKN activators, had stimulatory effects on the Tyr phosphorylation (TableII) of exogenous and endogenous substrates. Thus, it is unlikely that PKN is involved in PA-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation. The data presented do not allow us to rule out an involvement of two other candidate PA effectors, Raf-1 and Pak (p21-activated kinase), which are expressed in neutrophils (16Waite K.A. Wallin R. Qualliotine-Mann D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15569-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Experiments are underway to determine the mechanism by which PA activates Fgr.Fgr and a related Src family kinase, Hck, have been implicated in integrin signaling and cell adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 2Berton G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The development of a double knock-out mouse, deficient in both Fgr and Hck, has been useful in demonstrating the requirement of these protein Tyr kinases in adhesion-dependent functional responses (77Lowell C.A.

Interestingly, ethanol, at concentrations comparable to those used in this study, has been reported to decrease neutrophil adhesion in both in situ and in vitro systems (79Brayton R.G. Stokes P.E.

In addition, ethanol has been shown to interfere with both oxidative and nonoxidative killing mechanisms in stimulated neutrophils (81Patel M. Keshavarzian A. Kottapalli V. Badie B. Winship D.

It is tempting to speculate that an interference with PA-dependent regulation of Fgr may compromise neutrophil adhesion and adhesion-dependent cellular functions.In summary, our data indicate that human neutrophils contain Tyr phosphorylating activity that is activated by PA in the intact cell as well as in a cell-free system. Furthermore, we have identified Fgr as at least one of the protein Tyr kinases expressed in neutrophils that can be activated by PA. The lipid regulation of protein Tyr kinases (whether by a direct or indirect mechanism) constitutes a novel regulatory mechanism for this functionally important class of signaling components.AddendumWe have now observed that the magnitude of PA-stimulated Fgr activity is more variable than that shown (Fig.6 A). The variability appears to result from as yet undefined differences in lots of tissue-derived phosphatidylcholine. After testing three lots of phosphatidylcholine, we find that Fgr activity in the presence of PA is 1.45 ± 0.16 (mean ± S.E.,n = 8, p = 0.015)-fold higher than that in the presence of phosphatidylcholine. Neutrophils are dynamic, short lived cells that play a vital role in the early phases of the immune response. They provide formidable killing mechanisms against invading organisms. Neutrophils sense their environment through a variety of cell surface receptors that allow the cells to respond to bacterial products, inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulins, complement cleavage products, and adhesion molecules. Upon receptor ligation, numerous signaling events ensue within the cell that culminate in a repertoire of functional responses appropriate for a given stimulus. Among the many signaling events induced, increased Tyr phosphorylation of proteins is commonly observed for a wide variety of neutrophil stimuli (1Rollet E. Caon A.C. Roberge C.J. Liao N.W. Malawista S.E. McColl S.R. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 353-363PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berton G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Importantly, Tyr phosphorylation appears to play a central role in signaling pathways because treatment of neutrophils with inhibitors of protein Tyr kinases has been shown to interfere with most cellular functions (reviewed in Ref. 3Welch H. Mauran C. Maridonneau-Parini I. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 607-618Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Neutrophils express a large number of nonreceptor protein Tyr kinases (2Berton G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Welch H. Mauran C.

The functional roles of only a few of these enzymes in neutrophils have been clearly defined (reviewed in Ref. 2Berton G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, little is known about the regulation of protein Tyr kinases in neutrophils. The factors that influence Tyr phosphorylation in neutrophils are diverse and may reflect the variety of enzymes expressed in these cells. Examples of signaling events shown to alter protein Tyr kinase activity include ligand-induced dimerization of the Fc receptor (2Berton G. Curr. Opin. Hematol"
https://openalex.org/W2041983526,"The overlapping yaaG andyaaF genes from Bacillus subtilis were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Purification of the gene products showed that yaaG encoded a homodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and that yaaF encoded a homodimeric deoxynucleoside kinase capable of phosphorylating both deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine. The latter was identical to a previously characterized dAdo/dCyd kinase (Møllgaard, H. (1980)J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8216–8220). The purified recombinant dGK was highly specific toward 6-oxopurine 2′-deoxyribonucleosides as phosphate acceptors showing only marginal activities with Guo, dAdo, and 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine. UTP was the preferred phosphate donor with a K m value of 6 μm compared with 36 μm for ATP. In addition, the K m for dGuo was 0.6 μmwith UTP but 6.5 μm with ATP as phosphate donor. The combination of these two effects makes UTP over 50 times more efficient than ATP. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicated that the reaction with dGuo and UTP as substrates followed an Ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism with UTP as the leading substrate and UDP the last product to leave. dGTP was a potent competitive inhibitor with respect to UTP. Above 30 μm of dGuo, substrate inhibition was observed, but only with UTP as phosphate donor.

In addition, a number of organisms possess deoxynucleoside kinases that provide a salvage pathway for the utilization of preformed deoxynucleosides as precursors of DNA. Because the cytotoxicity of a large variety of deoxynucleoside analogs depends on the conversion of these compounds to the corresponding deoxynucleotide analogs, characterization of the substrate specificity and regulation of deoxynucleoside kinases from various sources have received considerable attention (3Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thymidine kinase (dTK),1which can generally use both Thd and dUrd as substrates, is widely distributed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In contrast, only relatively few genera have been shown to express deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and deoxyadenosine kinase (dAK) activities. From mammalian tissues four deoxyribonucleoside kinases, TK1, TK2, dCK, and dGK, with overlapping substrate specificities, have been characterized (for review see Ref. 3Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). TK1 and TK2 are pyrimidine-specific, phosphorylating Thd and dUrd. TK2 can in addition use dCyd as a substrate (4Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bradshaw Jr., H.D.

A deoxynucleoside kinase with a very different substrate specificity was recently characterized from Drosophila melanogaster. In this organism a single homodimeric enzyme (Dm-dNK) is capable of phosphorylating all four deoxyribonucleosides, although with widely different efficiencies (11Johansson M.

Chem. 1980; 255: 8216-8220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to phosphorylate all four deoxynucleosides, whereas it has been established that a number of bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, are lacking dGK, dAK, and dCK activities (16Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 446-473Google Scholar). In Lactobacillus acidophilus strain R26, a strain that appears to lack a functional ribonucleotide reductase (14Ives D.H. Ikeda S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 59: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the deoxynucleoside kinase activities are organized as three enzymes. In addition to a separate dTK, the remaining three activities are located on two heterodimeric proteins, dGK/dAK and dCK/dAK, with each subunit being highly specific for the individual substrates, and specifically feedback inhibited by its respective dNTP end-product (17Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The three subunits of the two heterodimeric enzymes are encoded by two tandem genes, dak and dgk, where dak encodes the dAK subunit of both enzymes, and dgk encodes both dGK and dCK. The only difference between the amino acid sequences of the two latter subunits is that dCK lacks the N-terminal amino acid residues 2 and 3. The mechanism responsible for the co- or post-translational deletion event has not yet been identified (18Ma N. Ikeda S. Guo S. Fieno A. Park I. Grimme S. Ikeda T. Ives D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14385-14390Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, the organization of the activities in Bacillus subtilis is quite different. dTK and dGK are genetically distinct and different from the enzyme that phosphorylates dAdo and dCyd (15Møllgaard H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8216-8220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present report concerns the molecular cloning of two overlappingB. subtilis genes encoding two homodimeric enzymes, dGK and dAK/dCK, and describes the purification and characterization of the recombinant dGK overexpressed in E. coli. The dAK/dCK enzyme appeared to be identical to the deoxyadenosine/deoxycytidine kinase previously purified and characterized from B. subtilis(15Møllgaard H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8216-8220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tris (TRIZMA base), BSA, nucleotides, and nucleosides were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Denmark, and 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides were gifts from Dr. H. G. Ihlenfeldt, Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were from of Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs, and [8-3H]-2′-deoxyguanosine was from Moravek Biochemicals. Dyematrex Blue A and Red A were from Amicon, and Sephacryl S-300 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DE-81 ion exchange paper was from Whatman Ltd., United Kingdom. SDS-PAGE low range molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. E. coliSØ5110 (MC1061 cdd::Tn10 (19Wang J. Neuhard J. Eriksson S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was used as host strain and pUC18 as cloning vector throughout. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (20Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When required, ampicillin was added to the medium at 100 μg/ml. The methods used for preparing chromosomal DNA and for transforming E. coli have been described previously by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from E. coli by the alkaline/SDS lysis procedure (22Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9895) Google Scholar). Fragments from digested plasmid DNA were isolated and purified from agarose gels by the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). Endonuclease digestion and ligation of DNA was done according to the recommendations of the suppliers. DNA was sequenced by the chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) and an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems). The overlapping yaaG andyaaF genes were amplified from genomic B. subtilis DNA by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc.). The 5′-primer, BsdNT4 (5′-GAAGGTCGGATCCTGACGCACG-3′), was designed to contain aBamHI site (underlined) 35 bp upstream of the translational start codon of yaaG. The 3′-primer, BsdNT5 (5′-GTTTTGAAGCTTGCATTCGGTGCGGCG-3′), was designed to contain a HinDIII (underlined) 40 bp downstream of the yaaF stop codon. The resulting amplicon was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pUC18, yielding pRA1. Because the reading frames ofyaaG and the vector-borne lacZ′ happened to be the same on pRA1, the BamHI site of the plasmid (located between the lac promoter and the cloned fragment) was opened, filled in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase, and religated. The lacZ′ reading frame of the resulting plasmid, pRA8, was changed, and the BamHI site was replaced by a unique ClaI site (see Fig. 1). Plasmid pRA5 was obtained by subcloning the 825-bpPstI-HindIII fragment of pRA8 into pUC18. Plasmid pRA9 was obtained by cloning the 713-bp EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of pUC18. Plasmids with the correct orientation relative to the lac promoter were identified byPstI digestion (see Fig. 1). A 1-liter culture of E. coli SØ5110 containing plasmid pRA8 was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin, harvested by centrifugation, and subjected to sonication in 15 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (buffer A). Following centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman L8–80 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and the precipitate formed between 45 and 70% saturation was redissolved and dialyzed overnight against buffer A. The dialyzed fraction was applied to a Dyematrex RedA column (1.5 × 16 cm), washed with 10 volumes of buffer A, and the column was eluted with 5 volumes of a linear KCl gradient (0–2 m) in buffer A. Fractions with dNK activity were pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, redissolved, dialyzed against buffer A, and applied to a Dyematrex Blue A column (1.5 × 16 cm). The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A and eluted as above. Fractions 34–37, containing the highest dGK activity, and fractions 46–51, containing the highest dAK/dCK activity, were pooled separately, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, redissolved, and dialyzed against buffer A. One liter of an early stationary phase culture of E. coli SØ5110/pRA9 in LB medium containing ampicillin was harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 0.9% NaCl, and the resultant cell pellet was suspended in 15 ml of buffer A containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA. The suspension was subjected to sonication followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in an ultracentrifuge, and the 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to a Dyematrex Blue A column (1.5 × 16 cm). The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A followed by 30 ml of a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.2m) in buffer A. The activity was recovered by subsequent isocratic elution with 0.2 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing dGK activity were pooled and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose Hi Performance column (1.5 × 15 cm). The column was washed with 50 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, followed by 50 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% 2-propanol, 5% ethanediol, and subsequently eluted with 1% Triton X-100. Fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep centrifugal concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). The concentrated enzyme was stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C. Deoxyguanosine kinase activity was measured with one of two procedures. Assay 1 measured the conversion of [3H]dGuo to [3H]dGMP. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, variable concentrations of [3H]dGuo and nucleoside triphosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme and performed at 37 °C. Four 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken at different times after addition of enzyme. These were mixed with 5 μl of 1.5 m formic acid to stop the reaction, and the entire mixture was pipetted onto DE-81 filter discs and dried. The discs were washed in deionized water for 30 min and dried, and the bound radioactivity was eluted from the filters with 1 ml of 0.1m HCl, 0.2 m KCl and counted in a Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instruments, Inc., Downers Grove, IL) using 5 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics). The amount of enzyme used in the assays was such that less than 10% of the substrate was converted to product during the reaction. All samples were taken within the linear part of the reaction, and initial velocities were determined from the slope of the lines. Assay 2 measured spectrophotometrically the oxidation of NADH coupled enzymatically to the phosphorylation of nucleoside to nucleotide. The reaction mixture (500 μl) contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm NTP, 0.1–0.4 mmnucleoside, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.18 mmNADH, 2 units of pyruvate kinase (10 units when UTP or CTP was used as phosphate donor), 2.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and enzyme. The reaction was started by addition of nucleoside, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed at 37 °C. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of dGMP per min. Protein was determined by the method of Lowryet al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. K m andV max values were obtained by fitting steady-state kinetic data to the rate equation for a sequential Bi Bi mechanism with the Biosoft program UltraFit 3.0 for Macintosh.K i values were calculated from secondary plots of inhibitor concentration versus intercept or slope of the double-reciprocal plots using linear least-squares regression analysis to determine the best-fit line describing the data. The mass spectrometry was performed by Dr. Jette Wagtberg Sen at the Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, using a Mariner electrospray time-of-flight spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Protein samples were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue and applied on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Gels were run at 40 mA for 70 min and silver-stained (26Merril C.R. Goldman D. Van Keuren M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of dAK and dGK from L. acidophilus, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the dak/dgk tandem genes (27Ma G.T. Hong Y.S. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6596-6601Google Scholar), were used to search the B. subtilis genome sequence (28Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P.

Danchin A. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar) for open reading frames encoding putative deoxynucleoside kinases. Two genes, yaaG and yaaF, were identified at coordinates 22497–23767 bp, which encoded putative polypeptides with 25–32% amino acid sequence identity to the L. acidophilusdeoxynucleoside kinases. The nucleotide sequence indicated that the TGA stop codon of yaaG overlapped 2 bp with the ATG start codon of yaaF, and that both open reading frames were preceded by typical B. subtilis Shine-Dalgarno sequences (29McLaughlin J.R. Murray C.L. Rabinowitz J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4912-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of the two gene products were 30% identical. The putative yaaG/yaaF operon was amplified from B. subtilis genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into pUC18, resulting in pRA8 (Fig. 1). Subsequently,yaaG and yaaF were subcloned separately in pUC18 using the internal PstI and EcoRI sites of pRA8, yielding plasmids pRA9 and pRA5, respectively (Fig. 1). In all constructs the cloned genes were transcribed from the lacpromoter (lacP) of the vector and translated from the native ribosomal binding regions. DNA sequencing of the cloned fragments of pRA9 and pRA5 confirmed the published genomic sequence and showed that they encoded potential polypeptides of 207 and 217 amino acid residues, respectively. SDS-PAGE of total proteins from cultures of E. coli harboring pRA9 or pRA5 revealed a major band with a mobility corresponding to a 24-kDa polypeptide, in accordance with the molecular masses of the yaaG and yaaF gene products as deduced from the nucleotide sequence (data not shown). Crude cellular extracts of E. coli SØ5110 harboring pRA8, pRA9, and pRA5 were assayed for deoxynucleoside kinase activity with dGuo, dAdo, and dCyd as substrates (Table I). The results suggested that yaaG encoded a kinase specific for deoxyguanosine, whereas the yaaF gene product was capable of phosphorylating both deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine.Table IDeoxynucleoside kinase activities in crude extracts of E. coli harboring various plasmidsPlasmidB. subtilis genes on plasmidSpecific activity 1-aAssay 2 with GTP as phosphate donor was used.

Open table in a new tab To establish whether all three kinase activities were part of a single heterooligomeric enzyme in conditions where both yaaG andyaaF were present in the cells, crude extracts of E. coli SØ5110/pRA8 were subjected to both ammonium sulfate fractionation and dye-affinity chromatography. TableII shows that the kinase activities for dGuo, dAdo, and dCyd copurified upon ammonium sulfate precipitation and on RedA dye chromatography. However, on a BlueA dye column deoxyguanosine kinase activity eluted clearly before the deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine kinase activities. Together with the results presented in Table I, this indicated that the gene products ofyaaG and yaaF formed two physically distinct enzymes, dGK and dAK/dCK. Preliminary characterization of the recombinant dAK/dCK from the BlueA dye column indicated that it was identical to the deoxyadenosine/deoxycytidine kinase previously purified and characterized from B. subtilis (15Møllgaard H.

The final procedure adopted involved fractionation by BlueA dye affinity chromatography and separation according to hydrophobicity on a phenyl-Sepharose column producing an enzyme that was >99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE, with an overall yield of 25% (TableIII).Table IIIPurification of B. subtilis recombinant dGKPurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activity 3-aAssay 2 was used with dGuo at 0.1 mm and UTP at 0.5 mm.Yieldmgunitsunits/mg%100,000 × g supernatant3152280.7100BlueA column661762.777Phenyl-Sepharose column7578.125From 1 liter of bacterial culture.3-a Assay 2 was used with dGuo at 0.1 mm and UTP at 0.5 mm. Open table in a new tab From 1 liter of bacterial culture. The molecular mass of the subunit was determined to be 24,147 Da by electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown), in accordance with the molecular mass of the yaaGgene product deduced from the DNA sequence (24,145 Da). The molecular mass of purified recombinant dGK was about 49 kDa as estimated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, suggesting that the enzyme was a homodimer under the conditions employed. In the presence of 50% v/v glycerol, concentrated solutions of the enzyme (>1 mg/ml) could be stored for at least 1 year at −20 °C without loss of activity. Upon dilution for assays the enzyme was highly unstable at 0 °C unless BSA (1 mg/ml) was added to the dilution buffer. In the presence of BSA the diluted enzyme (>1 μg/ml) was stable for months at 0 °C. With saturating concentrations of dGuo and UTP, dGK showed a broad pH optimum centered around pH 9. At pH 7.5 and 11.5 more than 80% of maximal activity was still observed. At pH 6.0, 60% activity remained, whereas the enzyme was completely inactive below pH 5.6 (data not shown). As observed for most kinases, dGK required Mg2+ for activity, suggesting that the true phosphate donor is MgNTP2−. Excess Mg2+ did not inhibit the enzyme. Thus, all assays were performed with Mg2+ at 5 mm to ensure that all NTP present in the reaction was complexed with magnesium. The specificity of the enzyme toward the nucleoside substrate was determined using the coupled assay and GTP as the phosphate donor. Naturally occurring ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides as well as certain nucleoside analogs were tested. As shown in Table IV, the enzyme is highly specific toward 6-oxopurine 2′-deoxynucleosides. Only marginal activity was observed with guanosine, and neither 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides nor hypoxanthine arabinoside served as substrates.Table IVNucleoside specificity of dGKSubstrateRelative activity 4-aActivities are relative to the activity with 2′-deoxyguanosine as substrate (2.5 units/mg).%2′-Deoxyguanosine1002′-Deoxyinosine632′-Deoxyadenosine32′-Deoxycytidine3Thymidine<1Guanosine7Inosine<1Adenosine12,3-Dideoxyguanosine<12,3-Dideoxyinosine<12,3-Dideoxyadenosine<1Hypoxanthine arabinoside<1Assay 2 was used with nucleosides present at 0.4 mm and GTP at 0.5 mm.4-a Activities are relative to the activity with 2′-deoxyguanosine as substrate (2.5 units/mg). Open table in a new tab Assay 2 was used with nucleosides present at 0.4 mm and GTP at 0.5 mm. Previous studies with dAK/dCK from B. subtilis indicated that GTP and dGTP were the preferred phosphate donors with both dAdo and dCyd as substrates; ATP and UTP were only half as effective (15Møllgaard H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8216-8220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments with dGK indicated that all naturally occurring ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, with the exception of dGTP, were active as phosphate donors. Under the conditions used (20 μm dGuo and 25 μm NTP) UTP was slightly more efficient than the other NTPs. With dGTP no measurable activity was observed (data not shown). Initial velocity experiments were carried out at varying concentrations of the four individual ribonucleoside triphosphates and fixed concentrations of dGuo. For each of the NTPs, double reciprocal plots of the initial rate as a function of the NTP concentration for various fixed dGuo concentrations yielded a series of intersecting lines, diagnostic of a sequential reaction mechanism (data not shown). The data obtained were fitted to the rate equation for a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. The kinetic constants obtained (Table V) showed that the trueV max values for the various NTPs were quite similar, whereas large variations in the true K mvalues for the four NTPs were observed. Thek cat/K m measure of substrate efficiency indicated a preference for UTP as phosphate donor by a factor of 4–6. Furthermore, the data indicated that theK m for dGuo was highly dependent on the nature of the phosphate donor (Table V). In the presence of UTP the trueK m for dGuo was 0.6 μm compared with 6.5 with ATP. This synergism between the high affinity for UTP and the low K m for dGuo with UTP as phosphate donor makes UTP 50–60 times more efficient than ATP as a phosphate donor. In all further kinetic studies UTP was employed as phosphate donor.Table VKinetic constants for Bs-dGK with different NTPs as phosphate donorsNTPTrueV max 5-aV max andK m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity experiments as described under “Methods.” For each NTP, five different concentrations of dGuo and five different concentrations of the triphosphate were used.k cat 5-bThe turnover number,k cat, was calculated per subunit.NTPdGuoTrueK m 5-aV max andK m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity experiments as described under “Methods.” For each NTP, five different concentrations of dGuo and five different concentrations of the triphosphate were used.k cat/K m 5-cNumbers in parenthesis are relative values.TrueK m 5-aV max andK m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity experiments as described under “Methods.” For each NTP, five different concentrations of dGuo and five different concentrations of the triphosphate were used.k cat/K m 5-cNumbers in parenthesis are relative values.units/mgs−1μmm−1s−1μmm−1s−1UTP3.51.4162.4 × 105 (1.00)0.62.4 × 106 (1.00)CTP5.62.25356.4 × 104 (0.27)1.71.3 × 106 (0.54)ATP3.81.53364.3 × 104 (0.18)6.52.4 × 105 (0.10)GTP4.21.69463.7 × 104 (0.15)10.41.6 × 105 (0.07)5-a V max andK m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity experiments as described under “Methods.” For each NTP, five different concentrations of dGuo and five different concentrations of the triphosphate were used.5-b The turnover number,k cat, was calculated per subunit.5-c Numbers in parenthesis are relative values."

Initial experiments revealed that stimulation with IL-1 caused a rapid, matrix-dependent activation of Ras. The effect was transient, peaking at 5 min and returning to base levels after 30 min. Activation correlated with pronounced changes in cell shape in EGFPH-Ras transfected cells. Transfection with the dominant negative mutant, RasAsn-17, inhibited IL-1 induced activation of the IL-8 promoter as well as of NF-κB and AP-1 synthetic promoters in transient transfection assays. Furthermore, overexpression of the IL-1 signaling proteins TRAF6 or MyD88 gave characteristic activation of IL-8, which was accentuated in the presence of IL-1. Co-transfection with RasAsn-17 gave a dose-dependent inhibition of TRAF6-induced responses in the presence and absence of IL-1, but had no effect on MyD88 mediated activity. Similarly, induction of NF-κB was abolished by RasAsn-17 only in TRAF6-transfected cells. In contrast, inhibiting Ras activity limited AP-1-mediated responses through both receptor complex proteins. Constitutively active RasVal-12increased the TRAF6 induced activity of the NF-κB pathway similar to the effect induced by IL-1, while the RasVal-12 induced activity was not inhibited by co-transfection with a dominant negative TRAF6. Our data show that activation of the Ras GTPase is an early, matrix-dependent response in IL-1 signaling which participates in structural regulation of IL-1-induced genes. In addition, they show that the Ras induced effect selectively regulates TRAF6-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway, suggesting that Ras GTPase represents a convergence point in structural and cytokine responses, with distinct effects on a subset of downstream signaling events.

Subsequently, the IL-1R associated kinase 1s are freed and interact with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, followed by activation of the stress-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathways (15Cao Z.D.

Aspects of Ras, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 involvement in downstream IL-1 signaling pathways have recently been elucidated (22Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting they play a part in mediating these structural changes localized around the receptor complex. This may underpin the, as yet, unclear mechanism by which the GTPases interact with members of the classical IL-1 signaling cascade. So far, however, little is still known of how these effects are initiated, and how they may modulate IL-1 signaling and influence downstream cascades.We report here that IL-1-induced structural alterations in adherent cells involve activation of the Ras GTPase as an early signaling event, which regulates IL-1-induced NF-κB transactivation of inflammatory genes. In addition, we show that Ras regulation of NF-κB affects TRAF6-mediated activation, but not that induced through MyD88, indicating that IL-1 induced pathways leading to NF-κB activation diverge upstream of TRAF6. Furthermore, the data suggest that Ras represents a convergence of IL-1 and matrix-mediated signaling events induced downstream of the adaptor proteins.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that IL-1 transiently activates Ras in a matrix-dependent fashion, correlating with translocation of EGFPH-Ras fusion protein and structural effects on IL-1 responses in transfected cells. We also show that the regulation of IL-1-mediated NF-κB activity by Ras is induced through TRAF6.The IL-1-induced Ras activation occurs during the initial steps of signal transduction involving heterodimerization of the receptor and the accessory protein and in matrix-attached cells, recruitment of a heparan sulfate to the receptor complex. Association of the adaptor protein MyD88 results in activation of the receptor IRAKs and association of TRAF6 (see Fig. 7). The observed Ras activity correlate with the similarly rapid, matrix-dependent IL-1 induced serine phosphorylation of the transmembrane linkage protein, Talin preceding the alterations in cell structure and the changes in the cytoskeleton (20Zhu P. Xiong W.S. Rodgers G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Qwarnstrom E.E. Macfarlane S.A. Page R.C. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1991; 88: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such alterations are known to be directly associated with events related to GTPase activation (33Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar). These data agree with recent findings of essential roles for other members of the GTPase family in IL-1 signaling (22Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7818-7825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Singh R. Wang B. Shirvaikar A. Khan S. Kamat S. Schelling J.R. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and together with the known interdependence between members of the Ras and Rho subfamilies suggest that their roles in IL-1-mediated responses to be interconnected.Our data further suggest that the IL-1 effect involves an increase in the concentration of the GTPase at the plasma membrane during activation. This is likely, to a significant extent, to be a consequence of the reduction in cell shape. However, Ras isoforms have been shown to have the ability to rapidly diffuse through the plasma membrane (34Niv H. Gutman O. Henis Y.I. Kloog Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1606-1613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and an increase in local concentration at the cell surface could reflect recruitment to specific areas to facilitate signal transduction. This could involve a mechanism similar to that demonstrated for Ras, Rac, and Rho during integrin and growth factor signaling, when localization to caveolin-rich regions in pre-assembled complexes is a prerequisite for signal transduction (35Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Wary K.K. Mariotti A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21430-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).The rapid induction of Ras activation suggests that it is induced through an immediate, receptor-associated event, and could be a direct consequence of the early IRAKs and TRAF6 association. This likely involves receptor-associated regulators of the GTPases such as the putative Rap/GTPase activating protein (GAP), IIP-1 (38Sims, J. E., Bird, T. A., and Mitcham, J. L. (1995)Cytokine 324.Google Scholar). Furthermore, the attachment dependence suggests that activation could be induced as a consequence of recruitment of the matrix-dependent, accessory receptor component to the IL-1 receptor complex (17Valles S. Tsoi C. Huang W.Y. Wyllie D. Carlotti F. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20103-20109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and thus result from co-regulation through integrin mediated activities. Such effects could be induced following selective activation of signaling components by structural events, as suggested by our data demonstrating specificity for the activities mediated through receptor-associated proteins MyD88 and TRAF6. This type of collaboration would thus be similar to that reported for MyD88 and Tollip during recruitment to the IL-1 receptor (14Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).We show that IL-1-induced NF-κB mediated transcription of IL-8 is dependent on Ras activity, demonstrated by using wild type and dominant negative mutant forms of Ras in transient transfection reporter assays. This agrees with previous findings from this laboratory, showing a direct dependence of IL-1 induced inflammatory genes (19Ostberg C.O. Zhu P. Wight T.N. Qwarnstrom E.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and NF-κB activation (18Qwarnstrom E.E. Ostberg C.O. Turk G.L. Richardson C.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, the lack of effect of nuclear translocation of RelA could reflect that Ras, as has been suggested for Rac1 (24Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3114-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), may regulate subsequent transactivation events such as phosphorylation of nuclear NF-κB (44Zhong H.H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In addition, the burgeoning evidence of complexity of NF-κB activity, involving association of nuclear IκBα·NF-κB complexes subsequent to independent translocation (45Johnson C. VanAntwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regulation through RelA shuttling 2F. Carlotti, S. K. Dower, and E. E. Qwarnstrom, submitted for publication. suggests that significant activation of the pathway may be induced without any net effect on the level of nuclear RelA. This is also supported by results from studying the endogenous protein demonstrating that activation of the pathway does not necessarily correlate with an absolute increase in nuclear NF-κB. 3E. E. Qwarnstrom and S. K. Dower, unpublished data. Finally, it is possible that the lack of RelA translocation reflects that structural induction activates only a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes, as has been shown for glycogen synthase kinase-3β (46Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgatt J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar).This type of specificity is also in agreement with the suggested divergence of the pathway upstream of TRAF6, and indicate that MyD88 can activate NF-κB via a TRAF6 independent pathway. The effect on both TRAF6 and MyD88 induced AP-1 regulation indicate that Ras may be able to influence activation of specific genes through selectivity of adaptor protein function, reflected in distinct sets of upstream regulators. The total lack of effect of the dominant negative TRAF6 on NF-κB activation induced through transfection with RasVal-12 suggests that structural regulation through Ras feeds into the NF-κB pathway downstream of TRAF6 or is induced through second messengers totally separate from that regulated by TRAF6. Thus, activation through TRAF6 via TAB-2 and TAK-1 (47Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) constitutes an IL-1-regulated pathway controlling NF-κB, while other regulators, such as NIK and NAK (48Tojima Y. Fujimoto A.

The indicated synergy in the observed response suggests, however, that whatever the upstream discrepancies in signaling, the Ras-induced effect on the NF-κB pathway is not totally distinct from the IL-1 mode of activation but rather that, the two activities converge upstream of induction of transcription.This type of receptor proximal divergence of TRAF6/MyD88-regulated pathways has been reported in in vitro studies on Toll signaling (49Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Studies on TRAF6 and MyD88 knockout mice have also shown a degree of compensation and/or redundancy and partial overlapping at the level of the adaptor proteins in transcriptional activation by IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide (50Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C.

By analogy with these systems, the type of model applied to our data suggests that IL-1 mediated responses may be “tailored” by GTPase activation and regulated by events such as cell attachment induced by selective involvement of receptor complex components (see Fig. 7). Cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors are influenced by the extracellular milieu (1Lukashev M.E. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These regulatory effects are mediated to a large extent by receptors of the integrin family and involve modulation of signaling pathways that link receptor activation and changes in cell shape, the cytoskeleton, and gene expression (2Hall A.

Ras acts cooperatively and/or hierarchically with the Rho subfamily of guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) to regulate focal adhesion and polymerized actin turnover (4Nobes, C.

It is thought to be in their arrangement of signaling proteins and receptors via the cytoskeleton that the GTPases are able to channel a diverse range of stimuli, from growth factor and cytokines to cell attachment, into common downstream signaling cascades (5Scita G.

The membrane proximal molecular events that take place following interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) binding and leading to transcription factor activation involves initially the heterodimerization of the IL-1R with accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) (10Greenfeder S.A.

Subsequently, the IL-1R associated kinase 1s are freed and interact with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, followed by activation of the stress-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathways (15Cao Z.D. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The majority of IL-1 receptors are located at focal adhesions (16Qwarnstrom E.E.

Subsequent IL-1-induced signal transduction and gene activation are regulated by cell attachment and the cytoskeleton (18Qwarnstrom E.E. Ostberg C.O. Turk G.L. Richardson C.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Early alterations following IL-1 receptor binding in adherent cells include a rapid and transient phosphorylation of transmembrane linkage protein Talin and changes in the cytoskeleton (21Qwarnstrom E.E.

Aspects of Ras, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 involvement in downstream IL-1 signaling pathways have recently been elucidated (22Palsson E.M. Popoff M. Thelestam M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting they play a part in mediating these structural changes localized around the receptor complex. This may underpin the, as yet, unclear mechanism by which the GTPases interact with members of the classical IL-1 signaling cascade. So far, however, little is still known of how these effects are initiated, and how they may modulate IL-1 signaling and influence downstream cascades. We report here that IL-1-induced structural alterations in adherent cells involve activation of the Ras GTPase as an early signaling event, which regulates IL-1-induced NF-κB transactivation of inflammatory genes. In addition, we show that Ras regulation of NF-κB affects TRAF6-mediated activation, but not that induced through MyD88, indicating that IL-1 induced pathways leading to NF-κB activation diverge upstream of TRAF6. Furthermore, the data suggest that Ras represents a convergence of IL-1 and matrix-mediated signaling events induced downstream of the adaptor proteins. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we demonstrate that IL-1 transiently activates Ras in a matrix-dependent fashion, correlating with translocation of EGFPH-Ras fusion protein and structural effects on IL-1 responses in transfected cells. We also show that the regulation of IL-1-mediated NF-κB activity by Ras is induced through TRAF6.The IL-1-induced Ras activation occurs during the initial steps of signal transduction involving heterodimerization of the receptor and the accessory protein and in matrix-attached cells, recruitment of a heparan sulfate to the receptor complex. Association of the adaptor protein MyD88 results in activation of the receptor IRAKs and association of TRAF6 (see Fig. 7). The observed Ras activity c"

Little is known about post-translational regulation of Pmc1p. In a genetic screen for potential negative regulators of Pmc1p, a vacuolar v-SNARE protein, Nyv1p, was recovered. Cells overproducing Nyv1p show decreased Ca2+ tolerance and decreased accumulation of Ca2+ in the vacuole, similar to pmc1 null mutants. Overexpression of Nyv1p had no such effects onpmc1 mutants, suggesting that Nyv1p may inhibit Pmc1p function. Overexpression of Nyv1p did not decrease Pmc1p levels but decreased the specific ATP-dependent Ca2+transport activity of Pmc1p in purified vacuoles by at least 2-fold. The effect of Nyv1p on Pmc1p function is likely to be direct because native immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Pmc1p coprecipitated with Nyv1p. Complexes between Nyv1p and its t-SNARE partner Vam3p were also isolated, but these complexes lacked Pmc1p. We conclude that Nyv1p can interact physically with Pmc1p and inhibit its Ca2+transport activity in the vacuole membrane. This is the first example of a Ca2+-ATPase regulation by a v-SNARE protein involved in membrane fusion reactions.

In eukaryotic cells, cytosolic free Ca2+concentration, ([Ca2+]c), is typically maintained at submicromolar levels against millimolar free Ca2+concentrations in the lumen of secretory organelles and extracellular spaces. Such steep gradients are generated and maintained by Ca2+-pumping ATPases and ion exchangers, which offset the effects of Ca2+ channels and nonspecific leaks in the membrane. The regulated opening and closing of Ca2+channels in cellular membranes contribute to [Ca2+]c modulation with intricate temporal and spatial resolution, permitting the use of cytosolic Ca2+ as a regulator of numerous cellular processes such as metabolism, gene expression, and membrane fusion. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, large lysosome-like vacuoles serve as the major intracellular Ca2+ reservoir, accumulating ∼95%of the total cell-associated Ca2+ (1Eilam Y. Lavi H.

As listed in TableI, two vacuolar Ca2+transporters have been identified, the Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1p and the H+·Ca2+ exchanger Vcx1p (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J.

Deletion of the PMC1 gene decreases the ability to grow in high Ca2+ environments, while deletion of VCX1decreases Ca2+ tolerance only slightly, suggesting that Pmc1p normally plays a more significant role in vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration. Ca2+ stored in the vacuole can bind inorganic polyphosphates in the lumen and precipitate thereby increasing the capacity for Ca2+ sequestration (2Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, release of Ca2+ from the vacuole was found to be important for homotypic fusion of vacuole membranes in vitro(6Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Homotypic vacuole fusion involves membrane-bound (SNAREs)1including the vesicle v-SNAREs Nyv1p, Vti1p, and Ykt6p, the target membrane t-SNARE Vam3p, and Vam7p (7Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R.

At a late step in the homotypic fusion pathway, Ca2+ is released from the vacuole causing a local elevation in [Ca2+]c, which triggers fusion of docked membranes through a calmodulin-dependent process (6Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, vacuoles lacking both Pmc1p and Vcx1p were fully active in homotypic fusion assays (10Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

Mutants lacking Pmr1p exhibit high rates of Ca2+influx and elevation of [Ca2+]c due to stimulation of a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel composed of Cch1p and Mid1p (16Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This process resembles the capacitative calcium entry mechanisms in animal cells where depletion of secretory Ca2+ pools promotes Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane channels and refilling of the depleted organelles (17Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In yeast, excessive activity of the vacuolar Ca2+transporters Pmc1p and Vcx1p can compete with Pmr1p for Ca2+ and activate the capacitative calcium entry-like mechanism (16Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of vacuolar Ca2+transporters must be balanced with Pmr1p activity to avoid depletion of secretory organelles and inefficient use of energy for Ca2+sequestration in the vacuole. Extensive studies have revealed that all three Ca2+transporters in yeast are regulated by a signaling network involving calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that becomes activated by binding Ca2+ and calmodulin upon elevation of [Ca2+]c. Genetic studies suggest that Vcx1p may be inhibited by calcineurin at a post-translational level (4Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Transcription of PMC1 and PMR1 is increased upon calcineurin-dependent activation of the transcription factor Tcn1p/Crz1p (18Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In high Ca2+ environments, the strong up-regulation of Pmc1p is necessary for proliferation (18Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, when environmental Ca2+ concentrations subside, the excess Pmc1p activity might inhibit normal maintenance of Ca2+ in secretory organelles. Negative regulation of Pmc1p activity may, therefore, be important under these and other conditions. To date, no negative regulators of Pmc1p have been identified. In this study, we screened for negative regulators of Pmc1p in vivo and identified Nyv1p, a transmembrane v-SNARE protein in the vacuole membrane, as a likely candidate. We found no obvious role of Pmc1p or Nyv1p in vacuole morphology or fusion in vivo. Rather, Nyv1p bound to Pmc1p and inhibited its Ca2+transport activity in vivo and in vitro. Thus, a new role of Nyv1p in yeast may be the regulation of Pmc1p activity and Ca2+ homeostasis. Standard culture media for yeast and Escherichia coli have been described previously (20Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar).

A pmr1 cch1 strain (ELY106) was transformed with a YEp13-based library of yeast genomic DNA (gift from Kim Nasmyth, Vienna, Austria), and transformants were replica plated onto Whatman No. 3MM filter papers that had been placed on the surface of agar medium containing YPD medium supplemented with 5 mm succinic acid, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm adenine.

One plasmid, pLE66, contained theTCN1/CRZ1 gene encoding the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor involved inPMC1-lacZ induction (18Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Another plasmid, pLE8, carried a genomic DNA insert spanning three complete genes, SUL2,NYV1, and GIS3. In a parallel screen using apmr1 mid1 strain and a low-copy pRS313-based library of genomic DNA (gift from David Levin, Johns Hopkins University), a plasmid carrying SUL2 and NYV1 genes was isolated as a stimulator of PMC1-lacZ expression in the pmr1 mid1 cells. Subcloning showed the NYV1 gene alone conferred the phenotype of increased PMC1-lacZ expression. The first subclone, plasmid pNYV-HIS, carried 2.5 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA surrounding NYV1 (from the SmaI site at nucleotide −191 to a Sau3A site at nucleotide +2315 relative to initiation codon) ligated into the SmaI site of pYO323 (24Qadota H. Ishii I. Fujiyama A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Yeast. 1992; 8: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The second subclone, plasmid pNYV-LEU, carried a 1.4-kilobase-pair SmaI-EcoRV fragment of the NYV1 locus ligated into the SmaI site of pYO325 (24Qadota H. Ishii I. Fujiyama A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Yeast. 1992; 8: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmids pPI12 and pSK60 have been described previously (25VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Total cell-associated Ca2+ was determined for yeast strains grown at 30 °C for 4 h in YPD medium supplemented with 20 μCi/ml as described previously (4Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The nonexchangeable Ca2+ pool was measured by a similar protocol except that the cultures were diluted 5-fold with fresh YPD medium containing 20 mm CaCl2 and incubated an additional 20 min at 30 °C prior to harvesting by filtration. The exchangeable Ca2+ pool represents the difference between total Ca2+ and nonexchangeable Ca2+. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 30 °C in YPD (pH 5.5) medium or half-concentrated synthetic complete minus leucine medium. Saturated cell suspensions were then diluted 100-fold into 0.2 ml of the same medium supplemented with various concentrations of CaCl2 and incubated in flat-bottom 96-well dishes for 20 h at 30 °C without shaking. The optical density of each culture was measured at 650 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). One hundred μg of purified vacuoles prepared as described previously (26Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were solubilized with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5%Tween 20, and protease inhibitors), incubated with anti-Nyv1p antiserum (9Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then treated with protein A beads for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), decorated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies specific for the HA tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or polyclonal antibodies specific for Nyv1p or Vam3p (8Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, after priming the reaction with ATP, vacuoles were first suspended in 750 μl of reaction buffer containing cytosol and ATP, incubated at 27 °C, washed with 500 μl of PS buffer (10 mmPIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, and 200 mm sorbitol) and then solubilized, treated with antibodies to Nyv1p or Vam3p, and processed as described (8Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Purified vacuoles were suspended at 32 μg/ml in reaction buffer (10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl) containing 10 μCi/ml45CaCl2 plus varying concentrations of nonradioactive CaCl2 and EGTA. Free Ca2+concentrations were calculated using MaxChelator. 2Contact corresponding author for Web address. Reactions were prewarmed to 30 °C and initiated by the addition of either 1 mm ATP or 2.5 mm ADP. After 1 min of incubation, vacuoles were collected by rapid filtration onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (type HA, Millipore) and washed three times with the ice-cold buffer A (5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, and 10 mm CaCl2), and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Time course experiments showed that Ca2+ transport reactions were linear for at least 2 min. ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was calculated by subtracting the values obtained using ADP from those obtained using ATP. Microscopic observation of yeast vacuoles in vivo was carried out by labeling with FM4–64 (Molecular Probes). Log-phase cells were incubated in 50 μl of YPD containing 20 μg/ml FM4–64 for 20 min at 30 °C. Cells were washed three times with fresh YPD, resuspended in 1 ml of YPD, incubated for an additional 60 min, and observed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with 100× objectives. Mutants lacking the Golgi Ca2+-ATPase Pmr1p maintain [Ca2+]c at elevated levels in part due to increased Ca2+ influx via the Cch1p-Mid1p Ca2+ channel, resulting in elevated expression of the calcineurin-dependent reporter gene PMC1-lacZ(16Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Marchi V. Sorin A. Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The up-regulated Pmc1p helps lower [Ca2+]c to levels that permit proliferation (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a hypothetical inhibitor of Pmc1p, when overexpressed in pmr1 mutants, would cause further elevation of [Ca2+]c and PMC1-lacZ expression and possibly decrease proliferation. There would be no such effects in wild type cells because Pmr1p can maintain [Ca2+]c andPMC1-lacZ expression at low levels even in the absence of Pmc1p and Vcx1p (4Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To identify potential inhibitors of Pmc1p, a high-dosage plasmid library of yeast genomic DNA was screened for clones that elevated PMC1-lacZ expression in colonies of apmr1 cch1 double mutant grown in optimized medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pmr1 cch1 double mutant was used instead of a pmr1 single mutant because the latter strain exhibits high background staining with X-gal, whereas background staining was much lower in the former (16Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As expected under these screening conditions, most of the colonies stained light blue with X-gal due to low expression of PMC1-lacZ, although several stained darker blue. One of the plasmids was isolated and found to carry the NYV1 gene plus flanking genes. Subcloning revealed that the NYV1 gene itself, when overexpressed, was necessary and sufficient to increasePMC1-lacZ expression in pmr1 cch1 mutants. A second screen employing pmr1 mid1 double mutants also recovered a plasmid bearingNYV1. 3E. G. Locke and K. W. Cunningham, unpublished data. TheNYV1 gene encodes a v-SNARE protein that localizes to the vacuole membrane and is required for homotypic fusion of vacuolesin vitro (7Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Nyv1p might affect vacuolar Ca2+ homeostasis. To determine whether NYV1 overexpression alters accumulation of Ca2+ in the vacuole, the nonexchangeable Ca2+ pool was quantitated in a variety of yeast strains after prolonged growth in medium containing45Ca2+ as a tracer. As seen previously (4Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the nonexchangeable Ca2+ pool was very large in wild type cells and vcx1 mutants but was greatly diminished inpmc1 mutants and pmc1 vcx1 double mutants (Fig.1). Overexpression of NYV1significantly decreased the nonexchangeable Ca2+ pool in wild type and vcx1 mutants but had no significant effect in either pmc1 mutants or pmc1 vcx1 double mutants. In all these strains, there was no significant effect ofNYV1 overexpression on the levels of exchangeable Ca2+ (data not shown). These results suggested that Nyv1p overexpression diminishes Pmc1p activity but does not abolish it. To determine whether the effect of Nyv1p required Vam3p, a vacuolar t-SNARE that forms complexes with Nyv1p (8Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), similar measurements of nonexchangeable Ca2+ pools were performed onvam3 mutants. For unknown reasons, the nonexchangeable Ca2+ pools were consistently elevated ∼2-fold invam3 mutants relative to wild type, independently of Vcx1p and Pmc1p (Fig. 1). Overexpression of NYV1 decreased the nonexchangeable Ca2+ pool in vam3 vcx1 double mutants but increased this pool in pmc1 vam3 vcx1 triple mutants. A close comparison of these two mutant strains indicated that the Pmc1p-dependent activity was significantly diminished by increased NYV1 dosage. Thus, NYV1overexpression decreased Ca2+ accumulation in the vacuoles of yeast cells by a process that was independent of Vcx1p and Vam3p but dependent on Pmc1p. The results are consistent with a model in which Nyv1p directly or indirectly inhibits the Ca2+ transport activity of Pmc1p in the vacuole, independently of fusion. Pmc1p is essential for growth in high calcium environments (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether NYV1 overexpression could also diminish Ca2+ tolerance in a Pmc1p-dependent fashion. Overexpression of NYV1 greatly decreased Ca2+ tolerance of vcx1 mutants almost to that ofpmc1 vcx1 double mutants (Fig.2 A). Overexpression ofNYV1 in pmc1 vcx1 double mutants had little effect on Ca2+ tolerance. As a control for specificity, we also tested the effects of overexpressing VTI1 andYKT6 genes encoding v-SNARE proteins related to Nyv1p, recently implicated in vacuole fusion reactions (9Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). There was no detectable effect of overexpressing the related v-SNARE proteins in either vcx1 mutants or pmc1 vcx1 double mutants (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the decreased Ca2+tolerance observed upon NYV1 overexpression can be attributed mostly to the effects on Pmc1p function. The above experiments show significant effects of NYV1overexpression on Pmc1p function. To test whether Nyv1p at native levels can also affect Pmc1p function, we analyzed the phenotype ofnyv1 knockout mutants in Ca2+ tolerance assays. The nyv1 null mutant strain exhibited slightly greater Ca2+ tolerance than an isogenic wild type strain (Fig.2 C). These results were also reproducible in the s288c strain background obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (data not shown). Thus, consistent with effects of Nyv1p overexpression, endogenous levels of Nyv1p appeared to limit Pmc1p function in Ca2+ tolerance. Growth in high Ca2+ conditions had no effect on the abundance of Nyv1p or the expression of aNYV1-lacZ reporter gene (data not shown). We suggest that a relatively static level of Nyv1p can partially inhibit Pmc1p functionin vivo and that the up-regulation of Pmc1p in high Ca2+ conditions may overcome this inhibition. Because Nyv1p and Pmc1p are both components of the vacuole membrane and interact functionally, we hypothesized that they might also physically interact. To test this possibility, Nyv1p was immunoprecipitated from purified vacuoles dissolved in a nondenaturing detergent, and coprecipitating proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. A polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes Nyv1p but not Nyv1p-Vam3p complexes was found to coprecipitate Pmc1p-HA, a functional epitope-tagged derivative of Pmc1p (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). No Pmc1p-HA coprecipitated with the antibody whennyv1 mutants were employed (lane 2). Incubation of purified vacuoles in conditions that support homotypic fusion slightly increased the abundance of Nyv1p-Pmc1p complexes (Fig.3 B, lanes 4–6). No Vam3p was coprecipitated with the Nyv1p or Nyv1p-Pmc1p complexes using the anti-Nyv1p antibody. Furthermore, antibodies specific for Vam3p coprecipitated Nyv1p but not Pmc1p (lanes 1–3). These results show that Nyv1p-Pmc1p complexes form in the vacuole membrane and can be purified away from other components of the vacuole membrane such as Nyv1p-Vam3p complexes. Therefore, a novel cellular role of Nyv1p may be to inhibit the Ca2+ transport activity of Pmc1p by direct or indirect physical interaction. The decreased function of Pmc1p observed upon overexpression of Nyv1p may be due to increased Pmc1p degradation, decreased catalytic activity, or a combination of these or other effects. To distinguish the possibilities, we first examined the levels of Pmc1p in whole cell extracts of strains with or without NYV1 overexpression by Western blot analysis. In all cases, the levels of Pmc1p were similar (Fig.4). Thus, Nyv1p appeared to have little or no effect on Pmc1p expression. Therefore, we examined Ca2+ transport activity of Pmc1p in purified vacuoles isolated from vcx1 mutants carrying or lacking theNYV1 overexpression plasmid. For these experiments, the initial rates of ATP-dependent45Ca2+ accumulation were determined at a variety of free Ca2+ concentrations set with EGTA buffers, and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport was undetectable in vacuoles obtained from apmc1 vcx1 double mutant (data not shown) but was readily detectable in the vcx1 mutant expressing Pmc1p-HA (Fig.5 A). The apparentKm for Ca2+ was calculated to be ∼4.3 μm, somewhat higher than that of Pmr1p (13Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Vacuoles isolated from the same strain but overexpressing NYV1 strain also exhibited a Pmc1p- and ATP-dependent Ca2+transport activity with apparent Km similar to the control; however, the maximal transport activity was diminished to ∼43% Both vacuole preparations contained equivalent amounts of Pmc1p-HA as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5 B). A similar decrease in Pmc1p specific activity was observed in three independent experiments. The results suggest that Nyv1p decreases the Ca2+ transport activity of Pmc1p by at least 2-fold.Figure 5ATP-dependent Ca2+transport activity of Pmc1p in purified vacuoles is inhibited by overexpressed Nyv1p. A, initial rates of ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport were measured at a variety of free Ca2+ concentrations using purified vacuoles from a vcx1 PMC1-HA strain (YTY28) carrying either a pYO323 ([−]) or pNYV-HIS ([2μ-NYV1]) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The apparentVmax was calculated to be 28.8 and 12.5 pmol Ca2+/min/mg, respectively, by nonlinear regression using the Michaelis-Menten equation (solid and dashed lines). B, the samples used in A were analyzed for Pmc1p-HA abundance by Western blotting. Ten μl of the samples were loaded. A similar decrease in Pmc1p specific activity upon Nyv1p overexpression was observed in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results suggest that inhibition of Pmc1p activity is a physiological function of Nyv1p. Does Pmc1p also regulate vacuole fusion reactions? To address this question, the morphology of vacuoles in pmc1 mutants was examined after staining the vacuole membranes of live cells with the fluorescent dye FM4–64 (29Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). In the W303 strain background, the vacuole morphologies of nyv1 mutant cells and pmc1 mutant cells were indistinguishable from that of wild type cells (Fig.6). In contrast, vam3 mutants exhibited fragmented vacuoles typical of defects in homotypic and heterotypic fusion. Unlike vam3 mutants, pmc1 andnyv1 mutants efficiently targeted carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole (7Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 30Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, pmc1 andnyv1 mutants had no obvious defects in either endocytosis of FM4–64 to the vacuole, trafficking of vacuolar proteins, or vacuole fusion and inheritance. That nyv1 mutants have no phenotypes other than those involving Ca2+ homeostasis may suggest that regulation of Pmc1p function is a primary cellular function of this v-SNARE protein. This study reports the first evidence of a v-SNARE protein interacting physically and functionally with a Ca2+-ATPasein vivo. We found that Pmc1p specifically coprecipitated with Nyv1p and that the ATP-dependent Ca2+transport activity of Pmc1p in purified vacuole preparations was significantly decreased upon overexpression of Nyv1p. The phenotypes of yeast cells lacking or overexpressing Nyv1p confirm this model. Overexpression of Nyv1p decreased 45Ca2+accumulation in the nonexchangeable (vacuolar) pool and decreased Ca2+ tolerance only when Pmc1p was present. Likewise, inactivation of Nyv1p increased Ca2+ tolerance in a Pmc1p-dependent fashion. Taken together, the data support a model in which interaction with Nyv1p decreases Pmc1p activity at least 2-fold. Nyv1p appeared to affect the Vmax rather than Km for Ca2+ in this reaction, as if it inactivates a subset of Pmc1p molecules. The data do not rule out the alternative possibility that Nyv1p partially inhibits the activity of all Pmc1p molecules. That Nyv1p levels were constant in low and high Ca2+environments 4Y. Takita and K. W. Cunningham, unpublished observations. suggests that the strong up-regulation of Pmc1p expression during growth in high Ca2+ conditions may serve to overcome the inhibitory effect of Nyv1p, further promoting Ca2+ tolerance. The interaction between Pmc1p and Nyv1p raises questions about the role of Ca2+ in fusion of vacuole membranes. Nyv1p and Vam3p were shown to be required in trans for homotypic vacuole-vacuole fusion in a reconstituted system (7Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one report has suggested that trans-pairing of Nyv1p and Vam3p on docked vacuoles triggers Ca2+ release and local elevation of [Ca2+]c, which was essential for stimulating calmodulin-dependent reactions leading to bilayer fusion (6Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The vacuolar Ca2+ release channel has not yet been identified, but the roles of Pmc1p and Vcx1p in homotypic fusion have been examined. Vacuoles lacking both Pmc1p and Vcx1p were found to be fully competent for homotypic fusion and even more competent for fusion than wild type vacuoles under some conditions (10Ungermann C. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, this observation sheds little light on the role of Ca2+ in fusion because the pmc1 vcx1 mutant vacuoles would likely contain lower lumenal Ca2+ available for triggering fusion but permit higher free Ca2+ levels to be reached in the suspension buffer. Our finding that Pmc1p associates with Nyv1p but not Vam3p (Fig. 3) has several possible implications for homotypic vacuole fusion. First, Pmc1p may serve as a reservoir (or buffer) for unpaired Nyv1p, thus increasing (or decreasing) Nyv1p availability for eventual trans-SNARE pairing and fusion. This role may be analogous to that of synaptophysin in synaptic vesicles, which forms complexes with the v-SNARE protein synaptobrevin/VAMP (see below). Second, trans-SNARE pairing may dissociate active Pmc1p from complexes with Nyv1p thereby increasing Ca2+ transport activity near the sites of membrane fusion. In this view, the cytoplasm in the vicinity of fusion sites may be restored rapidly to resting concentrations of Ca2+ after fusion or possibly depleted of Ca2+just before fusion. Alternatively, the Pmc1p-Nyv1p interaction might not facilitate the fusion process to any significant degree, but instead it may simply serve to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis. To resolve all these possibilities, it will be necessary to determine the affinity and dynamics of the Pmc1p-Nyv1p interaction under a variety of conditions and to identify its effects on subreactions of the fusion pathway. Unlike vam3 mutants and all other mutants defective in homotypic fusion, nyv1 mutants fail to exhibit any significant vacuolar phenotype unrelated to Ca2+. Trafficking of proteins to the vacuole by any of three distinct routes was shown to be normal in nyv1 mutants but strongly disrupted in vam3 mutants (30Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the morphology and inheritance of vacuoles in nyv1 mutants closely resembles that of wild type cells in contrast to vam3mutants (Fig. 6) (7Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Finally, using an in vivo assay for homotypic fusion during mating we found that fusion of vacuoles innyv1/nyv1 zygotes was indistinguishable from wild type but disrupted in vam3/vam3zygotes. 4Y. Takita and K. W. Cunningham, unpublished observations. It is possible that the in vivo assay for vacuole fusion reflects a distinct form of homotypic fusion rather than that which has been reconstituted in vitro. It is also possible that other v-SNARE proteins in yeast, such as Vti1p and Ykt6p (9Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), functionally substitute for Nyv1p in vivo but somehow fail to do so in vitro. Currently there is little or no evidence from in vivostudies that Nyv1p plays important roles in either homotypic or heterotypic fusion processes. The strongest phenotypes ofnyv1 mutants and NYV1-overexpressing strains to date are those reported here involving effects on Pmc1p and Ca2+ homeostasis. Pmc1p belongs to the family of Ca2+-ATPases that includes the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) of animals (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The animal PMCAs are localized almost exclusively to the plasma membrane and carry a C-terminal auto-inhibitory extension that can be relieved upon binding of Ca2+/calmodulin (31Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The homologous proteins from fungi, plants, and protozoa apparently lack this C-terminal extension and are frequently localized to vacuoles or other intracellular organelles (32Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Geisler M. Axelsen K.B. Harper J.F. Palmgren M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 52-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). How the nonanimal PMCA-type Ca2+-ATPases are regulated in vivo remains an interesting unanswered question. Sequences homologous to Nyv1p can be found in all the species containing PMCA-type proteins, raising the possibility that the interaction identified here occurs broadly in nature. Ca2+ fluxes are well known to regulate heterotypic fusion events, such as the fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane at synapses. In this case, the N-type and P/Q-type Ca2+channels in the presynaptic plasma membrane bind the t-SNARE protein syntaxin and the s-SNARE SNAP-25, which can be bound to synaptotagmin, and the v-SNARE synaptobrevin/VAMP, located on docked synaptic vesicles (34Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A second pool of synaptobrevin/VAMP in synaptic vesicles binds to synaptophysin, a polytopic membrane protein that is thought to sequester or buffer the v-SNARE from pairing with the t-SNARE proteins (35Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between Pmc1p and Nyv1p in yeast vacuoles may resemble the interaction between synaptophysin and synaptobrevin/VAMP. Currently there is no evidence that synaptobrevin/VAMP interacts with PMCAs in neurons or any other cell type. However, a large fraction of total cellular synaptobrevin/VAMP has recently been localized to the active zones of the presynaptic membrane (36Taubenblatt P. Dedieu J.C. Gulik-Krzywicki T. Morel N. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3559-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where PMCAs also reside (37Juhaszova M. Church P. Blaustein M.P. Stanley E.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The generality of the v-SNARE interactions with Ca2+-ATPases in nature remains to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2072515460,"The major plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases fall into two gene categories, subfamilies I and II. However, in many plant tissues, expression of the two subfamilies overlaps, thus precluding individual characterization. Yeast expression of PMA2 and PMA4, representatives of the two plasma membrane H+-ATPase subfamilies in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, has previously shown that (i) the isoforms have distinct enzymatic properties and that (ii) PMA2 is regulated by phosphorylation of its penultimate residue (Thr) and binds regulatory 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in the displacement of the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain. To obtain insights into regulatory differences between the two subfamilies, we have constructed various chimeric proteins in which the 110-residue C-terminal-encoding region of PMA2 was progressively substituted by the corresponding sequence from PMA4. The PMA2 autoinhibitory domain was localized to a region between residues 851 and 915 and could not be substituted by the corresponding region of PMA4. In contrast to PMA2, PMA4 was poorly phosphorylated at its penultimate residue (Thr) and bound 14-3-3 proteins weakly. The only sequence difference around the phosphorylation site is located two residues upstream of the phosphorylated Thr. It is Ser in PMA2 (as in most members of subfamily I) and His in PMA4 (as in most members of subfamily II). Substitution of His by Ser in PMA4 resulted in an enzyme showing increased phosphorylation status, 14-13-3 binding, and ATPase activity, as well as improved yeast growth. The reverse substitution of Ser by His in PMA2 resulted in the failure of this enzyme to complement the absence of yeast H+-ATPases. These results show that the two plant H+-ATPase subfamilies differ functionally in their regulatory properties. The major plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases fall into two gene categories, subfamilies I and II. However, in many plant tissues, expression of the two subfamilies overlaps, thus precluding individual characterization. Yeast expression of PMA2 and PMA4, representatives of the two plasma membrane H+-ATPase subfamilies in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, has previously shown that (i) the isoforms have distinct enzymatic properties and that (ii) PMA2 is regulated by phosphorylation of its penultimate residue (Thr) and binds regulatory 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in the displacement of the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain. To obtain insights into regulatory differences between the two subfamilies, we have constructed various chimeric proteins in which the 110-residue C-terminal-encoding region of PMA2 was progressively substituted by the corresponding sequence from PMA4. The PMA2 autoinhibitory domain was localized to a region between residues 851 and 915 and could not be substituted by the corresponding region of PMA4. In contrast to PMA2, PMA4 was poorly phosphorylated at its penultimate residue (Thr) and bound 14-3-3 proteins weakly. The only sequence difference around the phosphorylation site is located two residues upstream of the phosphorylated Thr. It is Ser in PMA2 (as in most members of subfamily I) and His in PMA4 (as in most members of subfamily II). Substitution of His by Ser in PMA4 resulted in an enzyme showing increased phosphorylation status, 14-13-3 binding, and ATPase activity, as well as improved yeast growth. The reverse substitution of Ser by His in PMA2 resulted in the failure of this enzyme to complement the absence of yeast H+-ATPases. These results show that the two plant H+-ATPase subfamilies differ functionally in their regulatory properties. plasma membrane H+-ATPase polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PMA)1 is an electrogenic pump, which couples ATP hydrolysis to proton transport out of the cell. The resulting electrochemical gradient is then used by secondary transporters, acting as uniporters or as proton symporters and antiporters, to move ions and metabolites across the plasma membrane (for review, see Refs. 1Sussman M.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 211-234Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Palmgren M.G. Harper J.F. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 883-893Crossref Google Scholar, 3Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The 33 plant H+-ATPases cDNA clones obtained as yet have been classified into two different gene subfamilies (I and II), which diverged before the separation of monocot and dicot plants (4Moriau L. Michelet B. Bogaerts P. Lambert L. Michel A. Oufattole M. Boutry M. Plant J. 1999; 19: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,5Oufattole M. Arango M. Boutry M. Planta. 2000; 210: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the fact that members of both subfamilies are simultaneously expressed in the same organ (4Moriau L. Michelet B.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) hinders the determination of the enzymatic and regulatory properties of individual isoforms in plant material. This limitation was overcome by the heterologous expression of H+-ATPases fromArabidopsis thaliana (7Palmgren M.G. Christensen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3027-3033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (8de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PMA2 and PMA4, the two most widely expressed N. plumbaginifolia genes, each representing one of the two subfamilies, were able to replace the yeast H+-ATPase genes, while still allowing yeast growth. However, clear differences were observed between the two PMAs in terms of proton pumping, pH dependence of ATPase activity, and growth capacity of the yeast at low pH (9Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The plant H+-ATPase is regulated by an autoinhibitory domain located in its C-terminal region (10Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20470-20475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the plant, phosphorylation of the penultimate residue (a threonine) is required for the binding of regulatory 14-3-3 proteins (11Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Svennelid F. Olsson A. Piotrowski M. Rosenquist M. Ottman C. Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M.

These highly conserved proteins function as a dimer in all eukaryotic cells and serve diverse regulatory functions (for review, see Ref. 12Finnie C. Borch J. Collinge D.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, studies performed using plant material have not attempted to differentiate between the different isoforms, and yeast expression of plant H+-ATPases was therefore also used to address their regulatory features. For instance, deletions or point mutations within the inhibitory C-terminal region of H+-ATPases fromArabidopsis (13Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar, 14Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G.

Using this heterologous system, it was recently demonstrated that, as with H+-ATPases expressed in the plant, phosphorylation of the H+-ATPase penultimate residue (Thr) is necessary for 14-3-3 binding and ATPase activation (17Maudoux O.

In the case of PMA2, the phosphorylation and complex formation with 14-3-3 proteins was readily observed in yeast in the absence of fusicoccin, a fungal toxin often used to stabilize the plant H+-ATPase·14-3-3 complex (17Maudoux O.

Given the kinetic differences between PMA2 and PMA4, it was important to determine whether these representatives of the two subfamilies were regulated in the same way. Here, we show that, in contrast to PMA2, PMA4 was poorly phosphorylated and bound 14-3-3 proteins only weakly. This regulatory difference could be linked to a single residue located two positions upstream of the phosphorylated Thr. YAK2 (8de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is a yeast strain in which the H+-ATPase genes, PMA1 and PMA2, have been deleted. This strain is kept alive by yeast PMA1 under the control of the GAL1 promoter in a URA3centromeric plasmid PRS-316 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain YAKpma2Ntagged was previously described (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For His tagging of PMA4, plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma4, containing wild-type N. plumbaginifolia pma4 cDNA (9Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was modified by PCR to introduce a sequence coding for 6 histidine residues at the N terminus (between codons 2 and 3). Two primers: T4-PCR2, 5′-GCGCCTAGGCACCTCGTCTCTACCGTGTAGTGGTAGTGGTAGTGTTTCG-3′ and T4-PCR3, 5′-GACAAGTGAGGTTGCGGG-3′ were used to generate the PCR product. The fragment was digested with BamHI/PstI and then used to replace the corresponding fragment in plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma4 (9Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to give 2μp(PMA1)pma4Ntagged. We produced four chimeras in which the 110 residues at the C-terminal region of PMA2 were progressively substituted by the corresponding region from PMA4. Recombinant DNA molecules were created by sequential PCR amplifications (Table I). 2μp(PMA1)pma2Ntagged (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol.

For each chimera, both PCR products (which partly overlapped) were combined and amplified as a single fragment using primers PH2–1 and PH4–2. The new fragments were digested with BglII/XbaI, then used to replace the corresponding fragment in plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma2Ntagged (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J.

His-949 in PMA4 was replaced in plasmid 2μp(PMA1)pma4Ntagged and chimera (PMA2+13) by Ser (PMA4-H949S) and (PMA2+13-H953S). All constructs were checked by sequencing. Transformants with the different constructions were obtained as follows: YAK2 was transformed by the plasmid bearing the plant H+-ATPase gene under the control of the PMA1promoter and was plated on MGal-His, Leu, Ura, Trp. Transformants were replicated on MGlu pH 6.5 or 5.5 supplemented with 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid to counterselect the URA3 plasmid PRS-316 and obtain a yeast strain expressing only a plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Yeast cells were grown either in rich medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose and 2% (w/v) yeast extract (YGlu) or in minimal medium containing 0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and 0.115% (w/v) drop mix (19Treco D.A. Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1994: 13.1.1-13.1.7Google Scholar), supplemented with all amino acids and nucleotides required for growth. Solid media contained 2% agar. The 5-fluoroorotic acid medium was prepared as described by Treco (19Treco D.A. Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1994: 13.1.1-13.1.7Google Scholar). The pH of the medium was adjusted with KOH/HCl to pH 6.5 for PMA2, pH 5.5 for PMA4 or to another pH when indicated. For growth comparison, liquid cultures at the early exponential stage (15–30 × 106 cells/ml) were diluted in sterile water to 1 × 106 cells/ml and then spread on different plates. Plasma membranes were prepared according to Morsomme et al. (16Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Solubilization and purification of the His-tagged H+-ATPase were performed according to Maudouxet al. (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis analysis and Western blotting were performed as described in Morsommeet al. (16Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) detected by PhosphorImager® (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager®System GS-S25). ATPase assays were performed at 32 °C in a reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm MES/MOPS/Tris, 6 mm MgATP, 1 mm free Mg2+(MgCl2), 10 mm sodium azide (mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor), 20 mm KNO3 (vacuolar ATPase inhibitor), and 0.2 mm molybdate (phosphatase inhibitor) at pH 6.4. The reaction was started by adding plasma membrane proteins (14 μg) to 160 μl of reaction mixture. After 3, 6, and 9 min, 50-μl aliquots were mixed with 60 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Heterologous expression in yeast has been previously used to express N. plumbaginifolia PMA2 and PMA4 separately, making it possible to study individual enzymatic and physiological properties. His tagging of PMA2 permitted its easy purification (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To compare the solubilized isoforms, a His6 tag was added to the N-terminal region (between residues 2 and 3) of PMA4. In addition, we tagged an activated PMA4 mutant (A129P) bearing a mutation (Ala-129 replaced by Pro) that resulted in a more active enzyme and improved yeast growth at low pH (data not shown), similar to two other activated PMA4 mutants described previously (T861D and Gln882stop, Ref.9Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We chose to use A129P in this study because, contrary to the two other PMA4-activated mutants, the amino acid substitution is not localized in the regulatory C-terminal region. However, we must be aware that this does not exclude a three-dimensional proximity. No significant differences in growth rate or ATPase activity were observed between yeast strains expressing tagged or untagged PMA4, 2M. Feuermann and M. Boutry, unpublished data. showing that, as with PMA2 (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), His tagging did not interfere with enzyme performance. After purification on a Ni2+-NTA column, PMA4 was found to interact weakly with the two yeast 14-3-3 proteins (BMH1 and BMH2) compared with PMA2 (Fig. 1 A). This was not because of a loss of 14-3-3 proteins during purification because Western blotting analysis of membranes also revealed the low abundance of these regulatory proteins compared with the strain expressing PMA2 (Fig. 1 B). The difference in binding amount of 14-3-3 proteins between the two H+-ATPase isoforms was not because of a difference in the total amount of 14-3-3 proteins in the yeast cells expressing either PMA2 or PMA4 because the same amount of 14-3-3 proteins was found in a total yeast extract of both strains (data not shown). As the binding of 14-3-3 to PMA2 depends on phosphorylation of Thr-955 (17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we determined the phosphorylation status of PMA4 using anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. In contrast to PMA2, phosphothreonine in PMA4 was only weakly detectable (Fig.1 B). A129P, a PMA4-activated mutant, displayed higher 14-3-3 binding and phosphorylation status than the corresponding wild-type protein (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the mutation resulted in increasing accessibility of the C-terminal region to phosphorylation. To define putative differences between the inhibitory C-terminal region of PMA2 and PMA4, we constructed four chimeras in which the 110-residue C-terminal region of PMA2 was progressively replaced by the corresponding region of PMA4. These chimeras were defined on the basis of (i) sequence alignment of the C-terminal domains of the two isoforms and (ii) information on mutated residues in this region (Fig.2 A). We defined three zones (Fig. 2 B), the first two (residues 851–871 and 879–895) containing all but one of the identified PMA2-activating mutations in the C-terminal region (15Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the third (residues 896–915) was highly divergent between the two isoforms. The chimeras used are shown in Fig. 2 C. As shown in Fig.3, chimera (PMA2+1), in which the entire PMA2 C-terminal region was replaced with that from PMA4, showed much better growth than PMA2, suggesting that the PMA2 inhibitory domain could not be functionally replaced by the corresponding region from PMA4. A chimera retaining the first zone in which activating PMA2 mutants were found (chimera PMA2+¾) still showed stimulation of growth compared with PMA2, but to a lesser extent. Retention of both activating mutant zones (chimera PMA2+½) reduced growth to the level observed for wild-type PMA2. Finally, when only the third C-terminal region was replaced (chimera PMA2+ 13), no growth was observed when the transformant was transferred to a medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to eliminate the plasmid bearing the yeastPMA1 gene. We therefore conclude that the first half of the C-terminal region represents the major part of the autoinhibitory domain but that residues between positions 895 and 915 also contribute to some extent. We speculate that in (PMA2+13) the last third of the PMA4 C-terminal region prevented phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding and therefore did not allow release of the inhibitory effect by the more N-terminal PMA2 C-terminal region. This hypothesis was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis.Figure 3Growth of yeast strains expressing chimeric PMA2-PMA4 H+-ATPases. Yeast cells expressing N-tagged wild-type PMA2 or chimeras (PMA2+1), (PMA2+¾), and (PMA2+½) were grown on YGlu pH 6.5, replicated on solid YGlu medium at the indicated pH, and grown at 30 °C for 4 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in the PMA2/PMA4 alignment (Fig. 2 A), chimera (PMA2+ 13) contained only four residues that differ from the PMA2 sequence. Among these, the fourth residue from the C terminus (C−4, position 953) appeared of interest as it was the only one that was highly conserved within, but different between, the two plant H+-ATPase subfamilies: Ser (55%) or Ala (45%) in subfamily I (here represented by PMA2) and His (87.5%) or Asn (12.5%) in subfamily II (here represented by PMA4). We therefore mutated His-953 in chimera (PMA2+13) to Ser (PMA2+ 13-H953S). After transfer on a 5-fluoroorotic acid medium, complementation of the yeast strain, free from its own H+-ATPase gene, was restored (Fig.4 A) to a level comparable with that observed in the wild-type PMA2. To confirm the importance of Ser-953, we mutated this residue in PMA2 into His, Ala, or Asn (PMA2-S953H, PMA2-S953A, or PMA2-S953N, respectively) and found that PMA2-S953A supported yeast growth to the same extent as PMA2 (Fig.4 B), whereas PMA2-S953H (data not shown) and PMA2-S953N (Fig. 4 B) did not, showing that Ser-953 or Ala-953 is indeed a key residue for the first subfamily. Because His-953 is only 2 residues distant from the phosphorylated Thr-955, the failure of PMA2-S953H or PMA2-S953N to support yeast growth could be interpreted as an interference with phosphorylation and thus 14-3-3 binding, preventing release of the autoinhibitory effect of the more upstream region. This could not be checked directly on PMA2-S953H, because this strain was not viable after removing the yeast H+-ATPasePMA1. So we mutated Ser-953 into His in the activated mutant PMA2-E14D, previously shown to grow better than PMA2 (15Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M.

It also displayed lower phosphorylation status and 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 5 B). The variation was smaller for the latter, suggesting that 14-3-3 binding might be the limiting step. As a final proof, we prepared the reciprocal substitution (His to Ser) in PMA4 (PMA4-H949S) and found that, compared with PMA4, PMA4-H949S showed increased phosphorylation status and 14-3-3 binding, a higher ATPase activity, and better yeast growth (Fig. 6).Figure 5Effect of mutation of residue C-4in PMA2-E14D.

Their direct characterization in plant material has been hampered by their partially overlapping expression in many plant tissues (4Moriau L. Michelet B. Bogaerts P. Lambert L. Michel A. Oufattole M. Boutry M. Plant J. 1999; 19: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression in yeast is a good alternative, because it has previously allowed us to compare their kinetics (9Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and to show that PMA2 is activated in yeast, as in plants, by phosphorylation of its penultimate residue (Thr) and binds regulatory 14-3-3 proteins (17Maudoux O.

Moreover, 14-13-3 binding was observed in the absence of fusicoccin, a fungal toxin often used to artificially stabilize the H+-ATPase/14-3-3 complex. This therefore validates the yeast model. The first aim of this study was to delineate the autoinhibitory C-terminal region. Replacing the entire PMA2 C-terminal region with that from PMA4 fully activated the enzyme and resulted in a much better yeast growth. This demonstrates that the autoinhibitory C termini of PMA2 and PMA4 are not interchangeable. Progressive reduction of contribution of the PMA4 C-terminal region was correlated to a decrease of yeast growth or even lethality when only the last 41 residues of PMA2 were replaced by those from PMA4. From these data, we can conclude that the inhibitory domain covers more than 50 residues and includes the first-half of the C-terminal region in which 19 single-point PMA2 mutations, which result in activated ATPase and better yeast growth, have been localized (15Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our data show that the inhibitory domain extends to the region encompassing residues 895–915, because adding back this region of PMA2 (PMA2+13) resulted in an enzyme that no longer sustained yeast growth. Our results extend those recently obtained for the A. thaliana AHA2 isoform by Axelsenet al. (14Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), who used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify two regions, corresponding to PMA2 Lys-871 to Leu-893 and Asn-911 to Gln-926 and including positions that when mutated release enzyme inhibition. Comparison of the PMA2-PMA4 chimeric H+-ATPases showed that the region upstream of Lys-871 and that between 895 and 915 also contain inhibitory sequences. This is in agreement with the previous identification of eight activated mutants within this region (15Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect and, therefore, the region presumably interacting with the rest of the enzyme seems to be spread over a large part of the C-terminal region. The second finding of this paper concerns the regulatory phosphorylation site of the H+-ATPase family. Sequence comparison of all plant H+-ATPase cDNAs available in the database shows that they can be grouped into two subfamilies and a similar dichotomy is observed in the first half of the C-terminal region. In contrast, the last 30 C-terminal residues are highly homologous except for the fourth residue from the C terminus (PMA2–953 or PMA4–949), which is Ser or Ala in subfamily I and His or Asn in subfamily II. This amino acid is 2 residues removed from the penultimate Thr, which is phosphorylated by a kinase and therefore belongs to the 14-3-3 binding site defined at the H+-ATPase C terminus (11Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M.

Larsson C. Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2392PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the difference at this position is supported by two arguments. Firstly, the divergence between the two subfamilies is ancient, because it preceded the separation between dicot and monocot species and yet the consensus has been strictly retained within each subfamily. Secondly, we showed that these differences have functional consequences on PMA regulation and yeast growth. For instance, converting Ser-953 of PMA2 into Ala (the alternative residue for subfamily I) did not cause any change, whereas converting it into either His or Asn (subfamily II residues) prevented yeast growth. The observation that PMA2-S953H did not support yeast growth whereas PMA4 (which also displayed His at C−4) did, was expected because we showed previously that PMA4 has a higher intrinsic ATPase activity than PMA2 (9Luo H. Morsomme P. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To bypass the lethality of PMA2-S953H, mutation of Ser-953 was obtained in an activated mutant (PMA2-E14D). In this case, His at C−4 decreased phosphorylation of Thr-955 and binding of 14-3-3 proteins, and reduced yeast growth. Reciprocal results were obtained when His-949 of PMA4 was mutated to Ser. We can therefore conclude that the differences observed between the two subfamilies at residue C−4 are functionally significant. As the position C−4 is only two residues upstream from the phosphorylated Thr, the most direct interpretation of these data is to consider that the Ser/His substitution modifies the recognition site for kinase. A major difference between Ala/Ser and His/Asn is that the latter are larger and thus possibly interfere with kinase binding or catalysis. Interestingly, another case has been reported recently (22Holtman W.L. Roberts M.R. Oppedijk B.J. Testerink C. van Zeijl M.J. Wang M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in which the presence of either a Ser or Asn residue seems to be related to different 14-3-3 binding properties. The barley lypoxygenase isoform 13-lox interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, whereas the 9-lox isoform does not. Sequence analysis revealed a putative 14-3-3 binding site (RKPSDSKP) in 13-lox, which differed by a single residue in 9-lox, where the Ser two positions N-terminal to the putative phosphorylated Ser in 13-Lox was replaced by Asn. An additional fact has to be considered. PMA2-E14D and PMA4-A129P, both activated mutants, were more phosphorylated and bound more 14-3-3 proteins than their respective wild-type enzymes. As it was shown previously that the PMA2-E14D H+-ATPase had a C-terminal region more accessible to trypsin cleavage (16Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we can suggest that in the wild type, the C-terminal region is not fully accessible to the kinase. Two parameters have to be taken into account: (i) the accessibility to the C-terminal region and (ii) the phosphorylation consensus sequence. Both effects seem to be additive because E14D (more accessible C-terminal region and Ser at 953) conferred a better growth than PMA2 (Ser at 953) or E14D/S953H (more accessible C-terminal domain). Weak accessibility and poor consensus (PMA2-S953H) combined did not allow yeast growth. In most cases, 14-3-3 proteins recognize their target through a specific phosphorylated sequence. The two most widespread motifs are RSXpSXP (23Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) and RX(Y/F)XpSP (24Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). The plant H+-ATPase is an exception, because the 14-3-3 dimer interacts with the last part of the C-terminal region (11Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Maudoux O. Batoko H. Oecking C. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Boutry M. Morsomme P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17762-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Fuglsang A.T. Visconti S. Drumm K. Jahn T. Stensballe A. Mattei B. Jensen O.N. Aducci P.

Oecking C. Sommarin M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2379-2392PubMed Google Scholar), which does not contain the above sequence. Within the last 30 residues, which are highly conserved between both subfamilies, position C−4 is the only one showing a clear difference between subfamilies. We therefore propose that the formation of the H+-ATPase/14-3-3 complex, which depends on the phosphorylation of Thr at position C−2, is differentially regulated between the two subfamilies, the consensus being QQ(S/A)YpTV for subfamily I and QQ(H/N)YpTV for subfamily II. How can we apply the data obtained in the yeast system to plants? The existence of several isoforms expressed in various plant organs complicates the comparison of their individual regulatory properties. For instance, in spinach, the formation of a H+-ATPase/14-3-3 complex is increased by fusicoccin, a fungal toxin that makes 14-3-3 binding irreversible. After tryptic cleavage, two H+-ATPase C-terminal peptides were identified, one with Ala and the other with Asn at position C−4 (11Olsson A. Svennelid F. Ek B. Sommarin M. Larsson C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although H+-ATPase genes have not been cloned from spinach, we can suggest that these two peptides belong to subfamilies I and II, respectively, and that both plant H+-ATPase types can be phosphorylated and interact with 14-3-3 proteins. However, being a rather extreme approach, fusicoccin is not a physiological regulator and is therefore not a good tool for revealing possible differential regulation between H+-ATPase subfamilies. The case might be different with blue light activation, which, in guard cells from Vicia faba, led to the identification of two H+-ATPase isoforms, VHA1 and VHA2, that were phosphorylated in the C-terminal region (25Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In this case, both isoforms belong to subfamily II, suggesting that only this subfamily was responding to this environmental factor in this cell type. More generally, how could differential regulation be explained? At least two models can be proposed. In the first one, different kinases would be involved, each of which specifically recognizes members of only a single subfamily, allowing completely independent transducing systems. In the second model, a single kinase would be involved and, if behaving like in the yeast enzyme, would favor the phosphorylation of subfamily I members unless the modification of subfamily II members (e.g. previous phosphorylation by another kinase at another H+-ATPase site) renders their C terminus more accessible to the kinase. This hypothesis is realistic, because we showed that a single point mutation (A129P) of PMA4 resulted in increased phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. It is clear that any progress toward the understanding of differential regulation will require tools that allow members of a single family to be specifically studied. Genetic methods that silence the expression of a whole subfamily might be one approach. However, the silencing ofpma4 in tobacco induced pleiotropic effects and therefore might disturb the regulatory systems (26Zhao R. Dielen V. Kinet J.M. Boutry M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 535-546PubMed Google Scholar). A better approach might be to express in the plant single H+-ATPase isoforms tagged in such a way (e.g. His6) that they can be specifically followed."
