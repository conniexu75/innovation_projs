https://openalex.org/W2046579578,"We have genotyped 14,436 nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and 897 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tag SNPs from 1,000 independent cases of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and breast cancer (BC). Comparing these data against a common control dataset derived from 1,500 randomly selected healthy British individuals, we report initial association and independent replication in a North American sample of two new loci related to ankylosing spondylitis, ARTS1 and IL23R, and confirmation of the previously reported association of AITD with TSHR and FCRL3. These findings, enabled in part by increased statistical power resulting from the expansion of the control reference group to include individuals from the other disease groups, highlight notable new possibilities for autoimmune regulation and suggest that IL23R may be a common susceptibility factor for the major 'seronegative' diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2126722763,"Glycogen synthesis is normally absent in neurons. However, inclusion bodies resembling abnormal glycogen accumulate in several neurological diseases, particularly in progressive myoclonus epilepsy or Lafora disease. We show here that mouse neurons have the enzymatic machinery for synthesizing glycogen, but that it is suppressed by retention of muscle glycogen synthase (MGS) in the phosphorylated, inactive state. This suppression was further ensured by a complex of laforin and malin, which are the two proteins whose mutations cause Lafora disease. The laforin-malin complex caused proteasome-dependent degradation both of the adaptor protein targeting to glycogen, PTG, which brings protein phosphatase 1 to MGS for activation, and of MGS itself. Enforced expression of PTG led to glycogen deposition in neurons and caused apoptosis. Therefore, the malin-laforin complex ensures a blockade of neuronal glycogen synthesis even under intense glycogenic conditions. Here we explain the formation of polyglucosan inclusions in Lafora disease by demonstrating a crucial role for laforin and malin in glycogen synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2089068108,"MutL homologs are crucial for mismatch repair and genetic stability, but their function is not well understood. Human MutLalpha (MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer) harbors a latent endonuclease that is dependent on the integrity of a PMS2 DQHA(X)2E(X)4E motif (Kadyrov, F. A., Dzantiev, L., Constantin, N., and Modrich, P. (2006) Cell 126, 297-308). This sequence element is conserved in many MutL homologs, including the PMS1 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MutLalpha, but is absent in MutL proteins from bacteria like Escherichia coli that rely on d(GATC) methylation for strand directionality. We show that yeast MutLalpha is a strand-directed endonuclease that incises DNA in a reaction that depends on a mismatch, yMutSalpha, yRFC, yPCNA, ATP, and a pre-existing strand break, whereas E. coli MutL is not. Amino acid substitution within the PMS1 DQHA(X)2E(X)4E motif abolishes yMutLalpha endonuclease activity in vitro and confers strong genetic instability in vivo, but does not affect yMutLalpha ATPase activity or the ability of the protein to support assembly of the yMutLalpha.yMutSalpha.heteroduplex ternary complex. The loaded form of yPCNA may play an important effector role in directing yMutLalpha incision to the discontinuous strand of a nicked heteroduplex."

https://openalex.org/W2072526811,"Class III histone deacetylases (Sir2 or sirtuins) catalyze the NAD+-dependent conversion of acetyl-lysine residues to nicotinamide, 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr), and deacetylated lysine. Class I and II HDACs utilize a different deacetylation mechanism, utilizing an active site zinc to direct hydrolysis of acetyl-lysine residues to lysine and acetate. Here, using ten acetyl-lysine analog peptides, we have probed the substrate binding pockets of sirtuins and investigated the catalytic differences among sirtuins and class I and II deacetylases. For the sirtuin Hst2, acetyl-lysine analog peptide binding correlated with the hydrophobic substituent parameter π with a slope of -0.35 from a plot of log Kd versus π. Interestingly, propionyl- and butyryl-lysine peptides were found to bind tighter to Hst2 compared with acetyl-lysine peptide and showed measurable rates of catalysis with Hst2, Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3, suggesting propionyl- and butyryl-lysine proteins may be sirtuin substrates in vivo. Unique among the acetyl-lysine analog peptides examined, homocitrulline peptide produced ADP-ribose instead of the corresponding OAADPr analog. The electron-withdrawing nature of each acetyl analog had a profound impact on the deacylation rate between deacetylase classes. The rate of catalysis with the acetyl-lysine analog peptides varied over five orders of magnitude with the class III deacetylase Hst2, revealing a linear free energy relationship with a slope of -1.57 when plotted versus the Taft constant, σ*. HDAC8, a class I deacetylase, displayed the opposite trend with a slope of +0.79. These results are applicable toward the development of selective substrates and other mechanistic probes of protein deacetylases.

HDACs are separated into four main classes: class I (e.g. human HDAC 1-3, 8); class II (e.g. human HDAC 4-7, 9-10); class III (e.g. yeast Sir2, Hst1-4; human Sirt1-7); and class IV (HDAC11) which is homologous to both class I and II (1Gregoretti I.V. Lee Y.M. Goodson H.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The Sir2 or sirtuin family of deacetylases constitute class III HDACs, catalyzing the NAD+-dependent conversion of acetyl-lysine residues to nicotinamide, deacetylated-lysine, and 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) (2Jackson M.D. Denu J.M.

Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). HDACs are targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of human diseases. Aberrant expression of class I and II deacetylases is linked to malignancies in leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors (24Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). Class III deacetylases have been associated with pathways that oppose diseases associated with aging including obesity, type-II diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (25Haigis M.C. Guarente L.P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Class I and II inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) that target the active site zinc of class I and II HDACs, are promising antitumor compounds. Indeed, SAHA recently received FDA approval to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (26Marks P.A. Breslow R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). However, TSA and SAHA are inactive against sirtuins. Rational design of selective HDAC inhibitors would be greatly aided by further understanding of inhibitor mechanisms and the differences in chemical mechanism between deacetylase classes. Sirtuins catalyze a sequential mechanism in which the acetyl-lysine substrate binds first followed by NAD+ to form the productive Michaelis complex (27Borra M.T. Langer M.R. Slama J.T. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9877-9887Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Chemical catalysis then occurs in two main steps: 1) initial attack of acetyl-lysine cleaving the nicotinamide ribosyl bond of NAD+ to form nicotinamide and an ADP-ribose-peptidyl intermediate (α-1′-O-alkylamidate) and 2) attack of the 2′-hydroxyl at the O-alkylamidate and subsequent addition of water to form OAADPr and deacetylated peptide (28Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that the nucleophilicity of the acetyl-oxygen is directly tied to the rate of nicotinamide-ribosyl bond cleavage in the first chemical step (29Smith B.C. Denu J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5802-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we utilize a series of ten acetyl-lysine analog peptides to probe the determinants for efficient binding and catalysis within the acetyl-lysine binding site of sirtuin deacetylases. Taking advantage of the unique chemical mechanisms and acetyl-lysine substrate binding sites between different deacetylase classes, we demonstrate the potential utility of these mechanistic probes in the development of selective substrates for class I/II/IV versus class III deacetylases.

The plasmid was transformed into the DH5α Escherichia coli strain. Overexpression was performed by induction of mid-log phase cells (A600 ∼ 0.6) with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cell pellets were harvested and stored at -20 °C before cell lysis and purification.

The cell supernatant was loaded onto 1.5 ml of a 75% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose resin and rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed 3× with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and then GST-HDAC8 was eluted 2× with 1.5 ml elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 at 25 °C, 25 mm glutathione reduced-form) and then 1× with elution buffer containing 50 mm glutathione.

Nicotinamide Exchange Reactions with Homocitrulline Peptide—Exchange reactions for were performed in 80 μl containing 500 μm NAD+, 300 μm homocitrulline peptide, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm Hst2, and [14C]nicotinamide concentrations ranging from 25 μm to 1.6 mm in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by enzyme addition, incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, quenched with trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% v/v, and analyzed as previously described (29Smith B.C.

C. and Denu, J. M. (November 21, 2007) Biochemistry 10.1021/bi7013294. Reactions contained 1 mm DTT, 325 μm [14C]NAD+, 650 μm homocitrulline peptide, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 at 25 °C, and 2-6 μm Hst2. Four μl of Hst2 (in H2O) to a final volume of 160 μl were added to initiate reactions. 18O-labeling of Homocitrulline Peptide Reaction—18O-labeling experiments were done as previously described for the Hst2 H135A mutant enzyme with the following modification (37Smith B.C. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 60-μl reactions containing 1 mm DTT, 200 μm homocitrulline peptide, 200 μm NAD+, 10 μm Hst2, in natural abundance water or 85% 18OH2, and 20 mm pyridine buffer adjusted to pH 7 with formic acid were used. Characterization of Methyl-ADPr From Hst2 Catalyzed Methanolysis of NAD+ using Homocitrulline Peptide—A 1-ml reaction containing 1 mm homocitrulline peptide, 2 mm NAD+, 1mm DTT, 100 μm Hst2, 5 m methanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was reacted for 2 h at 25 °C and quenched with trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1% v/v. The 1′-O-methyl-ADPr formed was purified and analyzed by 1H NMR as previously described for the Hst2 H135A mutant enzyme (37Smith B.C. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Determination of Overall Turnover Rate with HDAC8—The reactions were performed with 300-600 μm acetyl-lysine or propionyl-lysine peptide, 300-9600 μm homocitrulline, monofluoroacetyl-lysine, difluoroacetyl-lysine, trifluoroacetyl-lysine, or α-hydroxyacetyl-lysine peptide. Reactions containing the desired analog peptide in buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5 at 37 °C, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) were initiated by addition of GST-HDAC8 (0.5 μm for difluoroacetyl and trifluoroacetyl, 1 μm for monofluoroacetyl, propionyl, and acetyl, 2 μm for homocitrulline and α-hydroxyacetyl). Reactions were quenched by addition of aqueous HCl and acetic acid to a final concentration of 250 mm and 40 mm, respectively. Time points of between 4 and 60 min were chosen such that less than 20% conversion was maintained in all reactions. The quenched time points were then separated by RP-HPLC (Grace Vydac, Deerfield, IL; C18 column, 90 Å, 10 μm, 4.6 × 200 mm) by running H2O (with 0.05% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) for 5 min followed by a gradient of 0-15% acetonitrile (with 0.02% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) over 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Under these conditions, deacetylated peptide eluted at ∼21 min and the acetyl analog peptides eluted from ∼24 to ∼30 min. Product conversion was determined through comparison of deacetylated peptide and acetyl analog peptide peak areas detected at 214 nm. Saturating peptide conditions were not obtained for the α-hydroxy, monofluoro, difluoro, and trifluoroacetyl analogs, therefore Vmax values reported for these analogs are from fits of the initial rates at varying peptide concentrations to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Fitting of Log Kd to Physiochemical Parameters—Log Kd values of the acetyl-lysine analog peptides were fit versus the inductive Taft constant σ*, the volume of the acetyl group in Å3, and the hydrophobicity parameter π. The σ* values used were from the literature (38Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1979Google Scholar). The volumes were calculated for the acetaldehyde analogs using the JME molecular editor (Molinspiration Property Calculation Service). The π-values for the acetyl group (-C(O)CH3) or corresponding analog (-C(X)Y) were either reported in the literature (38Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1979Google Scholar) or calculated from the corresponding acetyl analog substituted benzenes using Equation 2 where log PH is the log P for benzene. MarvinSketch (version 4.1.6, 2007, ChemAxon) was used for prediction and calculation of πX values in Equation 2. πX=logPX-logPH(Eq. 2) Binding Affinity of Acetyl-lysine Analog Peptides Correlates with Hydrophobicity—A series of ten acetyl-lysine analogs were incorporated into an 11-mer peptide based on the human histone H3 sequence modified at Lys-14 (NH2-KSTGGK(acetyl-analog)APRKQ-OH) (Fig. 1). These analogs vary in the nature of the nucleophile, the electron-withdrawing potential, size, charge at neutral pH, and hydrophobicity of the substituents. To probe the determinants for acetyl-lysine binding to Sir2 deacetylases, the binding constant (Kd) for each peptide was measured with the archetypal Sir2 homolog from yeast, Hst2, using isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 2). The Kd values for these peptides varied more than 75-fold, ranging from 3.3 μm to 260 μm. Utilizing linear free energy relationships between binding affinity and either the electron-withdrawing nature (σ*) (38Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1979Google Scholar), hydrophobicity (π) (38Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1979Google Scholar), or size of the acetyl analog (volume Å3), we analyzed the correlation of the log Kd values to each of these parameters. The hydrophobicity parameter π, which is a measure of the relative hydrophobicity of each substituent distinct from electronic and steric effects, yielded a strong linear correlation to log Kd with a slope of -0.33 ± 0.06 and an R2-value of 0.77 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the log Kd values did not correlate well with the electron-withdrawing nature or the size of the substituents (Fig. 3, B and C), as revealed by the slopes of -0.16 ± 0.15 and -0.026 ± 0.015 and R2-values of 0.18 and 0.24 for these fits, respectively. In the fit of log Kd values versus volume, removal of butyryl-lysine peptide, a possible outlier, provided a marginally better fit with a slope of -0.055 ± 0.022 and an R2-value of 0.44.FIGURE 2Representative isothermal titration calorimetry run with butyryl-lysine peptide. Successive injections of butyryl-lysine peptide (8 μl of a 400 μm solution) were made into the cell containing 20 μm Hst2 and heats of binding were measured after each injection. The area under each injection spike (top) was integrated and fit using non-linear least-squares regression analysis (bottom) with Origin 7.0 software supplied by MicroCal (Amherst, MA) to determine Kd values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Plot of log Kd values versus the (A) hydrophobic substituent parameter π (38Hansch C.

For modeling, the 1.5-Å resolution structure of acetyl-lysine peptide and ADP-ribose bound to Hst2 (39Zhao K. Harshaw R. Chai X. Marmorstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8563-8568Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) was used replacing the bound acetyl-lysine with the appropriate acetyl-lysine analog using Sybyl (ver. 7.3). This modeling gave a clear rationalization for the observed binding results. In particular, the hydrophobic trifluoromethyl group of trifluoroacetyl-lysine peptide filled empty space not occupied by acetyl-lysine in the hydrophobic p"

In this study, we show that overexpression of CTGF occurred in a significant proportion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) samples that were of a high tumor grade and metastatic. Forced expression of CTGF in Eca109 ESCC cells accelerated their growth in culture and significantly increased tumor formation in nude mice, whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CTGF in ESCC cells significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation, as well as tumorigenicity in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of CTGF in ESCC cells resulted in the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, leading to activation of β-catenin-T-cell factor (TCF)/Lef signaling. Up-regulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1, two target genes of β-catenin-TCF/Lef signaling, was also observed in the CTGF-overexpressing cells. These effects of CTGF in ESCC cells were abolished by transfection with either dominant negative β-catenin or dominant negative TCF4. Furthermore, we identified a β-catenin-TCF/Lef-binding site (TBE) in the promoter region of CTGF and found that CTGF is a transcriptional target of β-catenin-TCF/Lef signaling. Taken together, these results revealed that the interaction of CTGF and β-catenin-TCF/Lef forms a positive feedback loop, which could contribute to the tumorigenicity of ESCC.

The development of this malignancy rises from the stepwise accumulations of multiple genetic alterations, which lead to the activation of oncogenes and/or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The differential expression of these critical genes and their downstream effectors enables cells to override growth controls and eventually undergo carcinogenesis. Mutations of p53 (4Kihara C.

In this study, we found that CTGF was overexpressed in ESCC, and its expression was associated with the clinical features of these patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the oncogenic activity of CTGF was mediated through the activation of β-catenin-TCF/Lef signaling pathway, and CTGF itself was a direct transcriptional target of this pathway. We propose that the cross-talk between CTGF and β-catenin-TCF/Lef signaling forms a positive feedback loop that may contribute to the tumorigenicity of ESCC. Cell Culture—ESCC cell line Eca109 was obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin-G, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), 10 units/ml penicillin-G, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Plasmid Construction and Transfection—To generate the CTGF expression vector, the open reading frame of human CTGF cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and was fused to a COOH-terminal Myc tag. The CTGF expression vector and empty pcDNA3.1 were transfected into Eca109 cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were selected in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418, and resistant clones were further confirmed by Western blotting. For cloning of the CTGF promoter, the -1024/+1 promoter region of CTGF was cloned into pGL3 basic plasmid using BglII and MluI. Point mutations in the putative TCF-binding site (TBE) and TBE deletion constructs were generated using primers. RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from ESCC cell lines and tissues of esophageal patients after their informed consent according to the institutional regulatory requirements using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA samples were separated in 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and their quality was then determined by visibility of 18 S and 28 S RNA bands under UV light. 2 μg of total RNA with high quality was processed directly to cDNA with the reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI), following the manufacturer's instructions, in a total volume of 25 μl. The primer pair used for amplification of the human CTGF gene was as follows: forward primer, 5′-CGACTGGAAGACACGTTTGG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AGGCTTGGAGATTTTGGGAG-3′. As an internal standard, a fragment of human β-actin was amplified by PCR using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC-3′. Amplification reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume of the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I mixture from Roche Applied Science as follows: with 10 pmol of primer, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP mixture, 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and universal buffer. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate in an iCycler iQ System (Bio-Rad), and the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 10 min. To confirm specificity of amplification, the PCR products from each primer pair were subjected to a melting curve analysis and electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were plated into 35-mm dishes and cultured to 80% confluence. The cells were then scraped and lysed in RIPA buffer, and cellular lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g (4 °C for 10 min). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total cellular protein were mixed with loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% fat-free dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibodies in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing with TBST, the membranes were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in appropriate dilution and then washed five times with the same buffer. The immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by ECL kit (Pierce). Antibodies to CTGF, c-Myc, c-Jun, β-catenin, and cyclin D1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibody to β-actin was purchased from Sigma. Establishment of Eca109/CTGF Pooled Transfects—The CTGF-pcDNA3.1 and empty pcDNA3.1 plasmids were transfected into Eca109 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The transfected cells were selected in the presence of G418 (600 μg/ml), and after 2 weeks of selection, cells that are resistant to G418 were pooled together for further analysis. Crystal Violet Assay—For cell proliferation assays, equal numbers of CTGF overexpressing cells, CTGF siRNA-containing cells, and their corresponding control cells were seeded in 48-well plates and cultured in media supplemented with 1% FBS for 7 days; media were changed every other day. Cellular growth was stopped after 7 days in culture by removing the media and adding 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. After staining for 5 min the fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 1% SDS. The absorbance at 600 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. For colony formation assay, at 24 h after transfection with each expression and GFP plasmids, Eca109 cells were trypsinized, washed, and counted, and equal numbers of transfected cells were seeded in 24-well plates. The remaining cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter to determine the percentage of GFP-expressing cells, which represent the transfection efficiency. After 24 h of incubation, plated cells were selected with 600 μg/ml of G418 and allowed to form colonies. After 2 weeks, the colonies were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and photographed. MTT Assay—For cell growth analysis, equal numbers of cells were seeded in 48-well plates and cultured for various durations. Cell numbers were measured by MTT assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Treatment with r-hCTGF—ESCC cells were seeded into 48-well plates at 1500 cells/well. r-hCTGF was purchased from Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc. (San Francisco). Eca109 cells were treated with 0.5 or 1 μg/ml of r-hCTGF, respectively, or 1.5 μg/ml CTGF-specific antibody during culture in medium plus 0.5% serum. The treatments were renewed every 48 h. Cells were harvested and counted after 6 days of culture. Lithium Treatment on Eca109 Cells—ESCC cells were plated into 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well and cultured for 12 h. The cells were then serum-starved overnight followed by incubation with 50 mm lithium for different times before being lysed by TRIzol reagent. RNA was extracted and transcript to cDNA. CTGF mRNA level was measured using a pair of specific primer by real time PCR. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—Eca109/CTGF pooled transfects and control Eca109/pcDNA3.1 cells were grown to 70% confluence. Cells was treated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling reagent (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h before they were processed for immunostaining. Cells were stained with anti-BrdUrd primary antibody (mouse IgG) followed by rhodamine red-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Slides for immunostaining were counterstained with the nucleophilic dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were analyzed by microscopy, and the means ± S.E. of cells with BrdUrd incorporation were calculated. Nuclear Protein Extraction—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the mini-extraction method as described previously (40Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested by being scraped in 1.5 ml of PBS followed by pelleting and resuspending in 400 ml of 10 mm HEPES/potassium hydroxide, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer. The resuspended cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min after vortexing for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei. After separation of the cytoplasmic fraction, nuclei were harvested by resuspension in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES/potassium hydroxide, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Tubes were incubated for 1 h on ice and then centrifuged to clear the cellular debris. Nuclear extracts were immediately used for Western blot. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were plated at a subconfluent density and co-transfected with 0.05 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of expression vectors, and 0.05 μg of Renilla luciferase pRL-TK as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, and the reporter activity was measured using the Dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated three times to ensure reproducibility. RNAi-mediated Knockdown of CTGF—In our experiments, FG12 lentiviral vector, which has an independent open reading frame of green fluorescence protein (GFP), was used to produce small, double-stranded RNA (siRNA) to inhibit target gene expression in ESCC cells, and the information on this vector system has been described in detail by Qin et al. (32Qin X.F. An D.S. Chen I.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). To construct the hairpin siRNA expression cassette, complementary DNA oligonucleotides for siRNA of CTGF (CTGF siRNA) or mutated sequence of CTGF siRNA as control (CTGF siRNA con) were synthesized, annealed, and inserted into FG12. Two CTGF siRNA constructs were used as follows: CTGF siRNA vector 1 (highlighted sequence was the complementary sequence with CTGF mRNA), 5′-ACCGCTGACCTGGAAGAGAACATTCAAGAGATGTTCTCTTCCAGGTCAGTTTTTGGATCCC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGGGATCCAAAAAGCTGACCTGGAAGAGAACATCTCTTGAATGTTCTCTTCCAGGTCAG-3′; and CTGF siRNA vector 2 (highlighted sequence was the complementary sequence with CTGF mRNA), 5′-ACCGATGTACGGAGACATGGCATTCAAGAGATGCCATGTCTCCGTACATTTTTTGGATCCC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGGGATCCAAAAAGATGTACGGAGACATGGCATCTCTTGAATGCCATGTCTCCGTACAT-3′; CTGF siRNA con vector (highlighted sequence was the random sequence as control that was not related to CTGF mRNA), 5′-ACCGGTACATAGGGACGTAACGTTCAAGAGACGTTACGTCCCTATGTACCTTTTTGGATCCC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGGGATCCAAAAAGGTACATAGGGACGTAACGTCTCTTGAACGTTACGTCCCTATGTAC-3′. FG12 vector with CTGF siRNA or CTGF siRNA con was transfected into 293T, and the virus with CTGF siRNA or CTGF siRNA con was harvested from culture medium. The harvested virus was purified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g (4 °C, 150 min), and appropriate amounts of virus were used to infect ESCC cells. After 3 days of infection, the GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences), which all stably expressed CTGF siRNA or CTGF siRNA con. ChIP Assay—Approximately 6 × 106 cells were used for each chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Cross-linking was stopped by adding 1.0 m glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and scraped into ice-cold PBS containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing proteinase inhibitors. The lysate was subjected to sonication to shear chromatin to 200-1,000-bp fragments. One-third of the lysate was incubated with 5 m NaCl at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking, phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and kept at -80 °C as an input control for PCR analysis. The remaining two-thirds of the lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-β-catenin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse IgG (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected by using protein G-Sepharose beads. Precipitants were sequentially washed with lysis buffer twice, followed by washing once with wash buffer. After the final wash, 300 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) was added, and beads were rotated at room temperature for 15 min. NaCl (5 m) was added to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in double-distilled water for PCR analysis. A set of primers specific for the human CTGF promoter was used for PCR amplification (35 cycles). Primer set was 5′-TTGCTCTGATAGAACAATGGA-3′ and 5′-TCAAGATGCCTACCTGTAAAAC-3′; the expected products (∼250 bp) were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels. Tumorigenicity Assay—Ten 8-week-old nude mice were separated into two groups. For the first group, 1 × 106 CTGF-overexpressing cells and their control cells were subcutaneously injected on opposite flanks of the same mouse. For the second group, 1 × 106 CTGF knockdown cells and their control cells were injected similarly in a cohort of mice. For each group, five nude mice were used for the study. The resulting tumors were measured once a week, and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the standard formula: length × width × height × 0.5326. Tumors were harvested 4 weeks after injection and individually weighed. Data were presented as tumor volume (mean ± S.D.) and tumor weight (mean ± S.D.). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. CTGF Is Overexpressed in ESCC and Correlated with Clinical Features of ESCC Patients—To study the expression pattern of the CTGF gene in esophageal cancers, levels of CTGF mRNA were quantified by RT-PCR in 36 pairs of tumors and their matched normal esophageal tissues (Fig. 1A). Expression levels were shown as a ratio between CTGF and the reference gene β-actin to correct for the variation in the amounts of RNA. To determine whether β-actin is suitable for the calibrator of normalization, a second housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was also used as a reference calibrator for CTGF in 36 paired normal and esophageal cancer samples. The levels of expression of the CTGF gene were comparable with those when β-actin was used as the reference gene (data not shown). Up-regulation of CTGF gene occurred in 27 of 36 (75%) esophageal cancers compared with the paired normal esophagus tissues. Univariate analysis showed that mRNA levels of CTGF was significantly different between paired normal and cancer samples (p = 0.001). In addition, elevated levels of CTGF protein were found in human ESCC tissues compared with the paired normal tissue from the patients as shown by immunochemical staining (Fig. 1B) and Western analysis (Fig. 1C). Statistical analysis revealed that a significant association existed between expression of CTGF mRNA in esophageal tumors versus the gender, tumor grade, metastasis, and age of the patient (Table 1). For gender, expression of CTGF was significantly higher in males than in females (p = 0.001). Levels of CTGF expression were increased significantly in higher stage tumors compared with lower stage tumors (p = 0.003). For metastasis, expression of CTGF was significantly higher in metastatic than in nonmetastatic esophageal cancers (p = 0.011). However, tumor position, family history, and alcohol consumption showed no significant correlations with the level of expression of CTGF.TABLE 1Relationship between levels of expression of CTGF in esophageal cancer and clinical and pathological features of statistical significance of the individuals was determined with a Student's t testClinical characteristicsCTGF negative (n = 9)CTGF positive (n = 27)ϰ2 testGenderFemale74p = 0.000ap < 0.01.Male223Tumor positionHigh26p = 0.294Medium611Low110Tumor gradeI63p = 0.003ap < 0.01.II29III115MetastasisNo78p = 0.011bp < 0.05.Yes219Family historyNo713p = 0.121Yes214DrinkNo421p = 0.060Yes56Age35-54p = 0.017bp < 0.05.50-11665-37a p < 0.01.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Forced Expression of CTGF in Eca109 ESCC Cell Line Stimulated Their Growth and Colony Formation—To examine the effects of CTGF on the growth of esophageal cancer cells, Eca109 cells were stably transfected with either a pcDNA/CTGF containing full-length CTGF or an empty vector pcDNA3.1 as a control. Five G418-resistant clones were screened for CTGF expression by Western blot analysis. Two pcDNA/CTGF stable transfected clones with high expression of CTGF (Eca109/CTGF1 and -3) are shown in Fig. 2A, which were used for further study. The effect of CTGF on cell growth was evaluated by crystal violet and MTT assays. The rate of growth of Eca109/CTGF was 1.5-2.5-fold greater than the Eca109/V control cells in both crystal violet and MTT assays (Fig. 2, B and C). Moreover, clonogenic assay showed that Eca109/CTGF cells formed more colonies than did the wild-type control cells (Fig. 2F). To avoid a nonspecific toxicity by forced expression of CTGF, we assessed the effect of r-hCTGF on the growth of ESCC cell line Eca109. Treatment with r-hCTGF for 6 days promoted cell growth in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group. However, the CTGF-neutralizing antibody significantly attenuated the enhanced cell growth caused by r-hCTGF (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, Western analysis showed that cell cycle-related protein cyclin D1 was up-regulated in the two stable clones compared with Eca109/V control cells (Fig. 2E). To rule out the possibility of clonal variations in this study, Eca109/CTGF pooled transfects were constructed. Consistently, the expression of cyclin D1 was also up-regulated compared with the parent Eca109 cells and Eca109/pcDNA3.1 pool transfects, which mirrored the observations in Eca109/CTGF stable cell clones (Fig. 2G). At the same time, we used BrdUrd incorporation assay to investigate the role of CTGF in cell proliferation. We found that Eca109/CTGF pooled transfects showed more BrdUrd incorporation than control cells (Fig. 2H). These results indicated that the forced expression of CTGF in ESCC cells enhanced their cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2050896765,"We recently described a new route for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from exogenous lyso-PtdEtn, which we have termed the exogenous lysolipid metabolism (ELM) pathway. The ELM pathway for lyso-PtdEtn requires the action of plasma membrane P-type ATPases Dnf1p and Dnf2p and their requisite β-subunit, Lem3p, for the active uptake of lyso-PtdEtn. In addition, the acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase, Ale1p, mediates the acylation of the imported lysolipid to form PtdEtn. We now report that these components of the lyso-PtdEtn ELM pathway are also active with lyso-1-acyl-2-hydroxyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PtdCho) as a substrate. Lyso-PtdCho supports the growth of a choline auxotrophic pem1Δ pem2Δ strain. Uptake of radiolabeled lyso-PtdCho was impaired by the dnf2Δ and lem3Δ mutations. Introduction of a lem3Δ mutation into a pem1Δ pem2Δ background impaired the ability of the resulting strain to grow with lyso-PtdCho as the sole precursor of PtdCho. After import of lyso-PtdCho, the recently characterized lyso-PtdEtn acyltransferase, Ale1p, functioned as the sole lyso-PtdCho acyltransferase in yeast. A pem1Δ pem2Δ ale1Δ strain grew with lyso-PtdCho as a substrate but showed a profound reduction in PtdCho content when lyso-PtdCho was the only precursor of PtdCho. Ale1p acylates lyso-PtdCho with a preference for monounsaturated acyl-CoA species, and the specific LPCAT activity of Ale1p in yeast membranes is >50-fold higher than the basal rate of de novo aminoglycerophospholipid biosynthesis from phosphatidylserine synthase activity. In addition to lyso-PtdCho, lyso-PtdEtn, and lyso-phosphatidic acid, Ale1p was also active with lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, and lysophosphatidylinositol as substrates. These results establish a new pathway for the net synthesis of PtdCho in yeast and provide new tools for the study of PtdCho synthesis, transport, and remodeling.

Chem. 2007; 282: 28344-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), involves two processes that are essential to eukaryotic cell biology but which remain poorly characterized at the molecular level; that is, phospholipid translocation across membranes and the acylation of lysophospholipids. The ELM pathway enables yeast to use lyso-PtdEtn as the sole source of PtdEtn and PtdCho required for cell growth. In this system lyso-PtdEtn is imported by the action of the plasma-membrane aminophospholipid translocases Dnf1p and Dnf2p, which require Lem3p as an accessory factor for their proper function. Once imported, lyso-PtdEtn is converted to PtdEtn by an acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase. The resulting PtdEtn rescues ethanolamine (Etn) auxotrophic psd1Δ psd2Δ strains much more efficiently than free Etn, and lyso-PtdEtn restores the mitochondrial pool of PtdEtn in a psd1Δ strain that cannot be replenished by PtdEtn derived from Psd2p or the Kennedy pathway.The acyltransferase responsible for the acylation of lyso-PtdEtn in yeast is encoded by the YOR175C locus and was named Ale1p (acyltransferase for lyso-PtdEtn). Ale1p has a very high specific activity relative to other anabolic processes of lipid metabolism in yeast such that the rate of PtdEtn synthesis from exogenous lyso-PtdEtn exceeds that required for membrane biogenesis. The enzymatic activity is highly enriched in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) and persists in purified mitochondria, indicating that it is part of a subdomain of MAM that is tightly associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Ale1p also acts as the major lyso-PtdOH acyltransferase (LPAAT) in yeast and shows a synthetic genetic interaction with Slc1p, which was the only LPAAT previously known in yeast (3Athenstaedt K.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we designed experiments to test other lysophospholipids as ELM pathway substrates. We now report that lyso-PtdCho is a substrate for the ELM pathway, with genetic and biochemical requirements similar but not identical to the lyso-PtdEtn ELM pathway. We also directly demonstrate that lyso-PtdCho is a substrate for the Ale1p acyltransferase and that the acyl-CoA specificity is similar to that of lyso-PtdEtn as a substrate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals, solvents, and amino acids were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Yeast extract, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were from Difco. Silica-60 thin layer chromatography plates were from EM Sciences. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), except acyl-CoA substrates, which were from Sigma. Lyso-PtdCho was purchased as a 20 mg/ml chloroform solution, and this solvent was removed under vacuum followed by repeated addition and evaporation of methanol to eliminate traces of chloroform. The dried lyso-PtdCho was dissolved in either 10% v/v Tergitol Nonidet P-40 or ethanol at a concentration of 25 mm and stored at –20 °C until use.Synthesis of Radiolabeled Lyso-PtdCho—To synthesize lyso-Ptd[methyl-14C]Cho, we developed a method based on the procedure of Sohlenkamp et al. (8Sohlenkamp C. de Rudder K.E. Rohrs V. Lopez-Lara I.M. Geiger O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18919-18925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We used the plasmid pTB2559 in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (kindly provided by Dr. Otto Geiger, Center for Genomic Sciences, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Cuernavaca, Mexico), which expresses the Sinorhizobium meliloti PtdCho synthase (pcs) gene under the control of a T7 promoter to produce SmPcs in E. coli cells. Cultures were pre-grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5) at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin followed by reduction of the temperature to 28 °C and addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was incubated overnight and harvested by centrifugation and washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cells were suspended in the same buffer, frozen at –80 °C, and thawed followed by probe sonication to effect lysis. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h. The Pcs-containing membranes were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15% (v/v) glycerol at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml and frozen in aliquots at –80 °C until use. Synthesis of Ptd[methyl-14C]Cho was carried out in a 400-μl reaction consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.25 mm CDP-diacylglycerol, 0.182 mm Cho (10 μCi total, 55 Ci/mol). 1 μl (5 μg of protein) of the SmPcs-containing membrane preparation was then added, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. This was followed by the addition of another 1 μl of enzyme and an additional 0.25 mm equivalent of CDP-diacylglycerol in 0.2% Triton X-100 and a further 30-min incubation. Under these conditions, ∼40–50% of the labeled Cho was converted to PtdCho in a typical synthesis. The reaction was stopped by lipid extraction, and the resulting Ptd-[methyl-14C]Cho was treated with bee venom phospholipase A2 as described previously for lyso-PtdEtn synthesis (1Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to synthesize lyso-Ptd[methyl-14C]Cho.Yeast Culture and Genetic Manipulations—Yeast strains used in this study and their associated genotypes are provided in Table 1. Strains with deletions of specific open reading frames were constructed by standard methods involving one-step gene replacement (9Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). Gene replacements were carried out by transformation of PCR fragments containing an appropriate marker gene (as indicated in Table 1) flanked by at least 40 base pairs of DNA identical to the 5′ and 3′ regions outside the start and stop codons of the open reading frame of interest. The eviction of target genes from the resultant drug-resistant colonies was confirmed by PCR amplification of the 5′ and 3′ recombination junctions using appropriate combinations of marker-gene- and target-gene-specific primers. Strains were routinely maintained on standard YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1.5% Bacto agar). For media containing lyso-PtdCho, 1% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40 was included, and lyso-PtdCho was added to the desired concentration from a sterile 25 mm stock solution in 10% (v/v) Tergitol Nonidet P-40 or ethanol. In some experiments a defined medium was used consisting of yeast nitrogen base (Difco) at 6.7 g/liter, complete amino acid mix, and 2% (w/v) glucose to give synthetic complete (SC) medium. In the lyso-PtdCho uptake and metabolism experiments, 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 was included, and this medium is denoted SCGT. For determination of growth requirements, 5-fold serial dilutions of yeast cultures were spotted onto plates as described previously (1Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Acyltransferase activity was determined in 200-μl reactions containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxyl-3-sn-glycerophospho-[methyl-14C]Cho (5 × 104 cpm), 0–100 μm acyl-CoA, and 5–20 μg of microsomal protein. Assays were conducted for 5–20 min at 30 °C depending on the specific activity of the preparation toward the given substrate. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) followed by vigorous vortexing and centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube to separate the phases. Radioactive PtdCho was identified by thin-layer chromatography on silica-60 TLC plates in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/water (65/25/4, v/v/v) and quantified on a PhosphorImager. For kinetic experiments, calculation of the Km and Vmax for the acyl-CoA substrates was carried out by direct fitting of a hyperbola to the kinetic data with the program “Hyper.”Lyso-PtdIns, lyso-PtdGro, and lyso-PtdSer acyltransferase assays were conducted using the same buffer compositions as for the lyso-PtdEtn acyltransferase assays (2Riekhof W.R. Wu J. Jones J.L. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28344-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lyso-PtdIns acyltransferase and lyso-PtdGro acyltransferase assays were conducted with 100 μm unlabeled lysophospholipid and 100,000 cpm of 1-[14C]-oleoyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) diluted to 50 μm final concentration with unlabeled compound. Lyso-PtdSer acyltransferase activity was determined using 50,000 cpm of lyso-Ptd[U-14C]Ser diluted to 100 μm with unlabeled compound (Avanti), and 50 μm oleoyl-CoA served as acyl donor. Lyso-Ptd[U-14C]Ser, lyso-PtdGro, and lyso-PtdIns were synthesized by digestion of the corresponding diacyl compounds with bee venom phospholipase A2 (Sigma) as previously described for the synthesis of lyso-PtdEtn (1Riekhof W.R.

Cultures were grown for 16 h to early stationary phase, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Lipid extraction and quantification of lipid classes was as previously described (1Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Acyl-CoA Substrate Choice Assay—Acyltransferase activity was assayed with a mixture of fatty acyl-CoAs by an adaptation of a previously described method (11Zarini S. Gijon M.A. Folco G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10134-10142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Yeast microsomes (24 μg, isolated as described above) were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl of assay buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 12.5 μm bovine serum albumin, 50 μm 1-[2H31]palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (≥97 atom %2H; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and 30 μm each caproyl-CoA, myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, and arachidonoyl-CoA (Sigma-Aldrich). After 30 min at 37 °C, lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar), dried under N2, and resuspended in 60 μl of high performance liquid chromatography solvent A (1 mm ammonium acetate in 60/20/20, CH3OH/CH3CN/H2O), and an aliquot (30 μl) was injected into the LC/MS/MS system. A gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B (1 mm ammonium acetate in CH3OH) was utilized to elute a C18 column (Columbus 150 × 2 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Solvent B was increased from 0 to 100% in 42 min and kept at 100% for 23 min.Identification of the different species formed was carried out using a Sciex API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring of the following specific transitions: m/z 681→184 for [2H31]16:0a/10:0a-GPCho, m/z 737→184 for [2H31]16:0a/14:0a-GPCho, m/z 765→184 for [2H31]16:0a/16:0a-GPCho, m/z 763→184 for [2H31]16:0a/16: 1a-GPCho, m/z 793→184 for [2H31]16:0a/18:0a-GPCho, m/z 791→184 for [2H31]16:0a/18:1a-GPCho, m/z 789→184 for [2H31]16:0a/18:2a-GPCho; m/z 813→184 for [2H31]16:0a/20: 4a-GPCho. The synthesis of the different phosphatidylcholines is expressed as the integrated area of the corresponding intensity peaks on LC/MS/MS.Labeling of Cells with Radioactive Lyso-PtdCho—We carried out lyso-PtdCho supplementation studies with strains BY4742 (wild type) and isogenic ale1Δ, nte1Δ, and ale1Δ nte1Δ mutant strains. These strains were initially grown overnight in 5 ml of YPD medium, and a 2-ml aliquot of culture was diluted into 50 ml of fresh YPD medium. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.5, the cultures were centrifuged, and the cells were washed twice with SCGT media and suspended in 10 ml of SCGT (final A600 = 2.5). 2 ml of this cell preparation was incubated with 100,000 cpm of lyso-Ptd[methyl-14C]Cho (diluted with unlabeled compound to 250 μm) for 3 h. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with cold 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and once in water. Cells were suspended in 400 μl of H2O, and a 200-μl aliquot was taken for liquid scintillation spectrometry before lipid extraction to determine the total amount of radioactivity taken up by the cells.Another 200-μl aliquot of the cells was subjected to lipid extraction by a modified Bligh-Dyer protocol involving the addition of 300 μl of EtOH and incubation in a sealed tube in a boiling water bath for 45 min. This was followed by the addition of 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and 1.6 ml of water. The tubes were vigorously mixed and centrifuged to separate the phases, and the upper aqueous phase was removed to a separate tube and lyophilized. This material was dissolved in 0.2 ml of water, and the radioactivity of an aliquot of the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The remainder of this aqueous fraction was resolved by TLC on Silica 60 plates (EM Sciences) in the solvent 0.5% (w/v) aqueous NaCl, ethanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (10:10:1, v/v/v). Excess unlabeled Cho, P-Cho, CDP-Cho, and Gro-P-Cho were added as carrier to facilitate the identification of radiolabeled compounds, and the bands were identified by spraying the TLC plate with Dragendorff's reagent (13Benning C. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which gives a color reaction with quaternary amines such as Cho. The radioactive products in the organic phase were resolved by Silica-60 TLC in the system chloroform, methanol, isopropanol, 0.25% (w/v) aqueous KCl, triethylamine (30:9:25:6:18, v/v/v/v/v) and quantified on a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare).RESULTSDnf2p and Lem3p Are Required for Lyso-PtdCho Uptake by Yeast—Our previous results obtained by examining the uptake of lyso-PtdEtn and its dependence on the plasma-membrane aminophospholipid translocase components Dnf1p, Dnf2p, and Lem3p (1Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) led us to test the genetic requirements for lyso-PtdCho uptake. The lem3Δ, dnf1Δ, dnf2Δ, and dnf1Δ dnf2Δ strains were previously constructed in the Etn auxotrophic PTY44 (psd1Δ psd2Δ) genetic background. The Etn auxotrophy is irrelevant for these experiments, and Etn was supplied in the medium used for lyso-PtdCho uptake. Yeast rapidly took up lyso-PtdCho at a rate (25 nmol/h/AU of cells) similar to that described previously for lyso-PtdEtn (1Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As detailed in Fig. 1, the ability to import lyso-Ptd[methyl-14C]Cho was significantly diminished in the dnf2Δ and lem3Δ mutants. The largest decrement in transport occurred upon deletion of the LEM3 gene, which reduced the rate of lyso-PtdCho uptake to ∼5% that of the wild type. The dnf2Δ mutation also caused a large decrease in lyso-PtdCho uptake, and this strain had an uptake rate of ∼35% that of the wild type. The dnf1Δ mutation produced a minimal defect in lyso-PtdCho uptake in either the wild-type or dnf2Δ genetic backgrounds. These results identify a major role for Dnf2p and Lem3p in regulating lyso-PtdCho transport and indicate that Dnf1p contributes to no more than 10% of the lyso-PtdCho transport activity.Lyso-PtdCho Supports the Growth of Choline Auxotrophs in a Lem3p-dependent Manner—The observed rate for lyso-Ptd-Cho transport reported above is sufficient to support all of the cellular requirements for PtdCho synthesis. The physiological relevance of this rate of lyso-PtdCho transport was tested using pem1Δ pem2Δ mutant strains that require either Cho or lyso-PtdCho for growth. The data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that 0.5 mm lyso-Ptd-Cho supports cell growth as well as 3 mm Cho in the pem1Δ pem2Δ strain. The effects of a lem3Δ mutation, which blocks lyso-PtdCho uptake, are also included in Fig. 2 and demonstrate that the lysophospholipid must be transported into the cell to restore the growth of pem1Δ pem2Δ strains. An additional conclusion obtained with the pem1Δ pem2Δ lem3Δ strain is that no significant extracellular degradation of lyso-PtdCho occurs to produce Cho, which could be imported and used by the cell for PtdCho synthesis.FIGURE 2Growth of a pem1Δ pem2Δ strain is supported by lyso-PtdCho in a Lem3p-dependent manner. The wild-type strain BY4742 (WT) and isogenic derivatives bearing pem1Δ pem2Δ and pem1Δ pem2Δ lem3Δ mutations were spotted onto agar plates as a 5-fold dilution series to assess growth phenotypes. The media used were YPD (rich medium) and synthetic complete medium (SC, minimal medium) containing no additive (SC), 3 mm Cho (SC+Cho), or 0.5 mm lyso-PtdCho (SC+lyso-PtdCho). After spotting, plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C and photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Experiments were also conducted to assess the transport and metabolism of lyso-PtdSer and lyso-PtdIns. The results of these experiments 4W. R. Riekhof, J. Wu, and D. R. Voelker, unpublished observations. were negative, and it appears that these compounds are not taken up and utilized in the same way as lyso-PtdEtn and lyso-PtdCho. Specifically, we were unable to demonstrate a time- or temperature-dependent uptake of lyso-PtdSer. This finding was corroborated by the inability of lyso-PtdSer or short-chain PtdSer species to support the growth of a cho1Δ strain (lacking PtdSer synthase) on minimal medium. Nearly identical experiments were conducted with lyso-PtdIns. This compound failed to support the growth of an ino1Δ strain (deficient in de novo inositol synthesis) or a strain bearing a pis1ts conditional allele of the PIS1 gene encoding PtdIns synthase.Ale1p Is a Lyso-PtdCho Acyltransferase—We next investigated the metabolism of the lyso-PtdCho that is taken up by the Dnf2p/Lem3p-dependent mechanism. Previous work on the yeast Ale1p demonstrated that the enzyme exhibited both lyso-PtdEtn acyltransferase and lyso-PtdOH acyltransferase activities (2Riekhof W.R. Wu J. Jones J.L. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28344-28352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We examined whether Ale1p was involved in lyso-Ptd-Cho metabolism by measuring LPCAT activity in an ale1Δ mutant. The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 3A, and demonstrated that the ale1Δ mutant membranes were devoid of LPCAT activity. This finding revealed that Ale1p acts promiscuously, providing the major acyltransferase activity to reacylate both lyso-PtdEtn and lyso-PtdCho. We next used yeast microsomes as a source of native, Ale1p-derived LPCAT activity in further experiments. Fig. 3B shows the results of enzyme kinetic experiments aimed at determining the acyl-CoA substrate specificity of Ale1p when lyso-PtdCho is the acyl-acceptor. Similar to the results we obtained with lyso-PtdEtn as the acyl-acceptor substrate, the Ale1p LPCAT activity showed a much higher Vmax with the unsaturated acyl-CoA substrates. Contrary to the lyso-PtdEtn acyltransferase kinetic assays, in which the Km values for the unsaturated substrates were ∼5–10-fold higher than the saturated substrates, the Km values for all acyl-substrates in the LPCAT assays, either saturated or unsaturated, were similar. This results in a strongly enhanced specificity constant (Vmax/Km) for the unsaturated substrates.FIGURE 3Ale1p is a lyso-PtdCho acyltransferase. A, the specific lyso-Ptd-Cho acyltransferase activity was measured using cell homogenates of the wild-type strain BY4742 and its isogenic ale1Δ derivative. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments conducted in triplicate. B, enzyme kinetic experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” by conducting the LPCAT assay using a fixed concentration (100 μm) of lyso-PtdCho and varying the concentrations of the individual acyl-CoA species. The data presented are a representative dataset from three independent experiments. FA, fatty acid. C, a “substrate choice” experiment was performed by conducting the LPCAT assay using 1-[2H31]palmitoyl-lyso-PtdCho (50 μm) as the acyl-acceptor for an equimolar mixture (30 μm each) of the acyl-CoA species indicated below the abscissa. Reactions were conducted for 30 min followed by lipid extraction to stop the reaction. The products were separated and quantified using an LC/MS/MS system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The most abundant species was arbitrarily defined as 100%, and other species were expressed as a percentage of the maximum.

To facilitate identification of host cell factors that are required for HCV replication, we screened a panel of small interference RNAs that preferentially target human protein kinases using an HCV replicon expressing the firefly luciferase gene as a genetic reporter. Small interference RNAs specific for three human kinases, Csk, Jak1, and Vrk1, were identified that reproducibly reduce viral RNA and viral protein levels in HCV replicon-bearing cells. Treatment of replicon cells with a small molecule inhibitor of Csk also resulted in a significant reduction in HCV RNA and proteins, further supporting a role for Csk in HCV replication. The effects of siRNAs targeting eight kinases known to be negatively regulated by Csk were then examined; knock down of one of these kinases, Fyn, resulted in up-regulation of the HCV replicon, suggesting that Csk mediates its effect on HCV replication through Fyn. This conclusion was further corroborated by demonstration that replicon cells treated with Csk inhibitor contained lower levels of the phosphorylated form of Fyn than control cells.

Alter M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In ∼70% of the cases, HCV escapes the immune system and establishes a chronic infection. In the long term, these chronic carriers are at risk of developing life-threatening liver disease, including hepato-cellular carcinoma (1Wasley A. Alter M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family. Its genome consists of RNA of positive polarity ∼9.6 kb in length that contains a large open reading frame. Translated polyprotein is processed by cellular and viral proteases into at least 10 individual structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. NS proteins are sufficient to support viral RNA replication and include the metalloprotease NS2, serine protease/helicase NS3, NS3 protease cofactor NS4A, RNA-dependent polymerase NS5B, and two other proteins with poorly characterized function, NS4B and NS5A. According to the current model, virus replication occurs within a complex that comprises viral RNA and NS proteins and is associated with the host endoplasmic reticulum (2Lundin M. Monne M. Widell A. Von Heijne G. Persson M.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5428-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. J.

However, this regimen is effective only in half of patients, often poorly tolerated, and unsuitable for certain patient populations (4Fried M.W. Shiffman M.L. Reddy K.R. Smith C. Marinos G. Goncales Jr., F.L. Haussinger D. Diago M. Carosi G. Dhumeaux D. Craxi A. Lin A. Hoffman J. Yu J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (5899) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an intense effort to develop new, better treatments, mostly by targeting viral enzymes (5Lin K. Perni R.B. Kwong A.D. Lin C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A complementary approach is to inhibit nonessential host cell proteins that are required for the viral life cycle. Several such host cell factors have been identified to date and represent potential candidates for this strategy. For example, inhibition of geranylgeranylation by lovastatin, a small molecule inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase 1, blocks HCV RNA replication and assembly of viral replication complex by preventing the geranylgeranylation of FBL2, a host cell factor interacting with NS5A (6Ye J.

Another host protein, cyclophilin B, was found to stimulate binding of NS5B to RNA; its inhibition by various cyclosporin derivatives prevents propagation of HCV replicons in cells (7Ishii N. Watashi K. Hishiki T. Goto K. Inoue D. Hijikata M. Wakita T. Kato N. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4510-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). And lastly, the inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α by 2-chloro-5-nitro-N-(pyridyl)benzamide results in down-regulation of HCV replication (8Rakic B. Sagan S.M. Noestheden M.

Virol. 2004; 78: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), likely through effects on lipid metabolism. The sequencing of the human genome and availability of highly specific methods for gene inactivation now allow a systematic examination of the roles of individual human genes in HCV replication and the identification of new potential drug targets. To this end, we have individually knocked down expression of 510 human genes, including 380 Tyr and Ser/Thr kinases, and examined the effect on HCV replicon propagation. Three kinases, Csk, Jak1, and Vrk1, were identified that when targeted with siRNAs caused a substantial reduction in cellular viral RNA and protein expression. The role of Csk in the HCV replicon propagation was confirmed with a small molecule inhibitor of Csk. Furthermore, we show that Csk exerts its effect on HCV replication through Fyn, the downstream effector of Csk and a member of the Src family of kinases. Cell Culture—Huh7 human hepatoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products). Cell lines harboring replicons were maintained in the same medium, which was further supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and were passaged twice per week. Oligonucleotides—All oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys, and their sequences and modifications were as follows: NeoLuc1, 5′-CGATACGTAGG-3′; Neoluc2, 5′-CGCGCCTACGTATCG-3′; HCVFor, 5′-GTCTGCGGAACCGGTGAGTA-3′; HCVRev, 5′-GCCCAAATCTCCAGGCATT-3′; HCVDet, 6FAM-5′-ACGACCGGGTCCTTTCTTGGATCAA-3′-TAMRA. Restriction Endonucleases—All restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. Plasmids—Plasmid pLS1 was created by inserting a SnaBI restriction site adapter oligonucleotide (obtained by annealing Neoluc1 and Neoluc2) between the NruI and AscI sites of pFK-I389luc/NS3-3′/5.1 (10Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). This step removed ∼120 bp from the 3′-end of the HCV IRES located just before the firefly luciferase open reading frame. Plasmid pLS2 was derived from pLS1 by inserting the BstUI-SmaI fragment from pIRES plasmid (Clontech), which harbors encephalomyocarditis (EMCV) IRES, into the SnaBI site of pLS1. To construct pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1, a NruI-SpeI fragment from pLS2 was used to replace the PmeI-SpeI fragment of pFK-I389neo/NS3-3′/5.1. The resulting plasmid (pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1) harbors three cistrons, neor, firefly luciferase, and the HCV NS open reading frame, which are translated from HCV IRES, EMCV IRES, and EMCV IRES, respectively. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Generating Stable Cell Lines Harboring Replicons—pFK-I389neo/NS3-3′/5.1 and pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1 plasmid DNAs were linearized with ScaI restriction endonuclease, extracted first with a phenol:chloroform mixture (1:1) and then with chloroform, and finally precipitated with ethanol. The resulting DNAs were used for the production of the synthetic replicon RNA with a T7-Megascript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA template was removed by digestion with 0.2 units/μl DNase I, and the in vitro transcribed RNA was purified with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of purified RNA were mixed with 400 μl of Huh7 cell suspension in Cytomix containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione. Electroporation conditions were 960 μF and 270 V with a Gene Pulser system and a cuvette width of 0.4 cm (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were diluted with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and seeded at a density ∼105 cells/cm2. The medium was replaced 24 h later with a fresh one containing 500 μg/ml of G418. Colonies harboring stably replicating HCV replicon appeared ∼3 weeks post-transfection. siRNAs—Predesigned siRNAs (3/gene) targeting Blk, c-Src, Fyn, Hck, Fgr, Lck, Lyn, and Yes kinases were purchased from Ambion. Library and custom-designed siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon as single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides. siRNA Library Preparation and High-throughput Transfection—The sequences of the library siRNAs have been described previously (11Aza-Blanc P. Cooper C.L. Wagner K. Batalov S. Deveraux Q.L. Cooke M.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were annealed in 96-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. The whole collection was normalized to a final concentration of 100 ng/μl in 100 mm KOAc, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, and 2 mm MgOAc (pH 7.4). One microliter of each siRNA stock was transferred to 96-well plates, and the plates were stored at –80 °C until use. For transfection experiments, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was diluted 50-fold with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and 25 μl of this mixture were added per well to 96-well plates containing the aliquoted siRNA library. The suspension of Huh7 cells harboring the tri-cistronic replicon (100 μl, 4000 cells) was then added to the plates using a Titertech 96/384 microplate liquid dispenser. After 48 h of cultivation, cell viability and activity of firefly luciferase in each well were determined. Treatment with Small Molecule Inhibitor—To examine the inhibition of HCV replication by the small molecule inhibitor, Huh7 cells harboring the HCV replicon were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 500 μg/ml of G418. After reaching ∼70% confluency, the inhibitor was added at the indicated concentrations in Me2SO (1% final Me2SO concentration). Control cells were treated in an identical manner except Me2SO was added in place of the inhibitor solution. After 72 h of cultivation, cells were analyzed for NS5A, γ-tubulin, firefly luciferase expression levels, viability, and phosphorylation of Fyn kinase. Determination of Cell Viability, Luciferase Activity, and Data Analysis—Cell viability was determined by incubating cells in 96-well plates with 10% Alamar Blue solution (Trek Diagnostic Systems) for 4 h, after which fluorescence was measured. To quantify firefly luciferase activity, the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured with an Analyst AD reader (Molecular Devices); data analysis was performed as described previously (9Gao L. Aizaki H. He J.W. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—To determine protein expression levels, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Aliquots of extracts were subjected to either 7.5 or 10% SDS/PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies against NS5A, Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or γ-tubulin (Sigma/Aldrich/Fluka) and then with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and Kodak Biomax films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Determination of Relative Cellular Levels of Replicon RNA by Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Replicon cells grown in 96-well plate were washed once with 0.2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Sequential cell lysis, cellular RNase inactivation, cellular DNA degradation, and total cellular cDNA synthesis were performed using the Cells-to-cDNA II kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction for the multiplex real-time quantitative PCR was set up in a total volume of 20 μl and included 80 nm HCVFor, 120 nm HCVRev, and 100 nm HCVDet primers, as well as 10 μl of AmpliTaq Gold PCR Master Mix and 1 μl of Human RPLP0 (large ribosomal protein) Endogenous Control (VIC/MGB Probe, Primer Limited); both reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using 7900HT Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mixture was first incubated for 2 min at 50 °C and then for 10 min at 95 °C and finally cycled 40 times between 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Ct values for the replicon and large ribosomal protein cDNAs were calculated for each sample using the instrument software. To calculate the relative cellular abundance of the HCV replicon, 2–ΔΔCt method was used (N-fold difference = 2–t(ΔC-t treated – ΔC control), where ΔCt is the difference between the replicon and large ribosomal protein cDNA Ct values). Detection of the Cellular Phosphorylated Form of Fyn—Huh7 cells harboring the bi-cistronic replicon were cultured in 6-well plates as described above. When the cells were 80% confluent, compound (dissolved in Me2SO at 1 mm concentration) was added to cells at 5 μm final concentration. Cells were then incubated in the presence of the compound or Me2SO for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, incubated for 4 h in the same medium containing 400 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (MP Biomedicals), and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (both from Sigma/Aldrich/Fluka). 20 μl of cell lysates were mixed with the Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The remaining lysates were precleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose bead slurry (50%; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of monoclonal anti-Fyn antibody (Upstate) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 100 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (50% slurry, prewashed with radioimmune precipitation buffer), and subsequent incubation overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and radioimmune precipitation buffer, resuspended in the Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel and then dried. 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by a PhosphoImager scanner (GE Healthcare). Determination of Inhibitor Specificity and IC50—JK239 specificity was assessed based on its inhibition profile in biochemical enzymatic assays against the panel of purified human kinase enzymes at 1 μm inhibitor concentration (performed at Invitrogen). The IC50 of JK239 for Csk kinase was determined with HTScan™ Csk Kinase Assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations and 2% Me2SO. Construction and Validation of a Selectable Tri-cistronic Subgenomic HCV Replicon Expressing the Firefly Luciferase Reporter—Several HCV replicon variants have been described previously that allow measurement of cellular replicon RNA levels through the activity of a reporter enzyme and, at the same time, also harbor an antibiotic resistance gene that enables the selection of transfected cells with stably replicating HCV replicon RNA (12Vrolijk J.M. Kaul A. Hansen B.E. Lohmann V. Haagmans B.L. Schalm S.W. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. Methods. 2003; 110: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Yi M. Bodola F. Lemon S.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In parallel with these reports, we developed another HCV replicon, pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1, which harbors the firefly luciferase gene and the Geneticin resistance gene neor. This new tri-cistronic construct was derived from the previously reported genotype 1b (con1) bi-cistronic replicon pFK-I389neo/NS3-3′/5.1 (Fig. 1A). pFK-I389neo/NS3-3′/5.1 includes the 5′-nontranslated end of the HCV genome together with the first five amino acids of core (C) protein that are fused to the neor gene (10Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). The second part of the replicon harbors the NS3-NS5B segment of the HCV polyprotein followed by the complete non-translated 3′-end of the HCV genome. The expression of NS3 through NS5B proteins, which are essential for the replication phase of the HCV life cycle, is driven by the heterologous EMCV IRES. In addition to these genetic elements, this tri-cistronic replicon (pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1) harbors the third open reading frame encoding firefly luciferase translated from the second EMCV IRES (Fig. 1B). This modification allows a simple evaluation of the cellular levels of replicon RNA through the measurement of firefly luciferase activity and is fully compatible with high-throughput screening technologies. When tested for sensitivity to interferon-γ treatment, the cell lines harboring the above two replicon variants responded in a very similar manner, a decrease in the HCV RNA cellular contents by 78 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 1C). Changes in tri-cistronic RNA levels were also accurately reflected by the decrease in the activity of firefly luciferase (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the replication of both replicon variants was equally affected by treatment with interferon-α (as measured by quantitative RT-PCR), and in the case of pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1, this effect could be assayed through the activity of the reporter enzyme (data not shown). Thus, pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1 is suitable for a rapid and accurate evaluation of changes in cellular replicon levels. A Kinase siRNA Library Screen for Genes Involved in HCV Replicon Propagation—To identify cellular protein kinases involved in HCV replicon propagation, we employed an siRNA library described previously that predominantly targets human protein kinases (380 of 510 library members target protein kinases) (11Aza-Blanc P. Cooper C.L. Wagner K. Batalov S. Deveraux Q.L. Cooke M.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Expression of approximately two-thirds of the targeted RNAs is reduced at least 70% in HeLa cells. Two parallel transfection experiments, each executed in duplicate, were performed with this library in Huh7 cells harboring the tricistronic replicon pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1. Control siRNAs against firefly luciferase (siGL2 and siGL3) (15Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar) and HCV NS3 genes were included in each library plate. The effects of individual siRNAs on cell viability and replicon levels (measured by firefly luciferase activity) were determined. The use of a transfection protocol compatible with high-throughput screening resulted in a lower (∼40%) transfection efficiency than observed (∼70%) under optimal transfection conditions. Because of the low transfection efficiency observed during the screen, we initially selected all of the hits from the primary screen that caused at least 25% replicon down-regulation and did not significantly affect cell viability. These siRNAs were then tested using optimal transfection conditions. The activity of only three siRNAs was re-confirmed (Fig. 2A), Csk (carboxyl-terminal Src kinase), Jak1 (Janus kinase 1), and Vrk1 (Vaccinia-related kinase 1). Csk, Jak1, and Vrk1 Play an Important Role in HCV Replicon Propagation—To strengthen the association between the knock down of these three protein kinases and the down-regulation of HCV replicon cellular levels, transfections were repeated with another set of siRNAs against these three kinases (see Table 1 for siRNA sequences). Transfection with any of six siRNAs resulted in roughly a 60% decrease of the targeted mRNA as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. For all three kinases transfection with either set of siRNAs resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity (∼40% Csk, ∼50% Vrk1, and ∼50% Jak1 on average, Fig. 2A). At the same time, an Alamar Blue assay showed no effect of any tested siRNA on cell proliferation, excluding the possibility of decreased reporter activity due to siRNA cytotoxicity (Fig. 2B). We also eliminated the possibility that these siRNAs affect the luciferase reporter rather than HCV replication. The cell line harboring the original pFK-I389neo/luc/NS3-3′/5.1 replicon was transfected with the control, CSK, JAK1, and VRK1 siRNAs, and their effects on the bi-cistronic replicon were determined by measuring cellular levels of the HCV NS5A protein. As was the case with the tri-cistronic replicon, each transfected siRNA resulted in a decrease in the level of NS5A protein present in the cells (Fig. 2C) that was comparable with that observed with the tri-cistronic replicon-encoded luciferase. In summary, the above data suggest that the three host kinases, Csk, Jak1, and Vrk1, are involved in HCV replicon propagation.TABLE 1siRNA kinase sequencesGeneSequenceNS3-1GGGCCCAAUCACCCAAAUGNS3-1CCCAAAUGUACACCAAUGUCSK-1CUACCGCAUCAUGUACCAUCSK-2CTGCGGCATAGCAACCTGGJAK1-1TGCTCAGGGACAGTATGATJAK1-2GCTCTGGTATGCTCCAAATVRK1-1GGCAAAUUGGACCUCAGUGVRK1-2CCAGGUGAAAUUGCCAAAUFYN-1GGACUCACCGUCUUUGGAGFYN-2GGUGUGAACUCUUCGUCUCGL2CGUACGGGAAUACUUCGAGL3CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA Open table in a new tab A Small Molecule Inhibitor of Csk Blocks Phosphorylation of Fyn and Inhibits Replicon Propagation—Because even under optimal transfection conditions we could observe only ∼50–60% replicon inhibition after transfection with various siRNAs (likely a consequence of low transfection efficiency), we sought to strengthen the above conclusions by examining the effects of small molecule inhibitors of these kinases on replicon-containing cells. One such inhibitor, JK239 (Fig. 3A) was identified for Csk based on data derived from previous profiles of kinase inhibitors in biochemical assays against a panel of various human protein kinases (data not shown). Of 90 kinases tested, JK239 inhibited only two, Csk and MAPK11, by >50% at 1 μm inhibitor concentration. The IC50 of this inhibitor in biochemical assay of Csk activity was found to be 0.43 μm. To assess the effect of JK239 on the viability of bi- or tri-cistronic repliconcontaining cells, these cell lines were grown in the presence of 10 μm JK239 for up to 3 days. This treatment did not result in any observable cytotoxicity (Fig. 3B). To confirm that JK239 treatment leads to a decrease in HCV replicon copy number, the amount of NS5A protein in Huh7 cells harboring bi-cistronic replicon was determined after compound treatment. In agreement with the previous experiment, addition of JK239 (10 μm) resulted in elimination of >80% NS5A protein from cells (Fig. 3C). Additionally, the compound did not inhibit the expression of firefly luciferase translated from EMCV IRES and transcribed from the cytomegalovirus promoter in the control experiment. Further characterization of this inhibitor revealed that it inhibited replicon propagation in tri-cistronic replicon cells (measured through luciferase activity) with an EC50 = 0.63 μm (Fig. 3D). These data, together with the results of siRNA experiments, strongly indicate that inhibition of Csk results in inhibition of HCV replication in the cell-based, HCV replicon model of HCV infection. Csk Facilitates HCV Replicon Propagation through Fyn—Csk negatively regulates Src family kinases by tyrosine phosphorylation. The Src family includes at least eight genes in humans, five genes with expression restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin (Blk, Hck, Fgr, Lck, and Lyn) and three genes expressed ubiquitously (Fyn, c-Src, and Yes) (16Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for inhibition of HCV replication by the reduction in Csk protein expression could be an increased activity of one or more members of the Src family kinase. To explore this possibility, we tested the effects of knock downs of these eight kinases on the tri-cistronic HCV replicon. Although siRNAs targeting seven of these eight kinases did not show any effect, the siRNA targeting Fyn elevated replicon levels (measured by luciferase reporter) ∼3-fold upon transfection. This observation was also confirmed with a second siRNA independently targeting Fyn, which also increased the cellular replicon level ∼3-fold upon transfection (Fig. 4). The up-regulation of replicon after Fyn depletion suggests that Fyn plays an important role in HCV replicon propagation under standard culture conditions. Because Csk is the direct negative regulator of Fyn, it is likely that the inhibition of the HCV replicon propagation observed upon siRNA-dependent Csk knock down, or inhibition of Csk activity by JK239, results from increased Fyn activity (JK239 does not inhibit Fyn activity in biochemical assays). To further demonstrate that Csk mediates its effects on HCV replication through Fyn, we examined the effect of JK239 on the phosphorylation status of Fyn by first radioactively labeling the cells with [32P]phosphate and then immunoprecipitating and quantifying the amount of phosphorylated Fyn in the labeled cells. As expected, 24 h of treatment of cells with 5 μm inhibitor significantly reduced the amount of the phosphorylated form of Fyn present in cells (residual phosphorylated form = 20%, Fig. 5C) without affecting the amount of total Fyn (Fig. 5B). At the same time, treatment of cells with JK239 did not result in any significant global change in protein phosphorylation shown by the comparison of the phosphoprotein profiles of treated versus control cells (Fig. 5A). These results reinforce the notion that Csk affects HCV replication by modulating the phosphorylation status and activity of Fyn.FIGURE 5Inhibition of Fyn phosphorylation by Csk inhibitor JK239.A, comparison of Huh7 replicon cell phosphoprotein profiles after treatment with Me2SO or JK239 for 24 h and subsequent labeling with [32P]orthophosphate.

Using aggregation of a model polyglutamine-containing protein as an indicator in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that protein damage occurs specifically at the site of the host-pathogen interaction, the intestine, in response to various bacterial pathogens. We demonstrate that the insulin signaling pathway and the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1) influence the amount of aggregation that occurs, in addition to heat shock proteins and oxidative stress enzymes. We also show that addition of the antioxidants epigallocatechin gallate and α-lipoic acid reduces polyglutamine aggregation. The influence of oxidative stress enzymes and exogenous antioxidants on protein aggregation suggests that reactive oxygen species produced by the host are a source of protein damage during infection. We propose a model in which heat shock proteins and oxidative stress enzymes regulated by insulin signaling and HSF-1 are required for tissue protection during infection, to minimize the effects of protein damage occurring as a result of host-pathogen interactions.

Innate immunity is comprised of strategies that allow an organism to immediately defend itself against an invading pathogen. In addition to mechanisms that actively destroy the infecting agent, the organism must protect itself from damage. Damage to the host can occur from virulence mechanisms of the pathogen, but also as a side effect of the immune response of the host. One pathway that we have shown contributes greatly to pathogen resistance in the model host Caenorhabditis elegans is insulin signaling (1Garsin D.A. Villanueva J.M. Begun J. Kim D.H. Sifri C.D. Calderwood S.B. Ruvkun G. Ausubel F.M. Science. 2003; 300: 1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition to increased pathogen resistance, loss of insulin signaling in C. elegans results in several cytoprotective phenotypes such as stress resistance (oxidative stress, heat stress) and long lifespan. The insulin signaling pathway consists of a receptor, DAF-2, that when stimulated activates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling cascade that culminates in the phosphorylation and down-regulation of the transcription factor DAF-16. A mutation in DAF-2, or any of the other upstream signaling components prevents inhibition of DAF-16, causing greater transcriptional activity (reviewed in Refs. 2Finch C.E. Ruvkun G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 4Nelson D.W.

It was previously shown that pathogen resistance mediated by increased DAF-16 activity is dependent, at least in part, on the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1. 2The abbreviations used are:HSF-1heat shock transcription factorROSreactive oxygen speciesEGCGepigallocatechin gallateLAα-lipoic acidHSPsheat shock proteinsYFPyellow fluorescent proteinRNAiRNA interferingDAFabnormal DAuer Formation The loss of hsf-1 in a daf-2 mutant, or a mutant that overexpresses daf-16, causes a reduction in pathogen resistance and the overexpression of hsf-1 increases pathogen resistance (6Singh V. Aballay A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13092-13097Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). HSF-1 likely mediates these effects by controlling the expression of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are protein chaperones that bind to unfolded or damaged proteins and prevent aggregation until they can be refolded or recycled (7Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 8Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 9Sakahira H. Breuer P.

HSPs regulated by HSF-1 were demonstrated to be protective against bacterial pathogens (6Singh V. Aballay A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13092-13097Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and we showed that ROS, a possible source of cellular damage, is generated by the pathogen-exposed worm (12Chavez V. Mohri-Shiomi A. Maadani A. Vega L.A. Garsin D.A. Genetics. 2007; 176: 1567-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we postulate that protein quality control is perturbed at the site of infection. heat shock transcription factor reactive oxygen species epigallocatechin gallate α-lipoic acid heat shock proteins yellow fluorescent protein RNA interfering abnormal DAuer Formation Protein homeostasis has been studied in the worm by fusing aggregation-prone polyglutamine proteins to fluorescent proteins such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), which has the significant advantage of allowing one to measure aggregation under various conditions in live animals using a simple visual assay (13Brignull H.R. Morley J.F. Garcia S.M. Morimoto R.I. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412: 256-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Brignull H.R. Morley J.F. Morimoto R.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 594: 167-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The amount of aggregation has been documented to correlate with the global balance of protein quality, and is highly sensitive to perturbations in protein synthesis, trafficking, folding, or degradation (15Gidalevitz T. Ben-Zvi A. Ho K.H. Brignull H.R. Morimoto R.I. Science. 2006; 311: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 16Nollen E.A. Garcia S.M. van Haaften G. Kim S. Chavez A. Morimoto R.I. Plasterk R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In one study, Huntington-like polyglutamine (poly(Q)40) repeat protein fused to YFP was expressed in the body wall muscle cells of C. elegans. The amount of poly(Q)40::YFP aggregation increased as the worms aged indicating a loss of protein quality control (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, the amount of aggregation at a given age was found to be modulated by the insulin signaling pathway and HSF-1 (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Additionally, reducing the expression of certain small HSPs (but not oxidative stress enzymes) increased aggregation (18Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). From this work it was concluded that insulin signaling and HSF-1 can delay aging, at least in part, by increasing small HSP expression (18Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Herein we introduce a system to study protein homeostasis in the context of infection. Because we demonstrate that the protective effects of HSF-1 arise from its expression specifically in the intestine, the site of infection, we developed transgenic worms that express poly(Q)::YFP at this location. By assaying polyglutamine aggregation in the intestine we show that protein quality control is perturbed during the disease process. Aggregation occurs in the intestine, but not the muscle cells, suggesting that protein homeostasis problems are only occurring at the site of infection and not throughout the worm. We show that insulin signaling and HSF-1, as well as HSPs and oxidative stress enzymes, modulate the amount of polyglutamine aggregation. Additionally, the presence of exogenous antioxidants decreases aggregation, suggesting that ROS is a significant source of protein damage during infection. We propose that a mechanism of insulin signaling and protection against bacterial pathogens by HSF-1 is through expression of genes that encode factors to prevent and ameliorate protein damage. We conclude that maintaining protein homeostasis during infection is a crucial component of the innate immune response.

DNA Cloning—hsf-1 expression constructs were generated by subcloning the full-length hsf-1 wild-type cDNA into pPD30.38 (unc-54 promoter) (gift from A. Fire, Stanford University) (24Kelly W.G. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Genetics. 1997; 146: 227-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vectors containing the F25B3.3 promoter (gift from D. Pilgrim, University of Alberta) (25Altun-Gultekin Z. Andachi Y. Tsalik E.L. Pilgrim D. Kohara Y. Hobert O. Development. 2001; 128: 1951-1969PubMed Google Scholar), or the vha-6 promoter (gift from R. Morimoto, Northwestern University) (26Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YFP-tagged polyglutamine (poly(Q)) constructs were generated by subcloning the various lengths of poly(Q)-encoding sequences into vectors containing the vha-6 promoter. YFP-tagged poly(Q) constructs cloned into pPD30.38 (Q0, Q33, Q40, Q44, Q64, and Q82) were obtained from R. Morimoto (Northwestern University) (27Satyal S.H. Schmidt E. Kitagawa K. Sondheimer N.

Successful construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Generation of Transgenic Lines—For generation of transgenic animals, hsf-1 or poly(Q) expressing plasmids were mixed at 2 or 10 ng/μl, respectively, together with the pRF4 rol-6(su1006) plasmid at 80 ng/μl and pBlueScript II for a total DNA concentration of 130 ng/μl (28Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mixtures were microinjected into the gonads of adult N2 or hsf-1(sy441) hermaphrodites, respectively, using standard methods (29Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). Transgenic F1 progeny were selected on the basis of roller phenotype. Individual transgenic F2 animals were picked to establish independent lines. At least two independent lines for each transgene were examined. C. elegans Killing Assays—Killing assays were performed as previously described (30Garsin D.A. Sifri C.D. Mylonakis E. Qin X. Singh K.V. Murray B.E. Calderwood S.B. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). 60 worms were used in each experiment. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 3.0. Survival was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method and the curves compared using the log-rank test, which generates a p value testing the null hypothesis that the survival curves are identical. p values of 0.05 or less were considered significantly different from the null hypothesis. Fluorescence Microscopy—Animals were viewed with an Olympus BX60 upright epifluorescence microscope for epifluorescence, and the number of poly(Q) aggregates was counted. Aggregates were defined as discrete structures with boundaries distinguishable from surrounding fluorescence on all sides. All photographs represent what was typically seen upon examination and were taken at the same exposure and the levels manipulated identically in Adobe Photoshop CS. 20 worms were viewed for each condition, averaged, and the standard error calculated using GraphPad Prism 3.0. The significance of differences between conditions was determined by an unpaired t test. p values of 0.05 or less were considered significantly different from the null hypothesis. RNAi—RNAi exposure was performed with some modification as previously described (6Singh V. Aballay A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13092-13097Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Except for the hsf-1 and hsp-6 RNAi worms, adults were allowed to lay eggs on RNAi-expressing bacteria for 24 h. The eggs were allowed to develop into L4 larvae on RNAi or vector control plates at 20 °C. hsf-1 and hsp-6 RNAi was performed as follows. L2–L3 larvae on NGM plates were collected by washing with M9 buffer, and then they were exposed to hsf-1 or hsp-6 expressing bacteria for 24 h. L4 larvae were transferred to assay plates with pathogenic or non-pathogenic bacteria. Less than 5% of the L4 worms had aggregates (data not shown). Except for the daf-2, daf-21, and sod-3 RNAi constructs, all our RNAi constructs were obtained from Geneservice Ltd. (Cambridge, UK) (31Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 32Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N. Moreno S. Sohrmann M. Welchman D.P. Zipperlen P. Ahringer J. Nature. 2003; 421: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The daf-2 RNAi construct was the same as used in Chavez et al. (12Chavez V. Mohri-Shiomi A. Maadani A. Vega L.A. Garsin D.A. Genetics. 2007; 176: 1567-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the daf-21 and sod-3 RNAi constructs were generated as described below. The identity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing. Generation of the Vectors for daf-21 and sod-3 RNAi—The daf-21 RNAi construct was created by PCR amplification from total genomic DNA by using gene-specific oligonucleotides, digestion with XbaI/NcoI, and ligation into appropriately digested plasmid L4440 (gift from A. Fire, Stanford University) (33Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences used for amplification of trigger sequences were: daf-21 forward, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGTCCGAGAACGCCGAAAC-3′ and daf-21 reverse, 5′-CATGCCATGGTTAGTCGACCTCCTCCATGC-3′ resulting in a 2280-bp product. sod-3 RNAi construct was created by digesting sod-3 cDNA from a cDNA clone yk264g10 (gift from Y. Kohara, National Institute of Genetics) with EcoRI/XhoI, and ligation into appropriately digested plasmid L4440. Antioxidant Experiments—Experiments were performed as previously described with some modifications (34Brown M.K. Evans J.L. Luo Y. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2006; 85: 620-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol compound, and α-lipoic acid (LA) were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of EGCG or LA were made in 100% ethanol and used at a final concentration of 25 μm. The chemicals were added directly to the NGM or BHI plates. The final concentration for ethanol was less than 0.1% when dissolved in the plates. Adults were allowed to lay eggs on NGM plates with no chemical, EGCG or LA. The eggs were allowed to develop into L4 larvae on the plates at 20 °C. L4 larvae were exposed to E. coli or E. faecalis at 25 °C on NGM plates or BHI plates with no chemical, EGCG or LA, respectively. After a 2-day exposure, the percentage of worms with aggregates was counted. hsf-1 Is Required in the Intestine, but Not Muscles or Nerves, for Protection against Infection—An earlier study showed that HSF-1 is crucial to mediating resistance in the worm; loss of the gene encoding HSF-1 by mutation or RNAi caused increased susceptibility, whereas overexpression of the gene caused increased resistance (6Singh V. Aballay A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13092-13097Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It was shown in our previous work that E. faecalis causes a persistent infection in the intestine of the worm (30Garsin D.A. Sifri C.D. Mylonakis E. Qin X. Singh K.V. Murray B.E. Calderwood S.B. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted that HSF-1 would mediate its protective effects in this tissue. As shown in Fig. 1, an hsf-1 mutant is more susceptible to E. faecalis than wild type as previously published (6Singh V. Aballay A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13092-13097Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We complemented this mutant using tissue-specific promoters (24Kelly W.G. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Genetics. 1997; 146: 227-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Altun-Gultekin Z. Andachi Y. Tsalik E.L. Pilgrim D. Kohara Y. Hobert O. Development. 2001; 128: 1951-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Tokarz R. Savage-Dunn C. Development. 2002; 129: 4989-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein was also put under the control of these promoters and tissue-specific expression verified (data not shown). When under the control of a neuron-specific or muscle-specific promoter, the worm strains are just as susceptible as the hsf-1 mutant. However, when we put hsf-1 under the control of an intestinal promoter, resistance was restored to wild-type levels (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that the protective effects of HSF-1 are mediated specifically by expression in the intestine. In contrast, lifespan assays testing a dominant negative HSF-1 mutant found that HSF-1 contributed to longevity when expressed in any one of these tissues (36Morley J.F. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Exposure to Pathogens Enhances Polyglutamine Aggregation Specifically in the Intestine—The requirement for HSF-1 in the intestine, the site of infection, suggests the possibility of cellular protein damage at this location. For more direct evidence of protein damage, we examined infected worms for changes in protein quality control using a poly(Q) repeat protein expressed in the intestine. Formerly, Huntington-like poly(Q) repeat proteins fused to YFP were expressed in the body wall muscle cells of C. elegans and increases in aggregation observed with increases in length (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). A length of 40 repeats was found to be the threshold length, resulting in a mixture of focal fluorescence (aggregated protein) and diffuse fluorescence (non-aggregated protein), which varied depending on factors that affect protein homeostasis (16Nollen E.A. Garcia S.M. van Haaften G. Kim S. Chavez A. Morimoto R.I. Plasterk R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We expressed different lengths of poly(Q) fused to YFP in the worm intestine to find the threshold length in this tissue, as shown in Fig. 2A. On day 2 of adulthood, worms containing constructs with less than 44 repeats had diffuse fluorescence throughout the intestine, whereas those with more than 44 repeats had focal fluorescence. Most of the worms with a construct containing 44 repeats had diffuse fluorescence, but some had a mixture of diffuse and focal fluorescence (Fig. 2A). We found that the amount of aggregation increased with age (Fig. 2B), as was shown previously with transgenic lines expressing polyglutamine in the body wall muscle (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Based on our model that protein damage occurs in the intestine during infection, we predicted that exposure to E. faecalis would increase aggregation of the threshold length polyglutamine (Q44) in the intestine compared with exposure to E. coli. In Fig. 3, A and B, 83% of Q44 worms had detectable aggregates by day 3 of exposure to E. faecalis and over 92% by day 5. In contrast, 33% of worms on E. coli had aggregates on day 3, and only 41% by day 5. These data suggest that more damage occurs in the intestine of worms exposed to the pathogen E. faecalis than on its normal food source E. coli. To test if damage occurs in other tissues, we examined the effects of exposure to E. faecalis on poly(Q)40::YFP expressed in the body wall muscle cells (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Because all the worms had some aggregates, we counted the number of poly(Q)40::YFP aggregates rather than the number of worms with aggregates. We observed an increase in the number of aggregates over time, as previously observed (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), but we found no increase in the number of aggregates in the body wall muscle cells of worms feeding on E. coli compared with those exposed to E. faecalis (Fig. 3C). We conclude from these experiments that during infection with E. faecalis protein damage occurs at the site of the host-pathogen interaction, the intestine, and not throughout the worm.FIGURE 3Protein damage occurs during infection with E. faecalis at the site of infection, the intestine. L4 worms (day 0 worms) were exposed to E. faecalis or E. coli. A, fluorescence micrographs of worms expressing poly(Q)44::YFP in the intestine after exposure for 1, 3, and 5 days.

Sifri C.D. Mylonakis E. Qin X. Singh K.V. Murray B.E. Calderwood S.B. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 37Aballay A.

S. aureus and P. aeruginosa kill more quickly than E. faecalis and S. enterica with an LT50 of 2 days versus 4 and 5 days (30Garsin D.A. Sifri C.D. Mylonakis E. Qin X. Singh K.V. Murray B.E.

In correlation with the faster course of infection, we observed aggregation occurring earlier with 90% or more of the worms containing aggregates on both pathogens after 2 days of infection (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, we observed less than 80% of the worms on S. enterica experiencing aggregates by day 3 of infection (Fig. 4C). However, there were still more than twice as many aggregates on S. enterica as there were on E. coli (76 versus 35%). daf-16 and hsf-1 RNAi Increases whereas daf-2 RNAi ReducesPathogen-induced Aggregation in the Intestine—Because HSF-1 and insulin signaling affect susceptibility to pathogens and are involved in regulating HSPs, we predicted that the protein damage resulting from infection with E. faecalis would be influenced by these factors. To test our prediction, we used RNAi to reduce the expression of hsf-1, daf-16, and daf-2 in the intestinal poly(Q)44::YFP worms. We also exposed the worms to the vector alone as a control. The worms were exposed to E. coli strains expressing the RNA of the gene of interest during development, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We modified our procedure for hsf-1 RNAi and only exposed the worms for 1 day due to the strong effects that hsf-1 RNAi had on aggregation, even before pathogen exposure. Following RNAi, the worms were then placed on either the pathogen E. faecalis or the control strain, E. coli OP50. For hsf-1 and daf-16 RNAi, the percentage of worms with aggregates was observed after 1 day, whereas for daf-2 the percentage was recorded after 4 days. Because the loss of hsf-1 and genes in the insulin signaling pathway was previously observed to change the number of aggregates in aging assays conducted while feeding on E. coli (17Morley J.F. Brignull H.R. Weyers J.J. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), we subtracted the number of aggregates under non-pathogen feeding conditions to control for aggregation occurring as a result of the aging process. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, and Table 1, a dramatic, statistically significant increase in the percentage containing aggregates was observed for the hsf-1 and daf-16 RNAi worms compared with those exposed to the vector control when feeding on E. faecalis. Only 6–7% of the worms had aggregates when exposed to the vector control, compared with 27 and 23% of the worms exposed to hsf-1 and daf-16 RNAi, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5C and Table 1, daf-2 RNAi (which increases DAF-16 activity) greatly decreased the amount of protein aggregation that occurs in response to pathogens. Even after 4 days of feeding on E. faecalis, only 10% of the daf-2 RNAi worms had aggregates compared with 28% of the vector control worms. These data suggest that HSF-1 and DAF-16 are protective against infection-induced protein aggregation.TABLE 1Infection-induced poly(Q) aggregation of RNAi worms af"

Docking of these ligands in the ligand binding pocket alters the conformation of PPARγ, resulting in transcriptional activation subsequent to the release of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators.

In lung epithelial cells PARP-2 interacts with thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1). TTF1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor of the Nkx-2 family. In these cells, PARP-2 regulates the expression of the surfactant protein-B by affecting TTF1 activity (25Maeda Y. Hunter T.C. Loudy D.E. Dave V. Schreiber V. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9600-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study we show that PARP-2 affects the transcriptional activity of PPARγ both in vitro and in vivo. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. Animals—PARP-2-/- mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates (26Menissier-de Murcia J. Ricoul M. Tartier L. Niedergang C. Huber A. Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Sabatier L. Chambon P. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) coming from heterozygous crossings were used. Mice were housed separately, had ad libitum access to water and chow, and were kept under a 12-h dark-light cycle. The animals were killed at the age of 7 months by cervical dislocation after 4 h of fasting, and tissues were collected. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), Gentamicin (Invitrogen), and HEK, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum (Adgenix, Voisins le Bretonneux, France), and Gentamicin (Invitrogen). The 3T3-L1 cells were maintained subconfluent. MEF Preparation and Differentiation—MEFs were prepared from embryos as described elsewhere (26Menissier-de Murcia J. Ricoul M. Tartier L. Niedergang C. Huber A. Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Sabatier L. Chambon P. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). For the differentiation studies 4 × 105 MEFs were seeded in 12-well plates and maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was changed every 2 days until confluence. The cells were maintained at confluency for 2 days. Cells were then differentiated in DMEM, 10% newborn calf serum, 5 μm troglitazone, 5 μm dexamethasone, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 10 μg/ml insulin (later defined as differentiation mix), while the control cells received DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and Me2SO as vehicle. The medium with the differentiation mix was replaced every 2 days, and the cells were differentiated for 8 days. Control cells after confluency were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum containing only vehicle (Me2SO, 0.21%). DNA Constructs—To create an siRNA-expressing construct, double stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSuper vector (for sequences see Table 1) (27Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides siPARP-2sense and siPARP-2antisense (containing the siRNA sequence), as well as the control scrPARP-2sense and scrPARP-2antisense (scrambled version of the siRNA sequence), respectively, were annealed in annealing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH. 8.0). The resulting duplexes carried BglII and HindIII sites and were cloned into pSuper using these sites resulting in pSuper-siPARP-2 (oligonucleotides siPARP-2 sense plus siPARP-2 antisense) and pSuper-scrPARP-2 (oligonucleotides scrPARP-2 sense plus scrPARP-2 antisense). An EcoRV/SmaI fragment encoding mouse PARP-2 was isolated from pBC-mPARP-2 (23Schreiber V. Ame J.C. Dolle P. Schultz I. Rinaldi B. Fraulob V. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol.

Luciferase Activity Measurement—3 × 105 HEK cells were seeded in 6-well plates and were transfected with pSuper-siPARP-2, pSuper-scrPARP-2, pBabe, or pBabe-PARP-2 using the BES-buffered saline method. Two days later the cells were once more transfected with the constructs mentioned above. Cells were transfected 24 h later with 0.6 μg of pSuper-siPARP-2/pSuper-scrPARP-2/pBabe/pBabe-PARP-2, 0.4 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid, 1 μg of pSG-PPARα/pSG-PPARβ/pSG-PPARγ2/pCMX-ERβ expression vector, and 1 μg of PPAR-/ER-responsive construct. Six hours after transfection, cells were scraped, and luciferase activity was determined. For the determination of PPAR activity, just before transfection, cells were washed in serum-free DMEM medium, and the transfection was carried out in DMEM plus 10% fat-free serum. As ligand we used, fenofibrate (50 μm), monoethylhexyl phthalate (100 μm), troglitazone (5 μm), and β-estradiol (10 μm). After 6 h of transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and stored at -80 °C. Luciferase assay was carried out by standard procedures. Luciferase activity was expressed as luciferase activity/β-galactosidase activity. Nile Red Flow Cytometry—To assess the extent of MEF differentiation, cytosolic triglyceride content was assessed by determining Nile red uptake (modified from Ref. 32Maquoi E. Munaut C. Colige A. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) followed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Cells were harvested by adding trypsin/EDTA, and the detached cells were stained with Nile red (20 μg/ml, 5 min). Cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis with 10,000 events collected for each sample; each measurement point was repeated in 4 parallel replicates. Samples for each cell line were normalized against the non-differentiated cells of the same line. The rate of differentiation was expressed as the percentage of the differentiated cells versus total number of cells. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 8.0). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. For the detection of PARP-2, a polyclonal rabbit antibody was used 1:2,000, Alexis, Lausen, Switzerland), and actin was as detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma, 1:200). The secondary antibody was IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, 1:10,000). Reactions were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Total RNA Preparation, Reverse Transcription, and qPCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was treated with DNase, and 2 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription (RT). cDNA was purified on QIAquick PCR cleanup columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 50× diluted cDNA was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions. The qPCR reactions were preformed using the Light-Cycler system (Roche Applied Science) and a qPCR Supermix (Qiagen) with the primers summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2qPCR primersNameSequence (5′-3′)Accession numberAdiponectinF 5′-AAG AAG GAC AAG GCC GTT CTC TT-3′ (652-674)NM_009605.4R 5′-GCT ATG GGT AGT TGC AGT CAG TT-3′ (875-853)aP2F 5′-TGC CAC AAG GAA AGT GGC AG-3′ (132-151)BC054426R 5′-CTT CAC CTT CCT GTC GTC TG-3′ (294-275)CD36F 5′-GAT GTG GAA CCC ATA ACT GGA TTC AC-3′ (1378-1403)NM_007643R 5′-GGT CCC AGT CTC AAT TAG CCA CAG TA-3′ (1527-1502)Cyclophylin BF 5′-TGG AGA GCA CCA AGA CAG ACA-3′ (561-581)M60456R 5′-TGC CGG AGT CGA CAA TGA T-3′ (626-608)FASF 5′-GCT GCG GAA ACT TCA GGA AAT-3′ (6612-6632)BC046513R 5′-AGA GAC GTG TCA CTC CTG GAC TT-3′ (6695-6673)LPLF 5′-AGG ACC CCT GAA GAC AC-3′ (317-333)BC003305R 5′-GGC ACC CAA CTC TCA TA-3′ (465-449)LeptinF 5′-GAC ACC AAA ACC CTC AT-3′ (147-163)NM_008493R 5′-CAG AGT CTG GTC CAT CT-3′ (296-280)PerilipinF 5′-GCT TCT TCC GGC CCA GC-3′ (1511-1527)NM_175640R 5′-CTC TTC TTG CGC AGC TGG CT-3′ (1580-1561)PPARγ1F 5′-CCA CCA ACT TCG GAA TCA GCT-3′ (158-178)NM_011146R 3′-TTT GTG GAT CCG GCA GTT AAG A-3′ (591-570)PPARγ2F 5′-ATG GGTG AAA CTC TGG GAG ATT CT-3′ (46-69)AY243585R 5′-CTT GGA GCT TCA GGT CAT ATT TGT A-3′ (346-322)HSLF 5′-CCT CAT GGC TCA ACT CC-3′ (1633/2075-1649/2091)NM_001039507.1/NM_010719.5R 5′-GGT TCT TGA CTA TGG GTG A-3′ (2067/2509-2049/2491)TNFαF 5′-GCC ACC ACG CTC TTC TG-3′ (286-302)NM_013693.2R 3′-GGT GTG GGT GAG GAG CA-3′ (627-611) Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to a previous study (33Balint B.L.

We used also a no antibody control. The chromatin fragments collected upon precipitation with the above antibodies were amplified using promoter-specific primers by qPCR. For the analysis of the coding sequence the same qPCR primer set was used as the one for the quantitation of the given gene. The respective primers are listed in Tables 2 and 3.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using the α-ERβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and as controls we used an α-MRE11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a no antibody control. The chromatin fragments collected upon precipitation with the above antibodies were amplified using K19 promoter-specific primers by qPCR. Microscopy—Formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (7 μm) were made from WAT samples and were stained with hematoxylin and eosine. The same sections were stained with a biotin-conjugated F4/80 antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC, 1:100 dilution), and the bound primary antibodies were detected using streptavidin-peroxidase (Vector ABC kit) and diaminobenzidine as chromogenic substrate. Terminally differentiated MEFs were stained by Oil red O as described elsewhere. Triglyceride Measurement—The triglyceride content of the MEFs was determined using a commercially available Sigma kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Significance was analyzed by Student's t test. Error bars represent ± S.E., unless noted otherwise. In Vivo Dysfunction of the PPARγ/RXR Heterodimer in the WAT of PARP-2-/- Mice—The different fat depots (epididymal, mesenteric, and inguinal) and the interscapular brown adipose tissue-associated WAT were measured in 7-month-old PARP-2-/- mice and their wild-type littermates. A proportional loss of the weight of all adipose tissue depots was observed in the PARP-2-/- mice (Fig. 1A). Histological examination of the PARP-2-/- epididymal WAT showed adipocytes with reduced and irregular size. This tissue contained diluted capillaries, indicative of inflammation, which was confirmed by a faint staining with the macrophage-specific F4/80 antibody in the PARP-2-/- (Fig. 1, B and C) and the macroscopic appearance of the WAT (Fig. 1A). The F4/80-positive cells were present in the vicinity of the blood vessels. To identify the molecular changes that contribute to the decreased fat accumulation and abnormal adipocyte morphology, we determined the expression of the PPARγ target genes, TNFα, and hormone-sensitive lipase by RT-qPCR in the epididymal WAT. TNFα expression was undetectable in 8 of the 22 mice used for this study (4 out of 14 PARP-2+/+ and 4 out of 8 PARP-2-/-). In the TNFα-positive mice, expression levels were not different, ruling out a major role for inflammation in the adipose tissue dysfunction in PARP-2-/- mice. The expression level of hormone-sensitive lipase, which is responsible for lipolysis, was also not different between the two genotypes. The expression of several PPARγ target genes, however, was markedly decreased. These include genes involved in chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride hydrolysis (lipoprotein lipase), free fatty acid uptake (CD36), de novo fatty acid synthesis, and endocrine signaling (leptin and adiponectin) (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, no difference was detected in PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 mRNA levels between the different genotypes. MEF Differentiation Is Affected by PARP-2 Ablation—We next aimed to determine whether MEFs differentiation toward adipocytes was affected by the PARP-2 deletion. Differentiation of PAPR-2-/- MEFs into adipocytes was decreased as judged by Oil red O staining, determination of lipid content, and Nile red staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 2A). The expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and function such as PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were decreased in the PARP-2-/- MEFs (34Saladin R. Fajas L. Dana S. Halvorsen Y.D. Auwerx J. Briggs M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 43-48PubMed Google Scholar). Because the PPARγ transcripts are primarily present in the differentiated cells, these data confirm that PARP-2-/- cells differentiate less into adipocytes. The expression of PPARγ target genes, such as lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid synthase, leptin, adiponectin, and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2), were decreased in parallel (Fig. 2B). PARP-2 Expression Modulates Transactivation of PPARs—To measure whether changes in PARP-2 expression affect PPAR transactivation, we used HEK 293 cells transfected with a PPARγ2 expression vector and a PPARγ-responsive luciferase construct. In these experiments we modulated the expression of PARP-2 expression by overexpression and siRNA depletion. For the siRNA depletion of PARP-2 we used the pSuper-siPARP-2 construct, whereas for PARP-2 overexpression we used the pBabe-PARP-2. The pSuper-scrPARP-2 and the empty pBabe vector served as the respective controls. PARP-2 levels were assessed by Western blotting using a PARP-2-specific antibody. For both constructs, the cells were transfected twice, on day 0 and on day 2. On day 3, the specific siRNA decreased PARP-2 protein levels significantly, whereas the scrambled PARP-2 siRNA did not alter the PARP-2 levels. A strong increase in PARP-2 protein was observed on day 3 of the overexpression experiment (Fig. 3). PARP-2 depletion diminished the basal PPARγ activity and abrogated receptor activation by its synthetic ligand, troglitazone. Conversely, PARP-2 overexpression induced by 3-fold the basal PPARγ activity, although it does not significantly change the ligand-dependent activation by troglitazone (Fig. 4A). To verify whether this effect of PARP-2 was specific for PPARγ, we performed similar experiments for the related nuclear receptors PPARα (NR1C1) and PPARβ (NR1C2), and the unrelated estrogen receptor β (ERβ, NR3A2). Interestingly, siRNA depletion of PARP-2 increased the basal activity of both PPARα and -β (Fig. 4, B and C). PARP-2 overexpression did not affect PPARβ but increased PPARα activity. The activation of PPARα and -β with fenofibrate and monoethylhexyl phthalate, respectively, was not modified by the modulation of PARP-2 expression. In addition, neither PARP-2 depletion, nor PARP-2 overexpression had an effect on the basal or ligand-induced activity of ERβ (Fig. 4D). Combined these results indicate specificity of the PARP-2-dependent effect on PPARγ. PARP-2 Is the Member of the RXR/PPARγ Transcription Complex—To demonstrate an interaction between PPARγ and PARP-2 we used ChIP assays. To precipitate chromatin from undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells we used antibodies against PARP-2 and PPARγ2. An anti-matrix metalloproteinase-9 antibody and a sample without antibody served as negative controls. We used qPCR to amplify the promoters of the aP2 (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) and CD36 (35Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M."
https://openalex.org/W2008767446,"Osteocrin (Ostn) is a recently discovered secreted protein produced by cells of the osteoblast lineage that shows a well conserved homology with members of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family. We hypothesized that Ostn could interact with the NP receptors, thereby modulating NP actions on the skeleton. Ostn binds specifically and saturably to the NP peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) receptor with a Kd of ∼5 nm with no binding to the GC-A or GC-B receptors. Deletion of several of the residues deemed important for NP binding to NPR-C led to abolition of Ostn binding, confirming the presence of a “natriuretic motif.” Functionally, Ostn was able to augment C-type natriuretic peptide-stimulated cGMP production in both pre-chondrocytic (ATDC5) and osteoblastic (UMR106) cells, suggesting increased NP levels due to attenuation of NPR-C associated NP clearance. Ostn-transgenic mice displayed elongated bones and a marked kyphosis associated with elevated bone cGMP levels, suggesting that elevated natriuretic peptide activity contributed to the increased bone length possibly through an increase in growth plate chondrocyte proliferation. Thus, we have demonstrated that Ostn is a naturally occurring ligand of the NPR-C clearance receptor and may act to locally modulate the actions of the natriuretic system in bone by blocking the clearance action of NPR-C, thus locally elevating levels of C-type natriuretic peptide.

To date, the exact role of Ostn has not been elucidated. Limited homology, however, was observed between Ostn and members of the natriuretic peptide family, suggesting a possible functional link. The natriuretic system, key in the maintenance of vascular tone and cardiovascular homeostasis, consists of three related natriuretic peptides (NPs), ANP, BNP, and CNP (2Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) and three receptors (NPRs) mediating the biological activity of these peptides. The GC-A receptor, which preferentially binds ANP and BNP, and the GC-B receptor, whose cognate ligand is CNP, are coupled to guanylyl cyclase, producing cGMP as a secondary messenger (3Matsuo H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Hirose S. Hagiwara H. Takei Y. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The third receptor, NPR-C, has no guanylyl cyclase activity and binds all three NPs with similar affinity (5Suga S. Nakao K.

To date, no specific endogenous ligand has been identified for NPR-C, and it is thought to act mainly as a clearance receptor (6Levin E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E483-E489PubMed Google Scholar). However, other biological functions have been postulated for this receptor (6Levin E.R. Am. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14288-14292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we initially identified Ostn in cells of the osteoblast lineage, the bone-producing cells, which together with its regulatory effects on these cells suggested a role in bone activity. Given the homology of Ostn to the NP family and its putative bone regulatory action, a role for Ostn as a molecule mediating co-operation between the natriuretic and skeletal regulatory systems presented an intriguing possibility. Investigation of the nature of Ostn interactions with the natriuretic system in vitro demonstrated specific binding to the natriuretic clearance receptor (NPR-C) and the ability to augment NP activity. Furthermore, overexpression of Ostn using the collagen type I promoter in transgenic mice resulted in enhanced bone growth associated with elevated cGMP levels. We, therefore, propose a role for Ostn as a specific NPR-C ligand capable of modulating local levels of CNP and its effects on skeletal development. Rat ANP-(1-28) and CNP-(1-22) were purchased from Sigma. The cGMP EIA (Biotrak System) was from Amersham Biosciences. The C-terminal synthetic mouse peptides, Ostn-(107-129) (amidated) (106YDHSKKRFGIPMDRIGRNRLSNSR129) and Ostn-(117-130) (116CMDRIGRNRLSNSRG130), were from Sigma and Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO), respectively. These peptides are consensus mammalian sequences for these regions of the Ostn protein. The human peptides Ostn-(83-133) and 125I-labeled Ostn-(83-133) were purchased from Phoenix Peptides (Belmont, CA). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and rat osteosarcoma cells (UMR106) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Mouse pre-chondrocytic cells, ATDC5, were maintained in 1:1 Ham's/F-12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Cansera), 1 mm glutamine (Wisent), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin (Wisent), 30 nm sodium selenite (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma). Exact experimental conditions are described below. To generate a secreted placental alkaline phosphatase-Ostn fusion protein (PLAP-Ostn), the mouse Ostn sequence covering amino acids 29-130 was amplified by PCR with forward 5′-tctctgtcgacttagcatcagg-3′ and reverse 5′-ccatcagcctctggaactggagag-3′ primers. The PCR product was digested with SalI (underlined) and cloned into an XhoI/PmeI-digested pAPtag5 vector containing the PLAP sequence (GenHunter, Nashville, TN). The resulting PLAP-Ostn plasmid and the pAPtag5 were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells (QBiogene, Carlsbad, CA) using Effectene (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The day after transfection, cells were washed and incubated for 48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The conditioned medium was collected, cells and debris were spun out, and the supernatant was stored at 4 °C after buffering with 20 mm HEPES (pH 8). Quantification of the PLAP-Ostn fusion protein was assayed by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Ostn-(107-129) peptide as standard curve. Briefly, samples and standards were mixed with carbonate buffer 100 mm (pH 10) and bound onto high protein-binding capacity polystyrene (Corning Costar) 96-well plates for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBST) for 1 h at 37 °C, incubated with the anti-Ostn antibody (1:2500 in TBST with 2.5% skim milk) for 1 h at 37 °C, then washed and incubated with an anti-rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) (1:30,000 in TBST with 2.5% skim milk) for 45 min at 37 °C. Revelation was achieved with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride Sigma Fast substrate (Sigma) in the dark for 30 min and read on a microplate reader at 492 nm. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting against Ostn was also performed to confirm the presence of the fusion protein. The expression plasmid for rat GC-A containing the entire coding sequence cloned between the NheI-KpnI sites of cytomegalovirus-driven pBK plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was kindly provided by Dr. A. De Léan (Département de Pharmacologie, Université de Montréal). The human NPR-C and GC-B coding sequences were amplified by RT-PCR from human embryonic kidney poly(A) RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with the following primer pairs: NPR-C, 5′-agggcaagctctttcttgcg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gggcttcctttaagctactg-3′ (reverse); GC-B, 5′-ctgctgctttatccccatgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggtttacaggagtccaggag-3′ (reverse). The resulting PCR products were then cloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter into the pcDNA1.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. To produce a bacterial human Ostn (recombinant human Ostn (rhOstn)), its cDNA encoding amino acids 23-133 was PCR-amplified with oligos 5′-gagggtacccgtagatgtaacaacaacagagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctcctgcagttagcctctggaatttgaaagccg-3′ (reverse). The purified PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and PstI and cloned into pQE30 plasmid and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain SG13009 (Qiagen). The N-terminal six-histidine-tagged rhOstn was purified from the soluble bacterial extract by sonication followed by chromatography through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) and a Sepharose-SP cationic exchanger (GE Healthcare). The final rhOstn preparation was estimated to be ∼95% pure by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and was quantified by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described above. PLAP-Ostn Fusion Protein—Binding studies were performed as described previously (13Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P.

Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids (GC-A, GC-B, or NPR-C) or a negative control (cytomegalovirus-based green fluorescent protein expression plasmid (pQBIfc3, Qbiogene)). Forty-eight hours later cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% d-glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.05% NaN3. Binding of the PLAP-Ostn-containing conditioned media with or without the various peptides (500 μl total/well) was performed at 25 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed 6 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution for 5 min each and lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 25 °C, and endogenous alkaline phosphatase was inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. PLAP activity was measured in the linear range by a standard enzymatic assay using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Sigma). 125I-Labeled Ostn-(83-133)—Intact cell binding studies with radiolabeled Ostn-(83-133) were carried out in confluent ATDC5 cells. Briefly, ATDC5 cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline then incubated in Ham's/F-12 plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin with 50,000 cpm of 125I-labeled Ostn-(83-133) for 90 min at 4 °C with varying concentrations of cold Ostn-(83-133) competitor. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed into 0.5 m NaOH, and the bound cpm were counted on a Wallac Wizard 1470 gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding curves were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For cGMP assays, cells were washed and incubated for 10 min in culture media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.25 mm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) to minimize cGMP degradation. Treatments were carried out in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 15 min, and cells were collected in ice-cold 65% ethanol. Cell extracts were assayed in duplicate using cGMP Direct Biotrak EIA (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transgenic mice were generated by nuclear microinjection of a 4454-bp DNA fragment containing the rat collagen 1 α1 3.6-kilobase promoter (-3500 to +115) (GenBank™ accession number J04464) and the mouse Ostn coding region. Five hundred copies were microinjected into the pronuclei of C3B6F1 fertilized eggs (C57BL/6J x C3H/HeJ F1 hybrid) which were then transplanted to the oviducts of pseudopregnant foster mothers using standard protocols at the Transgenic Facility at the Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal (16Hogan B. Beddington R.S. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Three independent mouse lines, 650, 677, and 688, were generated arising from three different founders. Genotyping was carried out by Southern analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA with a mouse Ostn coding region probe or by PCR using inter-exon primers covering the Ostn coding region (1Thomas G. Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. Gingras R. Godin E. Miao D. Goltzman D. Lanctot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50563-50571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Long bone lengths were measured using fine calipers on dissected bones. Tail lengths were measured from anus to tail tip using a ruler. All measurements were undertaken by the same operator blinded to the mouse genotype. For immunohistochemistry, bones were fixed, decalcified, embedded, and cut according to standard protocols (17Bourque W.T. Gross M. Hall B.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1429-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An Ostn-specific antibody (1Thomas G. Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. Gingras R. Godin E. Miao D. Goltzman D. Lanctot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50563-50571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used for immunolabeling and visualized with DAKO Envisision + System-HRP (AEC) (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes was assessed using a proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) on 7-week-old tibiae from Ostn-Tg and wild type littermates. After immunohistochemistry, positively stained cells in the entire growth plate were counted and expressed as the percentage of total cell number. To measure cGMP levels in the bones of wild type and transgenic mice, 10-14-day-old mice were euthanized, and the femurs and tibia were dissected and cleaned of any adjacent soft tissue. The whole bones including epiphysis, metaphysis, diaphysis, and marrow were then immediately homogenized in 1 ml of cold 65% ethanol using a Polytron homogenizer and stored at -80 °C until assay. For assay, the bone extracts were spun at 12000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 1 ml of cGMP assay buffer. The cGMP assay was then carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using 25-μl aliquots as for the cellular assays. RNA was isolated from whole bones, isolated tissues, or whole cell lysates using Trizol™ (Invitrogen). Tendons and muscles were obtained from 3-month-old rats and the bone tissue from 4-day-old neonates. Northern blots were generated on nylon membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) by standard methods (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters were prehybridized for 4 h and hybridized overnight in Church buffer (19Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar) at 65 °C. The rat Ostn cDNA probe corresponded to the full coding sequence. A mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe corresponding to -21 to 956 bp of GenBank™ accession number M32599 was generated by PCR. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a standard random priming protocol (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from confluent ATDC5 prechondrocytes and UMR106 osteoblasts 7 days post-confluence using Trizol™. For RT-PCR, cDNAs were generated with Superscript II™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer priming from 2 μg of total RNA, and PCR amplification was carried out with gene-specific primers using Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). Gene-specific primers (all 5′-3′) and conditions were as follows: NPR-A, forward tggatctcaagtgggagcacag and reverse gatctgcatagagcacaagc (annealing temperature = 58 °C, 35 cycles, product 261 bp); NPR-B, forward aactgatgctggagaaggagc and reverse gcgagtaagatggttgaactggac (annealing temperature = 58 °C, 35 cycles, product 305 bp); NPR-C, forward ctacatccaaggcagcgagcg and reverse gcaaccacagagaagtcccca (annealing temperature = 56 °C, 35 cycles, product 492 bp); 18 S ribosomal RNA, forward tcaagaacgaaagtcggagg and reverse ccaactaagaacggccatgc (annealing temperature = 62 °C, 20 cycles, product 324 bp). Ostn Sequence Homology—Initial analysis of Ostn species conservation identified Ostn in humans, cows, mice, rats, chickens, and snakes (1Thomas G. Moffatt P. Salois P. Gaumond M.H. Gingras R. Godin E. Miao D. Goltzman D. Lanctot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50563-50571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Further analysis through genomic data mining has identified Ostn in amphibians (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum, Eastern tiger salamander) and fish (Danio rerio, Zebrafish) as well as chimpanzee, pig, and dog. Fig. 1 shows the alignment between Ostn protein sequences from various vertebrate species with strong conservation of the C-terminal half of Ostn (e.g. human to amphibian = 81% similarity). Within the Ostn C-terminal region are two highly conserved putative dibasic motifs (Fig. 1, shaded) which may represent active processing sites for proteinases. N-terminal microsequencing of purified Ostn from the conditioned media of HEK293 cells stably expressing mouse Ostn revealed the presence of a fragment starting at Ser80, thus demonstrating processing at the KKKR site. Processing at the KRR site has not as yet been demonstrated. The two dibasic sites delimit similar sequences (Fig. 1, boxed), which contain motifs found in the NPs (NP-like motifs, NM). Fig. 2 shows the alignment between the human Ostn motifs (NM1 and NM2) and NPs. Residues shaded in gray are well conserved, particularly those marked with asterisks (Phe7, Gly8, and Arg13, numbered according to CNP) which are considered important in binding to the NPR-C receptor. Note, however, the absence of the two cysteine residues present in all NPs (Fig. 2, shaded black). Extra-osseous Ostn Expression—Although initially identified as an osteoblast-specific gene, further analyses of non-osseous tissues demonstrated Ostn expression in other stromal-derived tissues. Northern blotting has demonstrated that Ostn was expressed at significant levels in both leg tendons/ligaments and skeletal muscle of young adult rats (Fig. 3). Ostn levels appeared very high in tendons, with weaker expression in muscle. However, direct comparisons are difficult to draw due to differing cell densities and cell population homogeneity in the various tissues. Preliminary immunohistochemistry localization of Ostn in long bones and teeth confirmed it is present in knee joint and periodontal ligaments (supplemental Fig. 1). Ostn Binding to Natriuretic Peptide Receptors—Two approaches were used to characterize Ostn binding to NPRs. First, a heterologous expression system (transiently transfected HEK293 cells) in conjunction with an Ostn-fusion reporter (PLAP-Ostn) was utilized to demonstrate receptor-specific binding. Further characterization of the binding of Ostn to the NPR-C receptor was then undertaken using an iodinated synthetic C-terminal Ostn peptide (125I-labeled Ostn-(83-133)) in a pre-chondrocytic cell line (ATDC5) and which endogenously express natriuretic receptors. These cells have the potential to differentiate into matrix producing chondrocytes with insulin treatment. However, for our studies the presence of excessive matrix would greatly complicate binding studies, and the expression pattern of the NPRs was most appropriate in the pre-differentiated confluent state. Functional consequences of Ostn binding to NPR-C were then demonstrated by an enhanced cGMP response to CNP treatment in ATDC5 cells and an osteoblastic cell line, UMR106. The Ostn fusion protein, PLAP-Ostn, comprised an N-terminal secreted PLAP moiety linked to full-length mouse Ostn (residues 29-130). Conditioned media containing PLAP-Ostn was used to assess Ostn binding on transiently transfected HEK293 cells. We first wished to establish the specificity of PLAP-Ostn for the different NPRs. Saturable binding of the PLAP-Ostn fusion protein was observed exclusively on NPR-C-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A). No specific binding was seen on cells overexpressing either green fluorescent protein, GC-B (Fig. 4A) or GC-A (not shown). To verify functionality of the overexpressed receptors, intracellular cGMP levels were measured in transfected HEK293 cells upon stimulation with the appropriate ligand. As expected, ANP elicited the greatest response via GC-A and CNP through GC-B, indicating the receptors were functionally expressed in this heterologous system (Fig. 4B). Because of the presence of endogenous GC-A in HEK293 cells, low levels of cGMP were also induced by ANP after transfection with either GC-B or NPR-C (Fig. 4B). Consistent with absence of PLAP-Ostn binding to GC-A or GC-B, both a C-terminal Ostn peptide encompassing NM2 (Ostn-(107-129)) (see Fig. 2) or a recombinant form of human full-length Ostn (rhOstn) failed to activate either GC-A or GC-B (Fig. 4B). To investigate the role of the proposed natriuretic motifs in Ostn binding to NPR-C, two synthetic Ostn peptides, Ostn-(107-129) described above and Ostn-(107-129), lacking part of NM2, were used for competition binding studies. HEK293 cells transfected with NPR-C were co-incubated with ∼30 nm PLAP-Ostn and increasing concentrations of Ostn-(107-129) or Ostn-(107-129). Ostn-(107-129) was able to compete off 50% of the binding of PLAP-mouse Ostn in the ∼10-9-10-8m range, in contrast to Ostn-(107-129), which was unable to efficiently compete up to 10-7m (Fig. 4C). Having established that Ostn binds to the NPR-C receptor and that at least the NM2 motif was important for this interaction, we further characterized binding in ATDC5 cells which express both GC-B and NPR-C receptors (Fig. 4E, inset) (20Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21Fujishige K. Kotera J. Yanaka N. Akatsuka H. Omori K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Competitive binding experiments with 125I-labeled Ostn-(83-133) and increasing concentrations of cold Ostn-(83-133) gave an average Kd of 4.8 ± 0.9 nm with a curve characteristic of competitive binding for a single receptor site (Fig. 4D). Binding of Ostn to NPR-C could result in attenuation of the clearance action of this receptor, thus increasing NP availability and cGMP production upon stimulation of GC-A or GC-B. We tested this hypothesis in ATDC5 and UMR106 cells whereby NP signaling (cGMP production) was assessed in the presence or absence of Ostn-(83-133). ATDC5 cells express both GC-B and NPR-C at confluence (Fig. 4E, inset). When treated with 10-7 or 10-6m CNP, ATDC5 cells produced 10.1 ± 1.9 and 37.0 ± 4.5 ng of cGMP/μg of protein, respectively. However, if the cells were incubated with the same concentrations of CNP together with 10-7m Ostn-(83-133), cGMP production was augmented 5.2- and 2.2-fold, respectively (p ≤ 0.01). UMR106 osteoblasts were used at 7 days post-confluence when both GC-B and NPR-C were expressed (Fig. 4F, inset). Treatment of UMR106 with a range of CNP concentrations from 10-7 to 10-6m resulted in a dose-responsive cGMP production. At all CNP concentrations tested, co-treatment with Ostn augmented cGMP production, with an average increase of 1.4-fold (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 4F). Using the heterologous HEK293 model, we showed that Ostn could not compete off either ANP or CNP for the endogenous GC-A or the overexpressed GC-B receptors, respectively (see supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). However, in both cases Ostn could effectively compete with either ANP or CNP for the NPR-C receptor, with concomitant activation of their respective cognate receptors and increase in intracellular cGMP accumulation (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). Characterization of Ostn Transgenic Mice—Reflecting the initial identification of Ostn in osteoblastic cells, we investigated its role in the skeleton in vivo by generating transgenic mice utilizing the rat 3.6-kilobase collagen type I promoter to overexpress mouse Ostn in osteoblast-lineage cells (Ostn-TG) (22Dacic S. Kalajzic I. Visnjic D. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1228-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the collagen type I promoter also drives expression in the perichondrium, skin, and tendons (23Pavlin D. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov A. Kream B.E. Harrison J.R. Thomas H.F. Gronowicz G.A. Clark S.H. Woody C.O. Rowe D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Three independent mouse lines were established and analyzed with all three lines showing similar phenotypes. Northern blotting confirmed high levels of transgene expression in bone with no apparent effects on endogenous expression (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated elevated Ostn protein levels in osteoblastic cells of 4-day-old Ostn-TG tibiae versus wild type littermates (Fig. 5, A and B). Clear expression can be seen in the cuboidal osteoblasts in the primary spongiosa and surrounding periosteum, sites rich in osteoblasts. Expression was also seen in the perichondrium surrounding the growth plate (a known site of collagen type I expression). Ostn-TG mice displayed no gross physiological defects, with similar body weight to their wild type littermates. Life spans of the Ostn-TG mice appeared normal with no evidence of early death up until 12 months of age. Bone mineral density as well as lean and fat mass, as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in 8-month-old mice from the three transgenic lines, showed"

We previously demonstrated that estrogen suppresses activin gene expression, suggesting a feedback relationship between these two follicle-regulating hormones. The purpose of this study was to investigate fully activin A regulation of ER expression. Real time reverse transcription-PCR assays on cultured granulosa cells showed that both ERα and ERβ mRNAs were induced by activin A at 4, 12, and 24 h in a dose-responsive manner. Western blots confirmed an increase in their protein levels. Consistent with increased ERα and ERβ expression, activin A stimulated estradiol-induced estrogen response element promoter activity. Activin A stimulation of ER expression was a direct effect at the level of gene transcription, as it was not abolished by cycloheximide but was abolished by actinomycin D, and in transfected granulosa cells activin A stimulated ERα promoter activity. To investigate the effect of activin in vivo and, thus, its biological significance, we examined ER expression in inhibin transgenic mice that have decreased activin expression and discovered that these mice had decreased ERα and ERβ expression in the ovary. We also found that ER mRNA levels were decreased in Müllerian inhibiting substance promoter (MIS)-Smad2 dominant negative mice that have impaired activin signaling through Smad2, and small interfering RNAs targeting Smad2 or Smad3 suppressed ERα promoter activation, suggesting that Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in regulating ER levels. Therefore, this study reveals an important role for activin in inducing the expression of ERs in the mouse ovary and suggests important interplay between activin and estrogen signaling.

Activin and its functional antagonist inhibin were originally isolated from gonadal sources as endocrine factors regulating the synthesis and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone by the pituitary gland (1Schwartz N.B.

In the reproductive system, in addition to regulating gonadotropin release, activin and inhibin have been shown to play an important role in regulating the formation and development of ovarian follicles in the female (10Mather J.P.

Ovarian follicle formation and development is a dynamic process finely regulated by various intrinsic and endocrine factors, and it involves interactions between multiple cell types within the ovary.

Activins are dimers of two shared β subunits, βAor βB, to form activin A (βAβA), activin B (βBβB), or activin AB (βAβB) (4Ying S.Y. Endocr.

Inhibin is a heterodimer of a unique inhibin α subunit with either of two shared β subunits, βAor βB, to form inhibin A or inhibin B, respectively (4Ying S.Y. Endocr.

Activin signals through a receptor serine-threonine kinase/Smad protein pathway, which involves activin binding receptors (ACTR IIA and ACTR IIB), a signaling receptor (ACTR IB), signaling co-activators (Smads 2, 3, and 4), and an inhibitor (Smad7). All three inhibin/activin subunit mRNAs are expressed in the ovary and are localized predominantly to granulosa cells (17Woodruff T.K. D'Agostino J. Schwartz N.B. Mayo K.E.

In addition to the inhibin and activin ligands, most components of their signaling systems are expressed in the rodent ovarian follicle both in the oocyte and somatic cells (12Knight P.G. Glister C.

In addition to its functions in many extragonadal tissues, similar to activin, estrogen also plays an intraovarian role in regulating follicle development and function (for reviews, see Refs. 24Britt K.L.

During follicle formation and development (the first few days after birth in mice), ERs and activin subunits are both expressed, whereas other members of the TGF-β superfamily, inhibin, or follicle-stimulating hormone receptors are not readily detectable until after primary follicles have formed (38Jefferson W.N.

In an effort to examine the effects of activin on ovarian gene expression, we performed a microarray study, and ERβ was identified as a gene that is significantly up-regulated. This is particularly interesting as we have shown earlier that estrogen can negatively regulate activin subunit expression (45Kipp J.L. Kilen S.M. Bristol-Gould S. Woodruff T.K. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1968-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between ER signaling and TGF-β superfamily members has been reported in other systems (46Matsuda T.

The results suggest an important interplay between activin and estrogen signaling in the mouse ovary. Animals—CD-1 mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, In), MT-α inhibin transgenic mice, and MIS-Smad2 dominant negative mice, both on a CD-1 background, were maintained on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle (lights off at 17:00) with food and water available ad libitum. Breeders (90-180 days old) were fed with a soy-free mouse chow (Harlan 7926, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) to limit exogenous phytoestrogen intake through food. At the time of delivery (day 1), 8 pups were kept with each female to minimize the possible difference in pup development caused by nutrient availability. Animals were cared for in accordance with all federal and institutional guidelines. Primary Granulosa Cell Collection, Culture, and Treatment—Wild type or MIS-Smad2 dominant negative mice on a CD-1 background were sacrificed on postnatal days 22-23, and ovaries from 6-10 animals were pooled for granulosa cell collection. Granulosa cells were collected through follicle puncture as described previously by our laboratory in rats (50Dykema J.C. Mayo K.E.

Granulosa cells were either used directly for RNA isolation or cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 μg/ml insulin, 5 nm sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.04 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) for 3 days before treatments. Estrogen-free culture conditions were used to minimize any interference from this steroid as this study measures ER levels. All treatments were done in phenol red-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 medium to eliminate endogenous growth factors including activin. The treatments included 25, 50, 100, or 200 ng/ml activin A (equivalent to 0.96, 1.92, 3.84, and 7.96 nm, respectively; R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), 100 ng/ml activin A plus 400 ng/ml follistatin (produced in the Woodruff laboratory), 400 ng/ml follistatin, 100 ng/ml inhibin A (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX), 100 pm TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, kindly provided by Dr. Boris Pasche from Northwestern University), 100 ng/ml BMP-2 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), or vehicle (PBS) for 1, 4, 12, or 24 h. The doses of treatments were based on reported studies (55Burdette J.E. Jeruss J.S. Kurley S.J. Lee E.J. Woodruff T.K.

Primary Granulosa Cell Transfection—Primary granulosa cells cultured in the above estrogen-deprived conditions were transiently transfected with an ERE promoter-luciferase reporter construct that contains two ERE (58Gehm B.D.

Transfection was performed with 250 ng of DNA per well of a 24-well culture plate using cationic liposomes in a phenol red-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) (59Burkart A.D. Mukherjee A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 2005; 196: 1909-1921Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After 12-16 h of transfection, fresh medium containing vehicle, 100 ng/ml activin A, 100 ng/ml activin A plus 400 ng/ml follistatin, or 400 ng/ml follistatin alone was given to the cells for 4-8 h followed by the addition of E2 (100 nm) or ethanol for another 24 h. Cell lysates were then collected for luciferase assays as well as for RNA isolation to measure ER expression levels. RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from primary granulosa cells or from ovaries of 19-day-old MT-α inhibin transgenic mice and their normal littermates (NLM) using a Qiagen RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Ovaries were collected on postnatal day 19 because at this age all follicles through the antral stage can be observed and yet the animals are pre-pubertal. On-column DNase digestion was performed using an RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen) to eliminate DNA contamination. The resulting RNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Fisher). Real time PCR was then performed on a Bio-Rad iCycler using SyberGreen SuperMix to quantitatively measure the mRNA levels of ERα, ERβ, inhibin α, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, JunB, pS2/TFF1, inhibin βA, and inhibin βB. Primers were designed according to the complete mouse cDNA sequences of the above genes. A list of the primers used is shown in Table 1. Ribosomal protein L19 (L19) was used as an internal control for all reactions. The threshold cycle (Ct) numbers of L19 were not altered by any of the treatments (data not shown). The amplicons from reactions for ERα and ERβ were sequenced to confirm correct products. Specificity of all the real time PCR reactions was also confirmed by a single peak in the melt curves and by a single band of the predicted size after agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products (data not shown).TABLE 1List of primers used in this studyGenesPCR primersProduct sizeBpRP-L195′-CTG AAG GTC AAA GGG AAT GTG-3′1955′-GGA CAG AGT CTT GAT GAT CTC-3′ERα5′-ACC ATT GAC AAG AAC CGG AG-3′1705′-CCT GAA GCA CCC ATT TCA TT-3′ERβ5′-TGT GTG TGA AGG CCA TGA TT-3′1385′-TCT TCG AAA TCA CCC AGA CC-3′Inhibin α5′-CTC CCA GGC TAT CCT TTT CC-3′1125′-TGG CCG GAA TAC ATA AGT GA-3′CREB5′-CCT GCC ATC ACC ACT GTA AC-3′1195′-TGT ACC CCA TCC GTA CCA TT-3′GAPDH5′-ACA GTC AAG GCC GAT AAT GG-3′1455′-TCT CCA TGG TGG TGA AGA CA-3′JunB5′-GAC GAC CTG CAC AAG ATG AA-3′1305′-TGC TGA GGT TGG TGT AGA CG-3′pS2/TFF15′-CAG GCC CAG GAA GAA CAT-3′1225′-AAT CCC CGG ACA CTG CAT-3′Inhibin βA5′-GAT CAT CAC CTT TGC CGA GT-3′1435′-TGG TCC TGG TTC TGT TAG CC-3′Inhibin βB5′-CTA GAG TGT GAT GGG CGG AC-3′3085′-ACA TCC CGC TTG ACA ATG TT-3′ Open table in a new tab Western Blot—Protein homogenates were collected from the treated primary cultured granulosa cells, ovaries of 19-day-old MT-α inhibin transgenic mice and their NLM, or transfected GRMO2 cells. Protein homogenates were prepared in GBA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science), and 0.1 mm bacitracin (Sigma), pH 7.4, at 4 °C). Proteins were electrophoresed under reducing conditions in 13% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (all from Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA; 1:5000 dilution). The primary antibodies were anti-ERα (MC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-ERβ (PA1-311, Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), anti-c-Myc (Sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-phospho-Smad2 (#3101, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-phospho-Smad3 (#9514, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti-actin (Sigma), all at 1:1000 dilution except for anti-actin, which was at 1:2000 dilution. Proteins were then visualized by chemiluminescence. The blots were scanned by densitometry. The intensities of the protein bands were analyzed using the public domain NIH Image program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). The pixel intensity of each protein band was normalized against that of the corresponding loading control, which was actin. The relative intensity of the protein band was then obtained from the ratio of the experimental group over the control. GRMO2 Cell Culture and DNA/siRNA Transfection—GRMO2 cells are a mouse granulosa cell line provided by N. V. Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium (59Burkart A.D. Mukherjee A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 2005; 196: 1909-1921Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Culture of GRMO2 cells was performed as described previously in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (59Burkart A.D. Mukherjee A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 2005; 196: 1909-1921Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Three days before transfection, an estrogen-free culture condition was applied that contained a phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 nm sodium selenite, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 50 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 2% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with a mouse ERα promoter-β-galactosidase construct (60Cicatiello L. Cobellis G. Addeo R. Papa M. Altucci L. Sica V. Bresciani F. LeMeur M. Kumar V.L. Chambon P. Weisz A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1077-1090PubMed Google Scholar) (MER II βGAL, kindly provided by Dr. Alessandro Weisz from Seconda Università degli Studi di Napoli, Italy) at a dose of 500 ng DNA per well of a 12-well culture plate using cationic liposomes (59Burkart A.D. Mukherjee A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 2005; 196: 1909-1921Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After 20 h of transfection, fresh medium containing vehicle or various concentrations of activin A was given to the cells for 4 or 24 h followed by cell lysate collection and β-galactosidase assays. For the siRNA study, 250 ng of the mouse ERα promoter-β-galactosidase construct was co-transfected with 100 nm control siRNA or siRNAs targeting Smad2 or 3 (all from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) in a 24-well culture plate. The co-transfection was performed for 24 h using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were then cultured in a phenol red- and serum-free medium for an additional 16-18 h, and cell lysates were collected for β-galactosidase assays. Luciferase Assays and β-Galactosidase Assays—Transfected cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice for 20 min. For luciferase assay, the lysis buffer contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell lysates (100 μl) were added to 400 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), 100 μl of 1 mm luciferin (sodium salt) (Analytical Bioluminescence, San Diego, CA) were added using an automatic injector, and emitted luminescence was measured using a 2010 luminometer (Analytical Bioluminescence) for 10 s. For β-galactosidase assay, a Galacto-Light Plus Systems kit (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. For both assays relative light units were normalized for total protein content measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Immunohistochemistry—Ovaries collected from 19-day-old MT-α inhibin transgenic mice and their NLM were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm serial sections were obtained and mounted on Superfrost-Plus slides (Fisher). Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed using 0.01 m sodium citrate. For ERα detection, tissue sections were incubated overnight with anti-ERα antibody (MC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:50 dilution) followed by overnight incubation with secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:200 dilution), all at 4 °C. Sections were then counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (not shown) and visualized with a fluorescent microscope. For ERβ detection, tissue sections were treated with 3% H2O2 and avidin/biotin blocking reagents (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Tissue sections were then incubated with anti-ERβ antibody (39Dupont S.

https://openalex.org/W2008736686,"Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is promoted by the increased activities of several small GTPases, including K-Ras4B, Rap1A, Rap1B, RhoC, and Rac1. SmgGDS is an unusual guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates many of these small GTPases, and thus may promote NSCLC development or progression. We report here that SmgGDS protein levels are elevated in NSCLC tumors, compared with normal lung tissue from the same patients or from individuals without cancer. To characterize SmgGDS functions in NSCLC, we tested the effects of silencing SmgGDS expression by transfecting cultured NSCLC cells with SmgGDS small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cells with silenced SmgGDS expression form fewer colonies in soft agar, do not proliferate in culture due to an arrest in G(1) phase, and exhibit disrupted myosin organization and reduced cell migration. The transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in NSCLC cells is diminished by transfecting the cells with SmgGDS siRNA, and enhanced by transfecting the cells with a cDNA encoding SmgGDS. Because RhoA is a major substrate for SmgGDS, we investigated whether diminished RhoA expression mimics the effects of diminished SmgGDS expression. Silencing RhoA expression with RhoA siRNA disrupts myosin organization, but only moderately decreases cell proliferation and does not inhibit migration. Our finding that the aggressive NSCLC phenotype is more effectively suppressed by silencing SmgGDS than by silencing RhoA is consistent with the ability of SmgGDS to regulate multiple small GTPases in addition to RhoA. These results demonstrate that SmgGDS promotes the malignant NSCLC phenotype and is an intriguing therapeutic target in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2010450534,"We previously identified the cvfA gene (SA1129) as a novel virulence regulator in Staphylococcus aureus using the silkworm infection model. The cvfA gene, which is conserved among various pathogenic bacteria, contributes to the expression of the agr locus, a global virulence regulator that controls the expression of genes encoding various exoproteins, such as hemolysin. CvfA protein has a transmembrane domain, an RNA binding domain (KH domain), and a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase domain (HD domain). We report here the purification of recombinant CvfA protein from a membrane fraction of Escherichia coli by measuring its phosphodiesterase activity. Purified CvfA protein hydrolyzed the phosphodiester linkage of 2′,3′-cyclic AMP, 2′,3′-cyclic GMP, and 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate at the 3′-terminal of RNA in the presence of Mn2+. CvfA mutant proteins with amino acid substitutions in the HD domain had significantly decreased phosphodiesterase activity. Furthermore, mutated cvfA genes encoding proteins with low phosphodiesterase activity did not complement the decreased hemolysin production or the attenuated killing ability against silkworms in the cvfA deletion mutant. These results suggest that the phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA protein is required for virulence in S. aureus.

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen in humans that causes various diseases, such as localized skin infection, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and toxic shock syndrome (1Crossly K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1997Google Scholar). These diseases are caused by the combination of various virulence factors expressed by S. aureus, which contain cell surface proteins to adhere to host tissues and exotoxins such as hemolysin, protease, and nuclease to destroy host tissues (2Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar, 3Dinges M.M. Orwin P.M. Schlievert P.M. Clin. Microbiol.

Several genes regulate the expression of genes encoding virulence factors in S. aureus, such as the agr locus (5Peng H.L. Novick R.P. Kreiswirth B. Kornblum J. Schlievert P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4365-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 6Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S.

Microbiol. 2001; 41: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These genes are assumed to interact with each other and to regulate the expression of virulence genes. The overall picture of the regulatory cascades, however, is obscure (11Novick R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1429-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Based on our assumption that there are novel virulence regulatory genes among the uncharacterized genes of S. aureus, we screened gene-disrupted mutants using a previously reported silkworm-infection model (12Kaito C. Akimitsu N. Watanabe H. Sekimizu K. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we identified novel virulence genes named cvfA, cvfB, and cvfC, whose mutation resulted in an attenuated killing ability against silkworms (13Kaito C. Kurokawa K. Matsumoto Y. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Matsumoto Y. Kaito C. Morishita D. Kurokawa K. Sekimizu K. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cvfA, cvfB, and cvfC genes are conserved among various pathogenic bacteria, and also contribute to virulence in mice. In S. aureus, the cvfA gene is required for transcriptional expression of the agr locus, and for the production of exotoxins such as hemolysin and protease (13Kaito C. Kurokawa K. Matsumoto Y. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We also identified the sarZ gene, a novel virulence regulator, as a multicopy suppressor of decreased hemolysin production in the cvfA deletion mutant (15Kaito C. Morishita D. Matsumoto Y. Kurokawa K. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1601-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cvfA gene is considered to promote the expression of the sarZ gene, followed by activation of the expression of the agr locus, and to contribute to hemolysin production (15Kaito C. Morishita D. Matsumoto Y. Kurokawa K. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1601-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, under the genetic background of the agr-null mutation, cvfA disruption attenuates virulence in silkworms (13Kaito C. Kurokawa K. Matsumoto Y. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cvfA gene contributes to virulence via both agr-dependent and agr-independent pathways in S. aureus. Thus, CvfA is thought to function upstream of the various virulence regulatory systems. The biochemical features of CvfA protein, however, remained to be determined. In the present study, we purified CvfA protein and determined that it has phosphodiesterase activity that hydrolyzes 2′,3′-cyclic AMP and 2′,3′-cyclic GMP into 3′-AMP and 3′-GMP, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of mutated CvfA proteins with low phosphodiesterase activity suggests that phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA is required for virulence in S. aureus.

The cvfA gene, amplified by PCR using primers FccvfA and RccvfA with RN4220 genomic DNA as a template, was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC119. Using primer pairs for mutagenesis (e.g. FH338A and RH338A) and pUC119-cvfA as the template, mutant strands were synthesized by thermal cycling, and then template plasmid was digested with DpnI. The E. coli JM109 strain was transformed with the synthesized mutated plasmids (pUC119-mutant-cvfA). The plasmids were extracted and sequenced to confirm the desired cvfA point mutation. Using primer pairs FCvfA and RCvfA and the mutated plasmid as the template, PCR amplification was performed.

The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pMN, resulting in pPspac-CvfA and -H338A, -H367A, -D368A, -K371A, and -D423A. Purification of Recombinant CvfA Proteins—E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS was transformed with plasmid pCvfA and grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5. Recombinant CvfA proteins were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), and lysed by sonication. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was washed once with lysis buffer. The resulting pellet was obtained as the membrane fraction (Fraction I). The membrane fraction was resuspended in buffer C′ (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing 1.5% n-octyl glucoside and 0.5 m KCl, and sonicated three times for 15 s (OPC1) using a Branson Sonifier 450, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and a pellet was obtained (Fraction II). The pellet was resuspended in buffer C′ containing 2.5% Tween 20 and sonicated four times for 30 s (OPC2) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the resulting supernatant was obtained as the solubilized fraction (Fraction III). Fraction III was loaded onto a DEAE-toyopearl 650 (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) column (1.5 × 3 cm) preequilibrated with buffer C′ containing 0.5% CHAPS, and washed with buffer C′ containing 0.5% CHAPS and 0.5 m KCl. Phosphodiesterase activity was not detected in the wash fraction. The activity was then eluted with buffer C′ containing 2.5% Tween 20 and 0.5 m KCl (Fraction IV). Fraction IV was dialyzed against the buffer C′ containing 2.5% Tween 20 and loaded onto a MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.8 m KCl. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Fractions I to III containing the various mutated CvfA proteins were prepared in a similar way. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzymatic Assays—Phosphodiesterase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 9.0), 0.6 m KCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and 16 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (bis-pNPP). After 20 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA and the amount of p-nitrophenol produced was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm. Phosphatase activity was measured in a similar way using pNPP as a substrate. Phosphodiesterase activity with natural substrates (various 2′,3′- and 3′,5′-cyclic nucleoside monophosphates from Sigma) was measured as described previously (19Yakunin A.F. Proudfoot M.

CvfA protein and 20 mm cyclic nucleotide were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 9.0), 0.6 m KCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA. The products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on cellulose F plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in solvent A (saturated ammonium sulfate, 3 m sodium acetate, isopropyl alcohol; 80:6:2). The reaction products and the nucleotide standards were visualized under ultraviolet light, and the signal intensity was quantified using Image Gauge software (FUJI PHOTO FILM CO., LTD., Tokyo, Japan). Staphylococcal RNA containing guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate in its 3′-terminal nucleoside ([Np]nG>p*) was prepared as previously described with slight modification (20Tyc K. Kellenberger C. Filipowicz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12994-13000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA prepared from S. aureus RN4220 was digested with 145 units of RNase T1 and the 3′-terminal phosphates were removed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan), followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Resulting oligonucleotides was incubated with [5′-32P]pCp (GE Healthcare) and T4 RNA ligase (TaKaRa Bio) to produce (Np)nGp*Cp. To generate (Np)nG>p*, (Np)nGp*Cp was digested with 1 unit of RNase T1, followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate (Np)nG3′p* generated by RNase T1. The sample was extracted with phenol, and the aqueous phase was applied to a CENTRI-SEP column (Princeton Separations, Inc., NJ) equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.5). The average length of the resulting (Np)nG>p* was 50 bases from urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. CvfA protein and 200 nm (Np)nG>p* were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 9.0), 0.6 m KCl, 1 mm MnCl2, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting products were digested with nuclease P1 (Roche, Germany), separated by TLC as described above, and analyzed by autoradiography. The marker pG>p was prepared by phosphorylating G>p(2′,3′-cyclic GMP) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa Bio), and its position on the TLC plate was detected under ultraviolet light. Construction of the cvfA-deletion Mutant—To construct a targeting vector for disruption of the cvfA gene, the cvfA 5′-arm or 3′-arm DNA fragment, the region located just upstream or downstream of the cvfA gene, respectively, was amplified by PCR with RN4220 genomic DNA as a template, using primers P1 and P2 or P3 and P4, respectively. The marker, phleomycin resistance gene, was amplified by PCR using primers Fphleo and Rphleo with a upp cassette as a template (21Fabret C. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The three amplification DNA fragments were inserted into the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pSF151 in the following order: 5′-arm, phleomycin resistance gene, and 3′-arm, resulting in pSF1129-phleo. A strain resistant to both kanamycin and phleomycin was obtained by transforming the RN4220 strain with pSF1129-phleo. Among these strains, we screened a strain that become sensitive to kanamycin but resistant to phleomycin, resulting in the MP1129 strain, in which the cvfA gene was replaced by the phleomycin resistance gene. Disruption of the cvfA gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using the PCR-amplified fragment, ranging from the cvfA coding region to the 3′-arm, as a probe. To construct the cvfA-deletion mutant in the NCTC8325-4 strain, namely CKP1129, phage transduction was performed as described previously (22Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Phage 80α lysates of the MP1129 strain were used to infect NCTC8325-4. Similarly, plasmids were transferred to recipient strains by phage transduction. Hemolytic Activity Assay—Hemolytic activity was measured using the previously described method (23Vandenesch F. Kornblum J. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6313-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, a supernatant of the culture at 18 h after inoculation was incubated with sheep red blood cells at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min) and the increase in the A450 of the supernatant was determined. The hemolytic activity was expressed as hemolytic units corresponding to the reciprocal of the dilution of supernatant that yielded 50% lysis of the erythrocytes. Silkworm Infection Experiment—The silkworm infection experiment was performed according to the previously established method (13Kaito C. Kurokawa K. Matsumoto Y. Terao Y. Kawabata S. Hamada S. Sekimizu K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Silkworms were raised from fertilized eggs to fifth-instar larvae in our laboratory. The hatched fifth-instar larvae were fed antibiotic-free artificial food (Silkmate, Katakura Industries, Japan) for 1 day. Bacterial suspensions (0.05 ml, 4 × 107 colony forming units) were injected into the hemolymph of the larvae through the dorsal surface using a 27-gauge needle (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Overnight S. aureus cultures in the tryptic soy broth containing 0.5 mm IPTG were diluted appropriately with saline containing 10 mm IPTG and used for the experiments. The injected larvae were maintained without food in a safety cabinet (BHC-1303IIA; Airtech Japan, Tokyo, Japan) at 27 °C with 50% humidity. The larvae were injected 10 mm IPTG (0.05 ml) every 24 h and survival was monitored. Purification of CvfA Protein from E. coli Membrane—CvfA protein has a transmembrane domain, an RNA binding domain (KH domain), and metal-dependent phosphohydrolase domain (HD domain) (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence of the CvfA HD domain is conserved among various pathogenic bacteria. In particular, there is a greater than 99% sequence identity of the consensus residues that are considered to be important for the phosphohydrolase activity (Fig. 1B) (24Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 25Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Dow J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that CvfA protein has phosphohydrolase activity, and attempted to purify the recombinant CvfA protein by measuring this activity. First, we lysed E. coli expressing S. aureus CvfA protein by sonication, and prepared the membrane fraction. In the membrane fraction prepared from E. coli expressing CvfA, the hydrolysis activity against bis-pNPP, an artificial phosphodiesterase substrate, was 1.7-fold higher than that of E. coli not expressing CvfA (Fig. 2A). By tracing this phosphodiesterase activity, we performed purification of CvfA protein (Table 3). E. coli membrane fraction (Fraction I) was suspended in a buffer containing 1.5% n-octyl glucoside and centrifuged. The insoluble fraction (Fraction II) contained 67% of the activity. The activity of Fraction II prepared from E. coli transformed with an empty vector was less than 5% of that transformed with the CvfA-expression vector (Fig. 2A). Fraction II was then solubilized with 2.5% Tween 20, and the resulting supernatant contained 66% of the activity of Fraction II. The solubilized fraction (Fraction III) was subjected to DEAE-toyopearl column chromatography, and the enzyme activity was eluted by KCl (Fraction IV). The active fraction was subjected to MonoQ column chromatography. The recovered activity was 24% that of the starting membrane fraction of E. coli. The specific activity increased 23-fold (Table 3). The final fraction (Fraction V) gave a single band with a molecular mass of 59 kDa, which is the estimated size of the CvfA protein, on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). The final step of MonoQ chromatography revealed that the phosphodiesterase activity co-migrated with the CvfA protein (Fig. 2, C and D). Based on these results, we concluded that CvfA protein was purified as a phosphodiesterase.TABLE 3Purification of recombinant CvfA proteinFractionProteinTotal activityYieldSpecific activitymg×10–2 μmol/min%×10–2 μmol/min/mgIMembrane25351001.4II1.5% OGaOG, n-octyl-glucoside-washed membrane7.823.3673.0III2.5% Tween 20 solubilized2.315.5446.8IVDEAE-toyopearl column1.0818.45317.1VMonoQ column0.378.392422.9a OG, n-octyl-glucoside Open table in a new tab Biochemical Characterization of Phosphodiesterase Activity of CvfA Protein—Some enzymes possessing the HD domain not only has phosphodiesterase activity but also phosphatase activity (19Yakunin A.F.

When CvfA was incubated with a phosphodiesterase substrate (bis-pNPP), p-nitrophenol was produced in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, when CvfA was incubated with a phosphatase substrate (pNPP), p-nitrophenol was not produced (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that CvfA does not have phosphatase activity. Scatchard plot analysis demonstrated that the Km value of the hydrolysis activity of CvfA against bis-pNPP was 30 mm and the kcat was 0.7/s (Fig. 3B, Table 4). CvfA phosphodiesterase activity requires Mn2+ or Ni2+ (Fig. 3C), and the optimal pH was 9.0 in buffer containing 1 mm Mn2+ (data not shown).TABLE 4Kinetic parameters of phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA proteinSubstratesKmVmaxkcatμmμmol/min/mg/sBis-pNPP30,0000.750.732′,3′-cAMP17,0000.930.912′,3′-cGMP15,0000.380.37(Np)nG>p*1.11.5 × 10–31.4 × 10–3 Open table in a new tab Phosphodiesterase Activity with Natural Substrates—To determine the natural compounds hydrolyzed by CvfA, we examined whether CvfA has phosphohydrolase activity against cyclic nucleotides, which are known substrates of phosphodiesterase that contain the HD domain (19Yakunin A.F. Proudfoot M. Kuznetsova E. Savchenko A. Brown G. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36819-36827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CvfA was incubated with various cyclic nucleotides and the reaction products were analyzed by TLC. When CvfA was incubated with 2′,3′-cAMP, 3′-AMP was produced (Fig. 4A). Similarly, incubation with 2′,3′-cGMP produced 3′-GMP (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, when CvfA was incubated with 3′,5′-cAMP, 3′,5′-cGMP, or 2′,3′-cCMP, the hydrolyzed products were not detected (Fig. 4, A–C). These results suggest that CvfA has phosphodiesterase activity against 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP; but not 3′,5′-cAMP, 3′,5′-cGMP, and 2′,3′-cCMP. As with bis-pNPP, CvfA phosphodiesterase activity against 2′,3′-cAMP requires Mn2+ or Ni2+ (data not shown). Scatchard plot analysis demonstrated that the Km value of the hydrolysis activity of CvfA against 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP was 17 and 15 mm, respectively (Fig. 4, D and E, Table 4). In bacteria, di-cGMP is used as a signaling molecule to regulate various cellular functions including virulence (27Romling U. Gomelsky M. Galperin M.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Di-cGMP is hydrolyzed by enzymes possessing the HD domain (26Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Crossman L.C. Spiro S. He Y.W. Zhang L.H. Heeb S. Camara M. Williams P. Dow J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), but CvfA did not hydrolyze di-cGMP (data not shown). Phosphodiesterase Activity against 2′,3′-Cyclic Nucleotide Structure at the 3′-Terminal of RNA—The 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide is produced at the 3′-terminal of RNA when cleaved by endonucleases. Because CvfA protein has an RNA binding domain (KH domain), we hypothesized that CvfA hydrolyzes the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester linkage at the 3′-terminal of RNA. CvfA was incubated with RNA containing guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate in its 3′-terminal nucleoside ([Np]nG>p*), and the products were digested with nuclease P1 and analyzed by cellulose TLC. In the presence of CvfA, the contents of pG>p* were decreased to 86% of the control (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, labeled free phosphate, which was produced by nuclease P1 from (Np)nG3′p*, an estimated hydrolyzed product of (Np)nG>p*, was increased. These results suggest that CvfA has phosphodiesterase activity against the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide structure at the 3′-terminal of RNA. Scatchard plot analysis demonstrated that the Km value of the hydrolysis activity of CvfA against (Np)nG>p* was 1.1 μm (Fig. 5B, Table 4). Phosphodiesterase Activity of CvfA Proteins with Mutation in the HD Domain—To determine the CvfA structure required for the phosphodiesterase activity, we focused on the consensus residues of the HD domain (Fig. 1B, magenta and green). Among these, the residues corresponding to His367 and Asp368 were important for the phosphohydrolase activity of the HD domain-possessing enzymes, such as the RpfG family response regulator, tRNA-nucleotidyltransferase, and phosphodiesterase type 5 (19Yakunin A.F.

Regarding His367, Asp368, and other conserved residues among various pathogenic bacteria (His338, Lys371, and Asp423), we constructed amino acid-substituted CvfA proteins. They were expressed in E. coli and corresponding Fractions I and III of the mutants were prepared as well as wild-type CvfA. In Fractions I and III prepared from E. coli expressing these CvfA mutant proteins, the phosphodiesterase activity against bis-pNPP was lower than that in wild-type (Fraction I, data not shown; Fraction III, Fig. 6). The presence of the mutant CvfA proteins in these fractions was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the conserved residues in the HD domain of CvfA (His338, His367, Asp368, Lys371, and Asp423) are required for the phosphodiesterase activity. Hemolysin Production by the CvfA Mutant Proteins in S. aureus Cells—To examine whether the phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA is required for the hemolysin production in S. aureus cells, we studied whether the expression of the CvfA mutant proteins can complement the decreased hemolysin production in the cvfA-deletion mutant. The expression of wild-type CvfA protein under the control of the IPTG inducible promoter restored hemolysin production in the cvfA-deletion mutant, MP1129, in an IPTG-dependent manner (data not shown). In contrast, the expression of CvfA mutant proteins (H338A, H367A, D368A, K371A, and D423A) did not restore hemolysin production in the M1129 strain. These results suggest that CvfA mutant proteins with decreased phosphodiesterase activity are not functional for hemolysin production in S. aureus. The RN4220 strain is mutagenized by nitrosoguanidine exposure (5Peng H.L. Novick R.P. Kreiswirth B. Kornblum J. Schlievert P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4365-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 28Traber K. Novick R. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There might be some uncharacterized mutations that affect the function of the cvfA gene product in hemolysin production. Therefore, we examined whether the CvfA mutant proteins complement decreased hemolysin production in the cvfA deletion mutant, in a non-mutagenized strain, NCTC8325-4. Disruption of the cvfA gene in NCTC8325-4 induced a decrease in hemolysin production (Fig. 7). In this cvfA-deletion mutant, the expression of wild-type CvfA protein restored hemolysin production in an IPTG-dependent manner (Fig. 7). In contrast, the expression of CvfA mutant proteins (H338A, H367A, D368A, K371A, and D423A) did not restore hemolysin production. These results suggest that CvfA mutant proteins with decreased phosphodiesterase activity are not functional for hemolysin production in both RN4220 and NCTC8325-4. Thus, phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA is required for hemolysin production in S. aureus cells. Complementation Activities by CvfA Mutant Proteins against the Attenuated Virulence in cvfA-deletion Mutant—Next, we studied whether the expression of the CvfA mutant proteins can complement the attenuated virulence in the cvfA-deletion mutant using a silkworm-infection model. The expression of wild-type CvfA protein restored the silkworm killing ability of the cvfA-deletion mutant (Fig. 8). In contrast, the expression of CvfA mutant proteins (H338A, H367A, D368A, K371A, and D423A) did not restore the silkworm killing ability of the cvfA-deletion mutant (Fig. 8). In the absence of IPTG, more than 50 h was required for all the cvfA-deletion mutants possessing each expression vector to kill half of the silkworms (data not shown). These results suggest that the expression of the CvfA mutant proteins with decreased phosphodiesterase activity cannot complement the attenuated virulence in the cvfA-deletion mutant. Thus, phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA is required for virulence in S. aureus. In this paper, we demonstrated that CvfA protein has phosphodiesterase activity. CvfA mutant proteins in which the consensus amino acid residues of the HD domain were substituted had reduced phosphodiesterase activity, and its expression in S. aureus cvfA-deletion mutant did not complement the decreased hemolysin production and the attenuated virulence against silkworms. Therefore, we concluded that phosphodiesterase activity of CvfA is required for virulence in S. aureus. CvfA has phosphodiesterase activity against 2′,3′-cAMP and 2′,3′-cGMP. Although many organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes have some phosphodiesterases against the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide, its physiological role is not well understood. The present study is the first report suggesting that phosphodiesterase against the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide functions in bacterial virulence. The 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide is produced at the 3′-terminal of the RNA when cleaved by endonuclease. Many functional RNAs, such as tRNA and small RNA, are produced by the cleavage of pre-RNA. If the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide structure at the 3′-end of RNA is not converted to the 3′-phosphate or 3′-OH form, the following RNA processing such as degradation or addition of nucleotides cannot occur (29Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30Kennell D. J.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is possible that the enzyme hydrolyzing the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide acts on such RNA processing. For example, E. coli tRNA-nucleotidyltransferase, an enzyme possessing the HD domain, is assumed to process tRNA 3′-terminal by hydrolyzing the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester linkage (19Yakunin A.F. Proudfoot M. Kuznetsova E. Savchenko A. Brown G. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36819-36827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CvfA has an RNA binding domain (KH domain), and hydrolyzes the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester linkage at the 3′-terminal of Staphylococcal RNA. The Km value of the CvfA phosphodiesterase activity against (Np)nG>p* was 1.1 μm, which was extremely low compared with that against the mononucleotide G>p. From these results, we assume that CvfA binds to a specific RNA via its KH domain, and hydrolyzes the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester linkage at the 3′-terminal of the target RNA, and regulate virulence. Such a virulence regulatory system has not been previously described. It is now evident that di-cGMP works as a second messenger in bacteria regulating many cellular functions, including virulence. In Salmonella enterica var. typhimurium and Vibrio cholerae, factors involved in di-cGMP hydrolysis are required for the expression of virulence factor and survival in mice (33Hisert K.B. MacCoss M. Shiloh M.U. Darwin K.H. Singh S. Jones R.A. Ehrt S. Zhang Z. Gaffney B.L. Gandotra S. Holden D.W. Murray D. Nathan C. Mol.

In Xanthomonas campestris, RpfG, an enzyme with the HD domain and hydrolysis activity against di-cGMP, is required for expressing the toxin (26Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Crossman L.C. Spiro S.

On the other hand, CvfA did not have hydrolysis activity against di-cGMP. Therefore, it is thought that the target molecule regulated by CvfA phosphodiesterase activity is not a di-cGMP. Further studies are needed to determine the target molecule hydrolyzed by CvfA. CvfA has a transmembrane domain and its phosphodiesterase activity was recovered from the membrane fraction of E. coli expressing CvfA. In Bacillus subtilis, ymdA, a homologous gene of cvfA, is localized at the membrane based on analysis using green fluorescent protein fusion protein (36Hunt A. Rawlins J.P. Thomaides H.B. Errington J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 2895-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There are some known systems by which membrane-bound factors convey the extracellular information to the intracellular signal network: the two-component system in which the signal is transmitted by phosphorylation of the transcription factor, and the σE system in which the signal is transmitted by degradation of proteins (9Yarwood J.M. McCormick J.K. Schlievert P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10Fournier B. Klier A. Rapoport G. Mol.

Similar to these systems, CvfA might transmit the signal in response to the extracellular information and regulate virulence at the membrane. Elucidating the CvfA virulence regulatory system would contribute to the understanding of an important signaling pathway commonly utilized by many pathogenic bacteria. We thank Drs. T. J. Foster, K. Hiramatsu, and N. Ogasawara for kindly providing bacterial strains and plasmids."

Nmyc ectopic expression is sufficient to promote cell autonomous proliferation and can lead to tumorigenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) antagonizes Shh proliferative effect by promoting cell cycle exit and differentiation in CGNPs. Here we report that BMP2 opposes Shh mitogenic activity by blocking Nmyc expression. We have identified TIEG-1 (KLF10) as the intermediary factor that blocks Nmyc expression through the occupancy of the Sp1 sites present in its promoter. We also demonstrate that TIEG-1 ectopic expression in CGNPs induces cell cycle arrest that can lead to apoptosis but fails to promote differentiation. Moreover, TIEG-1 synergizes with BMP2 activity to terminally differentiate CGNPs and independent differentiator signals such as dibutyryl cAMP and prevents apoptosis in TIEG-1 arrested cells. All together, these data strongly suggest that the BMP2 pathway triggers cell cycle exit and differentiation as two separated but coordinated processes, where TIEG-1 acts as a mediator of the cell cycle arrest.

Along cerebellum development, CGNPs become postmitotic and migrate through the Purkinje cells setting forth the three layered cerebellar cortex (1Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Annu. Rev.

Clonal expansion of CGNPs is achieved by the mitogenic activity of Shh (Sonic hedgehog) signaling emanating from the Purkinje cells to the external germinal layer (4Dahmane N. Ruiz i Altaba A.

Shh transduces its signal through the Ptc (Patched) and Smo (Smoothened) receptor complex. The pathway is negatively regulated through a series of PKA, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and casein kinase phosphorylations of the GLI/Ci transcription factors Gli2/3. This phosphorylation targets Gli2/3 to the proteasome, where it is truncated by removing its transactivation domain; it becomes a potent transcriptional repressor of the pathway. In the presence of Shh, however, PKA activity is blocked, and Gli2/3 acts as a transcriptional activator (6Lum L. Beachy P.A.

The deregulation of several components of the Shh pathway leads to tumorigenesis. On one hand, the receptor Ptc and SuFu (Suppressor of Fused) act as tumor suppressors, and inactivating mutations of both genes can be found in medulloblastomas (8Xie J. Johnson R.L. Zhang X.

Nmyc is a member of the Myc family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, implicated in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. In contrast to c-Myc, which is expressed in virtually all proliferating cells, Nmyc presents a more restricted pattern of expression, although both transcription factors are functionally replaceable (13Malynn B.A. de Alboran I.M.

In the cerebellum, Nmyc is transiently expressed during development showing a pattern restricted to proliferative zones (15Hirning U. Schmid P. Schulz W.A. Rettenberger G. Hameister H. Mech.

Overexpression of Nmyc is associated with several neuroectodermal tumors including medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, and small cell lung carcinoma (16Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Eggleston J.

Finding signals capable of terminating Shh-mediated proliferation of CGNPs would contribute not only to the knowledge on normal cerebellum development but also to the understanding of medulloblastoma formation. So far, only a few inhibitors of Shh pathway have been reported. For instance, cyclopamine, which directly impairs Smo activity, and activators of PKA such as dibutyryl cAMP (DBA), forskolin, or the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (22Noveen A. Jiang T.X. Chuong C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Nicot A. Lelievre V. Tam J. Waschek J.A. DiCicco-Bloom E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9244-9254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it is very likely that the vitronectin-induced inhibition of Shh reported by our group (24Pons S. Trejo J.L. Martinez-Morales J.R. Marti E. Development. 2001; 128: 1481-1492PubMed Google Scholar) was also mediated by PKA, because a consistent elevation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation was observed. We recently also reported the powerful anti-mitotic activity mediated by BMP2 in Shh-stimulated CGNPs (25Rios I. Alvarez-Rodriguez R. Marti E. Pons S. Development. 2004; 131: 3159-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As we demonstrate in the present work, this inhibition is absolutely independent of PKA activity, constituting a novel mechanism of inhibition of the Shh pathway. BMP2 belongs to the TGFβ family of cytokines (26Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4156) Google Scholar, 27Shi Y. Massague J.

Phosphorylation of Smads causes conformational changes that allow the heteromerization of Smad1/5/8 with Smad4, the unique member common to the BMP and TGFβ pathways, acting as a transcriptional activators or repressors (for review see Refs. 26Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4156) Google Scholar, 27Shi Y. Massague J.

There are several proteins known to be direct targets of the BMP pathway such as the Ids (inhibitor of differentiation) or the TIEG-1 (TGFβ early inducible gene-1) (30Hollnagel A. Oehlmann V.

The mechanism by which BMP2 opposes Shh-induced proliferation of CGNPs remains unknown, although it has been reported that TGFβs acts over proliferating cells using multiple and coordinated mechanisms including down-regulation of c-Myc and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15ink4B (33Feng X.H.

Miyazono K. Kato M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 854-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been described that TIEG-1 activity promotes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on the cell context (35Hefferan T.E. Reinholz G.G. Rickard D.J. Johnsen S.A. Waters K.M.

Here we report that Nmyc down-regulation is the critical event by which BMP2 counteracts Shh-induced proliferation of CGNPs. Furthermore, we show that TIEG-1 plays a central role on transcriptional repression of Nmyc by occupying Sp1 activator sites within Nmyc promoter. Additionally we show that overexpression of TIEG-1 promotes cell cycle arrest in CGNPs and that in the absence of coordinated differentiator signals, this arrest can lead to apoptosis. In the present work we propose a model in which BMP2 action on proliferating CGNPs can be dissected in two separated components, one anti-proliferative and another one pro-differentiative, where TIEG-1 appears to be the main effector of the anti-mitotic branch. Additional components of the BMP2 pathway appear to be required for a terminal neuronal differentiation. Cerebellar Granule Cell Culture, Viral Infection, and Transfection—Cerebellar cultures and plate coating were performed using a procedure described before (25Rios I. Alvarez-Rodriguez R. Marti E. Pons S. Development. 2004; 131: 3159-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For retroviral infection, the cells were plated in absence of Shh and incubated with the retrovirus for 2 h. Then the medium was replaced with or without Shh. After 24 h, different treatments were applied. For ordinary transfection experiments, the cells were allowed to rest for 24 h in the presence of Shh and then transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 12 or 24 h of the transfection, fresh medium was added, and different treatments were applied. Turnover experiment were performed pulsing cells with cycloheximide for the indicated periods of time in the presence of Shh or Shh with BMP2. RNA Preparation, Retro-Transcription, and Real Time PCR Analysis—The cells were incubated in the presence of Shh (3 μg/ml) or Shh with BMP2 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time with or without cycloheximide in 100-mm tissue culture dishes containing 8 × 106 cells. Total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol method (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis was primed with 250 ng of random primers using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed in a iCyclerIQ Multicolor real time PCR detection system from Bio-Rad using the IQ SYBR GREEN Supermix from the same supplier. PCR program consisted of 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min plus 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. The data were then analyzed with the ΔΔCt method with Microsoft Excel. The primer sequences used were TIEG fw, 5′-CCG GAG AAG AAC CCA CAT AA-3′; TIEG rv, 5′-GAG GAA GGC ACA GCA AAG TC-3′; Nmyc fw, 5′-ATC ACT GTA CGC CCC AAG AC-3′; Nmyc rv, 5′-CCT TTG GTG GAA CGA CAC TT-3′; Gli1 fw, 5′-TTC CAT ATC AGA GCC CCA AG-3′; Gli1 rv, 5′-GAA GGG GCA GGA TAG GAG AC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fw, 5′-CCC CCA ATG TAT CCG TTG TG-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase rv, 5′-TAG CCC AGG ATG CCC TTT AGT-3′. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For Western blot analysis cell cultures were lysed after treatments in 1× SDS loading buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and the DNA was disrupted by sonication. The samples were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 8% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (150 mm NaCl, 0.05 Tween 20, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and probed with the different antibodies. The blots were developed using anti-rabbit coupled peroxidase plus the ECL system and captured with Versadoc Imaging System from Bio-Rad. The digital images were then quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation 6-well dishes were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and after sonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-Nmyc antibody (BD Biosciences). Antigen-antibody complexes were collected with anti-mouse agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Then beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl) and boiled with 2× SDS loading buffer. The samples were resolved with a 7% SDS-PAGE and proceeded as described above. Antibodies and Chemicals—Monoclonal anti-Nmyc was purchased from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies anti-GFAP, anti-β-tubulin-III, anti-O4, and biotinylated anti-BrdUrd were obtained from Chemicon. Anti-GFP was purchased from Molecular Probes. Monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Anti-actin was purchased from Santa Cruz. Antibodies against the phosphorylated Tyr-15 of cdc2 and Ser-807 of retinoblastoma were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. For immunocytochemical analysis, fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and anti-mouse Alexa 594 were used, both of them purchased from Molecular Probes. For immunoblotting anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase-conjugated were obtained from Jackson. The amino-terminal fragment of Shh was produced as a histidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified using a nickel column according to manufacturer instructions (Qiagen). BMP2 was kindly provided by Genetic Institute. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and MG-132, a reversible proteasome inhibitor, were purchased from Calbiochem. Retroviral Constructs and Packaging—Retroviral vector pWZL-IRES-GFP was cotransfected with gagpol plasmid and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein vector into 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen) in the presence of G-418. One day after transfection, the medium was washed twice with PBS and replaced with fresh medium to harvest virus. The supernatants were collected every 24 h during 1 week, then pooled, and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. The supernatants were stored at 4 °C for 2 months. To determine the titer of each lentiviral construct, collected supernatants were applied to a 293T cell line, and GFP-positive cells were counted after 24 h. Similar titers of each construct were applied to cerebellar granular cells. Plasmid Constructs—TIEG-1 cDNA was kindly gifted by Thomas C. Spelsberg and subcloned into a modified version of pWPI lentiviral vector provided by Dr. Didier. TIEG-1 and its variants such as TIEG-VP16 and the mutant inactive form R440W were generated by PCR mutagenesis and subcloned into pCIG, which contains an IRES-3xNLS-GFP. Gli1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Hui and was subcloned into pWZL-IRES-eGFP (Jay P. Morganstern, Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). Smoothened M2 mutant was obtained from Frederic J. de Sauvage and the dominant negative form of PKA was from Elisa Marti, and both of them were cloned into the lentiviral vector. Nmyc pWZL-IRES-eGFP was kindly provided by Dr. A. M. Kenney. Nmyc promoter was provided by Dr. William L. Carroll and subcloned into pGL3 vector (Clontech). Directional deletions of the Nmyc promoter were performed using a Exonuclease III/S1 nuclease protocol as previous described (38Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar). Mutant variants of the Nmyc promoter were done using standard PCR mutagenesis. Immunocytochemistry—For BrdUrd incorporation assay, the cells were pulsed with 24 ng/ml of BrdUrd 4 h prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with methanol for 5 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 10 min with DNase I in a DNase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2). DNase was washed once with PBS, and the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. For deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, the fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with TdT and a biotin-labeled nucleotide, washed, and developed with streptavidin-Alexa-488. For triple staining procedure, a previous immunocytochemistry with anti-GFAP/anti-β-tubulin-III/anti-O4 developed with anti-mouse Alexa-594 and anti-rabbit Alexa-488 was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with biotinylated anti-BrdUrd and developed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase plus DAB. All of the images were captured with a Colorview digital camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Flow Cytometry of Cultured Cerebellar Granular Cells—The cells were incubated with Shh for 24 h and pulsed at different periods of time with BMP2. The cells were then washed with PBS and trypsinized in the presence of DNase. Trypsinization was stopped with 10% of fetal bovine serum. Then the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS, and 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde was slowly added and incubated for 15 min. PFA was blocked with 1vol of PBS containing 10% of FBS and 0.1% Triton-X-100 and washed again with the same buffer. Finally, RNase A and propidium iodide were added, and the samples were analyzed with a flow cytometer, and the data were plotted and quantified with WinMDI 2.9. Nonradioactive Band Shift Assay—COS-7 cells were electroporated with FLAG-TIEG-1 pCIG, pCIG alone and incubated for 24 h. After that, the cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and incubated for 15 min in an hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Then Nonidet P-40 was added to 1% final concentration, and the cells were vortexed and centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing nucleus was incubated in an hypertonic buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) under vigorous shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. Then the nuclei were pelleted again for 15 min at 13,000 rpm, and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Probes from the Nmyc promoter were amplified by PCR from the original promoter and labeled with TdT using a biotin-11-dUTP. Additional purification of the biotinylated probe was performed with an agarose gel. Nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min with the biotinylated probe at room temperature in a binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 2 units of poly(dI·dC), 0.05% of Nonidet P-40, and 50 μm ZnCl2. The samples were separated with a 4% acrylamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA gel, prerun for 2 h. Once the gel was resolved, it was electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA for 30 min and cross-linked for 3 min with a 302-nm UV lamp. The membrane was then processed with a standard Western blot protocol with an streptavidin-peroxidase reactive. Reporter Assay—Nmyc promoter -875/+169 cloned into the pGL3 reporter plasmid, and its deletions were transfected in 293T cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfection efficiency was normalized with a cotransfected cytomegalovirus-Renilla vector. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were lysed with a buffer containing 2.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The lysates were collected and measured with an Orion II Microplate Luminometer from Berthold using the reagents previously described (39Dyer B.W. Ferrer F.A. Klinedinst D.K. Rodriguez R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The luciferase data were normalized to the Renilla values, and the results were plotted and expressed in arbitrary units as the means and standard deviations of three experiments. BMP2 Decreases Nmyc Levels in CGNPs, Resulting in Cell Cycle Exit and Differentiation—During the development of the cerebellum, Shh activity is required for the expansion of the CGNPs, but its signal is not sustained anymore during the subsequent steps of cell cycle exit and differentiation (4Dahmane N. Ruiz i Altaba A. Development. 1999; 126: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lewis P.M. Gritli-Linde A. Smeyne R. Kottmann A. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The addition of Shh to CGNPs cultures maintained these cells cycling in an undifferentiated state. Otherwise cells differentiate (5Wechsler-Reya R.J. Scott M.P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Shh signal increases proliferative markers such as BrdUrd incorporation, Tyr(P)-15-cdc2, and Ser(P)-807-Rb (Fig. 1, A and B). The addition of BMP2, however, overcomes Shh proliferative action (25Rios I. Alvarez-Rodriguez R. Marti E. Pons S. Development. 2004; 131: 3159-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with the concomitant decrease of these cell cycle markers revealed by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). We next tested how BMP2 treatment modulates cell cycle phase distribution to discard any possible effect of BMP2 on apoptosis or anomalous cell cycle arrest within the S or G2/M phase. CGNPs treated with BMPs were analyzed by flow cytometry at different time points, confirming that cells are progressively arrested at G0/G1 with no increase on apoptosis (Fig. 1C). These data, together with the fact that BMP2 increases differentiation markers such as tubulin β-III (25Rios I. Alvarez-Rodriguez R. Marti E. Pons S. Development. 2004; 131: 3159-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), indicated that cell cycle exit induced by BMP2 conduces to terminal neuronal differentiation rather than to apoptotic cell death. Shh mitogenic activity acts through the up-regulation of Gli1 and Nmyc (11Oliver T.G. Grasfeder L.L. Carroll A.L. Kaiser C. Gillingham C.L. Lin S.M. Wickramasinghe R. Scott M.P. Wechsler-Reya R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Kenney A.M. Cole M.D. Rowitch D.H. Development. 2003; 130: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next decided to determine whether BMP2 regulated Gli1 and Nmyc mRNA levels. CGNPs cultures treated with Shh or Shh plus BMP2 were analyzed by Real time PCR with specific primers for Gli1 and Nmyc. The results showed a remarkable decrease in mRNA levels of both oncogenes 24 h after the treatment (Fig. 2A). Notably, Nmyc down-regulation was already detected as soon as 12 h after the BMP2 pulse, whereas Gli1 decrease was only evident at 24 h, thus suggesting either a more direct and/or a more efficient regulation of Nmyc transcription. In agreement, Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease of Nmyc protein levels that could be already detected 12 h after the BMP2 addition (Fig. 2B). Together these data suggested that BMP2 antagonize Shh by down-regulating Nmyc and prompted us to ask whether Nmyc overexpression was sufficient to suppress the effect of BMP2 on Shh-stimulated CGNPs. Nmyc Overexpression Overcomes BMP2 Antiproliferative Effect in CGNPs—To determine the level at which BMP2 counteracts Shh-induced proliferation, we first studied the effect of BMP2 on CGNPs cultures that were overexpressing different components of Shh, from the most upstream to the most downstream known members of the Shh pathway. Shh acts through the Ptc (Patched) and Smo (Smoothened) receptor complex that initiates a cascade of poorly understood events that give rise to the inhibition of PKA activity and thus the migration of Gli2/3 to the nucleus in its active form to activate the transcription of Gli1 and Nmyc (6Lum L. Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Activating mutations of Smoothened (SmoM2) or a dominant negative form of PKA (dnPKA) fully recapitulated Shh responses in vivo in the developing CNS (41Hynes M. Ye W. Wang K. Stone D. Murone M. Sauvage F. Rosenthal A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 42Epstein D.J. Marti E. Scott M.P. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 12: 2885-2894Google Scholar). Furthermore, forced expression of Nmyc or Gli1 (11Oliver T.G. Grasfeder L.L. Carroll A.L. Kaiser C. Gillingham C.L. Lin S.M. Wickramasinghe R. Scott M.P. Wechsler-Reya R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Development. 2003; 130: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) is sufficient to sustain CGNP proliferation. CGNPs cultures were infected with SmoM2, dnPKA, Gli1 and Nmyc and grown in the absence of Shh for 48 h. The cultures were then treated with BMP2 for an additional 48 h and pulsed with BrdUrd 4 h prior to fixation. Retroviral infection of the"

Whereas p42 exclusively resides in the cytoplasm, p48 localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Here, we show that Ebp1 forms a complex with B23, and this complex plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival. p42 specifically associates with B23 upon epidermal growth factor stimulation, while p48 constantly binds B23. Moreover, Ser360 phosphorylation in p42, but not p48, is critical for the interaction. p48 constitutively binds B23 in the nucleolus, for which B23 Lys263 sumoylation is indispensable. By contrast, p42 selectively binds unsumoylated B23 mutants. Interestingly, B23 K263R, an unsumoylated mutant, triggers p42 nuclear translocation and interacts with it in the nucleus even in the absence of epidermal growth factor. In contrast, the nucleolar residency of p48 is abolished in B23 K263R cells. During the cell cycle, p42 selectively colocalizes with B23 in the mitotic cells, correlating with its phosphorylation status in mitosis. Knocking down of B23 or Ebp1 substantially decreases ribosome biogenesis and cell survival. Thus, B23 distinctively binds Ebp1 isoforms and regulates cell proliferation and survival through p42 and p48, respectively. Ebp1 and NPM/B23 are essential for cell proliferation and survival.

Knocking down of B23 or Ebp1 substantially decreases ribosome biogenesis and cell survival. Thus, B23 distinctively binds Ebp1 isoforms and regulates cell proliferation and survival through p42 and p48, respectively. Ebp1, a member of the PA2G4 family of proliferation-regulated proteins, was initially identified as an ErbB3-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen searching for the binding partners for the cytoplasmic region of ErbB3 (1Yoo J.Y.

Overexpression of Ebp1 inhibits the growth of human breast and prostate cancer cells and induces cellular differentiation (2Lessor T.J. Yoo J.Y. Xia X. Woodford N. Hamburger A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), probably through repressing transcription of both E2F1 and androgen receptor-regulated genes (3Zhang Y. Woodford N. Xia X.

Hamburger A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ebp1 also binds to the E2F1 promoter in a complex with the E2F1 transcription factor and Rb, which is regulated by the ErbB3 ligand heregulin (7Zhang Y. Hamburger A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26126-26133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that EBP1 acts as a nucleolar growth-regulating protein linking between ribosome biosynthesis and cell proliferation. For instance, EBP1 overexpression inhibits proliferation of human fibroblasts, and this effect is coupled to its nucleolar localization (8Squatrito M. Mancino M. Donzelli M. Areces L.B. Draetta G.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4454-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ebp1 is a part of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and contains a dsRBD that mediates its interaction with dsRNA. Deletion of the Ebp1 dsRBD impairs its localization to the nucleolus and its ability to form RNP complexes (8Squatrito M. Mancino M. Donzelli M. Areces L.B. Draetta G.F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4454-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, Ebp1 is associated with mature ribosomes and that it is able to inhibit the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α). Ebp1 overexpression prevents eIF2α from phosphorylation, suggesting that it could be involved in protein translation control (9Squatrito M. Mancino M. Sala L. Draetta G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, we show that Ebp1 promotes cell survival by preventing apoptotic DNA fragmentation through a complex with active nuclear Akt, which is regulated by Ebp1 phosphorylation via PKCδ (10Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Liu Z. Pereira L. Cheng D. Peng J. Wade P.A. Hamburger A.W. Ye K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2083-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ebp1 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cells with two mRNA transcripts ∼2.2 kb and 1.7 kb in size that encode two different alternatively spliced isoforms, p48 and p42, which differentially mediate PC12 cell survival and differentiation. p42 mRNA skips an exon consisting of 29 nucleotides, which contains 2nd ATG in p48 mRNA. Thus, p42 protein translation is initiated from the 3rd ATG. Although the two mRNA transcripts concentrations are comparable, in many mammalian cells, p48 is predominant form and p42 is barely detectable (1Yoo J.Y. Wang X.W. Rishi A.K. Lessor T. Xia X.M. Gustafson T.A. Hamburger A.W. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Liu Z. Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Ye K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10917-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism suppressing p42 protein level remains unknown. p48 that is 54 amino acids longer than p42 in the N terminus localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and suppresses apoptosis, whereas the shorter form p42 predominantly resides in the cytoplasm and promotes cell differentiation.

By contrast, p48 does not bind to ErbB3 regardless of EGF treatment. Moreover, nerve growth factor (NGF) elicits extensive sprouting in p42 stably transfected PC12 cells, whereas p48 cells reveal modest neurite outgrowth (11Liu Z. Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Ye K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10917-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

Chromosoma. 1988; 96: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). B23 is implicated in ribosome biogenesis and cleaves the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) in 32S pre-rRNA, generating mature 28S rRNA (14Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Like Ebp1, B23 is a component of pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (20Zirwes R.F. Kouzmenko A.P. Peters J.M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to the above functions, B23 has a tumor suppression function through p53, because overexpression of B23 induces a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in normal fibroblast cells (22Colombo E. Marine J.C. Danovi D. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other studies demonstrate that high level expression of B23 correlates with uncontrolled cell growth, suggesting that B23 may have oncogenic potential (23Feuerstein N. Mond J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11389-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Feuerstein N. Spiegel S. Mond J.J. J.

Pathol. 1996; 178: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Overexpression of B23 in NIH-3T3 cells resulted in malignant transformation and tumorigenesis in nude mice (26Kondo T. Minamino N. Nagamura-Inoue T. Matsumoto M. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Such tumor cells also became resistant to UV-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (27Higuchi Y. Kita K. Nakanishi H. Wang X.L. Sugaya S. Tanzawa H. Yamamori H. Sugita K. Yamaura A. Suzuki N.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Conversely, mice lacking B23 die in early embryonic stages (29Colombo E. Bonetti P. Lazzerini Denchi E. Martinelli P.

Manova K. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 437: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), indicating an essential role for B23 in embryonic development. Employing PI(3,4,5)P3 column and NGF-treated PC12 nuclear extracts, we recently identified B23 as a nuclear PI(3,4,5)P3-binding protein. B23/PI(3,4,5)P3 complex mediates the anti-apoptotic effects of NGF by inhibiting DNA fragmentation activity of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) (31Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Cheng D. Peng J. Chan P.K. Wade P.A. Ye K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ARF tumor suppressor binds B23 and enhances its sumoylation (32Tago K. Chiocca S. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7689-7694Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the biological effects of this event remain unknown. Most recently, we show that B23 is sumoylated on both lysine 230 and 263 residues, but the latter is the major one. Mutation of Lys263 but not Lys230 into Arg abolishes its centrosomal and nucleolar residency (33Liu X. Liu Z. Jang S.W. Ma Z. Shinmura K. Kang S. Dong S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Ye K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that Ebp1 interacts with B23. p48 isoform constitutively associates with B23, which is mediated by B23 sumoylation; whereas p42 interacts with B23 in response to EGF stimulation, for which Ser360 phosphorylation is essential. Moreover, B23 binding to Ebp1 p42 is regulated by cell cycle, which correlates with evident Ser360 phosphorylation in p42 (Ser360 in p48 corresponds to Ser306 in p42. For simplicity, we use Ser360 for both p42 and p48 isoforms) in mitosis. Interestingly, Ebp1 is also implicated in ribosome biogenesis. Disrupting the interaction between B23 and Ebp1 affects cell cycle profile, leading to cell proliferation decrease and cell death increase. Cells and Reagents—PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5% horse serum. Ebp1 p42 or p48 or B23 or control empty vector stably transfected PC12 cells (Tet-off cell lines) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 5% horse serum, 100 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline. The transfected genes were induced by culturing in medium without tetracycline for 24 h. HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. EGF was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-Ebp1 C antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Ebp1-N antibody was raised in rabbit against the N-terminal 22 residues in p48. All the chemicals not included above were purchased from Sigma. GFP-Ebp1 constructs are kindly supplied by Dr. Giulio Draetta (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). Fluorescence Microscope Analysis—HEK293 cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 12-well dish. After overnight growth, cells were transfected using calcium phosphate method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with DMEM without FBS for 24 h and then treated with 100 ng/ml EGF 30 min. For mitotic cell synchronization, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h. PC12 or HeLa cells were treated with 50 μm VP16 or 1 μm staurosporine for 16 h. After apoptotic stimuli, cells were treated with 2 μm propidium iodide and 200 ng/ml Hoechst33342 for 10 min and then washed with PBS. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then permeabilized and blocked by 0.4% Triton X-100 and 2% FBS in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, washed with PBS three times and treated with several antibodies. Fluorescent images were taken by OLYMPUS IX71 fluorescence microscope. Ribosome Biogenesis Assay—For monitoring ribosomal RNA processing, pulse-chase experiments using [methyl-3H]methionine were conducted based on the methylation of ribosomal RNA precursors and rapid turnover of the cellular pool of methionine, which provides [3H]methyl. Cells were infected with control adenovirus or virus expressing shRNA of Ebp1 or B23. In 48 h, the infected cells were starved of methionine for 30 min on 6-well plates with 1 ml of methionine-free medium and were labeled with 50 μCi of l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Cold methionine (15 μg/ml) was added to chase the label for 45 min. After washing with PBS, the total RNA was purified by an RNA isolation system (Promega) and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded onto 1% agarose denaturing gel containing 0.55 m formaldehyde. The RNA was fractionated and transferred onto a Zeta-probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was dried and sprayed by EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences) at -80 °C with an intensifying screen for 7 days. Genomic DNA Fragmentation—Oligonucleosomal fragmentation of genomic DNA was determined as described below. In brief, after transfection or infection, the cells were incubated with 50 μm VP16 or 1 μm staurosporine for 16 h. At the end of incubation, cells were pelleted, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed at 37 °C for 2 h in 500 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K). Samples were treated with phenol/chloroform and then centrifuged, the supernatants were treated isopropyl alcohol precipitation. This pellet was dissolved in TE buffer containing RNase A (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h, then the same amount DNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed at 100 V for 1 h through a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide in TAE buffer (0.04 m Tris acetate/0.001 m EDTA, pH 8.0). DNA bands were visualized under UV light. Co-immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Binding Assays—A10-cm plate of HEK293 cells were washed once in PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. The experimental procedures for co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays are as described (34Ye K. Compton D.A. Lai M.M. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10747-10756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting analysis was performed with a variety of antibody. Cell Synchronization—The cells were initially plated at a density of ∼5 × 105 cells in a 10-cm dish. One day after seeding, the cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine-containing medium, and 24 h later, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with prewarmed PBS at 37 °C and incubated in fresh thymidine-free medium for 8 h. The cells were then cultured in medium supplemented with 2 mm thymidine for an additional 16 h. After aspirating the medium, the cells were washed three times with PBS prewarmed at 37 °C and then incubated in fresh medium. At various times after release from the second thymidine block, the cells were harvested and lysis. For mitotic arrest, we employed 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Cycle Status—The flow cytometric evaluation of the cell cycle status was performed by a modification of a published method (35Ye K. Ke Y. Keshava N. Shanks J. Kapp J.A. Tekmal R.R. Petros J. Joshi H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 transfected or control or shRNA-treated HEK293 cells were centrifuged, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Tubes containing the cell pellets were stored at -20 °C. After this, the cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of phosphate/citrate buffer (0.2 Na2HPO4, 0.1 citric acid, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed with 5 ml of PBS and incubated with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml)/RNase A (20 μg/ml) in PBS for 30 min. The samples were analyzed on a Coulter Elite flow cytometer. B23 Binds to Ebp1—Both Ebp1 and B23 localize in the nucleolus and prevent DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (10Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Liu Z. Pereira L. Cheng D. Peng J. Wade P.A. Hamburger A.W. Ye K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2083-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Ahn J.Y. Liu X. Cheng D. Peng J. Chan P.K. Wade P.A. Ye K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To explore whether they interact with each other, we conducted a binding assay with a variety of B23 fragments (Fig. 1A). GFP-p48 was transfected into HEK293 cells, and cell lysates were incubated with GST-B23 recombinant protein conjugated beads. Immunoblotting analysis reveals that GFP-p48 binds to full-length B23. Nonetheless, the strongest binding occurs to B23 truncates Δ14-107 and Δ84-151. Interestingly, B23 Δ186-239 fails to interact with B23, suggesting that amino acids 186-239 is essential for B23 association with Ebp1. Immunoblotting with both anti-GFP and anti-Ebp1 reveals the same results (Fig. 1B, top and 2nd panels), indicating both the transfected and endogenous Ebp1 bind to B23. By contrast, GFP alone is unable to bind B23 (data not shown). To explore whether these 53 residues (amino acids 186-239) are sufficient for binding to Ebp1, we prepared the recombinant protein, and find that it binds to Ebp1 p48 much stronger than to p42, but it does not bind GFP control. GST control is unable to interact with any protein (Fig. 1C). To investigate which region of Ebp1 is implicated in binding to B23, we transfected various GFP-tagged Ebp1 fragments into HEK293 cells, and their cell lysates were incubated with recombinant GST-B23 Δ84-151. GST pull-down assay reveals that only full-length Ebp1 but not any other truncates associate with B23, indicating that the intact three-dimensional conformation is critical for Ebp1 p48 to interact with B23 in vitro (Fig. 1, D and E). EGF Regulates p42 Ebp1 Association with B23 in Mammalian Cells—To examine whether the association between Ebp1 and B23 can be regulated by growth factors, we co-transfected Myc-B23 into HEK293 cells with various Ebp1 constructs, followed by EGF treatment for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation reveals that Ebp1 p42 displays even stronger affinity to B23 than p48. Truncation of the N-terminal 23 amino acids (p44 Ebp1) slightly increases the binding activity (Fig. 2A, top panel). To further explore the interaction between Ebp1 and B23, we serum-starved HEK293 cells and treated the cells with or without EGF. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that both p48 and p42 are coprecipitated by anti-B23 antibody upon EGF stimulation. The specificity of the immunoprecipitated is verified with control IgG (Fig. 2B, upper left panel). Ebp1 p48 and p42 isoforms are verified in the whole cell lysates (upper right panel). The reciprocal immunoprecipitation was conducted with two different Ebp1 antibodies, which recognize both p42 and p48 (anti-Ebp1 C terminus) and p48 specific (anti-Ebp1 N terminus). The co-precipitated proteins were analyzed with anti-B23 antibody. Interestingly, B23 co-precipitates with p48 (anti-Ebp1 N) regardless of EGF stimulation, whereas B23 is selectively pulled down by anti-Ebp1 C antibody upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The peptide corresponding to amino acids 186-239 of B23 strongly binds to both p42 and p48. To examine whether this short peptide overexpression inhibits B23/Ebp1 binding, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies after transfection of B23 fragment. Compared with GST control, overexpression of GST-B23 (amino acids 186-239) completely disrupts the interaction between the association between endogenous B23 and Ebp1 isoforms (top and 2nd panels), indicating that residues 186-239 from B23 are implicated in binding to Ebp1. Neither anti-Ebp1 C nor anti-Ebp1 N antibody recognizes GST-B23 (amino acids 186-239) (data not shown). These findings suggest that B23 binding to p42 is up-regulated by EGF, whereas B23 constitutively associates with p48. Immunostaining with co-transfected GFP-p48 and Myc-B23 verifies that p48 always co-localizes B23 in the nucleolus. By contrast, p42 predominantly resides in the cytoplasm, and EGF stimulation provokes its association with nucleolar B23 (Fig. 2D). Subcellular fractionation correlates with this observation. Myc-B23 mainly occurs in the nuclear fraction, and the cytosolic B23 might be centrosomal localized B23 (Fig. 2E). Ebp1 p42 Ser360 Phosphorylation Is Essential for Its Interaction with B23—P42 binding to B23 requires EGF stimulation, indicating that EGF-mediated post-translational modification might regulate the complex formation. Our previous studies demonstrate that EGF or NGF triggers potent Ser360 phosphorylation in Ebp1. To assess whether this phosphorylation plays any role in regulating the interaction between Ebp1 and B23, we cotransfected Myc-B23 into HEK293 cells with various p42 constructs and the transfected cells were serum-starved overnight. GST pull-down assay shows that B23 strongly binds to p42 S360D, a phosphorylation mimetic mutant, whereas wild-type p42 and S360A, a nonphosphorylated mutant, barely interact with B23. Neither wild-type p42 nor S360A was phosphorylated (data not shown). This finding underscores that p42 Ser360 phosphorylation is required for its association with B23 (Fig. 3A, right panels). In contrast, p48 Ebp1 wild-type and mutants reveal similar binding affinity to B23 (Fig. 3A, left panels). To further investigate the effect of Ser360 phosphorylation in p42 binding to B23, we co-transfected GFP-B23 into HEK293 cells with GST-p42 wt or S360A, respectively, and treated the co-transfected cells with EGF. As expected, wild-type p42 potently associates with B23 upon EGF stimulation, whereas S360A fails regardless of EGF treatment (Fig. 3B, top panel). Ebp1 S360 is potently phosphorylated in wild-type p42, which is completely abolished in S360A mutant (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Hence, these data support that Ser360 phosphorylation is essential for the interaction between B23 and p42. Murine p38-2G4 (proliferation associate 2G4, PA2G4), a homolog of human Ebp1, was initially cloned as cell cycle-regulated protein (36Radomski N. Jost E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To examine whether human Ebp1 is also regulated by cell cycle, we monitored Ebp1 expression pattern and Ser360 phosphorylation. p48 remains unchanged in all phases, whereas p42 expression peaks in S phase and decreases in G2/M phase, and minimizes in G1 phase. Strikingly, p42 is selectively phosphorylated in G2/M phase, while p48 phosphorylation doublet remains constant in all phases (Fig. 3C). To explore whether the cell cycle-specific phosphorylation mediates p42 binding activity to B23, we co-transfected GST-B23 into HEK293 cells with GFP-p48 and p42, respectively. GST pull-down assay reveals that p48 interacts with B23 under both asynchronous and mitotic-arrested cells; by contrast, p42 selectively binds B23 in mitotic arrested cells but not in asynchronous cells (Fig. 3D, top panel). Interestingly, coprecipitated Ebp1 is specifically phosphorylated in mitotic cells (Fig. 3D, 2nd panel). GFP-p42 phosphorylation correlates with its binding activity (Fig. 3D, bottom panel). Immunostaining confirms that p42 colocalizes with B23 in mitotic cells but not in interphase cells (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Ser360 phosphorylation is essential for the association between p42 and B23. B23 Sumoylation Plays Distinctive Roles in Regulating Its Binding to p42 and p48 Ebp1—Our previous study reveals that B23 can be sumoylated on both Lys230 and Lys263 residues with the latter the major site. To explore whether B23 sumoylation plays any role in the association between B23 and Ebp1, we co-transfected various B23 constructs into HEK 293 cells with Ebp1 p42 and p48, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that unsumoylated B23 K230R and K263R mutants bind to p42, while wild-type B23 does not. Surprisingly, the robust interaction between p48 and B23 was completely blocked by K263R mutation, and it is also decreased by K230R mutation, demonstrating that Lys263 sumoylation is required for the association between B23 and p48. Interestingly, abolishing B23 sumoylation enhances its binding to p42 (Fig. 4A). To further examine the effect of sumoylation on the interaction between B23 and Ebp1, we conducted immunofluorescent staining studies. p48 co-localizes with wild-type B23 and K230R in the nucleolus. However, B23 K263R does not reside in the nucleolus in the co-transfected cells, whereas p48 mostly localizes in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B, arrows, bottom panel). Therefore, these results demonstrate that B23 nucleolar residency is necessary for p48 nucleolar localization (Fig. 4B, lower panels). p42 mainly distributes in the cytoplasm in both wild-type B23 and K230R-transfected cells. Surprisingly, p42 translocates into the nucleus, co-localizing with B23 K263R mutant, which distributes in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4B, upper panels). Quantitative analysis reveals that p42 translocates into the nuclei of 30% B23 K263R transfected cells; by contrast, less than 10% B23 K263R transfected display p48 nucleolar residency (Fig. 4C). Subcellular fractionation demonstrates that p42 nuclear translocation increases in B23 K263R-transfected cells, whereas p48 nuclear distribution reduces in B23 K263R transfected cells (Fig."

For many proteins the state of the glycans serves as an indicator, which allows the ER quality control system to monitor the conformation of polypeptides upon folding. Proteins that fail to fold in the ER are often dislocated to the cytoplasm, where they are subjected to proteasomal degradation. Although the addition of N-linked glycans occurs within the ER, non-lysosomal removal of the glycans occurs in the cytosol by the action of peptide N-glycanase (PNGase). In this study, we investigated the interplay between PNGase action and proteasomal degradation of ER misfolded proteins (i.e. whether PNGase acts prior to or following proteasomal degradation). Interestingly, we found that glycan removal from N-terminally extended peptides modulates the presentation of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted epitopes. Our findings provide direct evidence that the proteasome is capable of degrading glycoproteins without prior removal of their glycans. This degradation is independent of either the identity of the glycosylated protein or the type and number of N-linked glycans it harbors. We also captured and characterized glycopeptides generated following proteasomal degradation of RNaseB. Although the carbohydrate moiety reduced the variability of the degradation products that include the glycosylated residue (local effect), the overall global digestion pattern of RNaseB was unaffected. Together with earlier findings by others, our data support a model in which PNGase may act both upstream and downstream to proteasomal degradation and demonstrates its important role in class I major histocompatibility complex antigen presentation.

Degradation of proteins in eukaryotes and bacteria is catalyzed primarily by large multimeric proteases, whose function is ATP-dependent (1Confalonieri F. Duguet M.

In eukaryotes these enzymes (most prominent of which is the proteasome) are essential for the rapid destruction of many regulatory proteins such as cyclins. The proteasome plays a key role also in the immune system by producing antigenic peptides suitable for presentation by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 4The abbreviations used are:MHCmajor histocompatibility complexERendoplasmic reticulumPNGasepeptide N-glycanasePNGaseFpeptide N-glycanase FyPNGaseyeast peptide N-glycanaseEndoHendoglycosidase HE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseZbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketoneGFPgreen fluorescent proteinDTTdithiothreitolIAAiodoacetamideTfRtransferrin receptorMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime of flightTCRT cell receptorRNaseA-B, ribonucleases A and Baaamino acid(s) molecules (5Bonifacino J.S.

Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). In the ER an elaborate quality control system assists proteins in their folding and prevents misfolded proteins from reaching their final destination. Two mechanisms have evolved to prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins. One, termed the “unfolded protein response,” (UPR), involves the activation of an ER-to-nucleus signaling pathway that results in up-regulation of ER chaperones and augments its folding capacity (11Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 12Mori K.

Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, proteins cannot always be refolded, and therefore a second mechanism has evolved to destroy polypeptides that failed to pass the ER quality control system. Both mechanisms, the unfolded protein response and degradation of misfolded ER proteins, are coordinately regulated (14Casagrande R. Stern P. Diehn M. Shamu C. Osario M. Zuniga M. Brown P.O.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Degradation of ER misfolded proteins entails their dislocation from the ER to the cytoplasm, followed by substrate ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (18Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Because many of such misfolded proteins are glycosylated, the presence of the glycan may influence their proteasomal degradation. Although modification of proteins by N-linked glycans occurs only in the ER, non-lysosomal removal of the sugar moieties takes place in the cytosol. The removal of N-linked glycans is executed by the cytosolic enzyme peptide N-glycanase (PNGase). PNGase hydrolyzes the β-glycoamide bond between the asparagine residue and the GlcNAc group at the reducing end of the oligosaccharide, resulting in the release of a free glycan with the concomitant conversion of the asparagine to aspartic acid (19Misaghi S.

Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Several studies addressed the exact step at which PNGase removes the glycans from glycosylated substrates in the course of their degradation. One model based on earlier studies suggests that PNGase is recruited to the 26 S proteasome and removes the glycan from the polypeptide prior to its degradation by the proteasome (21Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In support of this model, both yeast and mammalian PNGase were shown to interact directly with the proteasome via the 19 S subunit S4, or indirectly through RAD23 (21Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

A. 2005; 102: 9144-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, during the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains, which is mediated by the human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoproteins US2 and US11, a deglycosylated intermediate accumulates in the cytosol when the 26 S proteasome is inhibited (24Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In accord with this model yeast and mouse PNGase deglycosylate unfolded proteins in vitro; however, their properly folded counterparts do not undergo PNGase-mediated deglycosylation (28Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Hirsch C. Misaghi S. Blom D. Pacold M.E. Ploegh H.L. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Presumably, the substrate of PNGase may be at least partially unfolded as it emerges from the ER. Alternatively, PNGase action may be coupled to the unfolding step that occurs during recognition of the ubiquitinated substrate by the ATPases at the base of the 19 S proteasome regulatory particle (21Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Katiyar S. Li G. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13774-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The observation that the N-linked glycan acts as a recognition module for the SCF (Fbx2) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (30Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) places PNGase downstream of ubiquitination and upstream of proteasomal degradation. Both the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells have a single gene encoding for cytoplasmic N-glycanase activity. Thus, if PNGase must act prior to proteasomal degradation of glycosylated substrates, blocking its activity should result in accumulation of glycoproteins in the cytoplasm, which must be deleterious to the cells. Surprisingly, yeast deleted for the Png1 gene are viable and present no growth defect or other noticeable phenotype (20Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In fact, the only phenotype detected so far in Png1-deficient yeast includes a moderate decrease in the rate of CPY* degradation (a glycoprotein decorated with four N-linked glycans, commonly used as a model substrate for degradation of ER misfolded proteins) (20Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Likewise, mammalian cells, in which PNGase expression was silenced using siRNA, showed only a minor delay in the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains, which carry a single N-linked glycan (23Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The lack of an overt phenotype in yeast deficient in PNGase or mammalian cells in which PNGase expression was silenced by small interference RNA suggests an alternative mechanism in which PNGase activity is not a prerequisite for proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, PNGase may remove the glycan moiety from glycosylated digestion products following proteasomal degradation rather than act on the intact glycoprotein prior to its digestion. In agreement with this alternative, inhibition of PNGase by Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent proteasomal degradation of glycosylated substrates in living cells (19Misaghi S. Pacold M.E. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. Korbel G.A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1677-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the requirement of PNGase for proteasomal degradation has never been assessed directly. Here we monitored the ability of the proteasome (20 S and 26 S) to degrade N-linked glycoproteins without deglycosylation. We found that in vitro the proteasome digests proteins decorated with single or multiple glycans in a fashion that is independent of PNGase activity. Interestingly, although the carbohydrate moiety did not interfere with degradation per se, it altered the repertoire of the digestion products containing the glycosylation site. We further demonstrate that the presence of a glycan near a class I MHC epitope affects its presentation, which is suppressed when PNGase is inhibited. Generation of EL4 Cells Expressing TCRα Mutants—Mutants of TCRα (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) were cloned into pMIG, a retroviral vector, which harbors an IRES-GFP element. Retroviral infections were performed as previously described (32Tirosh B. Iwakoshi N.N. Lilley B.N. Lee A.H. Glimcher L.H. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GFP-positive EL4 cells were sorted to 100% purity and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm HEPES, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Pulse-Chase and Precipitation Experiments—After starvation of 45 min in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, EL4 cells were metabolically labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. Pulse-chase, cell lysis, and precipitation were performed as described previously (33Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. EndoH was purchased from New England Biolabs and used according to the manufacture's recommendations. Staining of EL4 Cells—EL4 cells were stained with 25D1.16 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Ron Germain, National Institutes of Health), which recognizes the H-2Kb/SIINFEKL complex (34Porgador A. Yewdell J.W. Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1997; 6: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody. Live cells were gated based on their light scattering characteristics. OT-I T Cell Activation Assay—Naïve CD8 T cells were isolated from spleens of OT-I transgenic mice bred onto RAG-1-/- background. OT-I is a transgenic TCR (V2/V5) specific for SIINFEKL (an ovalbumin-derived peptide) restricted by H-2Kb. To obtain naïve OT-I CD8 T cells, cell suspensions from spleens were depleted for erythrocytes by LCK lysis. 106 OT-I cells were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 3 × 105 EL4 cells with or without 50 μm of the SIINFEKL peptide, in a final volume of 300 μl. The cells were then washed with ice-cold fluorescence-activated cell sorting staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide), stained with phycoerythrin-anti-CD69 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry. OT-I T cells were gated based on their smaller size than EL4 cells and the lack of GFP expression. Preparation of Reduced and Alkylated Biotin-labeled Glycoproteins—10 mg of protein (RNaseB, ovalbumin, or transferrin receptor purchased from Sigma) dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm DTT, 8 m urea were incubated for 30 min at 55 °C. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a Superdex S-30 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 5 mm EDTA, 3 m guanidine, 8 m urea. For biotinylation, peak fractions were concentrated and incubated in the dark for 12 h at room temperature with 5 mg of biotin-polyethylene-oxide iodoacetamide (Pierce). The reaction mixture was then separated on a Superdex S-30 gel-filtration column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Peak fractions containing the biotinylated protein were pulled and used for proteasomal degradation experiments. PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) was used for deglycosylation according to the manufacture's recommendations. RNaseB Alkylation by Iodoacetamide—Twenty milligrams of RNaseB was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein was loaded on a mono S high-performance liquid chromatography column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing RNaseB were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The purified protein was then denatured and reduced as described for RNaseB-biotin, following by alkylation with 40 mg of iodoacetamide. The alkylated RNaseB (denoted RNaseB-IAA) was then purified as described for RNaseB-biotin and used for the degradation experiments, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Expression and Purification of TCRα from HEK293 TREX Cells—The Flp-In expression system (Invitrogen) was used to stably express TCRα-6 His. TCRα-6 His from pCDNA3.1 expression vector (35Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pCDNA5 FRT/TO mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Subconfluent HEK293 TREX cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were cotransfected with pCDNA5 FRT/TO TCRα-6 His and pOG44 (encoding the FLP recombinase) expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) was added to the growth medium, and positive clones were selected. To induce TCRα-6 His expression, hygromycin-resistant clones were grown for 24 h in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. To purify the TCRα-6 His, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and preincubated on ice for 15 min. The lysate was supplemented with urea to a final concentration of 5 m. Following 15-min incubation on ice, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm, filtered, and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences). After thoroughly washing the column, TCRα-6 His was eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, dialyzed for 24 h against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and assayed by immunoblotting with anti-TCRα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Degradation of Glycosylated Proteins by the Proteasome: Preparation of Substrates—Prior to the 26 S degradation assays, OVA-biotin and TfR-biotin were preincubated with 6 m guanidine followed by brief desalting using a Superdex S-30 gel-filtration column. Fractions containing the biotinylated proteins were used in degradation assays immediately. The purified TCRα was boiled, chilled briefly on ice, and used without delay in the digestion reactions. For 20 S degradation reactions, purified TCRα and OVA-biotin were incubated for 30 min in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine, 15 mm DTT at 55 °C, followed by desalting of the reaction mixture on G-50 (TCRα) or G-75 (OVA-biotin) spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). TfR-biotin was boiled and chilled briefly prior to usage. Proteasomal Degradation Reaction Conditions and Analysis—RNaseB-biotin, TfR-biotin, OVA-biotin, and the purified TCRα were incubated at 37 °C with 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT with or without 0.018% SDS, and 20 S proteasome purified from rabbit muscles. For degradation of substrates by the mammalian 26 S proteasome or the archaeal 20 S-PAN complex, the glycoprotein was incubated at 37 °C with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT with or without 2 mm ATP and 26 S proteasome purified from rabbit muscles or 20 S-PAN complexes that were expressed and purified from bacteria. In all of the degradation reactions, the molar ratio of proteasomes to substrates was 1:1000. The concentration of the 20 S and the 26 S proteasome used was 1 nm, with 1 μm substrate. Samples from the reaction mixture were removed at different time intervals and subjected to immunoblot analysis with an anti-biotin horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Vector) or anti TCRα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoblots were quantified using the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). The data were fitted using linear or exponential decay (Y = Y0 + A1e-(x - x0)/t1) fitting functions (Origin laboratory). Glycoprotein Staining with Concanavalin A—Staining of membranes with concanavalin A was used to detect glycosylated proteins transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was preincubated at room temperature for 30 min in wash solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 2.5% bovine serum albumin. Concanavalin A (Sigma, 20 μg/ml) was added for 30 min. The membrane was then washed three times with wash solution, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, 20 μg/ml) in wash solution supplemented with 2.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times, and the reactive bands were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Yeast PNGase—E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET22-yPNGase 6 His expression vector were grown in LB medium (2 liters) for ∼6 h at 37 °C with constant shaking until the A600 of the culture reached 0.6. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The culture was grown for additional 3 h, and the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated for 3 min on ice. The sonicated lysate was then clarified by centrifugation. The clear lysate was filtered and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.5 m imidazole. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT for 24 h. The dialyzed eluant was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex S-75 gel-filtration column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, diluted with 50% glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Following degradation by the 26 S proteasome the peptides were resolved by capillary reversed-phase chromatography and eluted with linear gradients of 5 to 95% of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid in water. Mass spectrometry was performed by an ion-trap mass spectrometer (Orbitrap, Finnigan, San Jose, CA) in a positive mode using repetitively full mass spectrometry scan followed by collision induces dissociation of the three most dominant ions selected from the first mass spectrometry scan. The mass spectrometry data were analyzed using the Sequest software (J. Eng and J. Yates, University of Washington and Finnigan, San Jose) searching the RNaseB sequence. The peptides were identified with Xcorr of at least 3 ΔCN above 0.1 and were manually evaluated as well. In addition, the peptides were analyzed using MALDI TOFTOF mass spectrometer (4700, Applied Biosystems), enabling a better coverage of the differences between the samples. The Presence of a Sugar Moiety Near a Class I MHC Epitope Reduces the Efficiency of Its Presentation—A small fraction of the proteasomal degradation products is transported into the ER and loaded onto class I MHC molecules. The peptides suitable for presentation must be of certain length (8–10 amino acids) and composed such that they can be presented by a specific type of class I MHC molecule. These strict requirements markedly limit the number of peptides generated from each antigenic protein that are suitable for presentation. Although most of the peptides generated are further degraded by cytosolic peptidases, only ∼35% of the peptides emerge from the proteasome as mature epitopes, correct in size for presentation, or as N-extended versions (36Cascio P. Hilton C. Kisselev A.F. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 37Rock K.L. York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Nat.

The N-extended epitopes can be further trimmed to the correct size for presentation by amino-peptidases, either in the cytosol or within the ER. On the other hand, the identity of the C terminus is determined by proteasomal cleavage. Because the average half-life of a peptide in the cytosol is only ∼5s, >99% of the proteasomal degradation products suitable for presentation are destroyed before they are translocated into the ER (38Yewdell J.W. Reits E. Neefjes J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 39Reits E. Griekspoor A. Neijssen J. Groothuis T. Jalink K. van Veelen P. Janssen H. Calafat J.

For example, whereas ovalbumin is composed of 386 residues, only two ovalbumin-derived epitopes are presented: the major epitope SIINFEKL and a minor epitope KVVRFDKL (40Chen W. Khilko S. Fecondo J. Margulies D.H. McCluskey J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). During degradation of ovalbumin, products containing the SIINFEKL epitope, suitable for presentation, are destroyed >90% of the time (36Cascio P. Hilton C. Kisselev A.F. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of PNGase activity on the generation and presentation of class I MHC-restricted epitopes, we investigated whether the presence of a glycan moiety in proximity to a class I MHC-restricted epitope would alter its presentation. To assay effective presentation, we inserted the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL epitope in-frame into the backbone of TCRα. The SIINFEKL epitope was demonstrated previously to be suitable for the study of N-extended epitopes (36Cascio P. Hilton C. Kisselev A.F. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L.

Because the target glycosylation consensus sequence is Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X stands for any amino acid but proline), it is possible to insert the SIINFEKL sequence two residues downstream of the glycosylation site such that its serine residue serves as part of the consensus sequence. When TCRα is expressed in the absence of a cognate β chain, it is routed to proteasome-mediated degradation (35Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L.

https://openalex.org/W2035142020,"Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that exports enterotoxins, which alter host cells through a number of mechanisms resulting in diarrheal disease. Among the secreted toxins is the multifunctional, autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTX(Vc)), which disrupts actin cytoskeleton by covalently cross-linking actin monomers into oligomers. The region of the toxin responsible for cross-linking activity is the actin cross-linking domain (ACD). In this study, we demonstrate unambiguously that ACD utilizes G- and not F-actin as a substrate for the cross-linking reaction and hydrolyzes one molecule of ATP per cross-linking event. Furthermore, major actin-binding proteins that regulate actin cytoskeleton in vivo do not block the cross-linking reaction in vitro. Cofilin inhibits the cross-linking of G- and F-actin, at a high mole ratio to actin but accelerates F-actin cross-linking at low mole ratios. DNase I completely blocks the cross-linking of actin, likely due to steric hindrance with one of the cross-linking sites on actin. In the context of the holotoxin, the inhibition of Rho by the Rho-inactivating domain of MARTX(Vc) (Sheahan, K. L., and Satchell, K. J. F. (2007) Cell. Microbiol. 9, 1324-1335) would accelerate F-actin depolymerization and provide G-actin, alone or in complex with actin-binding proteins, for cross-linking by ACD, ultimately leading to the observed rapid cell rounding."

Unlike the thin filaments of striated muscles, the actin cytoskeleton in nonmuscle cells is intrinsically dynamic. Given the differing requirements for the structural integrity of the actin thin filaments of the sarcomere compared with the requirement for dynamicity of the actin cytoskeleton in nonmuscle cells, we postulated that different regulatory mechanisms govern the expression of sarcomeric versus cytoskeletal Tms, as key regulators of the properties of the actin cytoskeleton. Comprehensive analyses of tissues from transgenic and knock-out mouse lines that overexpress the cytoskeletal Tms, Tm3 and Tm5NM1, and a comparison with sarcomeric Tms provide evidence for this.

Actin microfilaments are present in a variety of cellular structures that are specialized for different functions (1Gunning, P. W., O'Neill, G. M., and Hardeman, E. C. (2007) Physiol. Rev., in pressGoogle Scholar). In muscle cells, actin filaments are arranged into the thin filaments of sarcomeres to provide contractile force. Proper functioning of the sarcomere requires an invariant organization of this structure. A mechanism is in place that maintains strict stoichiometric expression of the components of the sarcomere, such as actin and Tms, 2The abbreviations used are:TmtropomyosinMEFmouse embryo fibroblastNTGnontransgenicESembryonic stemZ-LACZ-line adjacent compartment and thus sarcomeric integrity. In contrast, actin microfilaments in nonmuscle cells are involved in a wide range of cellular architectures and functions, including motility, membrane ruffling, adhesion, cytokinesis, and transport.

This is evident in the regulation of the sarcomeric Tms in cardiac muscle: α-Tm (major isoform) and β-Tm (minor isoform) (25Muthuchamy M. Pajak L. Howles P. Doetschman T. Wieczorek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3311-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hemizygous knock-out of striated α-Tm results in reduced levels of α-Tm mRNA; nevertheless, normal levels of striated α-Tm protein are maintained (26Blanchard E.M. Iizuka K. Christe M. Conner D.A.

Correspondingly, overexpression of β-Tm in the hearts of transgenic mice elicits a reduction in the levels of α-Tm. Thus, homeostasis of the amount of sarcomeric Tm is maintained (15Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it is postulated that translational compensation ensures that the level of the total sarcomeric protein pool remains unaltered, hence maintaining the strict protein stoichiometry of the sarcomere (14Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that in contrast to the requirement for a feedback mechanism to maintain a strict protein stoichiometry in the muscle sarcomere, the dynamic nature of the nonmuscle actin cytoskeleton requires a more flexible mechanism. We envisaged a simple mechanism whereby the supply of cytoskeletal Tms might be limiting. Thus the altered expression of limiting cytoskeletal Tm isoforms could provide a mechanism to regulate the form and dynamics of actin cytoskeletal structures. Through analysis of cytoskeletal Tm expression in transgenic and knock-out mice, we demonstrate that cytoskeletal Tms are not regulated by a feedback mechanism. We show that sarcomeric and cytoskeletal Tms in striated muscle cells are regulated by different mechanisms. Overexpression of muscle β-Tm in the heart causes the expected decrease in α-Tm expression (15Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P. Neumann J. Wieczorek D.F. J. Biol.

We show that an increase in the level of Tm5NM1 in the growth cone of primary neurons leads to an increased level of actin polymer. This divergent regulation of the Tm isoforms in striated versus nonmuscle cells provides a mechanism to regulate actin microfilament structures with clearly distinct functional requirements.

Volume analysis with object background correction was applied. Signal intensity in each lane was expressed relative to α-tubulin staining of the same blot to control for protein loading differences. The statistical difference was estimated by Student's t test, and the criterion for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Intensity of phalloidin staining and growth cone size measurements was made using Meta-Morph software (Molecular Devices Ltd., Victoria, Australia). Surface area measurement of the growth cones was performed by tracing the perimeter of the growth cone, and the proximal region of the growth cone was delineated at the point where it first splayed from the axon. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 13, and groups were compared using non-parametric analysis (the Mann-Whitney U test). All experimental values are expressed as ±S.D. Image Capture—Images were captured using a Spot II-cooled CCD digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) mounted on an Olympus Bx50 microscope. Immunofluorescence Detection—Hearts from ARC(S) mice and soleus muscles from NTG and TG5/52 mice were excised and processed for cryosectioning, as described previously (44Kee A.J. Schevzov G. Nair-Shalliker V. Robinson C.S. Vrhovski B. Ghoddusi M. Qiu M.R. Lin J.J. Weinberger R. Gunning P.W. Hardeman E.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, excised muscles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and transferred to 1.8 m sucrose, 17% polyvinylpyrrolidone for overnight infusion. Semithin (0.5-1.0 μm) longitudinal sections were cut at -60 °C using a Leica ULTRACUT UCT ultramicrotome equipped with an EM FCS cryochamber (Leica Microsystems Pty. Ltd., New South Wales, Australia). Sections were suspended in 2.3 m sucrose, allowed to thaw, and placed on poly-d-lysine-coated slides. Sections were blocked in 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.2% fish gelatin, 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, overnight at 4 °C. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied for 60-90 min at room temperature, and sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. For dual immunodetection, both primary antibodies were applied together. Negative controls consisted of substituting preimmune serum for the primary antibody. Slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD® mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). MEFs were prepared for dual immunodetection as described previously (34Schevzov G. Vrhovski B. Bryce N.S. Elmir S. Qiu M.R. O'Neill G.M. Yang N. Verrills N.M. Kavallaris M. Gunning P.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunodetection in primary hippocampal neurons was the same as for MEFs, except that cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Overexpression of Cytoskeletal Tms Does Not Elicit a Feedback Response—To investigate the hypothesis that cytoskeletal Tm isoforms are not subject to feedback regulation, we employed transgenic mouse models that overexpress two different cytoskeletal Tm isoforms encoded by different Tm genes. Tm3 is a high molecular weight isoform encoded by the α-Tm gene and is predominantly expressed in the stomach of NTG (Fig. 1F). Tm5NM1 is a low molecular weight isoform encoded by the γ-Tm gene and is ubiquitously expressed (34Schevzov G. Vrhovski B. Bryce N.S. Elmir S. Qiu M.R. O'Neill G.M. Yang N. Verrills N.M. Kavallaris M. Gunning P.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Schevzov G. Bryce N.S. Almonte-Baldonado R. Joya J. Lin J.J. Hardeman E. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3425-3437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that levels of Tm3 and Tm5NM1 are significantly increased in transgenic tissues of the respective mouse line (Fig. 1, A, C, D, F, and G). Although it is not possible to distinguish the exogenous Tm3 from endogenous, a human-specific antibody (LC1) was used to detect the presence of the human Tm5NM1 transgene product (Fig. 1C). Having established that the transgenes are expressed in a range of tissues, we next performed a comprehensive analysis of the impact of transgene expression on endogenous cytoskeletal Tm isoforms, utilizing three antibodies that detect the major Tm isoforms from the four Tm genes (Table 1) (34Schevzov G. Vrhovski B. Bryce N.S. Elmir S. Qiu M.R. O'Neill G.M. Yang N. Verrills N.M. Kavallaris M. Gunning P.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using two representative tissues from Tm3 transgenic mice, brain and lung, showed that there was no change in the levels of endogenous cytoskeletal Tm proteins (Figs. 1A and 2, A and B). Densitometric analysis confirmed no significant changes in expression of the Tm isoform Tm6, Tm1, Tm2, Tm5a, Tm5b, or Tm4 or Tm isoforms encoded by the γ-Tm gene (supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, no significant changes in the level of expression of Tm6, Tm1, Tm2, Tm3, Tm5a, Tm5b, or Tm4 were observed in Tm5NM1 transgenic tissues (Fig. 2, C-E, and supplemental Fig. S2, A-E). The increased amount of cytoskeletal γ-Tm isoforms in the Tm5NM1 transgenic tissues, detected with the total γ-Tm antibody (CG3), is due to the exogenously expressed human Tm5NM1 (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2F) and was predominantly observed in the brain, kidney, and stomach, mirroring the strong transgene expression in these tissues established earlier (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, Tm3 and Tm5NM1 proteins can stably accumulate in tissues if their supplies are increased, demonstrating that cytoskeletal protein pools do not appear to be saturated. In addition, since no compensating decreases in expression of endogenous isoforms are observed, the total cytoskeletal Tm pool is not fixed.TABLE 1Tm antibodies used in this study Shown is a list of Tm antibodies used in this study, indicating the isoforms recognized and the Tm gene from which they are derived. The Tm genes α, β, γ, and δ are also referred to as TPM1, TPM2, TPM3, and TPM4, respectively (13Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res.

Separate analysis with an antibody that detects all γ-Tm gene products (CG3) similarly reveals an ∼50% reduction in protein (Fig. 3B). Importantly, no compensating change in the expression of other cytoskeletal Tms is observed in either the ES or MEF cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Densitometry was carried out on an average of three sets of samples with identical results (data not shown). These results lead us to conclude"
https://openalex.org/W2082244331,"Peptide toxins from animal venom have been used for many years for the identification and study of cation-permeable ion channels. However, no peptide toxins have been identified that interact with known anion-selective channels, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein defective in cystic fibrosis and a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. Here, we describe the identification and initial characterization of a novel 3.7-kDa peptide toxin, GaTx1, which is a potent and reversible inhibitor of CFTR, acting from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Thus, GaTx1 is the first peptide toxin identified that inhibits a chloride channel of known molecular identity. GaTx1 exhibited high specificity, showing no effect on a panel of nine transport proteins, including Cl- and K+ channels, and ABC transporters. GaTx1-mediated inhibition of CFTR channel activity is strongly state-dependent; both potency and efficacy are reduced under conditions of elevated [ATP], suggesting that GaTx1 may function as a non-competitive inhibitor of ATP-dependent channel gating. This tool will allow the application of new quantitative approaches to study CFTR structure and function, particularly with respect to the conformational changes that underlie transitions between open and closed states.

Chloride is the predominant physiological anion; therefore, Cl- channels play critical roles in cell physiology. Plasma membrane Cl- channels are crucial to the process of secretion in many epithelial tissues such as the kidney, the intestine, and the airway (1Devuyst O. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1176-F1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A Cl- channel gene is the locus of the primary defect in several human diseases, including Bartter syndrome, Dent disease, myotonia, and some forms of epilepsy (2Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 3Haug K. Warnstedt M. Alekov A.K. Sander T. Ramirez A. Poser B. Maljevic S. Hebeisen S. Kubisch C. Rebstock J.

Genet. 2003; 33: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cl- channel proteins play important roles in a variety of other conditions, including cancer (4Lewis R.J. Garcia M.L. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). Despite their central roles in many physiological processes, our understanding of the structures and mechanisms of anion-permeable channels has lagged far behind that of their cation-permeable peers. One clear reason for this discrepancy is a paucity of specific probes that may be useful as tools for studying the permeation pathways and/or gating mechanisms of Cl- channels. Indeed, most Cl- channel blockers available at present act with very low affinity and poor specificity.Venoms from snakes, scorpions, marine snails, and spiders are rich sources of peptide toxins that have proven to be of great value in the functional exploration of cation channels (5Gross A.

Peptide toxins have proven to be among the most potent and selective antagonists available for voltage-gated channels permeable to K+, Na+, and Ca2+, and have been very useful tools for detailed structural analysis of these proteins (9Castle N.A. Haylett D.G. Jenkinson D.H. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Possani L.D. Merino E. Corona M. Bolivar F. Becerril B. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Pore-blocking toxins provide clues about the arrangement of channel domains, about the interactions between the permeant ions and the pore, and about the proximity and interactions of the gating machinery with the pore (8French R.J. Dudley S. Meth. Enzymol. 1999; 294: 575-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Posson D.J. Ge P. Miller C. Bezanilla F. Selvin P.R. Nature. 2005; 436: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Gating modifiers provide tools to dissect the processes underlying the transitions between gating states. Peptide toxins have high potential as lead compounds for the development of therapeutics targeting pain, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (4Lewis R.J. Garcia M.L. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). Because peptide toxins have well defined structures, constrained by disulfide bridges, and interact with their targets through multiple contacts, they bind with much higher affinity and specificity than most other blockers available to date and report the structures of their targets at molecular detail.The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 5The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorClTxchlorotoxinBt2cAMPdibutyryl-cAMPIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineMRPmultidrug resistance-associated proteinShB-IRShaker BK+ channel with inactivation removedTEVCtwo-electrode voltage-clampTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidGaTx1Georgia anion toxin 1LqhLeiurus quinquestriatus hebraeusRP-HPLCreversed phase high-performance liquid chromatographyGABACγ-aminobutyric acid, type CAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMS/MStandem mass spectrometryWTwild type 5The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorClTxchlorotoxinBt2cAMPdibutyryl-cAMPIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineMRPmultidrug resistance-associated proteinShB-IRShaker BK+ channel with inactivation removedTEVCtwo-electrode voltage-clampTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidGaTx1Georgia anion toxin 1LqhLeiurus quinquestriatus hebraeusRP-HPLCreversed phase high-performance liquid chromatographyGABACγ-aminobutyric acid, type CAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMS/MStandem mass spectrometryWTwild type protein forms a Cl- channel, which is activated by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation plus ATP binding and hydrolysis (12Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 19: 512-518Google Scholar), and is expressed predominantly in epithelial cells. Mutations in CFTR are associated with cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians, affecting >60,000 individuals worldwide (13Guggino W.B. Stanton B.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Over-activity of CFTR plays a key role in secretory diarrhea, a worldwide health concern causing thousands of deaths per year, in diarrhea-predominant inflammatory bowel syndrome, and in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the most common inherited nephropathy and fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States (1Devuyst O.

Structure/function studies have led to improved understanding of which parts of the CFTR protein form the permeation pathway and of the mechanism of binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the nucleotide-binding domains that regulate channel gating (18Gadsby D.C. Vergani P. Csanády L. Nature. 2006; 440: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how binding and hydrolysis of ATP controls the conformation of the pore to regulate transitions between open and closed states. The availability of a peptide toxin that interacts with CFTR in a state-dependent manner would allow the application of quantitative approaches previously not accessible for answering these questions.Unfortunately, no peptide inhibitor of CFTR, or of any other identified Cl- channel, has been described, although several potential chloride channel toxins have been identified (10Possani L.D. Merino E. Corona M. Bolivar F. Becerril B. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In 1992, Strichartz and colleagues (19DeBin J.A. Strichartz G.R.

However, neither recombinant ClTx, nor native ClTx isolated from venom, has been shown to block CFTR or any other Cl- channel of known molecular identity (21Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R. Cui G. Kubanek J. McCarty N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1328-C1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Native ClTx also had no effect on Ca2+-activated Cl- channels or volume-regulated Cl- channels, when applied to the bath (22Maertens C. Wei L. Tytgat J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Br. J.

Glia. 2003; 42: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the molecular identity of this channel is also unknown.We previously determined that venom from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus (Lqh) inhibits CFTR in a voltage-independent manner by binding to the channel in an interburst closed state when applied to the channel's cytoplasmic surface (21Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R.

In this study, we used bioassay-guided fractionation of scorpion venom to isolate a single peptide toxin, GaTx1, which selectively and reversibly inhibits CFTR. Initial characterization of the activity of GaTx1 using electrophysiological approaches indicates that it inhibits CFTR with higher affinity and higher specificity than most other known modulators of this channel; only GaTx1 exhibits state-dependence of inhibition at CFTR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOocyte Preparation and Electrophysiology—Adult female Xenopus were obtained from Xenopus One (Ann Arbor, MI); methods of animal handling are in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines, and the protocol was approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Georgia Institute of Technology (21Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R.

The supernatant was then passed through a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off spin filter (Biomax-10, Millipore) to remove high molecular weight components, resulting in “Lqh-pf venom.” Venom or fraction concentrations are stated as equivalent to venom dry weight before processing.Reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) was used to separate components of Lqh-pf venom based on hydrophobicity, using a Waters 1525 binary HPLC and Waters 2487 dual wavelength absorbance detector, with a Zorbax 300SB-C3 silica column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300-Å pore size), and a gradient of water and acetonitrile. Size-exclusion chromatography used a 1.4-cm × 80-cm column (Bio-Rad) packed with Sephadex G50 Superfine (Sigma); toxins were eluted using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm KCl (pH 7.5). All fractions collected via RP-HPLC or size-exclusion chromatography were dried under vacuum, then resuspended in the appropriate recording solution, and stored at -80 °C until use. For all chromatograms, the solid line indicates absorbance at 220 nm. The dashed line in RP-HPLC chromatograms indicates the elution gradient.Electrophysiology—Venom fractions were tested using either excised/inside-out macropatches or single channel patches (21Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R.

CFTR currents were measured with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and were recorded at 10 kHz to DAT tape. For subsequent analysis, records were played back and filtered with a four-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instruments; Hamden, CT) at a corner frequency of 100 Hz and acquired using a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon) and computer sampling at 500 Hz with pClamp 9 (Axon). For inside-out macropatch recording, electrodes were filled with the same solution as for single-channel recording, with resistances averaging ∼1-2 MΩ. Typical seal resistances were 100 GΩ or greater. Macropatch recordings were also performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier operated with pClamp 9; data were filtered at 100 Hz and acquired at ≥2 kHz. The normal intracellular control solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 1.1 MgCl2, 2-10 Tris-EGTA, 10 TES, and 0-1 MgATP (pH 7.45). For all CFTR patch experiments in Figs. 1 and 3, and supplemental Figs. S1-S3, VM =-80 mV; for other experiments, voltage protocols were as described in the figure legends. For macropatch experiments, solutions containing venom, fraction, or toxin were applied to the intracellular face of the channel using a fast perfusion system (Warner instruments, model SF-77B) (27Fuller M.D. Zhang Z.-R.

To test for effects of GaTx1 on CFTR when applied extracellularly, CFTR also was studied using TEVC. Current at -60 mV was monitored during exposure to solution containing IBMX and dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), with subsequent addition of toxin.FIGURE 3Synthetic GaTx1 inhibits CFTR with high affinity in a state-dependent manner. A, representative multichannel trace of FLAG-cut-ΔR-CFTR in the absence and presence of 250 nm synthetic GaTx1, with continual exposure to 0.2 mm ATP at VM =-80 mV. B, dose-response curves for inhibition of FLAG-cut-ΔR-CFTR currents by either GaTx1 (circles) or glibenclamide (triangles). Drugs were applied in the continuous presence of either 0.2 mm ATP (filled symbols) or 1 mm ATP (open symbols). Dose-response curves for GaTx1 were created by measuring percent inhibition of channel currents using multichannel patches. Data are from one or two patches for each condition where window current was measured from five randomly selected windows both before and after addition of toxin; each point is normalized to the control condition for that patch. Dose-response curves for glibenclamide were created by measuring percent inhibition of macropatch currents in five to ten patches at each condition. GaTx1 was applied at 5, 20, 50, 250, or 750 nm, whereas glibenclamide was applied at 10, 50 100, and 250 μm. C, representative trace of FLAG-cut-ΔR-CFTR macropatch current activated with 0.2 mm ATP at VM =-80 mV. Glibenclamide was applied at the times indicated in the continuous presence of ATP. D, comparison of percent inhibition of CFTR currents by 50 nm GaTx1 when toxin was applied in the continuous presence of 0.2 mm or 1 mm ATP, or when toxin was applied in the absence of ATP for 5 min prior to subsequent reactivation in the presence of 1 mm ATP plus toxin. Note that inhibition by 50 nm GaTx1 was significantly increased when toxin was applied in the absence of ATP. E, comparison of percent inhibition by 100 μm glibenclamide when applied in the continuous presence of either 0.2 mm or 1 mm ATP.

Effects of toxin were determined after 5-min incubation. Ligand-gated chloride channels formed by human GABAC receptors (rho subunit) were expressed in oocytes and studied using TEVC. GABA receptor currents were activated by perfusing the cell with 10 μm GABA in the absence and presence of toxin. Oocyte endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channels were studied using inside-out macropatches. Channels were activated by exposure to 10 mm cytosolic Ca2+ using the fast perfusion system. For experiments with ShB-IR K+ channels, holding potential was -90 mV. Leak subtraction used a P/4 protocol with a conditioning pulse to -120 mV; corrected traces are shown. Voltage was stepped from -100 mV post-train to 0 mV. For all figures including electrophysiological recordings, the thick horizontal dashed line indicates the closed current level.FIGURE 4GaTx1 specifically inhibits CFTR.

Oocytes were then exposed to 20 nm GaTx1 for 5 min, and subsequently activated with 10 μm GABA in the continuing presence of GaTx1. Toxin was then removed from the bath solution, with GABA remaining. There were no differences in GABA-activated current magnitudes in the absence and presence of GaTx1 (bottom). G, effect of GaTx1 on endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channels. Currents were activated 3 times, at VM =-50 mV, by exposure to 10 mm Ca2+, or Ca2+ plus 50 nm GaTx1 (top).

Virus-infected Sf9 cells were harvested, their membranes were isolated and stored, and the membrane protein concentrations were determined. After dissolving and sonicating the isolated membranes in a disaggregation buffer, immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal antibodies developed against MRP1-3. Substrates [3H]leukotriene C4 (0.05 μm), for MRP1, and [3H]E217βG(5 μm), for MRP2 and MRP3, were used at sub-saturating levels for transport measurements in isolated Sf9 cell membrane vesicles, as described previously (31Bakos É.

In brief, inside-out vesicles were incubated in the presence of either 4 mm ATP or 4 mm AMP-PNP in a buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm MOPS-Tris, and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.0) at 23 °C (for experiments with leukotriene C4) or at 37 °C (for experiments with E217βG), in the presence or absence of 200 nm synthetic GaTx1. After incubation for 0.5 min for MRP1 or 5 min for MRP2 and MRP3, aliquots of this suspension were added to excess cold transport buffer and then rapidly filtered through nitrocellulose membranes with 0.25-μm pores. The filters were washed extensively, and radioactivity associated with the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. ATP-dependent transport leading to intravesicular accumulation of labeled substrate was calculated by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of AMP from those in the presence of ATP. The effect of the GaTx1 toxin was assessed at a single dose (200 nm). The mean results ± S.D. values from quadruplicate measurements are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Effects of 200 nm GaTx1 on the transport activity of MRP proteinsMRP1MRP2MRP3Substrate[3H]LTC4[3H]E217βG[3H]E217βGRelative transport rate (percent control)105.91 ± 2.9496.78 ± 16.69106.06 ± 7.19 Open table in a new tab N-terminal Protein Sequencing—The toxin isolated from venom, or the reduced/carboxamidomethyl-modified toxin, was purified by microbore RP-HPLC (Applied Biosystems, model 140A/785A system) on a Zorbax SB-C18 silica column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300-Å pore size) equilibrated in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and eluted at 25 °C using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The toxin was eluted as a dominant peak absorbing at 214 nm. Peptide monoisotopic masses (supplemental Table S1) were obtained by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis using the Applied Biosystems model 4700 Proteomics Analyzer system in the reflector mode.RP-HPLC fractions of either the native or reduced/carboxamidomethyl-modified toxin were sequenced. The peptides were loaded onto a Biobrene-coated and pre-cycled glass fiber filter disc and sequenced using a model cLC-Procise sequencer/PTH Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using the manufacturer's pulse-liquid Edman degradation chemistry cycles. To further confirm the sequence data, an aliquot of the reduced/carboxamidomethyl-modified toxin was digested with Lys-C protease. The digest was separated by RP-HPLC, and the resulting three fractions were manually collected and subjected to Edman sequencing as above. The sequences of the three fragments corresponded to: (a) N-term.: CGPCFTTDHQMEQK; (b) Middle: CAECCGGIGK; and (c) C-term.: CYGPQCLCNRamide. The C-terminal fragment was further analyzed by electrospray ionization-MS/MS, yielding a molecular ion mass of 1,325.5 Da, which agrees with the calculated mass of this fragment based on sequence assuming a C-terminal amide. These data also confirmed the presence of three carboxamidomethyl-Cys residues in this fragment.Homology Modeling—A homology model of Ga"

The ability of CS to regulate these processes is attributed to its complex structure, which arises from extensive modifications of a nonsulfated precursor with the structure (-4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1-)n by specific modifying enzymes such as sulfotransferases and epimerases (for review, see Ref. 5Sugahara K.

Structural features of CS chains involved in neuroregulatory events have been studied to a considerable extent by using oversulfated CS variants, CS-D from shark cartilage and CS-E from squid cartilage, characterized by GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S) (D-unit) and GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S) (E-unit), respectively (7Nadanaka S.

Hence, these rare structures may play key regulatory roles in the biological functions of CS-E. To evaluate the biological significance of GlcUA(3S)-containing structures, oligosaccharides containing GlcUA(3S) structures were previously isolated from CS-K derived from king crab cartilage after digestion with hyaluronidase (11Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Seno N. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26745-26754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), because preliminary studies by Seno et al. (12Seno N. Murakami K. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 190-194Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that a CS-K preparation from king crab cartilage was rich in GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides. However, GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides cannot be quantified using conventional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) because of their unexpected degradation following digestion with chondroitinase (CSase) ABC (11Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Seno N. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26745-26754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides might have been overlooked in CS chains derived from various tissues including mammalian samples after CSase ABC treatment. Therefore, it is essential to re-evaluate the disaccharide composition of oversulfated CS chains, which is estimated currently by means of CSase ABC treatment. With the growing interest in the fine structure of CS chains (4Sugahara K. Mikami T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), there is a need to understand the fate of GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides upon digestion with CSase ABC. This will enable us to decipher the domain structures of CS and to understand their interactions with growth/neurotrophic factors by which CS coordinates the diverse aspects of biological events and could reveal new therapeutic opportunities. In this study, we showed the binding activity toward growth/neurotrophic factors and neurite outgrowth-promoting (NOP) activity of CS-K. In addition, we developed a method of detecting the GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides of CS-E and CS-K rich in GlcUA(3S) by monitoring intermediates after CSase ABC digestion and elucidated the possible mechanism by which the disaccharides are degraded. Preliminary results have been reported in an abstract form (13Fongmoon D. Shetty A.K. Basappa B. Yamada S. Sugiura M. Kongtawelert P. Sugahara K. 19th International Symposium on Glycoconjugates.

Briefly, a GAG fraction was obtained by Pronase digestion of the gill cartilage, followed by ethanol precipitation, and purified by anion exchange and reverse phase chromatographies. The fraction, which was eluted from an anion exchange column with 2.0 m NaCl and accounted for 89% of all GAG, was used in the analysis. By contrast, the 0.15 and 0.5 m NaCl-eluted fractions accounted for less than 10% of GAG. The following materials and enzymes were purchased from Seikagaku Corp.

Briefly, 2 μg/well of the CS-K and CS-E preparations were individually coated on to coverslips precoated with poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN) (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. To investigate the structural characteristics of CS-K responsible for the neuritogenic activity, an aliquot (10 μg as GAG) was digested with 10 mIU of CSase ABC, a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II, or α-l-fucosidase, and a 2-μg aliquot of each digest was coated onto the coverslips precoated with P-ORN. Although the binding efficiency of oligosaccharides in the enzyme digests to P-ORN has not been evaluated, a recent study by Sotogaku et al. (18Sotogaku N. Tully S.E. Gama G.I. Higashi H. Tanaka M.

The hippocampal neuronal cells freshly isolated from E16 mouse embryos were suspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing supplements described previously (16Faissner A. Clement A. Lochter A. Streit A. Schutte K. Mandl C. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S.

Subsequently, the cells were seeded on coverslips at a density of 20,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to grow in a humidified atmosphere for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Thereafter, the cells were fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and the neurites were visualized by immunochemical staining using anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (Lieco Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO) and anti-neurofilament (Sigma) as described previously (19Debus E. Weber K. Osborn M. Differentiation. 1983; 25: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The antibodies were then detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. The stained cells on each coverslip were scanned and digitalized with a ×20 objective lens on an optical microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (HC-300Z/OL; Olympus). One hundred cells with at least one neurite longer than the cell body were chosen at random to determine the length of the longest neurite using morphological analysis software (Mac SCOPE; Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). At least three independent experiments per parameter or condition were carried out. Interaction Analysis—The interaction of various growth/neurotrophic factors with CS-K was examined using a BIAcore J system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The CS-K-immobilized sensor chip was prepared as reported earlier (20Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For the kinetic analysis, various concentrations of growth/neurotrophic factors were injected onto the surface of the sensor chip in running buffer, pH 7.4 (HBS-EP; BIAcore AB), containing 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (w/v) Tween 20. The flow rate was kept at a moderate speed (30 μl/min) as the manufacturer recommended. Each growth/neurotrophic factor was allowed to interact with the CS-K-immobilized sensor chip for 2 min of association and dissociation. Before each injection, the base-line stability was achieved by injecting 1 m NaCl for 2 min. The kinetic parameters were evaluated with BIA evaluation software 3.1 (BIAcore AB) using a 1:1 binding model with mass transfer. Enzyme Digestion and Fluorophore Labeling—CSase ABC digestion was carried out using 1 μg of GAG or 1nmol of tetrasaccharide and 5 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of the appropriate buffer at 37 °C for 60 min as described (21Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) unless otherwise specified. To generate the oligosaccharides, which are resistant to CSases AC-I and AC-II, CS-E was subjected to digestion with a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, at 37 °C for 60 min as described previously (15Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Khoo K-H. Sugiura M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11063-11074Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). α-l-Fucosidase treatment of CS-K (50 μg as GAG) was performed using 50 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 500 μl of 0.05 m citrate buffer, pH 4.5, for 120 min at 37 °C (22Iijima Y. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 70: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After incubation, each reaction mixture was boiled at 100 °C for 1 min, cooled to room temperature, vacuum-dried, and derivatized with 2AB as described previously (21Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These products were used for the structural analysis. HPLC—The analysis of monosaccharides/disaccharides/ oligosaccharides was carried out by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 798 mm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature as described (21Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because ΔHexUA-GalNAc (ΔO-unit) and GalNAc(4S) were co-eluted with the linear gradient of NaH2PO4, the conditions for HPLC were modified to separate the peaks. Namely, isocratic conditions with 16 mm of NaH2PO4 were employed for the first 20 min followed by a linear gradient from 16 to 798 mm NaH2PO4 over 70 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. To fractionate the CSase ABC digest, an aliquot was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide™ HR column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) using 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as an eluent at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Elution was monitored using a RF-10A XL fluorometric detector (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. Each fraction was collected and desalted by repeated evaporation. ESI-MS—The mass spectral analysis was performed with mass spectrometers operated in negative ion mode (API-3000, PE Biosystems, CA, at Kobe Pharmaceutical University; or JMS-700TZ, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, at the Center for Instrumental Analysis, Hokkaido University) and equipped with an electrospray ion source. The CS-derived disaccharides were used to optimize the acquisition parameters. The fractionated and desalted samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid in water and introduced into an ion source at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The nebulizer pressure was set to 8 p.s.i. at room temperature. The samples were examined over a mass range of m/z 50–650. 500-MHz 1H NMR Spectroscopy—An aliquot of an unidentified fraction (40 nmol as disaccharides) derived from CS-K after CSase ABC digestion was repeatedly exchanged in D2O with intermediate lyophilization. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Varian VNMRS-500 (1H: 499.7 MHz) with a Nano gHX probe (sample volume 40 μl) at a spinning rate of 2,000 Hz. One-dimensional spectrum with presaturation of the HOD signal, correlation spectroscopy, and two-dimensional homo-nuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy were measured at 26 and 55 °C. Chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured indirectly relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in D2O (23Yamada S. Yoshida K. Sugiura M.

NOP Activity of the CS-K Preparations—CS-E derived from squid cartilage and containing a GlcUA(3S)-disaccharide is involved in several intriguing biological events such as the binding of growth factors and differentiation of neurons (8Ueoka C.

To understand the possible involvement of GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides in NOP activity, a CS-K preparation derived from king crab cartilage rich in K-unit was assessed for NOP activity. Hippocampal neuronal cells from E16 mouse embryos were cultured on CS-K or CS-E (a positive control) immobilized onto coverslips precoated with P-ORN or on P-ORN alone (a negative control). Both CS-K and CS-E promoted neurite outgrowth as compared with a P-ORN-control (Fig. 1, A–C). Notably, the NOP activity of CS-K was slightly yet significantly stronger than that of CS-E, being principally axonic in nature, and similar in this respect to what was observed with CS-E (Fig. 1, B and E). The greater NOP activity of CS-K compared with CS-E may reflect the importance of the GlcUA(3S)-containing structures in addition to E-unit (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)). CS-E from squid cartilage consists of ∼10% GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides in addition to the major (66%) oversulfated disaccharide (E-unit) (10Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CS-K Interacts with Various Growth Factors and Neurotrophic Factors—CS chains used as the culture substrate recruit endogeneous Hep-binding growth factors such as PTN and HGF to promote the outgrowth of neurites in hippocampal neurons (20Bao X.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2956-2966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, signaling of various growth/neurotrophic factors appears to be involved in the NOP activity of CS-K. Hence, we analyzed the interaction using the BIAcore system with various growth/neurotrophic factors expressed in the brain during embryonic development. The purified CS-K preparation was biotinylated and immobilized on the streptavidin-precoated sensor chip. To determine the association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) as well as the dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd), various growth/neurotrophic factors (Table 1) at different concentrations were injected individually onto the surface of a sensor chip coated with CS-K. The overlaid sensorgrams shown in Fig. 2, were analyzed collectively using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model with mass transfer to calculate kinetic parameters, which are summarized in Table 1. The direct binding of CS-K to MK, PTN, FGF-18, HGF, BDNF, and GDNF was demonstrated. FGF-18, HGF, PTN, and MK displayed Kd values in the low nanomolar (nm) range, signifying their strong affinity for CS-K (Table 1). In contrast, BDNF and GDNF showed weaker affinity as reflected in the Kdvalues. CS-K bound MK, PTN, and FGF-18 more efficiently than did CS-E (9Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N.

Open table in a new tab Identification of the End Product of the Digestion of a GlcUA(3S)-containing Disaccharide with CSase ABC—The above results clearly showed the functional properties of CS-K. However, the quantification of GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides is not feasible using conventional anion exchange HPLC because of degradation upon digestion with CSase ABC (11Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Seno N. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26745-26754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have isolated oligosaccharides containing GlcUA(3S) from CS-K after digestion with testicular hyaluronidase as models and identified them using 1H NMR spectroscopy (11Sugahara K. Tanaka Y. Yamada S. Seno N. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26745-26754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the probable intermediates/end products because of the degradation of GlcUA(3S)-containing disaccharides upon CSase ABC digestion. The structurally defined ΔA–K tetrasaccharide ΔHexUA-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA(3S)-GalNAc(4S) isolated from CS-E (15Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Khoo K-H. Sugiura M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11063-11074Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used. It was subjected to CSase ABC digestion and labeled with the fluorophore 2AB. HPLC of the CSase ABC digest gave rise to ΔA(ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(4S)) in addition to an unidentified peak eluting shortly after ΔO(ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc) in a molar ratio of 46:54 (Fig. 3A). To identify this peak, an aliquot of a 2AB-labeled CSase ABC digest of ΔA–K was fractionated on a Superdex peptide™ column, yielding fractions A and B as shown in Fig. 3B. Each fraction was collected, desalted, and subjected to ESI-MS in negative ion mode. The ESI-MS spectrum of fraction A showed a major signal at m/z 578, consistent with the molecular mass of a monosulfated disaccharide ΔA-unit (data not shown). Interestingly, fraction B afforded a molecular ion at m/z 420 corresponding to the molecular mass of a monosulfated N-acetylhexosamine labeled with 2AB (Fig. 3C). Thus, it is reasonable to assign this product as GalNAc(4S), resulting from the degradation of K-unit (GlcUA(3S)β1–3GalNAc(4S)) by the action of CSase ABC. Identification of Intermediates during the CSase ABC-mediated Degradation of K-unit—To elucidate the mechanism by which K-unit is degraded to GalNAc(4S) after CSase ABC treatment and to identify the intermediates during the digestion, a structurally defined K-K tetrasaccharide, GlcUA (3S)β1–3GalNAc(4S)β1–4GlcUA(3S)β1–3GalNAc(4S), which was isolated from king crab cartilage (11Sugahara K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26745-26754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was partially digested with CSase ABC and subjected to ESI-MS. As expected, the ESI-MS profile in the Q1 mode of the CSase ABC digest showed no molecular ion signal corresponding to ΔK (ΔHexUA(3S)α1–3GalNAc(4S)) (molecular weight, 539) derived from the reducing end (data not shown). To evaluate possible intermediates generated from the degradation of ΔK, a precursor ion mode was used. Results with ΔA–K showed GalNAc(4S) as an end product after the degradation of ΔHexUA(3S)α1–3GalNAc(4S) followed by CSase ABC digestion. Because GalNAc(4S) contains a sulfate group, the precursor ions for the sulfate group at m/z 97 we"

https://openalex.org/W2047327813,Degradation of bovine nasal cartilage induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1) was used to study catabolic events in the tissue over 16 days. Culture medium was fractionated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE). Identification of components by peptide mass fingerprinting revealed released fragments representing the NC4 domain of the type IX collagen α1 chain at days 12 and 16. A novel peptide antibody against a near N-terminal epitope of the NC4 domain confirmed the finding and indicated the presence of one of the fragments already at day 9. Mass spectrometric analysis of the two most abundant fragments revealed that the smallest one contained almost the entire NC4 domain cleaved between arginine 258 and isoleucine 259 in the sequence -ETCNELPAR258-COOH NH2-ITP-. A larger fragment contained the NC4 domain and the major part of the COL3 domain with a cleavage site between glycine 400 and threonine 401 in COL3 (-RGPPGPPGPPGPSG400-COOH NH2-TIG-). The presence of multiple collagen α1 (IX) N-terminal sequences demonstrates that the released molecules were cleaved at sites very close to the original N terminus either prior to or due to IL-1 treatment. Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) is active and cleaves fibromodulin in the time interval studied. Cartilage explants treated with MMP-13 were shown to release collagen α1 (IX) fragments with the same sizes and with the same cleavage sites as those obtained upon IL-1 treatment. These data describe cleavage by an MMP-13 activity toward non-collagenous and triple helix domains. These potentially important degradation events precede the major loss of type II collagen.
https://openalex.org/W2047212885,"The proto-oncogene c-Jun plays an important role in regulating tumor progression. We previously reported that the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CaN, also called PP2B) dephosphorylates the C-terminus (Ser-243) of c-Jun, resulting in the increase in c-Jun and Sp1 interaction, and subsequent c-Jun-induced gene expression. Here, we demonstrate the interaction of c-Jun and CaN in the nucleus of living cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and that this interaction is mediated through the calmodulin-binding domain of CaN. Furthermore, c-Jun protein stability was altered by CaN-mediated dephosphorylation at the Ser-243 site of c-Jun. The half-life of the c-Jun mutant, c-Jun-S243A was longer than that of the wild-type c-Jun. Moreover, silencing of endogenous CaN expression led to increased c-Jun ubiquitination and decreased stability. In 46% of clinical cervical tissue samples obtained from patients with cervical cancer, enhanced c-Jun and CaN expression, as well as decreased phospho-Ser-243 expression levels were detected. Our results suggest that CaN stabilizes c-Jun by dephosphorylating c-Jun at Ser-243 to enhance its tumorigenic ability."
https://openalex.org/W2023802571,"Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) is a virulence factor causing immune suppression and toxic shock of Bacillus anthracis infected host. It inhibits cytokine production and cell proliferation/differentiation in various immune cells. This study showed that a brief exposure of LeTx caused a continual MEK1 cleavage and prevented tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in non-proliferating cells such as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or mouse primary peritoneal macrophages. In human monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1, LeTx induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase by rapid down-regulation of cyclin D1/D2 and checkpoint kinase 1 through MEK1 inhibition. However, THP-1 cells adaptively adjusted to LeTx and overrode cell cycle arrest by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibitory Ser-9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by Akt prevented proteasome-mediated cyclin D1 degradation and induced cell cycle progress in LeTx-intoxicated THP-1 cells. Recovery from cell cycle arrest was required before recovering from on-going MEK1 cleavage and suppression of TNF production. Furthermore, pretreatment with LeTx or the GSK3-specific inhibitor SB-216763, or transfection with dominant active mutant Akt or degradation-defected mutant cyclin D1 protected cells from LeTx-induced cell cycle arrest, on-going MEK1 cleavage and suppression of TNF production.

A genetic study investigating LeTx-sensitivity trait loci in different strains of mice identified the NACHT-leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 1b (NALP1b) as a host factor that confers rapid LeTx cytotoxicity (19Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Caspase-1–/– macrophages with LeTx-susceptible genetic backgrounds were resistance to LeTx. LeTx also rapidly induces the release of interleukin-1β and -18 in LeTx-susceptible macrophages (20Cordoba-Rodriguez R. Fang H. Lankford C.S. Frucht D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20563-20566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that LeTx induces Nalp1b- and caspase-1-mediated cell death. However, human macrophages lack NALP1b and are resistant to rapid necrotic cell death by LeTx. Instead, LeTx was shown to cause delayed apoptotic cell death of differentiated macrophages and inhibit cell proliferation/differentiation, which are probably mediated through MAPK inhibition (18Muehlbauer S.M.

Because sustained MAPK activation is required for cell cycle progress of many different cells and the prevalence in expression of PA receptors, it is expected that LeTx causes cell cycle arrest in many cells and tissues of infected hosts. In fact, LeTx was shown to inhibit cell proliferation/differentiation in other cell types, including melanocytes (23Koo H.M. VanBrocklin M. McWilliams M.J. Leppla S.H. Duesbery N.S. Woude G.F. Proc.

To date the signaling mechanism of cell proliferation inhibition by LeTx and its contribution in the pathogenesis of anthrax remains largely unknown. This study examined further details on the effects of LeTx on cell proliferation. LeTx induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase via down-regulating key cell cycle progress proteins cyclin D1, D2, and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) via MEK1 inhibition in human monocytic cell lines. LF incorporated inside cells had almost permanent MEK1-cleaving activity and completely blocked tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) production in response to a bacterial component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Recovery from the prolong MEK-cleaving LF activity and the TNF-suppressing effects required cell proliferation, which was mediated through adaptive response of THP-1 cells by inducing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. Activation of PI3K/Akt by pretreating cells with LeTx or a chemical GSK3-inhibitor protected cell cycle arrest and facilitated recovery from cellular LeTx intoxication. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and U937 cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 10 mm minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids solution, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were grown at 37 °C in the humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. LF and PA were prepared in the laboratory as previously described (28Wesche J. Elliott J.L. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15737-15746Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 29Miller C.J. Elliott J.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10432-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). LY294002, Akt inhibitor II, MG132, Ac-YVAD-CMK, SB202190, U0126, and JNK inhibitor I were purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). Chk1 inhibitor (SB218078) and GSK3 inhibitor (SB216763) was obtained from Sigma. Pan and phospho-site specific antibodies toward Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, MEK1 (COOH terminus of MEK1), and GSK3α/β were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Pickering, Ontario, Canada). The antibody raised against the N terminus of MEK1 was from QED Bioscience Inc. MEK3 and Chk1 antibodies were purchased form Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and cyclin D1 and LF antibodies were from Neo Markers (Fremont, CA) and List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA), respectively. Preparation of Human and Murine Macrophages—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Blood obtained from volunteers were diluted with 3 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline and layered on top of the Ficoll at a 3 to 1 ratio. Blood cells were separated into different strata, and the lymphocyte layer was extracted. Isolated PBMCs were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and plated with complete RPM1 1640 media. For isolation of mouse peritoneal macrophages, mice received intraperitoneal injections of 3% thioglycollate 4 days before the preparation of peritoneal macrophages. Macrophages were harvested from mice by injecting 5 ml of saline into peritoneal cavity and re-extracted by withdrawal with a syringe. Cells were put through a cell strainer (40 μm, BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C overnight in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained from C57BL/6 mice as previously described (30Falk L.A. Vogel S.N. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1988; 43: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), except culturing bone marrow cells with IL-3 (10 ng/ml) for 5 days. Total Cell Lysate Preparation and Western Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell lysate extraction and Western blotting analysis were performed as previously described (17Kim S.O. Jing Q. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Duesbery N.S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7413-7421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, 15 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100 and then sonicated on ice. Cell extracts were obtained by centrifuging the homogenate at 18,000 × g for 10 min. These extracts were electrophoretically resolved in ready-made 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were subsequently blocked with 5% skim milk for 30 min, immunoblotted with antibodies, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Pierce Bioscience). Total cell lysates were obtained from THP-1 cells 48 h after LeTx (250 ng of LF and 500 ng of PA for 5 h) exposure and Kinetworks™ KCCP-1.0 Cell Cycle Protein multi-immunoblotting analysis was performed at Kinexus Bioinformatics Inc. (Vancouver, Canada) as described on the Kinexus website. Quantitative Real-time PCR—mRNAs expression were quantified on the Rotor-Gene RG3000 quantitative multiplex PCR instrument using the Brilliant SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by using oligo(dT) primers and the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oligonucleotide primers were the following: for cyclin D1, 5′-CCCTCGGTGTCCTACTTCAA-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-AGGAAGCGGTCCAGGTAGTT-3′ (3′ primer); for cyclin D2, 5′-GTCTCAAAGCTTGCCAGGAG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-ATATCCCGCACGTCTGTAGG-3′ (3′ primer); for cyclin B, 5′-CAAGCCCAATGGAAACATCT-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-GGATCAGCTCCATCTTCTGG-3′ (3′ primer); for cyclin E, 5′-ATCCTCCAAAGTTGCACCAG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-AGGGGACTTAAACGCCACTT-3′ (3′ primer); for CHK1, 5′-CTGAAGAAGCAGTCGCAGTG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-TTGCCTTCTCTCCTGTGACC-3′ (3′ primer); for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTGGG-3′ (3′ primer). Cell Cycle and Proliferation Analysis—Analyses of intracellular fluorescence by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and DNA content using propidium iodide (PI) were performed using CellQuest software on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For cell proliferation studies by CFSE, cells were incubated with CFSE of 1 μm for 10 min at 37 °C, and reaction was quenched on an ice bath for 2 min. Cells were washed with 3 volumes of complete media and plated. Cells were harvested daily for FACS analysis. For DNA content analysis by PI, 1.0 × 106 cells were harvested at the indicated time points, fixed by dropwise addition of ice-cold 70% ethanol after three times washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% glucose, and were stored at 4 °C. Subsequently, cell were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in staining solution containing 50 μg of PI/ml and 100 units of RNase A/ml. After 60 min of incubation at room temperature, the cell was loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The data were analyzed using CellQuest and ModFit LT 3.0 software (BD Biosciences). For the purpose of analysis, acquired events were gated to eliminate cell aggregates and debris. Aktmyr and AktK179M Retroviruses Generation and Infection—The virus preparation and infection were performed as described (31Kim S.O. Ha S.D. Lee S. Stanton S. Beutler B. Han J. BioTechniques. 2007; 42: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, constitutively active myristoylated Akt (Aktmyr) and dominant negative Akt (Akt K179M) retroviruses were generated in Phoenix Amphotropic producer cells using the calcium phosphate method. Empty retroviral vector was transfected by same procedure for control virus. Cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C and for another 24 h were incubated at 32 °C for collection of viruses. Virus was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. THP-1 cells of 1 × 106 were suspended with viruses solution containing 4 μg of Polybrene per milliliter and plated in 6-well plates. The plates were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 45 min at 32 °C, and fresh RPMI 1640 media were added into the each well after 3-h incubation at 37 °C. Viruses expressing cells were selected by green fluorescent protein 48 h after infection and treated with the LeTx for cell cycle analysis. pCDNA-Cyclin D1T286A Construction and Transfection—pCDNA3 containing human mutant cyclin D1-T286A was made by digesting a pFlex-D1-T286A (32Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) with the EcoR1 restriction enzyme and ligated the resulting fragment into the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The stable transfection of constructed plasmids was performed by electrophoresis using Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad) in THP-1 cell line, and mutant cyclin D1 expression cells were selected by G418 antibiotics. LeTx Induces G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—Previous studies have shown that LeTx inhibits proliferation and differentiation of immune cells (22Kassam A. Der S.D. Mogridge J. Cell Microbiol. 2005; 7: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Fang H. Xu L. Chen T.Y. Cyr J.M. Frucht D.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6155-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Comer J.E. Chopra A.K. Peterson J.W. Konig R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 8275-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We further examined the mechanism of cell cycle arrest in the human monocytic cells lines U937 and THP-1. Proliferation of these cells after brief exposure of LeTx (250 ng/ml LF and 500 ng/ml PA for 5 h) was analyzed for 4 days by measuring the dilution of intracellular fluorescence dye CFSE in dividing cells. LeTx temporarily inhibited cell proliferation of both U937 and THP-1 cells for up to 2 and 3 days, respectively (Fig. 1A). Cell cycle analysis using PI chromosome staining showed that number of cells in G0-G1 phase of cell cycle was increased, whereas numbers in S and G2-M phase were greatly diminished in LeTx-treated THP-1 and U937 cells (Fig. 1B). LeTx Causes a Rapid Down-regulation of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2, and ChK1 mRNA Levels through MEK1 Inhibition—To identify signaling molecules involved in the LeTx-induced cell cycle arrest, we examined 25 different cell cycle-related proteins using Kinetworks™ multi-immunoblotting analysis in LeTx-treated THP-1 cells. Among them, protein levels of cyclin D1 and Chk1 were most significantly diminished by LeTx (Fig. 2A). Both protein and mRNA levels of cyclin D1 rapidly dropped in 3 h and maximally diminished within 6 h; whereas, the decrease in protein and mRNA levels of Chk1 were less dramatic and maximally decreased 24–48 h after an LeTx treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). The rapid decrease of cyclin D1 in mRNA and protein levels was likely due to inhibition by LF at the transcriptional levels and the short half-life of the mRNA and protein. It is unlikely that cyclin D1 was directly targeted by LF, because cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (data not shown) or stably transfected with proteasome-mediated degradation-defected mutant cyclin D1 (cyclin D1T286A) were resistant to LeTx-induced cyclin D1 down-regulation (Fig. 2D). Also cyclin D1 mRNA levels in cells treated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D were down-regulated with the same rate in both non-treated and LeTx-treated cells (data not shown). Because LeTx cleaves the N-terminal end of MEKs and inhibits most downstream MAPKs, we examined whether inhibition of MAPKs could cause cell cycle arrest in THP-1 cells. Treatment of the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) for 24 h caused accumulation of cells at G0-G1 phase and prevented entering into S phase; whereas, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (SB, 10 μm) had no effects on S phase progress, but it significantly prevented cells entering G2 phase (Fig. 3A). Treatment of both U0126 and SB additively blocked cell cycle progression. A JNK inhibitor (10 μm) had no effect on cell cycle progress of THP-1 cells. These results indicate that LeTx prevents cells entering S phase and G2 phase by inhibiting ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, respectively. Similar results were detected in U937 cells. When THP-1 cells were treated with U0126, SB, or JNK inhibitor, only U0126 induced down-regulation of both cyclin D1 and Chk1, suggesting that the down-regulation of both cyclin D1 and ChK1 by LF was at least in part mediated through inhibiting MEK1 (Fig. 3B). In addition to cyclin D1, mRNA levels of cyclin D2 were similarly down-regulated by U0126 and LeTx, but not by SB or JNK inhibitor. LeTx had no effects on mRNA levels of cyclin B and cyclin E (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of MAPKs and TNF Production in Response to LPS by LeTx Were Permanent in Non-proliferating Cells—We have previously shown that LF reside inside cells and continuously cleaves MEK1 for prolong periods (∼4–5 days) in murine macrophage cell line RAW246.7 cells (33Ha S.D. Ng D. Lamothe J. Valvano M.A. Han J. Kim S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26275-26283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine the duration of LF activity in non-proliferating cells, PBMCs were briefly exposed to LeTx for 5 h, and cells were cultured in fresh media for up to 6 days. Each day, LeTx-exposed and non-exposed cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h, and TNF production was measured using a TNF bioassay as previously described (34Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6401) Google Scholar) and MEK-1 N-terminal cleavage was examined using Western blots. Throughout the cell culture period, a brief exposure of LeTx continuously cleaved MEK1 (Fig. 4A, upper panel) and prevented TNF production in responses to LPS (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Because PBMCs are a heterogeneous population of cells, including monocytes, T cells, and B cells, we further characterized TNF-producing cells in PBMCs and found that almost all TNF-producing cells in day 1 were CD13+ myeloids and in day 6 were mostly CD3+ lymphocytes (data not shown). Most of the CD13+ cells were short-lived and did not survive after 24-h culture in both LeTx-treated and non-treated PBMCs (data not shown). To specifically examine in non-proliferating macrophages, mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 mice harboring LeTx-resistant macrophages (17Kim S.O. Jing Q. Hoebe K. Beutler B. Duesbery N.S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7413-7421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and treated with LeTx. MEK1 was continuously cleaved by a brief exposure of LeTx for the next 6 days (Fig. 4A, lower panel) by when cells started dying by senescence. TNF production in response to LPS was also abolished for the next 6 days (data not shown). Cell Cycle Inhibition by LeTx Was Recovered in the Absence of ERK1/2 Activity in Monocytic Cells—The effect of LeTx is almost permanent in non-proliferating cells. If LeTx causes cell cycle arrest, the effect of LeTx should be permanent in these cells. However, when we examined MEK1 N-terminal cleavage and TNF production in response to LPS in LeTx-treated THP-1 cells, both MEK1 and TNF production were returned to normal levels in ∼5 days after LeTx treatments (Fig. 4B). Based on Western blot analysis, LF inside cells was slowly degraded over >3 days (Fig. 4C). LF was no longer detectible after 4 days of a LeTx treatment. We then examined whether cell cycle arrest by LeTx was alleviated before MEK1/ERKs activities were recovered. In fact, THP-1 cells resumed cell cycle before the third day even when LF was readily detectible by Western blots (Fig. 4C), and TNF production in response to LPS was completely blocked (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Cell cycle arrest was released after the second day and returned to almost at normal levels after 3 days of a LeTx treatment (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that LeTx-exposed THP-1 cells underwent cell cycle progression in the absence of MAPK activities. Cells Pre-exposed with LeTx Were Protected from Cell Cycle Arrest by Subsequent LeTx Treatment through Activation of PI3K—If cells adaptively adjusted themselves to LeTx and resumed cell cycle even in the absence of MEK activities, these cells should continue to proliferate even in the presence of further LeTx challenges. To examine whether these cells were indeed resistant to LeTx-induced cell cycle arrest, we briefly pre-treated cells for 5 h with LeTx and then treated them again 2 days after the pretreatment. Consistent with previous results, numbers of cells at S and G2-M phases were dramatically reduced by LeTx in 2 days, but LeTx-pretreated cells were resistant to cell cycle arrest by a subsequent LeTx-treatment (Fig. 5A, left panel). To examine whether th"

The appearance of cell death markers, such as membrane damage, nuclear fragmentation, and induction of the stress-responsive element Tnt1, was observed in all conditions. However, the cell death process was delayed in the dark compared with the light, despite a similar accumulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the chloroplasts. In contrast, harpin-induced cell death was accelerated under very low oxygen (<0.1% O2) compared with air. Oxygen deprivation impaired accumulation of chloroplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the induction of cytosolic antioxidant genes in both the light and the dark. It also attenuates the collapse of photosynthetic capacity and the respiratory burst driven by mitochondrial alternative oxidase activity observed in air. Since alternative oxidase is known to limit overreduction of the respiratory chain, these results strongly suggest that mitochondrial ROS accumulate in leaves elicited under low oxygen. We conclude that the harpin-induced cell death does not require ROS accumulation in the apoplast or in the chloroplasts but that mitochondrial ROS could be important in the orchestration of the cell suicide program.

Light and oxygen are generally considered to be important in the responses of plants to environmental stress, principally because they are involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 4The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesPCDprogrammed cell deathETCelectron transfer chainAOXalternative oxidaseVLOvery low oxygenNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumDAB3,3′-diaminobenzidinepipostinfiltrationPSIIphotosystem IISODsuperoxide dismutase 4The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesPCDprogrammed cell deathETCelectron transfer chainAOXalternative oxidaseVLOvery low oxygenNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumDAB3,3′-diaminobenzidinepipostinfiltrationPSIIphotosystem IISODsuperoxide dismutase and associated molecular and biochemical changes. ROS are central to redox sensing during biotic and abiotic stress responses, and they act as second messengers in the activation of signal transduction pathways. ROS activate mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades that phosphorylate a variety of proteins involved in plant growth and development as well as death responses (1Pitzschke A. Hirt H. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). High ROS levels can trigger the appearance of programmed cell death (PCD) and the induction of caspase activation in animals (2Hail Jr., N. Carter B.Z. Konopleva M. Andreef M. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 889-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the activation of the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome system in plants (3Basset G. Raymond P. Malek L. Brouquisse R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cellular compartmentation of ROS production in PCD responses has been extensively investigated. For example, it has been established that ROS are generated in the apoplast during the oxidative burst that often accompanies plant PCD responses (4Lamb C. Dixon D.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that this oxidative burst is caused by activation of DPI-sensitive NADPH oxidase-like enzymes (5Sagi M. Fluhr R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and/or the activation of various extracellular oxidases and peroxidases (6Bolwell G.P. Bindschedler L.V. Blee K.A.

However, clear cause and effect relationships between apoplastic ROS production and the execution of cell death have never been established, and ROS have been suggested to be involved in the spread of cell death rather than in the death process per se (7Torres M.A. Jones J.D.

Mitochondrial superoxide production is restricted by the activity of alternative oxidase (AOX), a cyanide-resistant terminal oxidase (20Purvis A.C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 165-170Crossref Google Scholar). The abundance of AOX transcripts and proteins is increased when plants are subject to a range of stresses (21Simons B.H. Millenaar F.F. Mulder L.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the induction of AOX activity has been observed in planta during elicitor-induced cell death (23Vidal G. Ribas-Carbo M. Garmier M. Dubertret G. Rasmusson A.G. Mathieu C. Foyer C.H. De Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 640-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to explore the role of ROS in elicitor-induced cell death by using very low oxygen conditions to diminish the activity of enzymes involved in ROS accumulation in different cellular compartments and dark conditions to prevent ROS production by the chloroplastic ETC. We used the bacterial protein harpin NEa infiltrated into Nicotiana sylvestris leaves as a model system for elicitor-induced PCD. The harpin NEa protein is produced by Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight disease in Rosaceae, which induces cell death in leaves of nonhost plants, such as tobacco and Arabidopsis (24Wei Z.M. Laby R.J. Zumoff C.H. Bauer D.W. He S.Y. Collmer A. Beer S.V. Science. 1992; 257: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Harpin proteins are secreted by Gram-negative bacteria via a type III secretion apparatus (25He S.Y. Yang H.C. Collmer A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). E. amylovora mutants devoid of harpin NEa secretion show both lower virulence in host species and reduced cell death in nonhost plants (26Oh C.S. Beer S.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 253: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Harpins induce apoplastic ROS accumulation (27Baker C.J. Orlandi E.W. Mock N.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), activation of kinase signaling (28Samuel M.A. Hall H. Krzymowska M. Drzewiecka K. Hennig J. Ellis B.E.

Plant J. 1999; 20: 207-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elicitation of defense responses by harpins in cultured cells is an active process that is inhibited by cycloheximide and calcium channel blockers (30He S.Y. Bauer D.W. Collmer A. Beer S.V. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 289-292Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, harpins differentially alter mitochondrial function in plant cell suspension cultures (31Xie Z. Chen Z. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Krause M. Durner J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and leaves (23Vidal G. Ribas-Carbo M. Garmier M. Dubertret G. Rasmusson A.G. Mathieu C. Foyer C.H. De Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 640-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for mitochondria-chloroplast interactions in the death response. Here we show that harpin NEa-induced cell death is executed in N. sylvestris leaves under conditions of atmospheric oxygen (air; 21% O2) or under very low oxygen (VLO; <0.1% O2). Similarly, the elicitation of PCD markers is observed in the light and in the dark. However, the kinetics of the cell death process are accelerated by light and, more unexpectedly, by VLO. The respiratory and photosynthetic signatures associated with the cell death response were followed together with nuclear morphology, intracellular localization of ROS accumulation, and the expression of cell death markers and antioxidant genes. Plant Growth Conditions—Seeds of N. sylvestris, the diploid maternal ancestor of Nicotiana tabacum, were provided by the Institut des Tabacs (Bergerac, France). Plants were grown in soil in a greenhouse under natural lighting, supplemented by artificial lighting (Philips SON-7 AGRO 400 W lamps) at a day/night temperature of 23.5 °C/17.5 °C and a day/night 60%/50% relative humidity. Plants were irrigated with nutrient solution (Hydrokani C2Hydro Agri Spécialités, France). HarpinEa Isolation and Leaf Infiltration—HarpinEa was isolated from cell-free culture supernatants from Escherichia coli DH5α, which had been transformed with plasmid pCPP430 carrying the cloned HrpNEa gene (a gift from Dr. M. A. Barny, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, France), as described in Ref. 33Gaudriault S. Brisset M.N. Barny M.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. Prior to infiltration with buffer or harpin, leaves were acclimated for 30 min under 0.1 or 21% oxygen (VLO and air, respectively), in both the light and the dark, in a multichamber system (IACR, Rothamsted) or into the chamber of a Licor 6400-40 infrared gas analysis system, as described under “Steady-state CO2 Exchange and Fluorescence Measurements.” A 0.1-ml volume of harpin at a concentration of 40 μg ml-1 in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA) was infiltrated with a hypodermic syringe into the abaxial face of the second fully expanded leaf of 6-8-week-old plants. The infiltrated zones were thereafter immediately replaced in the gas chambers. Sampling for electrolyte leakage, RNA extraction, and cytological studies was performed at the indicated times. Using Licor, care was taken to harvest samples from the inside of the gas chamber. Electrolyte Leakage Measurements—At different times after harpin or buffer infiltration, eight discs were punched out from treated tissues with a core borer (0.5-cm diameter) and placed in 10 ml of sterile distilled water. Electrolyte leakage using a CD60 “resistivimeter” (Tacussel Electronique, France) was measured as described in Ref. 34Pike S.M. Adam A.L. Pu X.A. Hoyos M.E. Laby R. Beer S.V. Novacky A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1998; 53: 39-60Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Results were expressed as percentage of leakage obtained after 10 min of incubation of leaf discs at 95 °C. Nuclear Morphology—Leaf discs (1.3 cm2) were harvested after the different treatments and vacuum-infiltrated (30 min at room temperature) with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were washed twice with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8). Cells were then dissociated by incubation at 60 °C in 0.1 m EDTA (pH 9) for 90 min and then maintained at 4 °C until analysis. Nuclei stained with the fluorochrome Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) were observed using epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). Picture acquisitions were made using a numeric camera RT SPOT (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc.) and associated software. Steady-state CO2 Exchange and Fluorescence Measurements—Gas exchange measurements were performed using an infrared gas analyzer (model wa-225-mk3; ADC, Hoddesdon, Hertford-shire, UK) as described in Ref. 35Dutilleul C. Driscoll S. Cornic G. De Paepe R. Foyer C.H. Noctor G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar. Once steady-state leaf dark respiration rates had been attained in the chambers, respiratory CO2 release was monitored for 20 min prior to illumination. Leaves were illuminated at 350 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 until steady-state rates of CO2 uptake were reached. The gas composition was controlled by a gas mixer supplying CO2 and O2 at the stated concentrations with the balance made up with N2. Leaves were then infiltrated with either buffer or harpin, and gas exchange measurements began again immediately. Leaf temperatures were maintained by water jackets at 23 °C. Alternatively, infiltrated areas were placed in the leaf chamber of the Licor 6400-40 infrared gas analysis system (Li-Cor Corp., Lincoln, NE). Gases were maintained at stable concentrations with 0.038% CO2 (via two soda lime columns associated with the Licor system) and either 21% O2 (air) or 0.1% O2 (VLO) by using a highly purified N2 gas bottle (industrial quality I grade; Air Liquide, France). In the “dark” experiments, leaves were initially dark-adapted for at least 30 min under both air and VLO conditions. Chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were measured in an on-line system with minimal and maximal fluorescence (Fo and Fm) values recorded every 3 min. In the “light” experiments, steady state photosynthesis rates were measured under 350 μmol quanta m-2 s-1 actinic light for at least 1 h under both air and VLO concentrations prior to chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis, and then measurements were made continuously throughout the course of the experiment. Fluorescence parameters of light-adapted leaves were measured every 3 min and the following parameters were calculated according to Refs. 36Schreiber U. Schliwa U. Bilger W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar and 37Genty B. Briantais J.M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The parameter (1 - qP) is a measure of the fraction of closed photosystem II reaction centers. Cytological Detection of ROS—The accumulation of superoxide (O2·¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was monitored in situ using nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), respectively, as described in Ref. 38Dutilleul C. Garmier M. Noctor G. Mathieu C. Chétrit P. Foyer C.H. De Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1212-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar. The leaf discs were vacuum-infiltrated (three cycles of 5 min) with a solution of NBT (81 mm) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) or with 36 mm aqueous DAB (pH 3.8). After incubation in the dark at room temperature (1 h and 14 h for each stain, respectively), the leaf samples were incubated in 90% ethanol at 70 °C until all of the chlorophyll had been completely removed. The samples were then cleared by incubation overnight in an 8:2:1 chloral hydrate solution (chloral hydrate (w/v), H2O (v/v), glycerol (v/v)) at room temperature. Microscopic images were taken using a Zeiss microscope. Photographic images were produced using a numeric camera RT SPOT (Diagnostic Instrument) and the relevant accompanying software. RNA Isolation and Gel Blot Analysis—Leaf tissue pieces were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNAs were extracted by the Trizol-chloroform procedure (Invitrogen). Aliquots (10 μg) of total RNA were subjected to Northern blot analyses as described in Ref. 38Dutilleul C. Garmier M. Noctor G. Mathieu C. Chétrit P. Foyer C.H. De Paepe R. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1212-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar. Statistical Analysis—Data were compared using analysis of variance statistical analysis at the P0.05 level of significance (STATISTICA software; STATSOFT Inc., Tulsa, OK), unless specified. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The Time Course of Harpin-induced Cell Death Is Not Impaired by Oxygen Deprivation or by Darkness—The visible symptoms associated with the harpin-induced cell death response, such as changes in the translucency of the infiltrated area were first observed at ∼5-6 h postinfiltration of leaves, leading to complete necrosis at 48 h pi regardless of the conditions of oxygen availability and illumination (Fig. 1). Infiltration of the leaves with buffer alone did not produce necrotic symptoms. The kinetics of the cell death process was quantified by two methods: alterations in fresh weight and electrolyte leakage (Fig. 2). The latter technique has been used previously as a cell death marker in planta (34Pike S.M. Adam A.L. Pu X.A. Hoyos M.E. Laby R. Beer S.V. Novacky A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1998; 53: 39-60Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Any excess liquid occupying the intercellular spaces had evaporated within about 1 h of infiltration in illuminated harpin-treated leaves in air (Fig. 2A), similar to the situation in buffer-treated leaves (not shown). The fresh weight values of the elicited leaf area had decreased by about 20% at the 4 h time point compared with preinfiltration values, by 40% at 8 h pi, and by 80% at 24 h pi. In dark-elicited leaves, tissue dehydration was delayed when compared with illuminated leaves. The intercellular liquid evaporation took about 4 h, and the fresh weight remained at higher values than those of illuminated leaves up to 8 h pi (p < 0.01). At the 24 h time point, however, the fresh weight was only about 15% of the initial values in both dark- and light-elicited leaves. The delay in water loss observed in dark-elicited tissues was probably due to the lower stomatal aperture under these conditions (39Dietrich P. Sanders D. Hedrich R. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, a similar delay in electrolyte leakage was observed in dark-elicited leaves (Fig. 2B, p < 0.05), thereby indicating that the progression of the cell death execution process per se was less rapid in the dark than in the light. Maximum rates of ion leakage were observed 24 h pi in both conditions, indicating that most of the cells have lost membrane integrity at this time point.FIGURE 2Fresh weight and electrolyte leakage in harpin-elicited tissues under various conditions.

At 24 h pi, the loss of membrane integrity following harpin treatment was comparable in all conditions (data not shown). No visible symptoms, significant electrolyte leakage, or water loss were observed in untreated leaves (data not shown) or buffer-infiltrated leaves (Fig. 2B) in either conditions. These results show that oxygen deprivation per se did not induce cell death in tobacco leaves over the time period of the present study. It is well known that, in contrast to animal cells, plant cells are able to survive to severe hypoxia for several h (40Drew M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 223-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The induction of the tobacco Tnt1 transposon expression was chosen as a molecular marker for the progression of the elicitation under the different conditions. Tnt1 transcripts have previously been shown to accumulate under various stress conditions, particularly in tobacco suspension cells following exposure to Erwinia chrysanthemi supernatants (41Pouteau S. Grandbastien M.A. Boccara M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 535-542Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Tnt1 transcripts were more abundant under VLO than in air 4 h post-harpin inoculation in the light, and their accumulation was lower in the dark than in the light under both air and VLO conditions (Fig. 3). Nuclear fragmentation is a hallmark of PCD in animals (42Lu Z. Zhang C. Zhai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2778-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the extent of nuclear fragmentation in dissociated cells of untreated and harpin-infiltrated leaves stained using the Hoechst fluorochrome system. In untreated leaves maintained in the different environmental conditions, including 24 h under VLO, the vast majority of nuclei (about 95%) were round in shape in all of the cell types examined (parenchyma as well as epidermal and guard cells) (Figs. 4, A and D, and 5). No marked changes in nuclear morphology were observed in cells treated with buffer or with harpin until 12 h pi in air (data not shown). However, at 24 h post-harpin inoculation in air in the light and in the dark, about 40% of the nuclei were found to be deformed with signs of fragmentation (Figs. 4, B and H, and 5). In contrast, the proportion of deformed and/or fragmented nuclei was around 80% under VLO at 24 h pi, in the light (Figs. 4E and 5) and in the dark (not shown). Nuclear fragmentation was especially pronounced in stomatal guard cells (Figs. 4E and 5). At 48 h pi, most cells were devoid of visible nuclei in all conditions (Fig. 4, C, F, and I), and 85% (air) to 95% (VLO) of the remaining nuclei were fragmented (Fig. 5). Interestingly, nuclear morphology was essentially unaffected in dead leaf areas 48 h postinfiltration with cantharidin (Fig. 4G), a phosphatase inhibitor (43Li Y.-M. Mackintosh C. Casida J.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) inducing a rapid necrotic process in N. sylvestris leaves under our experimental conditions (not shown).FIGURE 5Relative proportions of fragmented nuclei. Cells of untreated or harpin-treated leaves were stained with Hoechst as in Fig. 4. Data are means and S.E. of 3-5 independent experiments. At least 100 nuclei (including guard cell nuclei) were examined at 24 h pi, and 50 nuclei were examined at 48 h pi in each experiment. Open columns, air and light; hatched columns: VLO and light; closed columns, air and dark. The proportions (percentages) of fragmented nuclei at 24 h pi were significantly different between air and VLO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these observations demonstrate that light and oxygen modulate harpin-induced cell death in an inverse manner, the absence of light delaying the onset of the response, whereas oxygen deprivation accelerates the process. However, the general characteristics of the cell responses to harpin (electrolyte leakage, induction of Tnt1 expression, and nuclear fragmentation) were qualitatively the same under all conditions, suggesting that a similar type of cell death process was elicited. Very Low Oxygen Tempers the Harpin-induced Impairment of Photosynthesis—In order to gain further insights into the relative contributions of events occurring in the chloroplasts and mitochondria in the execution of cell death, we compared CO2 exchange rates and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters in the different conditions (Fig. 6). Infiltration with either buffer or harpin in air caused an immediate collapse of CO2 assimilation by illuminated leaves (Fig. 6A). This nonspecific effect was probably due to the limitations on gas diffusion caused by the presence of liquid in the intracellular spaces of infiltrated areas. As the liquid evaporated or was absorbed into the cytoplasm, the rates of net photosynthesis (An) increased to reach nearly initial values, a process that was completed within less than 2 h of infiltration. Subsequently, CO2 assimilation progressively declined in the harpin-elicited leaves, such that the photosynthesis rates had virtually collapsed by 6 h pi. Stomatal conductance (gs) immediately collapsed following buffer infiltration, recovered close to maximal values at around 2 h pi and then slightly decreased from 4 h pi onward (Fig. 6B). A bimodal pattern of increase and decrease in gs was observed following harpin inoculation. Interestingly, gs markedly increased from 3 to 6 h pi, at a time when net assimilation (An) was already severely affected. This indicates that decreased gs was not the primary cause of the harpin-induced inhibition of photosynthesis. Rather, An inhibition was closely followed by a progressive decrease in PSII efficiency, as determined by ΦPSII (Fig. 6C). Evidence for the closure of PSII centers was also provided by the increase in (1 - qP), which suggests a progressive reduction of the plastoquinone pool in harpin-elicited leaves (Fig. 6D). The harpin-induced inhibition of An, PSII function, and gs, as well as the rise in the (1 - qP) parameter,"

Moreover, there is a significant asymmetry in the efficiency of the extension reaction, an ∼30-fold reduction for insertion of dATP opposite template DFT and ∼900-fold reduction for insertion of d(DFT)TP opposite template A (relative to the corresponding processes with T and dTTP, respectively (5Potapova O.

The latter loss is comparable with the effects on insertion reactions involving the DFT analog seen with Y-class polymerases (5Potapova O. Chan C. DeLucia A.M. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Washington M.T. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell.

Together, these observations appear inconsistent with the conclusion that A- and Y-class polymerases use different mechanisms of replication and that the former may rely chiefly on shape for efficient and correct nucleotide insertion (1Kool E.T.

An important limitation of the large body of work involving the use of the hydrophobic T isostere DFT for probing enzyme mechanism and the role of hydrogen bonding in DNA replication is constituted by the fact that the analog has never been visualized at the active site of any DNA polymerase.The Dpo4 trans-lesion DNA polymerase from S. solfataricus (10Boudsocq F.

The structural data reveal a versatile enzyme that in some cases defies the view of Y-class polymerases as low processivity and/or fidelity catalysts of DNA replication. For example, Dpo4 was found to synthesize past the 8-oxoG adduct efficiently and with relatively good fidelity, incorporating ≥95% dCTP instead of dATP and exhibiting faster rates for pre-steady-state kinetics of dCTP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG than G (21Zang H.

As far as the different roles of sterics versus hydrogen bonding in the replications catalyzed by A-class and Y-class DNA polymerases are concerned, recent crystal structures of a the high fidelity Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I large fragment (BF) and Dpo4 in complex with DNAs containing the O6-methyl-G (O6-MeG) adduct opposite C and T may be instructive (see Refs. 25Warren J.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 1456-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, respectively). At the constrained active site of BF, both the O6-MeG:C and O6-MeG:T pairs adopt a Watson-Crick conformation, whereby the cytosine in the former is protonated. This finding is consistent with the preferential incorporation of T over C opposite O6-MeG by high fidelity polymerases. The Watson-Crick mode for correctly and mispaired combinations was also observed at the -1- and -2-bp positions. On the other hand, the O6-MeG:C pair at the more spacious active site of Dpo4 adopts a wobble geometry, and analysis of Dpo4-catalyzed extension products reveals that the enzyme accurately bypasses O6-MeG with C being the major product (>70%) and T and A being the minor species (22Eoff R.L. Irimia A. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1456-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). T exhibited multiple conformations opposite O6-MeG at the Dpo4 active site that most likely include both the Watson-Crick and wobble geometries.Here we report the results of detailed pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic analyses as well as LC-MS/MS characterizations (20Zang H.

Our steady-state kinetic data confirm that the catalytic efficiency of Dpo4-catalyzed insertion opposite DFT was strongly inhibited, consistent with previously published data by others (9Mizukami S. Kim T.W. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2772-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is noteworthy that Dpo4 is ∼200-fold more efficient (kcat/Km) at inserting dATP opposite DFT than dGTP. The pre-steady-state kinetic analysis revealed no product formation for insertion of dATP opposite DFT, and next-base extension reactions were slower following an A:DFT pair and prevented by a G:DFT pair. To interpret the activity data, we determined crystal structures of Dpo4 in complex with primer-template DNA duplexes featuring dGTP opposite DFT at the active site as well as G or A paired with DFT at the -1 position. The structures provide insight into the different efficiencies of Dpo4 for inserting A and G opposite template-DFT and allow a rationalization of the inability of Dpo4 to further extend the primer strand after a G:DFT pair. The structure featuring an A:DFT pair also challenges the usual assumption that this pair virtually matches A:T in shape. Thus, the absence of hydrogen bonds in the former actually leads to significant changes in the local geometry of the template-primer duplex. Although Dpo4 may rely more heavily on hydrogen bonds between incoming nucleotide and template base for error-free replication compared with high fidelity polymerases, sterics clearly play a role in discriminating between A and G as the pairing partner of DFT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dpo4 was expressed in E. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as described previously (20Zang H.

Two DNA templates were used, a control 18-mer template containing T and the 18-mer containing DFT. A 13-mer primer containing A at the 3′ terminus was annealed to the template DNA so that it paired with T or DFT. Pyrophosphorolysis was initiated by addition of sodium pyrophosphate (pH 7.4; 500 μm final concentration).

Crystals of the Dpo4(DFT:13G) and Dpo4(dGTP) complexes were grown from droplets equilibrated against reservoir solutions containing 16-24% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Ca(OAc)2, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5).TABLE 3Selected crystal data, data collection, and refinement parametersParameterDpo4(DFT:13A)Dpo4(dGTP)Dpo4(DFT:13G)Type of complexPostinsertionInsertionPostinsertionCrystal data, data collection X-ray sourceAPS(DND-CAT)NSLSAPS(SER-CAT) BeamlineID-5X29ID-22 DetectorMARCCDQuantum CCDMARCCD Wavelength (Å)1.001.001.00 Temperature (K)110110110 No. of crystals111 Space groupP21P21212P21 Unit cell (a, b, and c; Å)52.14,101.87,111.0694.62,103.56,52.6452.7,186.74,52.73 (α, β, and γ; °)90,94.9,9090,90,9090,110.1,90 Resolution range (Å)50.0-2.850.0-2.9850.0-3.0 Highest resolution shellaValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shells(2.9-2.8)(3.09-2.98)(3.19-3.0) No. of measurements113,315 (10,980)31,795 (1,726)61,192 (3,171) No. of unique reflections27,671 (2,611)9,628 (863)16,865 (1,510) Redundancy4.1 (4.2)3.3 (2.0)3.6 (2.1) Completeness (%)96.6 (91.2)84.5 (81.0)87.5 (81.0) RmergebRmerge = Σhkl Σj= 1,N|〈Ihkl〉 - Ihklj|/Σhkl Σj= 1,N|Ihklj|, where the outer sum (hkl) is taken over the unique reflections7.0 (40.1)9.1 (30.0)14.2 (52.5) Signal to noise (〈I/σI〉)16.3 (3.42)14.3 (4.05)9.2 (2.0) Solvent content (%)58.954.252.05Refinement Model composition (asymmetric unit)No. of amino acid residues342/343342343/342No. of water molecules21666159No. of Ca2+ ions3/332/2No. of template nucleotides16/181618/16No. of primer nucleotides13/131313/13No. of dGTP1No. of ddCTP1/11/1RfcRf = Σhkl||Fo,hkl| - k|Fc,hkl||/Σhkl|Fo,hkl|, where |Fo,hkl| and |Fc,hkl| are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively (%)21.123.021.8RfreedRfree idem, for the set of reflections (5% of the total) omitted from the refinement process (%)24.928.229.0Estimated coordinate error (Å) Luzatti plot0.360.380.38 Luzatti plot (c-v)0.440.530.55 sA plot0.50.530.57 σA plot (c-v)0.60.720.8"
https://openalex.org/W2036397901,"Muscle cells are often exposed to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in pathological muscle and/or bone conditions. Because BMPs function as strong bone inducers as well as myogenesis inhibitors, certain molecules likely prevent muscle cells from converting into pathologic bone; without these molecules, de novo bone would form as observed in myositis ossificans traumatica. When C2C12 myoblasts are exposed to BMPs, they differentiate into osteoblastic cells but cannot mature into bone cells. As the Osterix gene, a transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation, is only transiently induced upon BMP stimulation in C2C12 cells, we hypothesized that unknown transcriptional repressor(s) inhibit Osterix expression and prevent complete osteoblastic differentiation. Gene microarray analyses were performed to identify putative inhibitors for osteoblastic differentiation, and the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Pitx2 (also termed Rieg), which plays an important regulatory role in left-right asymmetry, was identified. Pitx2 was induced 2 days after BMP stimulation in C2C12 cells in concert with Osterix down-regulation. Overexpression of Pitx2 repressed Osterix expression and subsequent osteoblastic differentiation, whereas Runx2, the most upstream regulator of osteogenesis, was unaffected. Conversely, the induction of short hairpin RNA for Pitx2 in C2C12 cells enhanced Osterix expression and osteoblastic maturation upon BMP stimulation. Moreover, mouse embryonic fibroblasts containing myoblasts from Pitx2-null embryos showed enhanced Osterix expression upon BMP stimulation. These findings suggest that Pitx2 suppresses osteogenic signals induced by BMPs in myoblasts to prevent their osteoblastic conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2087692510,"Endogenously occurring damage to DNA is a contributing factor to the onset of several genetic diseases, including cancer. Monitoring urinary levels of DNA adducts is one approach to assess genomic exposure to endogenous damage. However, metabolism and alternative routes of elimination have not been considered as factors that may limit the detection of DNA adducts in urine. We recently demonstrated that the peroxidation-derived deoxyguanosine adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythropentofuranosyl)-pyrimido[1,2-alpha]purine-10(3H)-one (M1dG), is subject to enzymatic oxidation in vivo resulting in the formation of a major metabolite, 6-oxo-M1dG. Based on the administration of [14C]M1dG (22 microCi/kg) to Sprague-Dawley rats (n=4), we now report that 6-oxo-M1dG is the principal metabolite of M1dG in vivo representing 45% of the total administered dose. When [14C]6-oxo-M1dG was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats, 6-oxo-M1dG was recovered unchanged (>97% stability). These studies also revealed that M1dG and 6-oxo-M1dG are subject to biliary elimination. Additionally, both M1dG and 6-oxo-M1dG exhibited a long residence time following administration (>48 h), and the major species observed in urine at late collections was 6-oxo-M1dG."
https://openalex.org/W1995687355,"The ability of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) to modulate various effects on distinct cell lineages has been a central feature of its multi-faceted nature. The purpose of this study was to access the effects of deletion of a key TGF-β signal transducer, Smad3, on MAPK activation and v-RasHa-transformation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We observe reduced TGF-β1 and v-rasHa mediated activation of the JNK and ERK MAPK pathway upon ablation of Smad3. Further, Smad3-deficient MEFs demonstrate resistance to v-rasHa-induced transformation while the absence of Smad3 results in increased inhibition of farnesyl transferase activity. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the absence of Smad3 protects fibroblasts from oncogenic transformation by (i) augmenting farnesyl transferase inhibition and (ii) suppressing the Ras—JNK MAPK pathway. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in v-RasHa oncogene-induced mesenchymal phenotypic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2077592900,"Voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) play diverse roles in biology. As integral components, they can detect changes in the membrane potential of a cell and couple these changes to activity of ion channels and enzymes. As independent proteins, homologues of the VSD can function as voltage-dependent proton channels. To sense voltage changes, the positively charged fourth transmembrane segment, S4, must move across the energetically unfavorable hydrophobic core of the bilayer, which presents a barrier to movement of both charged species and protons. To reduce the barrier to S4 movement, it has been suggested that aqueous crevices may penetrate the protein, reducing the extent of total movement. To investigate this hypothesis in a system containing fully functional channels in a native environment with an intact membrane potential, we have determined the contour of the membrane-aqueous border of the VSD of KvAP in Escherichia coli by examining the chemical accessibility of introduced cysteines. The results revealed the contour of the membrane-aqueous border of the VSD in its activated conformation. The water-inaccessible regions of S1 and S2 correspond to the standard width of the membrane bilayer (~28 A), but those of S3 and S4 are considerably shorter (> or = 40%), consistent with aqueous crevices pervading both the extracellular and intracellular ends. One face of S3b and the entire S3a were water-accessible, reducing the water-inaccessible region of S3 to just 10 residues, significantly shorter than for S4. The results suggest a key role for S3 in reducing the distance S4 needs to move to elicit gating."
https://openalex.org/W2006598254,"Within the ubiquitin degradation pathway, the canonical signal is a lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chain that is assembled upon an internal lysine residue of a substrate protein. Once constructed, this ubiquitin chain becomes the principle signal for recognition and target degradation by the 26S proteasome. The mechanism by which polyubiquitin chains are assembled on a substrate protein, however, has yet to be clearly defined. In an <i>in vitro</i> model system, purified E2-ubiquitin thiolester was unable to catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin chains in the absence of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. Mutagenesis of key residues within the E1 active site revealed that its conserved catalytic cysteine residue is essential for the formation of these chains. Moreover, inactivation of the E2 active site had no effect on the ability of E1 to catalyze ubiquitin chain formation. These findings strongly suggest E1 is responsible for not only the activation of ubiquitin but also for the direct catalytic extension of a lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chain."
https://openalex.org/W2002027167,"Oncogenesis is a progressive process often involving collaboration between various oncogenes and tumor suppressors. To identify those genes that collaborate with oncogenic ras, we took advantage of the Tg.AC transgenic mouse, a line that harbors the v-Ha-ras transgene and spontaneously develops an array of malignant tumors. By crossing Tg.AC mice on an inbred FVB background to other inbred strains, F1 mice were created that could be analysed using genome wide, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screens. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors and tumor cell lines marked a somatic event, possibly the inactivation of tumor suppressor gene(s). LOH could also represent DNA damage, a sign of genomic instability in the pretransformed cell. Nonetheless, the screens showed no evidence of such generalized genomic instability. Instead, they revealed a single region of LOH on chromosome 4 that occurred via somatic recombination/gene conversion, generating a region of isoparental disomy. This LOH provided a clue that linked v-Ha-ras to the inactivation of the Ink4a locus in 25 of 32 tumor cell lines. This collaboration is seen regardless of tumor type or genetic background. In contrast, tumors that develop in bitransgenic mice bearing both the v-Ha-ras gene and a heterozygous mutant p53 allele tend to retain the Ink4a locus and instead lose the p53 wild-type allele. This suggests that different strategies can be selected to collaborate with v-Ha-ras in tumorigenesis."
