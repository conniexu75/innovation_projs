https://openalex.org/W1604764621,"The superoxide dismutase (dismutase) which has already been found to be useful in detecting the role of O2·- in certain enzymic reactions has here been shown to be applicable to the study of nonenzymic reactions, as well. The aerobic oxidation of sulfate, which proceeds by a free radical chain mechanism, has been investigated with the aid of superoxide dismutase. The spontaneous oxidation of sulfite, which is catalyzed by traces of heavy metals, was unaffected by superoxide dismutase in the absence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate yet was inhibited by 1 ng per ml levels of the dismutase in the presence of EDTA. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been found to be a powerful catalyst of the aerobic oxidation of sulfite. This is a complex reaction with a mechanism which appears to change with changes in the relative concentrations of sulfite and of DMSO. When the ratio of [sulfite] to [DMSO] was high, sulfite oxidation was inhibited by dismutase. In contrast, when the ratio of [sulfite] to [DMSO] was low, dismutase stimulated the oxidation of sulfite. The effects of variation of the concentrationn of sulfite, DMSO, and oxygen on the DMSO-induced sulfite oxidation have been explored. DMSO was found to contain approximately 0.2% of an impurity which was a very effective radical scavenger. This impurity could not be eliminated by treatment with charcoal and vacuum distillation, but it could be destroyed by treatment with H2O2. The reduction of cytochrome c by sulfite and the effects of EDTA, DMSO, oxygen, and dismutase on this reduction have also been studied. The results, which have permitted clarifying deductions concerning these very complex reactions, could not have been achieved, were the superoxide dismutase not available."
https://openalex.org/W1548991782,"Abstract The protein components of human plasma very low density lipoproteins (Sf g 20) were studied following partial and total delipidation. After the neutral lipids were extracted with heptane, the resulting phospholipid-protein complexes contained at least one immunochemical reactant different from the major apoproteins of high density and low density lipoproteins. Purification required total delipidation with ethanol-ether, gel filtration, and diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. Two proteins were then isolated that differed from the proteins of high density or low density lipoproteins, and their purity was established by immunochemical analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of these had γ mobility, NH2-terminal threonine, COOH-terminal valine, and no tyrosine, histidine, cysteine, or cystine. The second, α2-migrating protein had NH2-terminal serine, COOH-terminal alanine, and no isoleucine, cysteine, or cystine. These two proteins constituted approximately half of the total protein in very low density lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1565879498,"Abstract Guanyl cyclase, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate from guanosine triphosphate, has been identified in a variety of animal tissues. Conditions were established under which formation of cyclic GMP was proportional to the amount of enzyme added and to incubation time. The enzyme differs markedly from adenyl cyclase in a number of respects. It is largely soluble in most tissues studied whereas adenyl cyclase is particulate. The relative distribution of the two cyclase activities among several tissues is quite different. In broken cell preparations, guanyl cyclase activity is not stimulated by fluoride, glucagon, or epinephrine under conditions where adenyl cyclase activity is stimulated. The activity of both guanyl cyclase and adenyl cyclase is greater in the presence of Mn++ than Mg++, but the effect of Mn++ is much more striking with guanyl cyclase. The enzyme has a pH optimum between 7.4 and 8.0. The apparent Km for GTP is between 0.02 and 0.1 mm and that for Mn++ is about 0.5 mm. Guanyl cyclase is heat-labile and inhibited by a number of nucleotides including dGTP, ATP, ADP, and ITP, and by P-enolpyruvate and oxalacetate. Zn++, Cd++ and Hg++ inhibit guanyl cyclase in a manner that is prevented by SH reagents. Preliminary attempts to purify the enzyme by conventional techniques have yielded a purification of about 20-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1642400962,"The roles of synthesis and degradation in the regulation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase levels in rat liver following fasting and fat-free feeding have been studied. Antibodies prepared to homogeneous chicken liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase were shown to cross-react with rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Enzyme from both species was totally inactivated as well as precipitated by this antibody preparation. Furthermore, quantitative precipitin curves and equivalence point determinations indicated that enzymes from the two species were precipitated in equal quantity by antibody and that the two enzymes had identical turnover numbers. It was also shown that disaggregated, aggregated, and palmityl-CoA-treated enzyme were all equally precipitated by antibody. Immunological analysis of crude homogenates of rat liver from animals treated with different diets, which had specific activities for acetyl-CoA carboxylase varying over 25-fold indicated that there was a constant amount of immunologically precipitable enzyme per unit of enzyme activity. The changes in acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity measured after dietary alteration result from changes in the enzyme content of liver rather than from activation or inhibition of preformed enzyme. The relative rates of acetyl-CoA carboxylase synthesis were determined by quantitative precipitation of the enzyme by antibody after pulse labeling with 3H-leucine. There was a 5- to 10-fold increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis after fat-free feeding of previously fasted rats. The rate of degradation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rats fed a fat-free diet was found to be first order with a t½ of approximately 48 hours, whereas in fasted rats a t½ of 18 hours was obtained. In rats fed a 12% fat diet the rate of acetyl-CoA carboxylase degradation was similar to that found in animals fed a fat-free diet, whereas the rate of synthesis was diminished, thus suggesting that independent factors regulate the rates of acetyl-CoA carboxylase synthesis and degradation in rat liver."

https://openalex.org/W1534736958,"Abstract The discovery of an abnormal hemoglobin variant (hemoglobin Richmond) in several members of a Negro family is reported. Structural analyses indicated a replacement of asparaginyl residue G4(102)β by a lysyl residue, while no other abnormality has been found. Carriers of this hemoglobin abnormality are clinically and hematologically normal; oxygen dissociation curves of total blood and of red cell hemolysates from carriers do not differ significantly from those observed for normal individuals. Hb Richmond is able to form asymmetric hybrid hemoglobins of the αaαxβrβx type with various human hemoglobin variants; these hybrids are readily detectable by electrophoresis at pH 9.0. Formation of these hybrids was most pronounced at low temperature. The tetrameric hemoglobin dissociates readily into dimeric subunits in NaCl solutions of moderate ionic strength, at which hemoglobin A does not dissociate significantly. A similar phenomenon was also observed in buffers of both low and high pH."

https://openalex.org/W1555803803,"An examination of three inbred strains of mice differing with respect to liver and kidney catalase activity reveals two distinct genetic factors controlling the level of liver catalase activity. The first genetic factor controls the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Specific activity of purified enzyme from C57BL/6 and C57BL/Ha strains is 60% that of the DBA/2 strain. The second factor controls the content of liver catalase. Liver catalase of CS7BL/Ha is degraded in vivo at a rate one-half that of liver catalase of DBA/2 and C57BL/6, resulting in the accumulation of twice as many catalase molecules in C57BL/Ha. The factor affecting turnover of catalase is apparently specific for catalase of liver since no differences exist in kidney catalase levels between C57BL/Ha and C57BL/6. Furthermore, this factor does not appear to alter the metabolism of peroxisomes or of liver protein since no substantial differences are observed among the strains with respect to liver urate oxidase activity levels and the turnover rate of liver protein. It is particularly significant that the genetic factor affecting the amount of liver catalase does so by altering the rate of catalase degradation rather than the rate of synthesis, confirming the previously published report of Rechcigl and Heston (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 27, 119 (1967)). Thus, these studies emphasize that the quantity of an enzyme in animal cells is a balance between the rate of synthesis and the rate of degradation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1842081329,"Abstract We have studied the effects of bilirubin on respiration, respiratory control, oxidative phosphorylation, and swelling of mitochondria from rat liver, bovine heart, and brain of chick, rabbit, and monkey. Low (l∼20 µm) concentrations of bilirubin increase and high concentrations (g50 µm) decrease the respiration of liver or heart mitochondria. This biphasic effect is not observed in brain mitochondria, in which respiration is always inhibited by bilirubin. Bilirubin in micromolar concentrations abolishes respiratory control, uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, and induces swelling of mitochondria. The bilirubin-induced swelling is irreversible and its amplitude is large. The swelling process requires a monovalent cation, any permeable anion, Mg++, and energy. The energy may be supplied from the oxidation of a substrate by the respiratory chain or from external ATP. Swelling measured by the decrease of absorbance at 590 mµ is parallel to the increase of water content and packed volume of mitochondria. In the absence of Mg++, a damped oscillation occurs which lowers the amplitude. The swelling is also accompanied by proton ejection to the medium. When ATP is used as an energy source, liberation of inorganic phosphate follows the pattern of swelling with a short initial lag. The Km value (50% of the maximum) of bilirubin for the over-all swelling is about 2.5 µm in liver mitochondria and is approximately 2 µm (about 0.1 mg of bilirubin per 100 ml) in brain mitochondria. Bovine serum albumin prevents uncoupling and swelling; estimation from the titration curves for either process gives a molar ratio of 1 for bilirubin to albumin. A probable role of bilirubin in affecting mitochondrial reactions is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1645507251,"Abstract The conditions required for identification of the translocation of adenine nucleotides as an exchange-diffusion process in rat liver mitochondria have been determined. Among them, the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the medium and a temperature not higher than 0° are the most critical ones. Experiments performed with a phosphonic analogue of ADP, namely adenosine 5'-methylene diphosphonate, indicate that all of the adenine nucleotides within mitochondria are exchangeable. The rate of exchange exhibits oscillation-like fluctuations immediately after ADP has been added to mitochondria. Similar fluctuations of the amount of ∼P bonds in internal adenine nucleotides suggest that the exchange rate may be dependent on the phosphorylation pattern of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotides. The apparent Km of the nucleotide-exchange system for extramitochondrial ADP is 5.6 µM in an EDTA-supplemented medium. It rises to 17 µM when EDTA is replaced by MgCl2. The adenine nucleotide translocation exhibits a Q10 of 10 to 12 below 10° and of 2 to 3 above 10°. By contrast the Q10 of the phosphorylation of mitochondrial ADP is 2 to 3 within the temperature range 0–25°. Small amounts of CDP, GDP, and UDP (after any contamination by adenine nucleotides has been eliminated) are taken up by mitochondria via an atractyloside-insensitive process. On the other hand, dADP and the phosphonic analogues of ADP and ATP are exchanged with the mitochondrial adenine nucleotides via an atractyloside-sensitive process; the latter exchanges are competitively inhibited by ADP. The translocation of ADP, and much more significantly the translocations of dADP and adenosine 5'-methylene diphosphonate, are stimulated by the addition of inorganic phosphate in the medium. These results are discussed on the basis of a preferential exchange between the internal ATP generated within mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation and the extramitochondrial ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1547928236,"Abstract The mechanism by which the levulinate locus (Lv) regulates the tissue activity of δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase in mice has been examined. The assayable hepatic enzyme activity in homozygous Lvb mouse strains represented by C57B1/6 is between one-third and one-half that of homozygous Lva strains. This difference in enzyme activity is due to a difference in amount of enzyme protein as demonstrated by immunochemical techniques with an antibody specific for δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase. Combined immunochemical and isotopic techniques show that the levulinate locus regulates the concentration of hepatic δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase by acting at the level of enzyme synthesis. The rate of degradation of hepatic enzyme is the same in both low and high activity strains; when expressed as a half-life, this is equal to 5 to 6 days. The pattern of δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase development with age is similar in livers of both low and high activity strains. The specific activity of the enzyme is high in fetal liver, decreases during the several days prior to birth, and increases to the adult level during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life. The activity of δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase in fetal liver is also regulated by the levulinate locus. The enzyme in fetal liver is approximately twice as active catalytically as the enzyme in adult liver relative to its function as an antigen. The fetal enzyme also appears to be different in stability to heat and proteolytic inactivation. However, fetal and adult enzymes are similar by other physiochemical criteria, including electrophoretic mobility, sedimentation coefficient, and Km for the substrate."

Its presence was correlated with the occurrence of felinie leukemia virus demonstrable by electron microscopy. The one clinically normal cat giving a positive test for feline leukemia virus antigen belonged to a household in which two cats had developed lymphosarcoma.

https://openalex.org/W1596107265,"Abstract Physical, chemical, and immunological properties and association-dissociation behavior of various molecular forms of free normal light chains of human immunoglobulin have been examined. Free light chains were isolated from the urine of both normal individuals and patients with tubular proteinuria by means of ultrafiltration, zone electrophoresis, gel chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. The yield of purified chains from each liter of pooled normal urine was, on the average, 0.7 mg (approximately 20% of the amount present). The quantities obtained from the patients were 4 to 30 times higher. Examinations by ultracentrifugation, gel chromatography, and starch gel electrophoresis in nondissociating and in dissociating media revealed that light chains from the two sources consisted of monomers, noncovalently linked dimers, covalently linked dimers, and tetramers. The various species showed some tendency to associate and (or) dissociate. Free chains from the patients had a relatively high content of dimers and tetramers. Immunological examinations and amino acid analyses indicated higher ratios of κ chain to λ chain in noncovalently linked dimers and monomers than in covalently linked dimers. In the dimers, there was a highly specific pairing of chains with the same antigenic type and, apparently, the same or similar electrophoretic mobility. The above results, in conjunction with values for the sedimentation coefficients, Stokes' radii, diffusion coefficients, molecular weights, and frictional ratios, provide strong support for a previous suggestion that free normal light chains of human immunoglobulin are counterparts to Bence-Jones proteins."

https://openalex.org/W350551141,"Abstract Studies on the degradation of DNA, alkylated with methylmethanesulfonate, by endonuclease II of Escherichia coli are presented. With a DNA gel assay, some of the kinetics of degradation have been examined. With extensively alkylated DNA, only a limited number of double-strand breaks were made. Activity was maximum over a pH range from 8.0 to 9.0. No absolute requirement for added divalent metals was observed. The rate of the reaction was stimulated by added Mg2+ or Mn2+, but was not inhibited by 8-hydroxyquinoline or several other chelating agents. An exception was ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Sulfhydryl reagents and high ionic strength inhibited the enzyme while transfer RNA and caffeine did not. An approximate sedimentation coefficient was 3.6. With lightly alkylated DNA, the enzyme made predominantly single-stranded breaks, and the ratio of single-to double-strand breaks was approximately 3.7:1. It is concluded that the enzyme can hydrolyze a phosphodiester bond near an alkylated base in a native DNA molecule which has no single-strand breaks in this region. With more extensively alkylated DNA, viscosity experiments, which measure double-strand breaks, give an n value of approximately 1. The activity of endonuclease II of E. coli on several species of native nonalkylated DNA has also been studied. The enzyme makes a limited number of single-strand breaks, with T4 DNA, approximately 3 to 4 per single-strand. Several factors which affect the reaction of the purified enzyme with alkylated DNA also affect the reaction with nonalkylated DNA. These are no absolute metal requirement, normal enzyme activity with 8-hydroxyquinoline but enzyme inhibition by EDTA, and no inhibition by tRNA. There was no induction of an enzyme with properties of endonuclease II after infection with T4. Enzyme activity was present in a series of mutants deficient in the ultraviolet repair process, in recombination, in DNA synthesis at elevated temperatures, and in host cell restriction as well as in a strain sensitive to methylmethanesulfonate."
https://openalex.org/W1508687943,"Abstract The metal ion requirement of the phosphoglucomutase reaction is satisfied by Mg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, or Zn2+. The relative activities elicited, by these metals are 100, 60, 15, 5, 0.8, and 0.3, respectively, at pH 7.4 and saturating substrate; the relative activity of enzyme extensively dialyzed against EDTA type chelating agents is less than 0.001 under the same conditions but the expected activity is restored on addition of stoichiometric amounts of Co2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ or by treatment with millimolar Mg2+. A differential effect of pH on the competitive binding of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ is observed; the differential effect may be caused by metal-dependent differences in pKa of two groups in the enzyme·metal complex which are not directly involved in metal binding. Two different types of pH effects on the activity of the various enzyme·metal complexes were observed: plots of log Vmax against pH for the Mg2+ enzyme were flat in the neutral pH range with down turns at extremes of pH; for the Co2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ enzymes, such curves were sigmoidal with inflections in the neutral pH range. It thus seems possible that the rate-controlling step differs in the two different cases."

https://openalex.org/W1481257192,"Abstract Cartilage from chick embryos was incubated with 14C-proline and puromycin in order to prepare puromycin peptides which were substrates for the synthesis of 14C-hydroxyproline with protocollagen proline hydroxylase. Stable enzyme-substrate complexes were recovered when the substrate was mixed with the enzyme and the mixtures were examined by gel filtration. Although ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and ferrous iron are required for catalytic activity, formation of the enzyme-substrate complexes did not require addition of the cofactors or cosubstrates to dialyzed enzyme. Formation of the complexes was reduced but not prevented by EDTA in concentrations which inhibited catalytic activity. Under the conditions used, the enzyme in the isolated complexes was readily saturated with substrate, but it was difficult to saturate the substrate with enzyme. With high concentrations of enzyme relative to substrate, the initial velocity for the reaction was greater than the initial velocity observed with the isolated enzyme-substrate complexes, suggesting that 1 molecule of polypeptide substrate could bind more than 1 molecule of enzyme. The enzyme-substrate complexes were in equilibrium with free enzyme and substrate, since addition of a competing polypeptide produced a dissociation of the initial complexes and a rapid inhibition of the hydroxylation of the substrate. Most of the substrate was still recovered in the enzyme-substrate complexes under conditions in which the over-all concentration of substrate was about 100 pm polypeptide. Since the enzyme appeared to be saturated with substrate under these conditions, the results suggested that the dissociation constant for the complexes expressed in terms of the molar concentration of substrate polypeptides was probably less than 100 pm. The affinity of the enzyme for substrate decreased after partial hydroxylation of the substrate. After one-sixth of the available 14C-proline in the substrate was converted to 14C-hydroxyproline, it was no longer possible to demonstrate enzyme-substrate complexes in the gel filtration column. Previous kinetic measurements demonstrated that the enzyme has a higher affinity for large polypeptides than for small ones of the same structure, and that a single encounter between enzyme and a large polypeptide probably involves a large segment of the polypeptide. The present results indicate that multiple encounters between enzyme and substrate are necessary to complete the hydroxylation of polypeptide substrates with molecular weights of up to 100,000. Since the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate decreases after partial hydroxylation of the substrate, the introduction of the final few hydroxyl groups into large polypeptide substrates apparently does not proceed as readily as the introduction of the first few hydroxyl groups."

https://openalex.org/W1612597812,"Abstract The bifunctional protein complex, cysteine synthetase, in Salmonella typhimurium is composed of the enzymes serine transacetylase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. A point mutation (BB1) in the structural gene for serine transacetylase results in diminished catalytic activity of both components of the complex. Enzyme inactivation studies using either specific O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase antiserum or heat show that the isolated O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of the mutant are indistinguishable from wild type O-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase. When O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from either wild type or mutant source is combined with serine transacetylase from a common source, their behavior is identical as measured by decrement in enzymic activity, immunological inactivation, and heat inactivation. Thus, when hybrid cysteine synthetases, composed of one component from the wild type and one from the mutant, are investigated, the O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of such hybrid complexes behave like those found in the native cysteine synthetase from which the serine transacetylase component was derived. These studies establish that the diminished catalytic activity of the sulfhydrylase of the mutant results from the association of catalytically normal O-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase with mutant serine transacetylase. The basis of the pleiotropic phenotype of mutant BB1 is, therefore, an alteration in protein-protein interaction resulting from a structural gene mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1498731981,"The kinetics of oxidative phosphorylation of extramitochondrial (external) ADP and intramitochondrial (internal) ADP and AMP has been studied under conditions required for the exchange-diffusion of adenine nucleotides through mitochondrial membranes (ethylenediaminetetraacetate-supplemented medium at 0°) and under conditions favoring the leakage of internal adenine nucleotides (Mg++-supplemented medium). By means of atractyloside, it is possible to show that under conditions of exchange-diffusion the kinetics of phosphorylation of internal ADP and AMP is not altered by the addition of ADP to mitochondria and is independent of the phosphorylation of external ADP. Internal ADP and AMP are converted into ATP through a three-step process which successively involves first a rapid oxidative phosphorylation of the internal ADP and ATP, second a transient plateau phase, and finally a conversion of AMP into ATP. The oxidative phosphorylation of external ADP starts after a lag period which corresponds to the time interval required for the oxidative phosphorylation of the internal ADP into ATP. The conversion of the internal AMP into ATP proceeds by two coupled reactions, namely an ATP-dependent transphosphorylation of AMP into ADP and the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. As suggested by the data of 32P-labeling experiments, the enzymatic systems catalyzing the two above mentioned coupled reactions are structurally and functionally linked to form a complex which catalyzes the over-all conversion of AMP into ATP in a cyclic manner. The ATP which is the phosphate donor for the transphosphorylation reaction is not the free ATP pre-existing in mitochondria, but the ATP produced by the complex itself; on the other hand, the ADP formed as a transient intermediate in the AMP-ATP conversion is immediately phosphorylated to give ATP without mixing with the free internal ADP. These data point to a compartmentalization of the enzymatic complex involved in the AMP-ATP conversion. Addition of magnesium ions to mitochondria incubated in a standard medium for oxidative phosphorylation (supplemented with O2, phosphate, and oxidizable substrate) results in a leakage of internal adenine nucleotides. This leakage is slowed by inhibitors or uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation or by a low temperature, but not by atractyloside; ATP is preferentially released compared to ADP and AMP. The adenine nucleotides released outside mitochondria are rapidly exchanged with those remaining inside mitochondria. Since the exchange is much faster than the release, the distribution patterns of the adenine nucleotides remaining inside mitochondria or released outside mitochondria are similar; for instance under the conditions of oxidative phosphorylation, the same high level of ATP is found inside and outside mitochondria. The effect of atractyloside on the apparent efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation of internal adenine nucleotides is discussed with respect to the above data."

https://openalex.org/W1518434992,"Abstract An N-substituted aminoacyl transfer RNA hydrolase (ribonuclease free) has been isolated, purified 230-fold, and crystallized from yeast supernatant. The purified enzyme is activated by 10-3 and 10-2 m MgCl2 and strongly inhibited by 10-1 m MgCl2. The hydrolase is also strongly inhibited by 10-2 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the inhibition can be completely overcome with 10-2 m MgCl2. The yeast hydrolase is competitively inhibited by uncharged yeast tRNA. Purified yeast ribosomal RNA does not inhibit the enzyme. The hydrolase does not show a strict species specificity since the tRNA of both yeast and Escherichia coli can be used to form substrate. N-Acetyl-valyl-adenosine is not a substrate for the hydrolase and N-acetyl-valyl-oligonucleotide is hydrolyzed very slowly. Although the free aminoacyl-tRNAs tested are resistant or very slowly hydrolyzed, the derivatives N-acetylaminoacyl-tRNA, N-benzoyl-glycyl-glycyl-phenylalanyl-tRNA, and N-benzoyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-phenylalanyl-tRNA are all readily hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme. Yeast oligolysyl-tRNA is very slowly hydrolyzed by the enzyme. N-Substituted amino acids and tRNAs are the products of hydrolysis of N-substituted aminoacyl-tRNAs. Enzymatically deacylated tRNAs can be recharged with their corresponding amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1553535293,"Abstract The purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PN-phosphorylase) from spores and vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus were each purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The turnover numbers for the spore and vegetative cell enzymes were 145 and 181 moles of inosine cleaved per mole of enzyme per sec, respectively. The PN-phosphorylase from vegetative cells was more anionic than that from the spores during gel electrophoresis in low concentrations of phosphate buffer. The Stokes' radii and sedimentation constants of the vegetative cell enzyme were constant over a wide range of phosphate concentrations. However, these parameters of the spore enzyme were concentration-dependent with respect to phosphate ion. The spore and vegetative cell enzymes were identical in mobility in acrylamide gel electrophoresis and heat resistance only at phosphate concentrations above the Michaelis constants for orthophosphate (7.3 x 10-3 m and 5.1 x 10-3 m, respectively). The molecular weight of the spore enzyme increased from 87,000 to 123,000 while that of the vegetative cell enzyme remained at 107,000 over the phosphate concentration range 0 to 0.05 m. The half-life of spore PN-phosphorylase at 60° was 25 min in the absence of phosphate, but decreased to 5 min in 0.05 m phosphate, the value characteristic of the vegetative cell PN-phosphorylase."

https://openalex.org/W1584277803,"Abstract The ratio of two species of tyrosine acceptor transfer RNA, tRNAtyri and tRNAtyrii, changes dramatically during growth of Bacillus subtilis W168 in various media. Tyrosyl-tRNAi and tyrosyl-tRNAii, as well as tRNAtyri and tRNAtyrii, are resolved by methylated albumin-Kieselguhr chromatography. The alteration may be due to selective transcription of structural genes or by subsequent modification of one species of tRNAtyr. Methods used to effect interconversion of tRNAtyri and tRNAtyrii in vitro were not successful. Both species of tRNAtyr are recognized by the same aminoacyltRNA synthetase and are acylated and deacylated (enzymatically or nonenzymatically) at similar rates. Both species transfer tyrosine into polypeptides in response to poly (U2, A) and poly (U, A, C) in the Escherichia coli S-30 system and exhibit similar magnesium optima for transfer in vitro of tyrosine into polypeptides. Differential usage of tyrosyl-tRNAi and tyrosyl-tRNAii in vivo seems unlikely because the ratio of the two species bound to polysomes reflects their ratio in bulk tRNA. The possibility that biological significance could be ascribed to the alteration of the relative amounts of tRNAtyri and tRNAtyrii has not been completely eliminated; nevertheless, it was not apparent in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1594087160,"Abstract 1. Lysosomal acid RNase was partially purified from a rat liver homogenate and a lysosomal fraction. This RNase, of optimum pH 5 to 6, cleaved RNA to form nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphates, which were hydrolyzed to nucleoside 3'-monophosphates. This enzyme was heat-labile and had a molecular weight of about 24,000 to 28,000, as estimated by gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-60. This lysosomal acid RNase activity was not found in the supernatant of normal rat liver. 2. The location of this lysosomal RNase in the isolated subcellular fractions derived from normal liver was different from that found in fractions obtained from precancerous liver induced by 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene. In the latter, the activity was proved to be present in the supernatant fraction, as well as in the lysosomal fraction, as indicated by column chromatography and other enzymological studies. 3. Another acid RNase may be present in the supernatant fraction, although it could not be separated from the alkaline RNase of this fraction. This soluble acid RNase differed from lysosomal acid RNase in molecular weight and in the effects of various compounds on its activity. 4. The effects of ions and other compounds on the two acid RNases and rat liver alkaline RNase were compared. Lysosomal acid RNase was strongly inhibited by ZnCl2, CuCl2, and HgCl2, whereas the other RNases were inhibited only slightly by these ions. 5. Ribosomes from rat liver did not inhibit lysosomal acid RNase, alkaline RNase from rat liver of Escherichia coli RNase I, although E. coli RNase I was inhibited by E. coli ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1482468895,"Abstract Inbred weanling rats were maintained on diets containing low (6%), medium (18%), and high (40%) levels of proteins. After 45 days they were killed and the activities of histidine ammonia lyase, urocanase, and histidine pyruvate aminotransferase in liver were assayed. Histidine ammonia lyase increased with age of the rat, and the increase was proportional to the level of protein in the diet. Animals on a low protein diet surviving the feeding period had negligible histidine ammonia lyase activity. In contrast, epidermal histidine ammonia lyase decreased with the growth of the animals and was highest in the group on a low protein diet. Hepatic urocanase activity did not show significant changes during growth, but the levels of the enzymes in animals receiving a high protein diet were higher than in animals on a low protein diet. In contrast to histidine ammonia lyase and urocanase, histidine pyruvate aminotransferase levels changed neither with growth nor with the protein level of the diet. Induction of histidine ammonia lyase and urocanase could be demonstrated in protein-depleted adult rats by administering casein hydrolysate along with histidine by intubation. In a 24-hour forced feeding period, histidine ammonia lyase levels showed a 2-fold increase over the starting activity. The pattern of response of male and female rats to induction was similar. Induction was inhibited by ethionine. Concurrent administration of glucose with the inducer repressed the levels of histidine ammonia lyase. Up to 1 g of the enzymic digest of casein was required to bring about optimal activity of induction. However, 50 mg of the same digest were adequate for induction when fed along with 200 mg of l-histidine hydrochloride."

https://openalex.org/W1520683588,"The repressible alkaline phosphatase in Neurospora crassa was investigated with respect to a number of its enzymatic properties. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and its structural analogue, N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid, stimulate the activity of this enzyme. This stimulation by EDTA is not associated with a measurable change in the pK of a protein functional group that is essential for enzymatic activity, as evidenced by kinetic data obtained over a pH range between 5.6 and 10.6. A number of other chelating agents that were tested did not stimulate the activity of this phosphatase, although several caused inactivation in the absence of substrate. The enzyme is more stable toward denaturation in the presence of certain divalent cations such as Mg2+ or Zn2+. Under a variety of experimental conditions, these metal ions can also facilitate the recovery of phosphatase activity after exposure to various denaturing agents. Although metal-binding sites on the alkaline phosphatase seem to be involved in the maintenance and restoration of its active structure, an absolute metal requirement for phosphatase activity remains in doubt."

Her exact provenance was unknown, as she had been rescued from some peasant farmers and brought in by her rescuer. At the time of her arrival at the centre, her second milk molars were just erupting. In 1968, after reaching adult status, she shared a cage with an adult male of the same species for several months, but mating was not actually observed."
https://openalex.org/W1524052095,"Abstract 4H-Pyran-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, an analogue of dipicolinic acid, has been shown to completely replace dipicolinic acid in restoring normal sporulation to an aspartic semialdehyde pyruvate-condensing enzyme-less (hence dipicolinate-less) mutant of Bacillus megaterium. A large number of other, related, compounds were unable to replace dipicolinic acid. In the case of the pyran compound, the mutant culture invariably produced spores with a higher density and greater heat stability than in the presence of dipicolinic acid. Furthermore, the sporulation rate was increased. Spores of both the wild and mutant types are destabilized by lysozyme without prior treatment."

For the first 7 days the only telemetered signs of a progressive general decline were falling brain temperature and lowered central venous pressure, which occurred in the last 3 days of flight. Fluid loss in flight was high, caused initially by sweating and later by diuresis, and appeared to arise in redistribution of blood in visceral pools as a consequence of weightlessness. Death occurred suddenly 12 hours after the flight and was caused by ventricular fibrillation."
