https://openalex.org/W2040942754,"Wnt regulation of beta-catenin degradation is essential for development and carcinogenesis. beta-catenin degradation is initiated upon amino-terminal serine/threonine phosphorylation, which is believed to be performed by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in complex with tumor suppressor proteins Axin and adnomatous polyposis coli (APC). Here we describe another Axin-associated kinase, whose phosphorylation of beta-catenin precedes and is required for subsequent GSK-3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin. This ""priming"" kinase is casein kinase Ialpha (CKIalpha). Depletion of CKIalpha inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation and causes abnormal embryogenesis associated with excessive Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Our study uncovers distinct roles and steps of beta-catenin phosphorylation, identifies CKIalpha as a component in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and has implications to pathogenesis/therapeutics of human cancers and diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2154540205,"In Arabidopsis, RPM1 confers resistance against Pseudomonas syringae expressing either of two sequence unrelated type III effectors, AvrRpm1 or AvrB. An RPM1-interacting protein (RIN4) coimmunoprecipitates from plant cell extracts with AvrB, AvrRpm1, or RPM1. Reduction of RIN4 protein levels inhibits both the hypersensitive response and the restriction of pathogen growth controlled by RPM1. RIN4 reduction causes diminution of RPM1. RIN4 reduction results in heightened resistance to virulent Peronospora parasitica and P. syringae, and ectopic defense gene expression. Thus, RIN4 positively regulates RPM1-mediated resistance yet is, formally, a negative regulator of basal defense responses. AvrRpm1 and AvrB induce RIN4 phosphorylation. This may enhance RIN4 activity as a negative regulator of plant defense, facilitating pathogen growth. RPM1 may ""guard"" against pathogens that use AvrRpm1 and AvrB to manipulate RIN4 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2011522975,"Mutations in the Artemis protein in humans result in hypersensitivity to DNA double-strand break-inducing agents and absence of B and T lymphocytes (radiosensitive severe combined immune deficiency [RS-SCID]). Here, we report that Artemis forms a complex with the 469 kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) in the absence of DNA. The purified Artemis protein alone possesses single-strand-specific 5' to 3' exonuclease activity. Upon complex formation, DNA-PKcs phosphorylates Artemis, and Artemis acquires endonucleolytic activity on 5' and 3' overhangs, as well as hairpins. Finally, the Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex can open hairpins generated by the RAG complex. Thus, DNA-PKcs regulates Artemis by both phosphorylation and complex formation to permit enzymatic activities that are critical for the hairpin-opening step of V(D)J recombination and for the 5' and 3' overhang processing in nonhomologous DNA end joining."

Between 45% and 60% of human gastric cancer cells do not significantly express RUNX3 due to hemizygous deletion and hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter region. Tumorigenicity of human gastric cancer cell lines in nude mice was inversely related to their level of RUNX3 expression, and a mutation (R122C) occurring within the conserved Runt domain abolished the tumor-suppressive effect of RUNX3, suggesting that a lack of RUNX3 function is causally related to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2125920059,"OLIG1 and OLIG2 are basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors expressed in the pMN domain of the spinal cord, which sequentially generates motoneurons and oligodendrocytes. In Olig1/2 double-mutant mice, motoneurons are largely eliminated, and oligodendrocyte differentiation is abolished. Lineage tracing data suggest that Olig1(-/-)2(-/-) pMN progenitors instead generate V2 interneurons and then astrocytes. This apparent conversion likely reflects independent roles for OLIG1/2 in specifying motoneuron and oligodendrocyte fates. Olig genes therefore couple neuronal and glial subtype specification, unlike proneural bHLH factors that control the neuron versus glia decision. Our results suggest that in the spinal cord, Olig and proneural genes comprise a combinatorial code for the specification of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the three fundamental cell types of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2128464557,"The oligodendrocyte lineage genes Olig1 and Olig2 encode related bHLH proteins that are coexpressed in neural progenitors. Targeted disruption of these two genes sheds light on the ontogeny of oligodendroglia and genetic requirements for their development from multipotent CNS progenitors. Olig2 is required for oligodendrocyte and motor neuron specification in the spinal cord. Olig1 has roles in development and maturation of oligodendrocytes, evident especially within the brain. Both Olig genes contribute to neural pattern formation. Neither Olig gene is required for astrocytes. These findings, together with fate mapping analysis of Olig-expressing cells, indicate that oligodendrocytes are derived from Olig-specified progenitors that give rise also to neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1991664409,"The extent to which primitive embryonic blood progenitors contribute to definitive lymphoid-myeloid hematopoiesis in the adult remains uncertain. In an effort to characterize factors that distinguish the definitive adult hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and primitive progenitors derived from yolk sac or embryonic stem (ES) cells, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of HoxB4, a homeotic selector gene implicated in self-renewal of definitive HSCs. Expression of HoxB4 in primitive progenitors combined with culture on hematopoietic stroma induces a switch to the definitive HSC phenotype. These progenitors engraft lethally irradiated adults and contribute to long-term, multilineage hematopoiesis in primary and secondary recipients. Our results suggest that primitive HSCs are poised to become definitive HSCs and that this transition can be promoted by HoxB4 expression. This strategy for blood engraftment enables modeling of hematopoietic transplantation from ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021550815,"Hox transcription factors have emerged as important regulators of primitive hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. In particular, HOXB4 appears to be a strong positive regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Here we demonstrate the potency of HOXB4 to enable high-level ex vivo HSC expansion. Cultures of nontransduced or GFP-transduced murine bone marrow cells experienced large HSC losses over 10–14 days. In sharp contrast, cultures of HOXB4-transduced cells achieved rapid, extensive, and highly polyclonal HSC expansions, resulting in over 1000-fold higher levels relative to controls and a 40-fold net HSC increase. Importantly, these HSCs retained full lympho-myeloid repopulating potential and enhanced in vivo regenerative potential, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving significant ex vivo expansion of HSCs without functional impairment."

https://openalex.org/W2108931314,"Immune-deficient Rag2(-/-) mice were used as nuclear donors for transfer into enucleated oocytes, and the resulting blastocysts were cultured to isolate an isogenic embryonic stem cell line. One of the mutated alleles in the Rag2(-/-) ES cells was repaired by homologous recombination, thereby restoring normal Rag2 gene structure. Mutant mice were treated with the repaired ES cells in two ways. (1) Immune-competent mice were generated from the repaired ES cells by tetraploid embryo complementation and were used as bone marrow donors for transplantation. (2) Hematopoietic precursors were derived by in vitro differentiation from the repaired ES cells and engrafted into mutant mice. Mature myeloid and lymphoid cells as well as immunoglobulins became detectable 3-4 weeks after transplantation. Our results establish a paradigm for the treatment of a genetic disorder by combining therapeutic cloning with gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2139739677,"Wnt/Wingless signaling controls many fundamental processes during animal development. Wnt transduction is mediated by the association of β-catenin with nuclear TCF DNA binding factors. Here we report the identification of two segment polarity genes in Drosophila, legless (lgs), and pygopus (pygo), and we show that their products are required for Wnt signal transduction at the level of nuclear β-catenin. Lgs encodes the homolog of human BCL9, and we provide genetic and molecular evidence that these proteins exert their function by physically linking Pygo to β-catenin. Our results suggest that the recruitment of Pygo permits β-catenin to transcriptionally activate Wnt target genes and raise the possibility that a deregulation of these events may play a causal role in the development of B cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2018458016,"Dynamic regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors represents a primary mechanism for controlling synaptic strength, though mechanisms for this process are poorly understood. The palmitoylated postsynaptic density protein, PSD-95, regulates synaptic plasticity and associates with the AMPA receptor trafficking protein, stargazin. Here, we identify palmitate cycling on PSD-95 at the synapse and find that palmitate turnover on PSD-95 is regulated by glutamate receptor activity. Acutely blocking palmitoylation disperses synaptic clusters of PSD-95 and causes a selective loss of synaptic AMPA receptors. We also find that rapid glutamate-mediated AMPA receptor internalization requires depalmitoylation of PSD-95. In a nonneuronal model system, clustering of PSD-95, stargazin, and AMPA receptors is also regulated by ongoing palmitoylation of PSD-95 at the plasma membrane. These studies suggest that palmitate cycling on PSD-95 can regulate synaptic strength and regulates aspects of activity-dependent plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W4239945442,"Rac, a member of the Rho family of monomeric GTPases, is an integrator of intracellular signaling in a wide range of cellular processes. We have purified a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-sensitive activator of Rac from neutrophil cytosol. It is an abundant, 185 kDa guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which we cloned and named P-Rex1. The recombinant enzyme has Rac-GEF activity that is directly, substantially, and synergistically activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Gbetagammas both in vitro and in vivo. P-Rex1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced endogenous P-Rex1 expression and C5a-stimulated reactive oxygen species formation in a neutrophil-like cell line. P-Rex1 appears to be a coincidence detector in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Gbetagamma signaling pathways that is particularly adapted to function downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins in neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2168256871,"The secreted signaling molecule Hedgehog regulates gene expression in target cells in part by preventing proteolysis of the full-length Cubitus interruptus (Ci-155) transcriptional activator to the Ci-75 repressor form. Ci-155 proteolysis depends on phosphorylation at three sites by Protein Kinase A (PKA). We show that these phosphoserines prime further phosphorylation at adjacent Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) and Casein Kinase I (CK1) sites. Alteration of the GSK3 or CK1 sites prevents Ci-155 proteolysis and activates Ci in the absence of Hedgehog. Ci-155 proteolysis is also inhibited if cells lack activity of the Drosophila GSK3, Shaggy, previously implicated in Wingless signaling. Conversely, Ci-155 levels are reduced in Hedgehog-responding cells by overexpression of PKA and the Drosophila CK1, Double-time, a regulator of circadian rhythms."

https://openalex.org/W1994332160,"We have identified mutations in Drosophila endophilin to study its function in vivo. Endophilin is required presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction, and absence of Endophilin dramatically impairs endocytosis in vivo. Mutant larvae that lack Endophilin fail to take up FM1-43 dye in synaptic boutons, indicating an inability to retrieve synaptic membrane. This defect is accompanied by an expansion of the presynaptic membrane, and a depletion of vesicles from the bouton lumen. Interestingly, mutant larvae are still able to sustain release at 15%-20% of the normal rate during high-frequency stimulation. We propose that kiss-and-run maintains neurotransmission at active zones of the larval NMJ in endophilin animals."
https://openalex.org/W2050178836,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder characterized by breakdown of articular cartilage. Degradation of aggrecan, which together with type II collagen provides cartilage with its unique characteristics of compressibility and elasticity, is an early and sustained feature of osteoarthritis. The present work was set up to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for aggrecan breakdown in osteoarthritis. We found that the two cartilage aggrecanases, ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5, are present in osteoarthritic cartilage and that they are responsible for aggrecan degradation without the participation of matrix metalloproteinases. This is based on 1) neoepitopes found on aggrecan fragments in osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage explants in vitro, 2) aggrecan fragments detected in synovial fluid of OA patients, 3) the observation that an aggrecanase inhibitor, BB-16, blocked aggrecan degradation in OA cartilage in vitro, whereas the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor XS309 did not, and 4) the presence of mRNA and protein for ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 in OA cartilage. These results suggest that ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 represent a potential target for the treatment of osteoarthritis.

These results suggest that ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 represent a potential target for the treatment of osteoarthritis. osteoarthritis glycosaminoglycan interglobular domain matrix metalloproteinase interleukin 1 antibody synovial fluid Osteoarthritis (OA)1 is the most common joint disorder in the world. According to the World Health Organization, OA affects 190 million people worldwide, thereby representing a major cause for pain and disability, especially in the aging population. The main pathologic features are loss of articular cartilage accompanied by hypertrophy in the subchondral bone and the joint margin. The pathogenesis of OA is poorly understood, but a major feature is the loss of aggrecan from the cartilage matrix (1Mankin H.J. Lipiello L. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. 1970; 52: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The key components of the cartilage extracellular matrix are type II collagen and aggrecan, which make up to 90% of the dry weight of healthy cartilage. Aggrecan hydrates the collagen network and thus provides cartilage with its properties of compressibility and elasticity. Maintenance of aggrecan content in articular cartilage is therefore critical to the function of the tissue. Aggrecan monomers consist of a 250-kDa protein core with chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains attached to it, resulting in a molecule of 1000–2000-kDa molecular mass. The N-terminal region of the aggrecan core protein contains two globular domains, G1 and G2, which are separated by an interglobular domain (IGD) that spans about 150 amino residues. The G2 region is followed by a long GAG attachment region and by the C-terminal globular domain G3 (2Paulsson M. Morgolin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T.E. Heinegard D.

Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 5-20Google Scholar). Aggrecan monomers interact with hyaluronan through their G1 domain and, thus, form large aggregates containing 10–100 aggrecan monomers on a hyaluronan backbone. Aggrecan depletion in arthritic cartilage has been ascribed to increased proteolytic cleavage of the core protein. Two classes of enzymes present in articular cartilage may be involved in the breakdown of aggrecan. First, there are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which cleave aggrecan at the Asn341-Phe342 bond in the IGD. MMPs present in cartilage include MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-13, and MT1-MMP (MMP-14), all of which are capable of cleaving aggrecan at the Asn341 and Phe342 bond in vitro (4Flannery C.R.

Shah S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1335-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 cleave aggrecan within the IGD at the aggrecanase site between residues Glu373 and Ala374 at concentrations as low as 50 pm enzyme but, at these concentrations, do not cleave at the MMP site between residues Asn341 and Phe342. Aggrecan fragments released upon IL-1 treatment of bovine cartilage contain the374ARGS neoepitope, suggesting that aggrecanase activity is responsible for the aggrecan cleavage occurring in this system (17Arner E.C.

The IC50 values of these compounds against MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, and -14 were calculated using the fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpn-Ala-Arg-NH2 (where Mca is 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetylmethoxysuccinyl, and Dap is 2,4-dinitrophenyl) at a concentration of 1 μm and against ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 were determined using 500 nm purified bovine nasal aggrecan as described (22Tortorella M.D. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Austin J. Ross O.H. Abbaszade I. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18566-18573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). XS309 is a nanomolar inhibitor of a large number of MMPs but is inactive at <10 μm in blocking ADAM-TS4/ADAM-TS5. In contrast, BB-16 is a nanomolar inhibitor of both MMPs and ADAM-TS4/ADAM-TS5. Both small molecules, XS309 and BB-16, have been tested for stability in buffer and in human plasma at 37 °C over a 24-h time period. The integrity of the compound was monitored by bioassay and traditional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In the bioassay, both compounds were added to either buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2, or human plasma at several concentrations including 1000, 300, 100, 30, 10, 3, and 1 nm at 37 °C for up to 8 h. After the incubations, an equal volume of acetone was added to the samples, and total compound was collected by passing the material through the Microcon 96 Filtrate Assembly (Millipore). The compounds were then tested for their ability to inhibit MMP-3. No change inK i value was detected, indicating no breakdown of either compound over an 8-h period. Stability of the compounds was also tested by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In this study, both compounds were spiked in either buffer or plasma at a single concentration of 1 μm for 24 h at 37 °C. After the incubations, integrity of the compounds was assessed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. No breakdown products of either compound were detected. All protein digestions were carried out in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mmCaCl2. Purified bovine aggrecan (500 nm) was incubated with MMPs at a concentration of 100 nm, with recombinant human ADAM-TS1 at 25 nm or with ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 at a concentration of 2 nm at 37 °C for 24h. The reactions were stopped with EDTA, and the products were analyzed by immunolocation in a Western blot analysis. Polyclonal neoepitope Ab to human aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu1545-Gly1546(Glu1480-Gly1481 for bovine aggrecan), Glu1714-Gly1715, Glu1819-Ala1820, and Glu1919-Leu1920 bonds were developed at DuPont Merck and found to be highly reactive and specific for the respective neoepitopes, as previously described (22Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.

Polyclonal Abs for ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 were prepared to the peptide sequences ILTSIDASKP (residues 502–511), VMAHVDPEEP (residues 502–511), and DAKQCASLNG (residues 481–490) as previously described (25Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Decicco C. Arner E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 539-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR for ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 was performed as previously described (25Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Decicco C. Arner E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 539-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Human OA cartilage was obtained from knees or hips at the time of joint replacement. Control healthy cartilage was obtained at autopsy within 24 h post mortem from the knees of human donors. Only visually intact cartilage was used (labeled “normal” cartilage). All donors were 20–89 years old and had died of trauma or cerebro/cardiovascular accidents, and none of them had received long term treatment with steroids or cytostatic drugs. Cartilage was allowed to equilibrate for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cartilage was then cut into 3 × 3-mm explants weighing ∼15 mg each, and 8 replicates per treatment were incubated in 96-well plates in 200 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing antibiotics as above for 48 or 72 h. After the incubation, 20 μl of conditioned media from each of the 8 wells/treatment were pooled before analysis. At the end of the culture period, proteoglycans were extracted from the cartilage explants for 5 days at 4 °C with 4m guanidinium hydrochloride, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.8, containing the protease inhibitors disodium EDTA (0.01 m), 6-aminohexanoic acid (0.1 m), benzamidine hydrochloride (0.05 m), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). Sulfated GAG levels in the culture media were determined by the dimethylmethylene blue assay, as previously described (30Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans and their breakdown products were digested with keratanase (0.001 units/μg of GAG), keratanase II (0.01 units/μg of GAG), and chondroitinase ABC (0.001 units/μg of GAG) and prepared for gel electrophoresis as previously described (25Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Decicco C. Arner E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 539-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Twenty μl of the pooled media for each treatment were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunolocalized with a 1:1000 dilution of one of the neoepitope Ab as described (25Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Decicco C. Arner E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 539-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Freshly obtained cartilage from the femoral head was extracted as described above in a total volume of 9 ml. Cesium chloride (CsCl) was then added to a density of 1.55 g/ml, and a gradient was established by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 48 h at 4 °C. Nine equal fractions per tube were taken ranging in density from 1.2 g/ml (fraction 1) to greater than 1.55 g/ml (fraction 9). These fractions were then dialyzed exhaustively against water and deglycosylated for Western blot analysis. Synovial fluid (SF) was collected from the knees of 11 patients with knee OA at various stages of disease. Clinical and radiological diagnosis of OA was made according to the classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (31Altman R. Ash E. Bloch D. Borenstein D. Brandt K. Christy W. Cooke T.D. Greenwald R. Hochberg M. Howell D. et al.Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (5285) Google Scholar). Fluids were spun to remove cells and frozen at −20 °C for storage and shipment. One ml of SF was added to 1 ml of 8 mguanidinium hydrochloride with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.8, in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmiodoacetamide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and gently mixed for 8 h at 4 °C. CsCl was then added to a density of 1.55 g/ml, and gradients were established by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 48 h at 4 °C. Four equal parts per tube were taken, yielding fractions D1 (bottom, highest density) to D4 (top, lowest density). These fractions were then deglycosylated for Western blot analysis as described above. To determine whether neoepitope Abs that detect cleavage at the aggrecanase-sensitive sites within the C-terminal region of the aggrecan core protein may serve as specific tools for monitoring ADAM-TS4/ADAM-TS5 activity in cartilage, we assessed the ability of these sites to be cleaved by other proteases. We evaluated MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -13, and -14 (MT1-MMP), which have been shown to be present in the cartilage extracellular matrix, for the ability to cleave at these sites in comparison with their ability to cleave at the MMP site. We also evaluated MMP-15 (MT2-MMP), -16 (MT3-MMP), -17 (MT4-MMP), ADAM-17 (TACE), and ADAM-TS1. All of the MMPs and ADAM-17 were tested at a concentration of 100 nm, whereas ADAM-TS1 was tested at 25 nm, and ADAM-TS4/ADAM-TS5 was tested at 2 nm. Bovine nasal aggrecan (500 nm) was incubated with each enzyme for 24 h at 37 °C, and neoepitopes produced were assessed by Western blot analysis. Results are summarized in Table I. As expected, all the MMPs tested with the exception of MT4-MMP cleaved aggrecan between residues Ser341 and Phe342 to generate DIPES341 (human = DIPEN341) and342FFGVG neoepitopes (Fig.2 a). However, none of the MMPs under these experimental conditions (a relatively high enzyme to substrate ratio) were able to produce any of the aggrecanase-derived neoepitopes, with the exception of MMP-8, which cleaved aggrecan in the IGD between residues Glu373 and Ala374 to generate a 374ARGS aggrecan fragment of ∼180 kDa (Fig.2 b). However, MMP-8 did not cleave any of the C-terminal bonds that are readily hydrolyzed by ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 (Table I and Fig. 2 c). ADAM-TS1, at a concentration of 25 nm, did not cleave aggrecan at the MMP- or aggrecanase-sensitive sites (Table I). The catalytic domain of ADAM-TS1 shares 66% identity with ADAM-TS4 and 60% with ADAM-TS5 but did not cleave aggrecan at any of the aggrecanase-sensitive sites or, in fact, at any site in aggrecan. Recently, Kuno et al. (32Kuno K. Okada Y. Kawashima H. Nakamura H. Miyasaka M. Ohno H. Matsushima K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) reported that human recombinant ADAM-TS1 did cleave bovine nasal aggrecan between residues Glu1871 and Leu1872, but the ratio of enzyme and the substrate used was about 20 times more than we employed for ADAM-TS5 and ADAM-TS4. Buttner et al. (20Buttner F.H. Hughes C.E. Margerie D. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Caterson B. Bartnik E. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) report that MT1-MMP cleaved rAgg1mut, a recombinant substrate composed of the complete IGD sequence of aggrecan, at the Glu373-Ala374 site. However, in the present study we found that MT1-MMP cleaved native aggrecan exclusively at the MMP site between residues Asn341 and Phe342 but not at any of the aggrecanase-sensitive sites, suggesting that the action of MT1-MMP on native aggrecan is different from that of rAgg1mut.Table ICleavage of aggrecan by metalloproteinasesProteaseMMP epitopesADAM-TS4- and ADAM-TS5-derived epitopesIPESFFGVTEGEARGSKEEEGLGSGELEAGEGLGQRMMP-1++−−−−−−−MMP-2++−−−−−−−MMP-3++−−−−−−−MMP-8++++−−−−−MMP-9++−−−−−−−MMP-13++−−−−−−−MMP-14++−−−−−−−MMP-15++−−−−−−−MMP-16++−−−−−−−MMP-17−−−−−−−−−ADAM-17−−−−−−−−−ADAM-TS1−−−−−−−−−ADAM-TS4−−+++++++ADAM-TS5−−+++++++MMPs (100 nm), ADAM-17 (100 nm), ADAM-TS1 (25 nm), or ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 (2 nm) were incubated with 500 nm aggrecan for 24 h at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab MMPs (100 nm), ADAM-17 (100 nm), ADAM-TS1 (25 nm), or ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 (2 nm) were incubated with 500 nm aggrecan for 24 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the products were analyzed for MMP-generated neoepitopes and aggrecanase-generated neoepitopes by Western blot analysis. + indicates the presence, and − indicates the absence of neoepitope-reactive bands. Aggrecan extracted from cartilage was analyzed by Western blot for MMP-generated IPEN341 and aggrecanase-generated TEGE373-containing products. Both the IPEN341and the TEGE373 epitopes were detected in normal and OA cartilage, with no apparent change in OA cartilage (Fig.3 a). The presence of a 64-kDa fragment with the IPEN341 C terminus and a 70-kDa fragment with the C terminus TEGE373 in non-arthritic cartilage was a reproducible finding in cartilage from several individuals, as has been reported previously (26Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J. Harper C.F. Hoerrner L.A. Hutchinson N.I. Singer L.L. Donatelli S.A. Weidner J.A. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin.

Hayward J. Maciewicz R.A. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We could detect these neoepitopes in cartilage from a donor as young as 7 weeks old (data not shown). This suggests that these fragments are retained in the matrix through the interaction of the G1 domain with hyaluronan and, thus, accumulate in cartilage during development and during the lifetime of the individual (26Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J. Harper C.F. Hoerrner L.A. Hutchinson N.I. Singer L.L. Donatelli S.A. Weidner J.A. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quantifying these neoepitopes by Western blot analysis and observing any change in disease will therefore be very difficult, and hence, they will not be useful in providing an accurate parameter of aggrecanase or MMP activity in OA. Therefore, we examined aggrecan fragments diffusing from normal and OA cartilage explants during a given culture period using neoepitope Ab that recognize various aggrecan fragments lacking a G1 domain. Age-matched normal and OA cartilage explants were cultured for 72 h, and supernatants were then analyzed for GAG content, which is a measure of the loss of degraded aggrecan into the culture media. More GAG was released into the media from OA than normal healthy cartilage over a 72-h culture period (Fig. 3 b). We detected no342FFGV or 374ARGS neoepitopes in the supernatants of normal cartilage explants under the experimental conditions employed (Fig. 3 b). Culture media of OA explants contained no detectable MMP-generated 342FFGV, but in contrast, several different sized aggrecan fragments with the N terminus 374ARGS were present (Fig. 3 b). Because the AF28 Ab is about 10 times more reactive than the BC3 Ab, 3M. D. Tortorella, unpublished observations. it is unlikely that we are missing MMP-generated fragments. To confirm that aggrecan fragments diffusing from OA cartilage are the result of cleavage by ADAM-TS4/ADAM-TS5, we looked for fragments generated by cleavage at the additional ADAM-TS4- and ADAM-TS5-preferred sites shown in Fig. 1 that are not cleaved by other MMPs. The most preferred cleavage site of ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5 is between Glu1714 and Gly1715, generating the C-terminal KEEE1714 and the N-terminal 1715GLGS neoepitope (22Tortorella M."

https://openalex.org/W2152911705,"We show that a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway controls embryonic migrations of blood cells (hemocytes) in Drosophila. The VEGF receptor homolog is expressed in hemocytes, and three VEGF homologs are expressed along hemocyte migration routes. A receptor mutation arrests progression of blood cell movement. Mutations in Vegf17E or Vegf27Cb have no effect, but simultaneous inactivation of all three Vegf genes phenocopied the receptor mutant, and ectopic expression of Vegf27Cb redirected migration. Genetic experiments indicate that the VEGF pathway functions independently of pathways governing hemocyte homing on apoptotic cells. The results suggest that the Drosophila VEGF pathway guides developmental migrations of blood cells, and we speculate that the ancestral function of VEGF pathways was to guide blood cell movement."

https://openalex.org/W2167143696,"The tobacco mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase NPK1 regulates lateral expansion of the cell plate at cytokinesis. Here, we show that the kinesin-like proteins NACK1 and NACK2 act as activators of NPK1. Biochemical analysis suggests that direct binding of NACK1 to NPK1 stimulates kinase activity. NACK1 is accumulated specifically in M phase and colocalized with NPK1 at the phragmoplast equator. Overexpression of a truncated NACK1 protein that lacks the motor domain disrupts NPK1 concentration at the phragmoplast equator and cell plate formation. Incomplete cytokinesis is also observed when expression of NACK1 and NACK2 is repressed by virus-induced gene silencing and in embryonic cells from Arabidopsis mutants in which a NACK1 ortholog is disrupted. Thus, we conclude that expansion of the cell plate requires NACK1/2 to regulate the activity and localization of NPK1."

To date, the few known CpxR-P target operons were mostly identified by genetic screens. To facilitate the discovery of all target operons, we derived a 15-bp weighted matrix for CpxR-P recognition that takes into account the relative base frequency at each nucleotide position. This matrix essentially consists of two tandem 5′-GTAAA-3′ motifs separated by a 5-bp linker. All of the 15-bp stretches on both strands of the E. coli MG1655 genome were then scored for their degree of matching with the matrix and classified in statistical deviation groups. The effectiveness of this screening is indicated by the identification of eight new target operons (ung, ompC, psd, mviA,aroK, rpoErseABC, secA, and aer) among eleven candidates tested. Moreover, the matrix score correlates with the likelihood that a site is a true target and with the relative site affinity for CpxR-P in vitro.

Together with RpoE (ςE) and RpoH (ς32), this system governs the expression of genes involved in relieving envelope-protein distress (1Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 3968-3980Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3Pogliano J. Lynch A.S. Belin D.

This induction results from the activation of the operon by RpoS (ςS) in synergy with autogenous activation by CpxR-P (5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J.

Thus, an intricate stress response network that integrates the Cpx, RpoE, RpoH, and RpoS regulatory pathways seems to have evolved inE. coli. A clue for an extensive physiological role of the Cpx system is provided by numerous seemingly unrelated phenotypes ofcpxA* mutants (10Rainwater S. Silverman P.M. J.

Because of the complexity and extensiveness of the Cpx response and its overlap with responses elicited by several other signal transduction pathways, it is especially difficult to identify all of the direct target operons of the Cpx system. Without knowing most of these operons, it is hard to understand the overall selective advantage of the Cpx response. The aim of this study is to develop a CpxR-P recognition weight matrix that helps to identify reliably target promoters by the presence of a specific nucleotide sequence closely conforming to the matrix. The method of Berg and von Hippel (17Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 723-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) was used to score genomic sites with the CpxR-P weight matrix developed with the AlignACE program (18Roth F.P. Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Church G.M. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The matrix screening method predicts the affinity of CpxR-P for a given DNA sequence based on the sequence statistics of 10 input CpxR-P-controlled promoter sequences. Both strands of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome sequence obtained from GenBankTM accession number U00096 were searched. Near-symmetric sites with high scores in both the forward and reverse directions were counted only once, and the higher of the two scores was then used (19Robison K McGuire A.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The E. colistrains used in this study (TableI) are deleted in thecpxRA operon at its natural locus.

To confirm the cpx genotype of strains ECL3502 (cpxR + A + -lacZ that contains a complete cpxRA operon), ECL3503 (cpxR Δ A + -lacZ in which cpxR sustained an in-frame deletion), and ECL3504 (cpxR + A * -lacZ in whichcpxA sustained a base change resulting in a Leu38 → Phe substitution rendering CpxA* phosphatase-defective), we assayed their reporter β-galactosidase activities (20Miller J.H.

Therefore, the strains were cultured at 30 or 37 °C in LB medium (20 ml in baffled shake flask of 250 ml and rotated at 300 rpm−1) until an optical density (A 600) of 0.9 was reached. At this point of growth, theΦ(cpxR + A * -lacZ)transcription level in strain ECL3504 exceeded the level ofΦ(cpxR + A + -lacZ)expression in strain ECL3502 by a factor of 3, whereas the expression level ofΦ(cpxR Δ A + -lacZ)was ∼20%Φ(cpxR + A + -lacZ)expression level in strain ECL3502 (data not shown).Table IE. coli strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceECL3502K-12 F− rph-1Δ(lac)X74 Δ(cpx)2λRZ5Φ(cpxR+A+-lacZ)5De Wulf P.

To analyze the expression of rpoErseABC, the cells were grown at 30 °C until reaching A 600 of 0.9 and then shifted to 50 °C for 10 min for RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated (RNeasy Total RNA System, Qiagen) and electrophorized in Tris acetate/EDTA-agarose (1%) containing guanidine thiocyanate (20 mm). The electrophorized and denatured RNA was blotted overnight onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). All of the RNA was then cross-linked (UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene), and the target mRNAs were hybridized with radiolabeled DNA probes. Radiolabeled DNA probes were PCR-generated (TaqPlus Precision polymerase mixture, Stratagene) from the chromosome of strain ECL3502 (cpxR + A + ) in the presence of 500 μm [α-32P]dATP. The transcription of ung was assayed with a 458-bp DNA fragment (from bp 35 to bp 493 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers UNG1 (5′-CTGAAGAGAAGCAGCAACC-3′) and UNG2 (5′-CCCACAACAAAAACACCAC-3′). The transcription of ompC was assayed with a 602-bp DNA fragment (from bp 144 to bp 746 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers OMPC1 (5′-AGATGTAGATGGCGACCAG-3′) and OMPC2 (5′-TCGTATTTCAGACCACCAG-3′). The transcription of psd was assayed with a 716-bp DNA fragment (from bp 89 to bp 805 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers PSD1 (5′-CAGGATGGCTGACAAAAC-3′) and PSD2 (5′-CAACCAGATTCACTTTACCC-3′). The transcription of mviM was assayed with a 674-bp DNA probe (from bp 156 to bp 830 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers MVIM1 (5′-TTATGCCGATTCGTTATCC-3′) and MVIM2 (5′-ACACATTCAATGAAGTGCC-3′). The transcription of aroK was assayed with a 486-bp DNA fragment (from bp 25 to bp 511 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers AROK1 (5′-AGCGACCAGATATGCAGAG-3′) and AROK2 (5′-CAAGATAAACGACAACGCC-3′). The transcription of hlpA was assayed with a 351-bp DNA fragment (from bp 31 to bp 382 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers HLPA1 (5′-GGTTTAGCACTGGCAACTTC-3′) and HLPA2 (5′-CAACGGATTTCACAGCAG-3′). The transcription of secA was assayed with a 743-bp DNA fragment (from bp 346 to bp 1089 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers SECA1 (5′-GCTTACCTGAACGCACTAAC-3′) and SECA2 (5′-CACACCTTCTTTCGCTTC-3′). The transcription of ubiC was assayed with a 299-bp DNA fragment (from bp 70 to bp 369 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers UBIC1 (5′-CTGCGATACAA TGCCTTTAC-3′) and UBIC2 (5′-TTCACCATCGGCACATAAC-3′). The transcription of flgM was assayed with a 211-bp DNA fragment (from bp 24 to bp 235 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers FLGM1 (5′-TCTGAAGCCTGTAAGCACC-3′) and FLGM2 (5′-TGTCCATTTTTAGTTCACCG-3′). The transcription ofrpoErseABC was assayed with a 610-bp DNA fragment (from bp 41 to bp 651 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers RPOE1 (5′-CCTGATAAGCGGTTGAACTTTGTTATC-3′) and RPOE2 (5′-GATAGCGCGTGGAAATTTGGTTTGG-3′). The transcription of aerwas assayed with a 987-bp DNA fragment (from bp 322 and bp 1309 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers AER1 (5′-ATCAGTGGCTATATGTCGATTCGTACCC-3′) and AER2 (5′-CCACAATATCTTCCATCGTCCGTCCG-3′). The transcription ofenvZ was assayed with a 920-bp DNA fragment (from bp 1958 to bp 2878 in the coding sequence) that was PCR-generated with primers ENVZ1 (5′-TTGGTTGTGCCTCCCGCTTTCC-3′) and ENVZ2 (5′-CGGACCGTCATCTTCCACCTGG-3′). Following hybridization, radioactive signals were visualized after overnight incubation of the hybridized membranes on phosphorimaging screens (Amersham Biosciences). The screens were scanned by the PhosphorImager 445SI (Amersham Biosciences), and the obtained signals were quantified with ImageQuant 5.0 (AmershamBiosciences). The level of radiation background was determined by quantifying a part of the membrane lying outside of the target mRNA signals. The transcription of each genetic locus was performed by at least three independent experiments. The levels of transcription were averaged, and their standard deviations were calculated. For graphical representation, the transcription levels were normalized to the averaged values measured in wild-type strain ECL3502 (cpxR + A + ). The ability of CpxR and CpxR-P to recognize and bind to the promoters of rpoErseABC, aer, andompR-envZ was examined according to a previously described procedure (5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CpxR(-P)/DNA ratio ranging from 10 to 25 (100–250 pm/10 pm) was tested in the presence of a 500-fold molar excess of competitor DNA (sheared salmon sperm DNA, Promega) and a 100-fold molar excess of competitor protein (bovine serum albumin, Sigma). CpxR was overproduced as His6-CpxR, purified, and phosphorylated (when required) with 50 mm acetyl phosphate (3Pogliano J. Lynch A.S. Belin D. Lin E.C.C. Beckwith J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1169-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For analysis of CpxR(-P) binding to the rpoErseABCpromoter, a 214-bp promoter fragment (bp 17–231 upstream of the start codon, Fig. 5 A) was PCR-amplified with primers RPOE/EMS1 (5′-CCAAACCAAATTTCCACGCGCTATC-3′) and RPOE/EMS2 (5′-TTACTCTTCAGGCAGTTAAATGGGC-3′). For analysis of CpxR(-P) binding to the aer promoter, a 238-bp promoter fragment (bp 36–274 upstream of the start codon, Fig. 6 A) was PCR-amplified with primers AER/EMS1 (5′-TCTTGTCAGAGTTTATGTCGGCCCCGC-3′) and AER/EMS2 (5′-GTTGTTATTTTGCACGGTTTTTGTCGGG-3′). For analysis of CpxR(-P) binding to the ompR-envZ promoter, a 206-bp promoter fragment (bp 6–212 upstream of the start codon) was PCR-amplified with primers OmpR/EMS1 (5′-TCTGTTTGATAATGCGCACATTGGG-3′) and OmpR/EMS2 (5′-GTACTCCCAAAGGTTCGCAACAATTTG-3′). All of the promoter fragments were radiolabeled during PCR by supplying 500 μm [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to the reaction.Figure 6Negative regulation of aerexpression by CpxR-P.

The samples were then electrophoresed on 5% non-denaturing acrylamide Tris borate/EDTA mini-gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak BioMax). On the basis of DNase I protection analyses of thedegP, ppiA, and yihE-dsbA promoter regions, a 14-bp CpxR-P recognition box (5′-GTAAA(N)5GTAA-3′) was first proposed (3Pogliano J. Lynch A.S. Belin D. Lin E.C.C. Beckwith J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1169-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). When the genome of E. coli K-12 MG1655 was later scanned for this box, 50 sites positioned within 450 bp upstream of start codons were found (5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three operons, motABcheAW, tsr, andcpxRA, containing such a site in their promoter region were then chosen for genetic and biochemical verification as actual CpxR-P targets. The motABcheAW and tsr operons proved to be under direct negative control, whereas thecpxRA operon turned out to be under autogenous positive control (5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A genetic screening for Cpx-controlled operons using transcriptionallacZ fusions yielded ppiD (encoding periplasmic isomerase D) as a target (2Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 3968-3980Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using the previously reported 14-bp recognition sequence as a reference, three 7-bp boxes (5′-GGTAAA(G/C)-3′) separated by 41 and 13-bp links were designated as CpxR-P binding sites. Deleting the region containing these boxes rendered the expression of ppiD independent of CpxR-P (2Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 3968-3980Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of each individual box was not determined. The discrepancy in length and base composition between the originally proposed 14-bp recognition sequence (5′-GTAAA(N)5GTAA-3′) and the subsequently proposed 7-bp box (5′-GGTAAA(G/C)-3′) for CpxR-P recognition prompted us to characterize the site by a weight matrix approach that takes into account the base frequency at each nucleotide position within the recognition sequence. For input purpose, we assembled 10 known target operons (Table II) identified on the basis of four different criteria. The first group consisted of three operons that were shown to be regulated by CpxR-P in vivo, and their promoter sequences were shown to be protected from DNase I activity by CpxR-P in vitro (degP,ppiA, and yihE-dsbA) (1Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3Pogliano J. Lynch A.S. Belin D. Lin E.C.C. Beckwith J.

The second group consisted of three operons that were shown to be regulated by CpxR-Pin vivo, and their promoter sequence (motABcheAW, tsr, and ygjT) was shown to be electrophoretically retarded by CpxR-P in vitro(5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1P. De Wulf, unpublished data. A third group was represented by ppiD whose expression was liberated from CpxR-P control after deletion of the three 7-bp CpxR-P boxes in the promoter (2Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 14: 3968-3980Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The fourth group consisted of three operons that were shown to be regulated by CpxR-P in vivo, and their promoter sequence (cpxRA, cpxP, and csgBAC) was shown to contain the proposed 14-bp CpxR-P box (4Dorel C.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 831-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. M. McGuire, unpublished data. Using the promoter regions of these 10 operons, we aligned 500-bp fragments from 400 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream of the start codon with the motif-finding program AlignACE (18Roth F.P. Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Church G.M. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), which is based on the Gibbs sampling algorithm (21Lawrence C.E. Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Liu J.S. Neuwald A.F. Wootton J.C. Science. 1993; 262: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). A highly conserved 15-bp stretch was identified in each of the input promoters (Table II), and the base frequency at each nucleotide position was then used to calculate a CpxR-P recognition weight matrix (17Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 723-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This matrix was found to extend the originally proposed 14-bp CpxR-P recognition box (3Pogliano J. Lynch A.S. Belin D. Lin E.C.C. Beckwith J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1169-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) by 1 bp (Fig.1). The modified 15-bp stretch (hereafter referred to as “potential CpxR-P recognition site”) essentially consists of two highly conserved pentamers in tandem (the second one being a bit less conserved) separated by five random bases, 5′-GTAAA(N)5GTAAA-3′ (Fig. 1).Table IICpxR-P controlled input operons used to construct the CpxR-P recognition weight matrixOperonPutative CpxR-P binding site2-aConserved 15-bp fragments identified by AlignACE in the promoter regions (400 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream of the start codons) of the 10 CpxR-P-controlled input operons.

Open table in a new tab Each of the 4,639,206 successive 15-bp stretches of theE. coli K-12 MG1655 genome (22Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar) was scored on both strands for its degree of matching with the CpxR-P recognition weight matrix using the log transformation method of Berg and von Hippel (17Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 723-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The distribution of scores from all of the potential CpxR-P recognition sites is displayed in Fig. 2 A. The average of all of these scores, i.e. the genomic mean, was assigned a Z score of 0. A histogram window comprising the highest scoring sites (Z ≥ +3.5) is shown in Fig.2 B. As one would expect, these sites include those that are present in the 10 CpxR-P input target promoters, because the probability of being a true CpxR-P regulatory site should statistically increase with an increasing Z score. The mean score μ i of the potential CpxR-P recognition sites in the 10 input promoters has a Z value of +4.85. We next determined the standard deviation, ς i , of these input sites and ranked them in four deviation groups relative to μ i (Fig.2 B). The first standard deviation group (Fig. 2 B, TableIII) scoring above μ i + 1ς i contained only two potential CpxR-P recognition sites, both of which belong to the input operons. One site (designated ascpxRA1/cpxP1) is intergenically positioned between the divergently transcribed cpxRA and cpxP operons (5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other site (designated as ygjT1) is positioned in the promoter region of ygjT. The second standard deviation group (Fig. 2 B, Table III) scoring between μ i and μ i + 1ς i contained 21 potential CpxR-P recognitions sites. Among these, 13 sites (or 62%) are located in intergenic regions as categorized according to Robison et al. (19Robison K McGuire A.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Representatives include the motABcheAW, tsr, andppiA input operons. The third standard deviation group (Fig.2 B, Table IV) scoring between μ i and μ i − 1ς i comprises 138 potential CpxR-P recognition sites. Among these, 44 sites (or 32%) are located in intergenic regions. Representatives include theyhiE-dsbA, degP, csgBAC, andppiD input operons. The fourth standard deviation group (Fig. 2 B, not tabulated) scoring between μ i – 1ς i and μ i – 2ς i comprises 743 potential CpxR-P recognition sites. Among these, 186 sites (or 25%) are located in intergenic regions. Representatives include the second potential CpxR-P recognition site that is intergenically positioned between thecpxRA and cpxPoperons (designated ascpxRA2/cpxP2) (5De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the second potential CpxR-P recognition site in front of ygjT (designated asygjT2). In total, 245 intergenic sites score higher than μ i − 2ς i .

https://openalex.org/W2000555456,"Cyclin G2, together with cyclin G1 and cyclin I, defines a novel cyclin family expressed in terminally differentiated tissues including brain and muscle. Cyclin G2 expression is up-regulated as cells undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to inhibitory stimuli independent of p53 (Horne, M., Donaldson, K., Goolsby, G., Tran, D., Mulheisen, M., Hell, J. and Wahl, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12650–12661). We tested the hypothesis that cyclin G2 may be a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and found that ectopic expression of cyclin G2 induces the formation of aberrant nuclei and cell cycle arrest in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cyclin G2 is primarily partitioned to a detergent-resistant compartment, suggesting an association with cytoskeletal elements. We determined that cyclin G2 and its homolog cyclin G1 directly interact with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). An okadaic acid-sensitive (<2 nm) phosphatase activity coprecipitates with endogenous and ectopic cyclin G2. We found that cyclin G2 also associates with various PP2A B′ regulatory subunits, as previously shown for cyclin G1. The PP2A/A subunit is not detectable in cyclin G2-PP2A-B′-C complexes. Notably, cyclin G2 colocalizes with both PP2A/C and B′ subunits in detergent-resistant cellular compartments, suggesting that these complexes form in living cells. The ability of cyclin G2 to inhibit cell cycle progression correlates with its ability to bind PP2A/B′ and C subunits. Together, our findings suggest that cyclin G2-PP2A complexes inhibit cell cycle progression.

The ability of cyclin G2 to inhibit cell cycle progression correlates with its ability to bind PP2A/B′ and C subunits. Together, our findings suggest that cyclin G2-PP2A complexes inhibit cell cycle progression. cyclin-dependent kinase fluorescein isothiocyanate green fluorescent protein glutathioneS-transferase horseradish peroxidase lissamine rhodamine sulfonyl chloride phosphate-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline protein phosphatase 2A hemagglutinin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid fluorescence-activated cell sorting propidium iodide bromodeoxyuridine Chinese hamster ovary terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling Classical cyclins promote cellular proliferation.

Cyclin G2 shows 26% amino acid identity with cyclin A, but its closest homolog is cyclin G1 (53% amino acid identity). Initial cloning and sequencing of cyclin G1, then called cyclin G, predicted a protein starting at the cyclin box and lacking an NH2-terminal region typically present in other cyclins (10Tamura K.

The overall expression profile of the G cyclins is atypical and not associated with promotion of cellular proliferation but rather suggests that they act as inhibitory coordinators of the cell cycle in some cell types and may assist in maintaining the quiescent state of differentiated cells. Although cyclin G2 and G1 are sequence homologs, their expression is differentially regulated during development (9Horne M.C. Donaldson K.L. Goolsby G.L. Tran D. Mulheisen M. Hell J.W. Wahl A.F. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because of its effects on the activity of the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25, a key regulator of the mitotic CDK p34cdc2, PP2A activity is thought to prevent premature entry into mitosis (26Clarke P.R. Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Lee T.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The diversity of PP2A function is paralleled by its requisite localization to distinct subcellular sites and specific targeting to a variety of cellular substrates, a crucial regulatory process for the proper function of many protein kinases (28Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). The 36-kDa catalytic C subunit of PP2A (PP2A/C) exists in cells in either a dimeric core complex with a 65-kDa “scaffolding” A subunit (PP2A/A, PR65) or, more often, in a trimeric complex containing variable regulatory B subunits bound to the A/C dimer (16Janssens V.

Studies in yeast showed that rabbit B′ isoforms can complement mutations in the yeast B′ subunit Rts1p, but Rts1p cannot complement mutations in the B subunit Cdc55p, indicating that different regulatory B subunits confer enzyme specificity (43Zhao Y. Boguslawski G. Zitomer R.S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8256-8262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the discovery that cyclin G1 interacts with PP2A B′ subunits (44Okamoto K. Kamibayashi C. Serrano M. Prives C. Mumby M.C. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) implicates cyclin G1 in the regulation of PP2A and contrasts it with the classical cell cycle-promoting cyclins. For a better understanding of cyclin G2 function, we investigated potential binding partners of this novel cyclin. We show that cyclin G2 interacts with various PP2A B′ subunits in vitro and in living cells, where they colocalize at distinct sites. Okamoto et al. observed that cyclin G1 interacts with two distinct B′ subunits; however, the composition of cyclin G1-PP2A/B′ complexes was not further resolved (44Okamoto K. Kamibayashi C. Serrano M. Prives C. Mumby M.C. Beach D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To understand the function of the cyclin G2 complex, we examined whether the cyclin G2-PP2A/B′ complex contains the other two major subunits of the prototypical PP2A trimeric A-B′-C complex. It is possible that members of the G cyclin family sequester B′ subunits away from the PP2A/A-C dimer and thereby change the pool of distinctly targeted PP2A holoenzyme. Alternatively, cyclin G1 or G2 may directly regulate either the activity or localization of PP2A by forming multimeric complexes. We found that cyclin G2 and G1 cannot only associate with a variety of B′ subunits but can also directly interact with the catalytic C subunit of PP2A. Our data indicate that this cyclin G2-C subunit association can also occur in vivo and that association of cyclin G2 with PP2A/B′ and C excludes the A subunit. Accordingly, cyclin G2 can form catalytically active trimeric complexes with PP2A/B′ and C subunits and thus may alter PP2A targeting or substrate specificity. A functional consequence of high cyclin G2 expression may be a change in the balance or local concentration of distinct PP2A complexes. This could lead to alterations in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal networks, or mitosis. Indeed, we observe an induction of cell cycle arrest and unusual nuclear DNA structures in cells overexpressing cyclin G2, indicative of an aberrant mitosis/cytokinesis. Together, our studies point to a role for cyclin G2 in PP2A regulation and provide a mechanism through which cyclin G2 up-regulation could contribute to cell cycle inhibition.

All PCR fragments were cloned into the TA cloning vector PCR.1 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by PCR sequencing with the AmpliTaq system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cyclins G1 and G2 and PP2A/C sequences were then subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) and DNA sequences were verified as above. GST and polyhistidine (His) fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli (NovaBlue; Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified following the manufacturer's protocols with modifications. Induced bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of TBS (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme. After 10 min on ice, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 nm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), 15 mmdithiothreitol (GST) or 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (His), 10 mm EDTA (GST proteins only), and 1.5% sarkosyl were added.

Herein, CD4+ T cell generation required engagement of CD83, a surface molecule expressed by thymic epithelial and dendritic cells. CD83-deficient (CD83-/-) mice had a specific block in CD4+ single-positive thymocyte development without increased CD4+CD8+ double- or CD8+ single-positive thymocytes. This resulted in a selective 75%-90% reduction in peripheral CD4+ T cells, predominantly within the naive subset. Wild-type thymocytes and bone marrow stem cells failed to differentiate into mature CD4+ T cells when transferred into CD83-/- mice, while CD83-/- thymocytes and stem cells developed normally in wild-type mice. Thereby, CD83 expression represents an additional regulatory component for CD4+ T cell development in the thymus."

In cells derived from XP-D patients, we observed a reduction of the ligand-dependent transactivation mediated by several nuclear receptors (RARα, ERα, and AR). We demonstrate that the XPD mutation alters cdk7 function in RARα phosphorylation. Transactivation is restored upon overexpression of either the wild-type XPD or the RARαS77E (a mutation which mimics phosphorylated RARα). Thus, we demonstrate that the cdk7 kinase of TFIIH phosphorylates the nuclear receptor, then allowing ligand-dependent control of the activation of the hormone-responsive genes."

In the present study, we investigated the ability of two plant and four animal LOXs to catalyze the hydroperoxidation of 2-AG. 5-LOX catalyzes the hydroperoxidation of arachidonic acid providing 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE), the precursor to the leukotrienes. The possibility that 5-LOX might oxygenate 2-AG to generate 5-HpETE glyceryl ester (HpETE-G) and, subsequently, leukotriene glyceryl esters in a manner similar to the ability of cyclooxygenase-2 to generate prostaglandin glycerol esters was investigated using two 5-LOX enzymes. The endocannabinoid oxygenase activities of four 15-LOX enzymes were also rigorously characterized. Lipoxygenase metabolism of 2-AG in an eukaryotic cellular environment was examined in two distinct cell systems. The results suggest that 15-LOX enzymes, but not 5-LOX enzymes, may play a role in endogenous cannabinoid signaling and should be included in the growing family of oxygenases capable of 2-AG metabolism.

The solution was stirred to homogeneity at room temperature, followed by the addition of 2-AG (10 mg, 26 μmol). A reaction mixture aliquot was followed by UV spectroscopy (240 nm) until no further increase in absorbance was detected (≈5 min). The reaction was quenched with 300 ml of EtOAc containing 25 mg of triphenylphosphine to reduce 15-HpETE-G to 15-HETE-G.

The lipoxygenase product was then purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing 15-LOX-2 were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% glycerol to remove imidazole. E. coli-expressed human 15-LOX-2 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. Lipoxygenase activity, except in the case of human 5-LOX, was detected by monitoring the absorbance of the conjugated diene product at 236 nm as previously described (8Moody J.S.

Briefly, UV assays were monitored using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a water-jacketed cuvette. The enzyme reactions included reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.03% Tween 20, pH 7.4), arachidonic acid or arachidonyl ester, and enzyme. The reaction temperature was 30 °C, and the final reaction volume was 1 ml. Potato 5-LOX reactions were conducted at 30 °C and included arachidonic acid or 2-AG (10 μm) and enzyme (200 units) in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). The commercially obtained, human 5-LOX preparation displayed considerable background absorbance at 236 nm, preventing spectrophotometric quantitation of enzyme activity. Consequently, human 5-LOX activity was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, oxygen consumption was measured with a Gilson model 5/6 oxygraph (Gilson Medical Electronics, Middleton, WI) equipped with a Clark electrode and a thermostated cuvette (37 °C). Enzyme aliquots (10 units) were added to 50 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm ATP, pH 7.4, containing either 0.03% Tween 20 or 0.015% Tween 20 and 100 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine in a final volume of 1 ml. Oxygen uptake was initiated by the addition of 100 μm arachidonic acid or 2-AG. Enzyme kinetics were assessed using the computer program Enzyme Kinetics 1.5 (Trinity Software, Campton, NH). Kinetic values were determined using nonlinear regression analysis. Velocity data were obtained by taking the slope of the reaction curve at the point of maximal reaction velocity. Because of the characteristic lag phase of lipoxygenases in some reactions, this rate was not necessarily the initial rate. HpETE-G regiochemistry was established by mass spectrometry (MS). Incubations of enzyme and 2-AG in 25 mm Tris, 0.015% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (37 °C, 10 min), were extracted with EtOAc and dried under argon. The residue was redissolved in 1:1 MeCN:H2O and infused into the mass spectrometer. Regiochemistry was established by diagnostic, collision-induced hydroperoxide cleavage. HpETE-Gs were reduced with triphenylphosphine to the corresponding HETE esters. Saponification with 1 n NaOH followed by RP-HPLC (Supelcosil LC-18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, 80:20:0.01 MeOH:H2O:HOAc, 1.4 ml/min) provided purified HETEs for chiral analysis and confirmed regiochemical assignment established by MS. Following methylation with diazomethane, HETE methyl esters were analyzed by chiral-phase HPLC (Chiralpak AD, 250 × 4.6 mm, 1.5 ml/min, hexanes:EtOH, 100:1) (29Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Enantiomerically pure HETE methyl ester standards were well resolved on the chiral column. LC effluents were routinely monitored by UV at 235 nm. COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human 15-LOX cDNAs in pcDNA3 or vector without insert were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, medium was replaced with HBSS and cells were treated with 2-AG (20 μm) or Me2SO vehicle for 30 min (15-LOX-1) or 45 min (15-LOX-2) at 37 °C. After treatment, HBSS was removed and extracted twice with an equal volume of 2:1 CHCl3:MeOH. The organic extract was dried under argon, and the residue was analyzed by LC/MS. Cells were harvested for immunoblotting by scraping, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%) and then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane. The membrane was probed with goat polyclonal antiserum to rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX (cross-reactive with human 15-LOX-1) or rabbit polyclonal antiserum to human 15-LOX-2, followed by anti-goat or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Undifferentiated human epidermal keratinocyte production of 15-HETE-G was evaluated by treating cells in HBSS (50–70% confluence) with vehicle or 2-AG (50 μm). Following incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, HBSS was removed and extracted twice with an equal volume of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1). The organic extract was dried under argon, and the residue was analyzed by LC/MS. Human epidermal keratinocyte expression of 15-LOX enzymes was examined by immunoblotting as described above. UAS-tk-luciferase, PPARδ-pCMX, pGAL4, PPARα-GAL4, PPARγ-GAL4, and PPARδ-GAL4 plasmids have been described previously (30Gupta R.A. Tan J. Krause W.F. Geraci M.W. Willson T.M. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13275-13280Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells (5.0 × 105cells/well using 24-well plates) were transfected using FuGENE 6 at a lipid:DNA ratio of 3:1. Cells were exposed to a mix containing 300 ng/ml UAS-tk-luciferase (GAL4 reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase), 300 ng/ml indicated PPAR-GAL4 plasmid, and 1.0 ng/ml pRL-SV40 (control plasmid expressing Renillaluciferase) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The transfection mix was replaced after 4–5 h with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum-containing medium supplemented with either 0.1% vehicle or the indicated compound. After 24–36 h, cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were determined using a luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT) and normalized to the relative light units from Renillaluciferase using the dual luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Human recombinant 5-LOX and purified potato 5-LOX were used to assess the ability of 5-LOXs to oxygenate 2-AG. Potato 5-LOX was incubated with substrate (10 μm arachidonate or 2-AG) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the reaction mixture was monitored by spectrophotometry. A marked increase in absorbance at 236 nm demonstrated that the enzyme was catalytically active with arachidonic acid as substrate. However, no change in absorbance was detected upon incubation with 2-AG (data not shown). To evaluate the ability of human 5-LOX to metabolize 2-AG, enzymatic hydroperoxidation was monitored by oxygen uptake. When human 5-LOX was incubated with substrate (100 μm arachidonate or 2-AG) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.03% Tween 20, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm ATP, robust oxygen uptake was detected with arachidonic acid but not with 2-AG (Fig. 1). The maximal rate of 2-AG oxygenation catalyzed by 5-LOX was 6.6 ± 0.9% of that observed with arachidonic acid (mean ± S.E., n = 3). In addition, direct liquid infusion MS of organic extracts of human 5-LOX incubations with 2-AG failed to reveal a mass ion consistent with a HpETE, HETE, dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, or leukotriene A4 glycerol ester (data not shown). The inclusion of phosphatidylcholine in human 5-LOX assays has been shown, under some conditions, to enhance enzyme activity (31Reddy K.V. Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To confirm our findings with human 5-LOX, we repeated activity assays with arachidonic acid and 2-AG using a phospholipid-containing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.015% Tween 20, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine, pH 7.4, containing 2 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm ATP). Similar results were obtained in the absence or presence of exogenous phosphatidylcholine (data not shown). Purified soybean 15-LOX was incubated with substrate (50 μm arachidonate or 2-AG) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.03% Tween 20, pH 7.4, and the reaction course was followed spectrophotometrically. Increases in absorbance at 236 nm demonstrated that soybean 15-LOX converted both arachidonic acid and 2-AG into a conjugated diene (Fig.2, A and B). Although the maximal rate of arachidonic acid oxygenation was markedly higher than that observed with 2-AG, total product formation after 5 min was only slightly lower with the endocannabinoid substrate (∼80%). To assess the substrate structural requirements for soybean 15-LOX oxygenation, arachidonic acid and a series of related arachidonyl esters (50 μm) were evaluated as substrates. The maximal rate of 2-AG oxygenation by soybean 15-LOX under these screening conditions was only 15% of that observed with arachidonic acid. However, 2-AG proved to be the preferred arachidonyl ester substrate (Fig. 3 A). Having established that soybean 15-LOX oxygenates 2-AG, we determined the steady-state kinetic values for both 2-AG and arachidonate metabolism (Table I). The enzyme displayed K m values in the low micromolar range for both substrates (7 ± 2 μm for 2-AGversus 13 ± 4 μm for arachidonic acid). Consistent with the initial observations of more rapid oxygenation of arachidonic acid by soybean 15-LOX, the V maxvalue with the free acid substrate was ∼9-fold higher than that observed with 2-AG, yielding a 4–5-fold higherV max/K m ratio for arachidonic acid (Table I). Soybean 15-LOX therefore appears capable of more rapidly metabolizing arachidonic acid, but the affinities of the enzyme toward both substrates and total product synthesis appear similar.Table ISteady-state kinetic values of soybean 15-LOXKinetic valueAA2-AG K M (μm)13 ± 47 ± 2 V max (nmol s−1 mg−1)76 ± 98.9 ± 0.8 V max/K M5.81.3Kinetic values were determined using the UV assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The maximum rates of reaction were obtained at least in triplicate with substrate concentrations varying from 5 to 60 μm. Substrate stocks were prepared in acetonitrile and diluted 500-fold to yield final concentrations. Values given are the mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Kinetic values were determined using the UV assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The maximum rates of reaction were obtained at least in triplicate with substrate concentrations varying from 5 to 60 μm. Substrate stocks were prepared in acetonitrile and diluted 500-fold to yield final concentrations. Values given are the mean ± S.E. Characterization of the product of 2-AG metabolism by soybean 15-LOX was achieved by chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and MS. As described above, incubations of 2-AG with soybean 15-LOX resulted in an increase in absorbance at 236 nm, suggesting the formation of a conjugated diene. Direct infusion of the organic extract of 2-AG/soybean 15-LOX incubations into the mass spectrometer revealed a single predominant product with a mass-to-charge ratio of 433 consistent with a HpETE-G sodium adduct (Fig.4 A). Collision-induced dissociation of this metabolite produced the expected hydroperoxide cleavage and established the C-15 regiochemistry of 2-AG oxygenation by 15-LOX (Fig. 4 B). In addition to the major ion atm/z 433, minor ions were detected with mass-to-charge ratios of 449 and 465. The former (m/z 449) represents the potassium adduct of the HpETE-G species. The latter (m/z 465) is consistent with a sodium adduct of abis-dioxygenation product (M + 2O2 + Na+). Both soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX enzymes have been reported to carry out bis-dioxygenations of arachidonic acid under some conditions, and thus the appearance of an ion at m/z 465 is not surprising (32Van Os C.P.

Bailey J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3548-3555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, under the conditions employed, this species represented only a minor product and unambiguous characterization was not pursued. Reduction of the HpETE-G product of 2-AG oxygenation by 15-LOX with triphenylphosphine followed by saponification afforded a product that co-eluted on RP-HPLC with a 15-HETE standard, confirming the regiochemical assignment provided by MS. RP-HPLC-purified HETEs were methylated with diazomethane and analyzed by chiral chromatography to establish the stereochemistry of enzymatic hydroperoxidation. Soybean 15-LOX produced the expected 15(S) enantiomer almost exclusively (95.3 ± 0.2% S (mean ± S.E., n = 3)). Investigations into mammalian 15-LOX metabolism of 2-AG began with partially purified rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX (15-LOX-1). As with the soybean enzyme, rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX catalyzed the formation of conjugated diene products when incubated with 50 μm arachidonate or 2-AG (Fig. 2, C andD). The maximal rate of arachidonic acid oxygenation was higher than that observed with 2-AG. However, the diffe"

The product of the gene defective in WS, WRN, is a helicase/exonuclease that presumably functions in DNA metabolism. To understand the DNA structures WRN acts upon in vivo, we examined its substrate preferences for unwinding. WRN unwound a 3′-single-stranded (ss)DNA-tailed duplex substrate with streptavidin bound to the end of the 3′-ssDNA tail, suggesting that WRN does not require a free DNA end to unwind the duplex; however, WRN was completely blocked by streptavidin bound to the 3′-ssDNA tail 6 nucleotides upstream of the single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junction. WRN efficiently unwound the forked duplex with streptavidin bound just upstream of the junction, suggesting that WRN recognizes elements of the fork structure to initiate unwinding. WRN unwound two important intermediates of replication/repair, a 5′-ssDNA flap substrate and a synthetic replication fork. WRN was able to translocate on the lagging strand of the synthetic replication fork to unwind duplex ahead of the fork. For the 5′-flap structure, WRN specifically displaced the 5′-flap oligonucleotide, suggesting a role of WRN in Okazaki fragment processing. The ability of WRN to target DNA replication/repair intermediates may be relevant to its role in genome stability maintenance.

Werner syndrome adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate double-stranded flap endonuclease 1 single-stranded Werner syndrome (WS)1 is an autosomal recessive disease that displays symptoms of premature aging after adolescence (1Martin G.M. Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1978; 14: 5-39PubMed Google Scholar). WS is characterized by the early onset of age-related symptoms including gray hair, wrinkled skin, cataracts, atherosclerosis, diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer. WS cells grown in culture display marked chromosomal instability characterized by elevated rates of chromosomal translocations and rearrangements (2Salk D., Au, K. Hoehn H. Martin G.M. Cytogenet.

WRN is a DNA-dependent ATPase and utilizes the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded (ds)DNA (19Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J.

Using a conventional helicase directionality substrate with 2 radiolabeled oligonucleotides annealed to opposite ends of a long ssDNA molecule, it was determined that WRN helicase unwinds dsDNA with a 3′ → 5′-polarity with respect to the single strand that it is inferred to bind (21Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). WRN is also a 3′ → 5′-exonuclease (21Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A.

Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of WRN suggest that the protein plays an important role in a pathway of genome stability, but precisely what pathway of DNA metabolism is defective in WS is not well understood. The involvement of three human RecQ family members (WRN, BLM, and RECQL4) in inherited disorders (WS, Bloom syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively) characterized by genomic instability, premature aging, and cancer suggests that the helicase function is likely to be important in the molecular pathology of disease (for review, see Ref. 25Mohaghegh P. Hickson I.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A reasonable hypothesis is that specific DNA substrates may be acted upon by the helicase during replication, repair, or recombination to confer genomic stability. A role of WRN in DNA replication has been suggested by its recovery from cells in a replication complex (26Lebel M. Spillare E.A. Harris C.C. Leder P. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1992; 202: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) suggests that WRN may play a direct role in the metabolism of certain structures that potentially interfere with the progression of the replication fork. Sequence-specific DNA structures such as triplexes and tetraplexes potentially block DNA synthesis. WRN is able to resolve these structures (31Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

WRN also actively unwinds the four-stranded X structure (33Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M., Jr. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), a model for the Holliday junction recombination intermediate. Recent models propose that Holliday junctions can arise at sites of stalled DNA replication (35McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and WRN may play a role in the subsequent processing of this structure during replication restart, perhaps in a recombinational repair pathway. To understand better the substrate specificity of WRN helicase, we have examined the ability of WRN to unwind a panel of defined duplex DNA substrates using an in vitro strand displacement assay. Helicase activity assays were performed to identify the DNA duplex substrates most efficiently unwound by WRN. This system enabled us to assay carefully WRN interactions with the substrate in a functional context and to determine which features of the DNA substrate are important for WRN to initiate the unwinding reaction efficiently. It was reported previously that oligonucleotide duplex substrates with both 3′- and 5′-(ss)DNA tails are unwound preferentially compared with similar substrates with only 3′-tails (32Brosh R.M., Jr. Majumdar A.

One aspect of this study entailed defining the minimum length requirements for the 5′- and 3′-ssDNA tails of forked duplex substrates required by WRN for efficient unwinding. In addition, we have used helicase substrates with specifically positioned steric blocks to probe the preference of WRN for forked duplex structures. The replication defects and hypersensitivity to certain DNA-damaging agents of WS cells suggest a direct role of the protein in the processes of replication and/or repair. One important DNA structural intermediate in both of these processes is the 5′-ssDNA flap substrate. Flap structures may arise during Okazaki fragment processing in replication or strand displacement during DNA repair pathways such as base excision repair. Recently, we demonstrated that WRN interacts with human FEN-1 (28Brosh R.M., Jr. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), a DNA repair/replication enzyme that processes 5′-ssDNA flap structures. In the current study, we have shown that WRN efficiently unwinds the 5′-flap DNA substrate. By its action at flap structures, WRN may facilitate strand displacement by an advancing DNA polymerase and processing of unannealed 5′-ssDNA flaps. The catalytic unwinding activity of WRN may be important at specific structures of the replication fork. Although the synthetic replication fork lacks the ssDNA loading region of a typical helicase substrate, WRN effectively unwound the structure in a specific manner by directing its helicase activity in the direction of the fork, leaving the two duplex arms intact. This characteristic feature of DNA unwinding by WRN might be important at the site of a stalled replication fork or in some other aspect of DNA metabolism at the site of new DNA synthesis. The preference of WRN to unwind dsDNA substrates with junctions suggests that WRN may act upon these structures during the processes of DNA replication, recombination, or repair. The cellular defects and genomic instability of WS may arise from persistent DNA structures that fail to be acted upon by WRN helicase. Recombinant WRN protein used in this study was purified as previously described (28Brosh R.M., Jr. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A.

DNA duplex substrates were prepared as described previously (38Henricksen L.A. Tom S. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

For helicase reactions containing streptavidin, 15 nm streptavidin was preincubated with the DNA substrate with all reaction components except WRN for 10 min at 37 °C. Helicase reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min unless otherwise indicated. WRN concentrations used were 0.19, 0.38, 1.9, and 3.8 nmmonomer. Reactions were quenched with 10 μl of loading buffer (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels except where indicated in the figure legends. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the formula: % unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate controls, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with standard deviations shown by error bars. To determine the DNA substrate requirements for efficient unwinding of B form dsDNA by WRN helicase, we have tested a series of related DNA substrates (0.5 nm final DNA substrate concentration) incubated with various concentrations of WRN protein using a strand displacement assay. The products of the helicase reaction were analyzed by native PAGE to determine which substrates were most efficiently unwound. Under the reaction conditions used for these studies, the DNA oligonucleotides, both those unwound and those remaining in duplex state, were not appreciably degraded by nuclease activity of WRN as judged by quantitation of DNA products resolved on denaturing gels (data not shown). Thus, the percent of DNA substrate unwound (% displacement) is determined by the amount of intact oligonucleotide released divided by the total amount of DNA substrate in the reaction. Our initial studies were focused on determining the importance of the length of the noncomplementary 5′-ssDNA tail of a forked dsDNA substrate for the efficiency of unwinding by WRN (Table II, substrates 1–5). Because WRN has been reported to unwind dsDNA with a 3′-ssDNA overhang, the length of the 5′-ssDNA tail may also be an important factor in the WRN helicase reaction. WRN-catalyzed unwinding of a 19-bp DNA duplex with a 25-nucleotide 3′-overhang (substrate 1) is relatively inefficient, with appreciable strand displacement (20–25%) during the 15-min time course only detected at the highest WRN protein concentrations tested (1.9, 3.8 nm WRN) (Fig.1). Thus a 3.8-fold greater amount of WRN monomer (1.9 nm) compared with DNA substrate (0.5 nm) is required for detectable unwinding, suggesting that unwinding is stoichiometric. Using a DNA substrate with the same duplex region but flanked by a single noncomplementary nucleotide on the terminus of the 5′-tail (substrate 2), WRN unwound a significantly greater amount of substrate, 40 and 58% displacement at WRN concentrations of 1.9 and 3.8 nm, respectively. Using a DNA duplex substrate with a 5-nucleotide noncomplementary 5′-ssDNA tail (substrate 3), the unwinding reaction was even more significantly improved. In this case, lower concentrations of WRN (0.19 and 0.38 nm) were sufficient to unwind 10 and 28% of the dsDNA substrate, respectively. At these protein concentrations, WRN unwound ∼5.5-fold more of substrate 3 compared with substrates 2 and 1, indicating that the enzyme is more efficient at unwinding dsDNA substrates with a 5-nucleotide 5′-ssDNA flanking region compared with substrates with only a 1-nucleotide 5′-noncomplementary tail or no tail at all. At the two highest concentrations of WRN (1.9 and 3.8 nm), substrate 3 bearing the 5-nucleotide 5′-ssDNA tail was efficiently unwound by WRN, achieving 70–80% displacement. Slightly higher levels of unwinding were attained at the two highest WRN concentrations with substrate 4, which has the 10-nucleotide 5′-tail. A DNA duplex with a long 5′-ssDNA tail of 26 nucleotides (substrate 5) was unwound significantly better (∼12-fold at a WRN concentration of 0.18 nm) than the DNA substrate with only the 3′-ssDNA tail (substrate 1), clearly indicating the preference of WRN for the forked substrate. Substrate 5 was unwound better than the fork duplex with the 5-nucleotide (substrate 3) or 10-nucleotide (substrate 4) 5′-ssDNA tails at 0.19 and 0.38 nm WRN protein concentrations. At higher WRN concentrations (1.9, 3.8 nm), substrates 3, 4, and 5 were unwound nearly equally well, suggesting that a forked duplex with 5–10 nucleotides of 5′-ssDNA tail is optimally unwound by WRN. Importantly, the helicase data on this family of substrates clearly show that a forked duplex is unwound substantially better than a 3′-tailed duplex. Because the forked duplex is the preferred substrate for WRN helicase, we next addressed the importance of the length of the noncomplementary 3′-ssDNA tail of a DNA duplex substrate that is flanked by a long 5′-ssDNA tail of 26 nucleotides (Table II, substrates 5–8). A DNA substrate possessing only a single noncomplementary 3′-nucleotide (substrate 6) was essentially not acted upon by the WRN helicase (Fig. 2), similar to a previously published report (21Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and our own data that WRN does not unwind a duplex DNA substrate flanked by only a 5′-ssDNA tail. However, if the DNA substrate possessed a 5-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tail (substrate 7), significantly greater amounts of DNA unwinding were detected at WRN concentrations of 0.19–3.8 nm. At the highest WRN protein concentrations tested, 1.9 and 3.8 nm, substrate 7 was unwound 44 and 54%, respectively, a 20-fold increase compared with substrate 6. Using a 10-nucleotide 3′-tailed substrate (substrate 8), a significantly greater amount of DNA substrate was unwound compared with substrate 7 at WRN protein concentrations of 0.19–3.8 nm. The maximal difference between substrates 7 and 8 was ∼2-fold at a WRN concentration of 0.38 nm. The 25-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tailed substrate (substrate 5) was unwound very similarly compared with substrate 8 at all WRN levels. Altogether the helicase data indicate that a 3′-ssDNA tail of 5 nucleotides is the minimal length for efficient unwinding of a forked substrate by WRN and that a 10-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tail can be judged to be optimal. The results from WRN helicase assays using forked duplex substrates with a long 25-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tail and increasing lengths of 5′-ssDNA tail indicated that 5–10 nucleotides is the minimal length of 5′-ssDNA tail necessary for optimal unwinding (Fig. 1). Likewise, the results from WRN helicase assays using forked duplex substrates with a long 26-nucleotide 5′-ssDNA tail and increasing lengths of 3′-ssDNA tail indicated that a forked duplex with a 5-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tail is unwound by WRN, but a 10-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA tail is necessary for optimal unwinding (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results would suggest that WRN might efficiently unwind a forked duplex substrate with 3′- and 5′-ssDNA tail lengths of 10 nucleotides. We tested WRN on such a forked duplex (substrate 9) and found this to be the case (Fig. 2). Approximately 43% of the substrate was unwound at a WRN concentration of 0.38 nm (Fig. 2). At WRN concentrations of 1.9 and 3.8 nm, 68 and 85% of the substrate was unwound, respectively. WRN-catalyzed DNA unwinding was dependent on ATP hydrolysis because the poorly hydrolyzable analog ATPγS failed to support the unwinding reaction (data not shown). These data indicate that WRN can efficiently unwind a forked duplex with 3′- and 5′-ssDNA tails of 10 nucleotides. Comparable levels of unwinding were detected for substrates 4, 5, 8, and 9, suggesting that a forked duplex with 3′- and 5′-ssDNA tails of 10 nucleotides is unwound as efficiently as the duplex with tails of 25 nucleotides (3′) and 26 nucleotides (5′). The reported 3′ → 5′ directionality of WRN helicase (21Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) may be a consequence of unidirectional translocation on ssDNA in a 3′ → 5′ direction; alternatively, the polarity of DNA unwinding may be determined by the binding specificity of WRN protein for a ssDNA/dsDNA junction characterized by a 3′-ssDNA overhang. The latter explanation was recently proposed to be responsible for the 3′ → 5′ directionality of a recombinant Sgs1 protein fragment (39Bennett R.J. Keck J.L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To address this issue for WRN, we examined DNA binding by WRN to a number of DNA substrates used in this study, including the 3′-tailed duplex (substrate 1) and the forked duplex (substrate 5). Gel shift analysis of protein-DNA mixtures that had been incubated in the presence of ATPγS or in the absence of nucleotide did not demonstrate a major level of stable binding to any of the duplex DNA substrates (data not shown). We were able to detect reproducibly 1–2% of the forked duplex substrate 5 molecules cross-linked to 3.8 nmWRN when the samples were treated with 0.25% glutaraldehyde after the binding incubation (data not shown). Under these conditions, WRN consistently failed to be cross-linked to substrates 1 or 2, suggesting that WRN may bind slightly preferentially to forked structures compared with the 3′-tailed substrate lacking a flanking 5′-tail (substrate 1) or bearing a single nucleotide 5′-tail (substrate 2), as detected by this assay. To probe the importance of DNA structural elements for the WRN unwinding function, we tested WRN helicase activity on dsDNA substrates with specifically positioned biotin-streptavidin complexes (Table III, substrates 10–12 and 19). The streptavidin-biotin complex is an extremely strong interaction (Kd ∼ 10−15m) (40Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), and the diameter of a streptavidin tetramer, ∼45 Å (41Hendrickson W.A. Pahler A. Smith J.L. Satow Y. Merritt E.A. Phizackerley R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), has previously been shown to block dsDNA unwinding by T7 Gene 4 and DnaB helicases when it is positioned on the single strand on which the enzyme translocates (42Hacker K.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 43Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Initially, we tested a substrate similar to the DNA duplex with a 25-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA overhang (substrate 1) which also has a biotin moiety conjugated to the terminal 3′-nucleotides of the ssDNA overhang (substrate 10). Streptavidin was effectively bound to the DNA substrate throughout the time course of the experiment as detected by a gel-shifted species when streptavidin was present (data not shown). WRN unwound substrate 10 nearly equally well in the presence or absence of streptavidin, as demonstrated by only a small reduction in the level of unwinding when streptavidin was present (Fig.3). These results suggest that WRN is not required to load onto the end of the protruding 3′-ssDNA of the DNA substrate to unwind the duplex. We next tested the same 3′-tailed substrate, only the biotin was positioned 6 nucleotides upstream of the ssDNA/dsDNA junction (substrate 11). In this case, WRN was blocked from unwinding the substrate in the presence of streptavidin (Fig.4). In contrast to these results, WRN unwound up to 40% of the DNA substrate in the absence of streptavidin. The fact that streptavidin only had a minor effect on WRN helicase activity on substrate 10 under the identical reaction conditions (Fig.3) indicated that the strong inhibitory effect of streptavidin on the WRN helicase reaction is specific for substrate 11 and caused by the position of the bound biotin. We also tested WRN in a streptavidin displacement assay under reaction conditions identical to those of the helicase assay and found that WRN completely failed to displace streptavidin bound to the same biotin-conjugated oligonucleotide (TSTEM25BINT) used to construct substrate 11 (data not shown). These results suggest that streptavidin bound to the biotin-conjugate positioned 6 nucleotides upstream of the ssDNA/dsDNA junction interferes with the progression of WRN helicase into the duplex region. Because WRN was unable to displace streptavidin from ssDNA, the helicase inhibition by the internally positioned streptavidin complex suggests that streptavidin may have posed a block to translocation of WRN along the 3′-ssDNA tail to the ssDNA/dsDNA junction on substrate 11. Alternatively, the streptavidin moiety may have deterr"

The most important target of cAMP is protein kinase A (PKA), but activation of PKA is known to counteract the Ras/Raf-1/MEK signaling pathway (18Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J.

Thus, we have been in search of the pathway linking the cAMP signal to ERK activation. Recently, a second enzyme target of cAMP, cAMP-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (cAMP-GEF)/Epac, emerged as a Rap1-specific GEF (26Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Makaya M.

We now show that a variety of bone cell lines, clonal and primary, constitutively express the components of this pathway in a cell type-specific manner. Modulation of cell proliferation through cAMP signaling is regulated primarily by the expression pattern of B-Raf splice variants, and B-Raf appears to function as a molecular switch in this signaling system. The decisive role of B-Raf first identified in this study may explain the long-known dual functionality of PTH signaling in bone.

MC3T3-E1 was cultured in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)/α-minimal essential minimum (α−MEM); C3H10T1/2 was cultured in 10% FCS/basal medium Eagle's; PC12, C2C12, and MG63 were cultured in 10% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), ROS17/2.8 and ATDC5 were in 10% FCS and 5% DMEM, F12, respectively. MLO-Y4 and MLO-A5 were cultured in 5% FBS, 5% FCS/α-MEM on collagen type I-coated plates as described previously (33Fujita T. Izumo N. Fukuyama R. Meguro T. Nakamuta H. Kohno T. Koida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method as reported by Chomczynski and Sacchi (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 62: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Brain and calvaria were isolated from male ddY mice (Shimizu Experimental Supplies, Kyoto, Japan) and RNA samples were extracted. Northern blot analysis was performed under high stringency conditions as described previously (32Fujita T. Fukuyama R. Izumo N. Hirai T. Meguro T. Nakamuta H. Koida M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred on nylon membrane filters (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. cDNAs encoding PPR and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used as probes (32Fujita T. Fukuyama R. Izumo N. Hirai T. Meguro T. Nakamuta H. Koida M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After the final wash, the membrane was exposed to a BAS imaging plate (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan), and the relative signal intensity was estimated. For reverse transcription-PCR, a 0.5-μg RNA aliquot was reverse transcribed at 37 °C for 2 h in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), 4 μm random primers, 500 μm dNTPs, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. PCR was performed using one-tenth of the reverse transcription reaction volume and 30 pmol of following oligonucleotides. For Epac1, Epac1-F, 5′-GCTTCCTCCACAAACTCTCA-3′, Epac1-R, 5′-AACGCTGCCATCACCTCTCT-3′ (AN: NM_006105); for Epac2, Epac2-F, 5′-AGCCTTATCCCATCTTTCTA-3′, Epac2-R, 5′-CTGACTGTATTCGCCTCCAC-3′ (AN: NM_007023); for HPRT as an internal control, HPRT-F, 5′-GTTGAGAGATCATCTCCACC-3′, HPRT-R, 5′-AGCGATGATGAACCAGGTTA-3′. PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase on the following schedule: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 64 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min on a TAKARA PCR thermal cycler MP system (Shiga, Japan); 30 cycles for the Epac and 20 cycles for the HPRT. Half of each reaction product was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel in 1 × Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. The number of cycles selected for each primer pair produced a linear relationship between the amount of input RNA and resulting PCR products. Cells were washed twice with incubation buffer (α-MEM containing 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the same buffer containing various concentrations of test agents. The reaction was terminated with trichloroacetic acid. cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Biosciences) and the protein concentrations were estimated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) activity was measured using a colorimetric assay (35Takuma K. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Tanabe M. Yamamuro A. Lee E. Mori K. Koyama Y. Baba A. Matsuda T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 399: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/well. Cells were treated with or without various agents for 4 days. The cells were then gently washed twice with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after the addition of 100 μl of 0.5 mg/ml MTT. Then, 50 μl of solubilizing solution containing 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50% dimethylformamide, 2% acetic acid, and 2.5% of 1 m HCl, pH 4.7, was added to extract the dark blue crystals. After complete extraction, the absorbance was measured on a Bio-Rad Model 550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK), using a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 655 nm. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay was performed using the colorimetric BrdUrd Cell proliferation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (36Fujita T. Meguro T. Izumo N. Yasutomi C. Fukuyama R. Nakamuta H. Koida M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 85: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There was no difference in either assay in the number of dead cells between the cell lines determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay. FCS was reduced to 1% for all treatment conditions. The day before transfection, cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 105 cells/ml, and then transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (37Fujita T. Izumo N. Fukuyama R. Meguro T. Yasutomi C. Nakamuta H. Koida M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The vector containing both the green fluorescent protein and neomycin-resistant genes, pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Valencia, CA), and the respective vectors were co-transfected in the cells. Subconfluent cells were trypsinized and plated at low density before selection. Subsequently, cells were selected by culturing them in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. Three clones of each mutant from MC4 and MG63 were isolated. In this study, number 004, N17Rap1 MC4; number 005, V12 Rap1 MC4; number 001, N17 Ras MC4; number 021, N17Rap1 MG63; number 008, V12 Rap1 MG63; number 015, B-Raf MG63 were used. Cells were solubilized in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 3% SDS and 10% glycerol and the protein concentrations were estimated using a BCA protein assay kit. The sample was mixed with 0.1% bromphenol blue and 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and then loaded (equal amounts of protein/lane) on 10% gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting, using antibodies against Epac1 (C-17), Epac2 (M-18), B-Raf (c19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Rap1 (clone3; Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY), and phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody as described previously (37Fujita T. Izumo N. Fukuyama R. Meguro T. Yasutomi C. Nakamuta H. Koida M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a positive control, PC12 cell lysates were used. For selection of clones, anti-HA antibody (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) were used. Unless otherwise described, statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Two-way analysis of variance was performed to determine statistical differences between cultures according to time in culture. B-Raf exists as a number of isoforms that are expressed primarily in neural and endocrine tissues (26Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Makaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 38Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Falender A.E. Ochsner S. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although the 95-kDa B-Raf isoform is found in both brain and spinal cord, its presence in bone cells has not been systematically explored. We measured B-Raf protein expression in cultures of fibroblast C3H10T1/2, osteoblast MC4, chondrocyte ATDC5, two osteocytic clones MLO-Y4 and MLO-A5, two osteosarcoma cell lines, ROS17/2.8 and MG63, and myoblast C2C12 cells by Western blotting using an antibody specific for B-Raf (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). ATDC5, MC4, C3H10T1/2, and the two types of MLO cells had both the 95- and 62-kDa B-Raf splice variants, and C2C12, MG63, and ROS17/2.8 cells expressed only the 62-kDa isoform. Additionally, Epac1 and Epac2, two isoforms of Epac, and Rap1 protein expression were investigated (Fig. 1). In vivo bone expressed Epac mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Similar Epac mRNA expression was observed in brain and PC12 cells. Epac2 expression was detected in all cells (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, Epac1 was not detected in ATDC5, C2C12, and ROS17/2.8, and Rap1 expression was limited and weak in C2C12 and ROS17/2.8 cells. Either expression pattern of 95-kDa B-Raf, Rap1, or Epac, however, failed to show any notable change during maturation (Fig. 1 D,right), while ERKs (p44 and p42) were gradually decreased (Fig. 1 D, left). Taken together, these results suggest that, among cell types tested, only primary calvaria cells predominantly express the 95-kDa B-Raf isoform while the other limited lines the 62-kDa isoform alone and this allows cell type-specific cAMP signal transduction and diverse proliferative reactions. Next, we performed Northern blot analysis using specific probes for PPR and examined cAMP accumulation levels triggered by PTH-(1–34) in some clonal cells (Fig.2). PPR mRNA expression was detected in ATDC5, MC3T3-E1, and MC4 cells. The MC4 cells expressed 10-fold more PPR mRNA compared with other lines (Fig. 2 A). As expected, PTH-(1–34) dose-dependently stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells (Fig. 2 B). In MC4, cAMP accumulation levels were ∼100-fold compared with ATDC5 and MC3T3-E1. On the other hand, the increased cAMP induced by PTH-(1–34) was negligible and barely detectable in MG63, C3H10T1/2, and the two MLO cell lines (data not shown), although high enough to suppress ERK activity and cell proliferation (refer to Figs.3 B and 6 A). In development model using primary osteoblastic cells, Northern blot analysis showed that PPR mRNA expression levels were gradually increased up to 21 days and then gradually decreased (Fig.2 C). Similar results were reported in the MC3T3-E1 and ATDC5 developmental culture system (17Schiller P.C. D'ippolito G. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1174-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of ERK had a peak at the start of culture. Since the Epac pathway is expressed constantly, the ERK level peaked at the start may be an important variable to assure proliferative response toward cAMP signal that increases the cell number, as the main determinant of bone mass. These results suggest that increased intracellular cAMP is perhaps the major PTH-induced signaling mechanism in these osteoblastic cells during cell proliferation.Figure 3Regulation of ERK activity by cAMP in bone like cells. A, PTH-(1–34), Bt2cAMP (Db-cAMP), and forskolin (FK) stimulated ERK phosphorylation in ATDC5. Lysates (50 μg of proteins) from cells untreated or treated with 100 nm PTH were examined for the indicated times (left side). Indicated concentrations of PTH-(1–34) were prepared (right side). B, PTH-(1–34) stimulated ERK phosphorylation in ATDC5 and MC4, but suppressed phosphorylation in MG63 and ROS17/2.8. Cells were treated with the peptide for 10 min. C, MC4 cells were treated with agents at different concentrations for 10 min. D, effects of 1 μm H89 and 1 μm PD98059 on PTH-(1–34)- and forskolin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in MC4.

Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Regulation of ERK and growth by Rap1 and B-Raf in MG63 cells.

Similar results were obtained from four additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the consequences of elevated intracellular cAMP on bone cellular ERK activity, we measured ERK activity using antibodies specific for the active phosphorylated ERK. For these experiments, a variety of agents that can increase intracellular levels of cAMP or act as a cAMP analogue, forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP), and 8-(4-chlorphenylthio)-cyclopencyladenosine, were used. Only clonal cells expressing 95-kDa B-Raf, PTH-(1–34), forskolin, Bt2cAMP, and 8-(4-chlorphenylthio)-cyclopencyladenosine (8-CPT) increased the activity of ERK 2–12-fold more than in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3, B and C, and data not shown). Maximal activation by 1 nm PTH-(1–34) occurred rapidly, within 5–30 min and its activation was reduced by a higher concentration of the peptide (Fig. 3 A). IBMX increases cAMP levels by inhibiting its degradation by cAMP phosphodiesterase. IBMX also potentiated ERK activity (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the potentiation was due to increased intracellular cAMP. PTH-(1–34)-induced ERK phosphorylation was completely inhibited by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059. When cells were treated with H89, low concentrations of PTH-(1–34)-induced ERK activation were not affected, while increased ERK activation was observed with high concentrations of the peptide (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that PTH stimulates intracellular cAMP accumulation, cAMP then activates Rap1 via GEF molecules, both Epac dependently and PKA independently, which in turn leads to B-Raf activation and results in ERK activation. Therefore, PKA might inhibit cAMP-mediated ERK activation when excess intracellular cAMP accumulates. In our preliminary experiments, calcitonin also stimulated cAMP-ERK signaling mechanisms in two MLO cell lines that express functional calcitonin receptors. 2T. Fujita, T. Meguro, R. Fukuyama, H. Nakamuta, and M. Koida, unpublished data. Therefore, cAMP-induced ERK activation by other hormones and factors was thought to be a common regulatory pathway in bone cells. In neuronal cells, cAMP signaling has an important role in cell differentiation and survival through a Rap1-B-Raf expression-dependent mechanism (24Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Activated ERK provides a mitogenic and a differentiating signal in many cell types (22Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether cAMP stimulates cell proliferation, we examined cell proliferation of bone cells assessed by MTT and BrdUrd incorporation assays. MTT activity and BrdUrd incorporation were directly correlated with the counted cell number of MC4 and MG63 cells in our preliminary experiments, thus growth was estimated using the MTT method. There was no correlation, however, between MTT activity and BrdUrd incorporation in ATDC5 and gene-transduced cells. Therefore, the BrdUrd method was used to measure cell proliferation (data not shown). PTH-(1–34), Bt2cAMP, and forskolin stimulated BrdUrd incorporation in two B-Raf-expressing bone cell lines in a low concentration range (ATDC5 and MC4; Fig.4, A and B). With increased ERK activity, IBMX also potentiated cell proliferation in basal and cAMP-stimulated conditions (Fig. 4 C), indicating that growth potentiation was due to the increase in intracellular cAMP. The ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 inhibited cAMP-triggered ERK activation and cell proliferation (Figs. 3 D and4 D). Basal cell proliferation of MC4 was not affected by 1 μm PD98059. The PKA inhibitor H89 (1 μm) did not affect low concentrations cAMP-induced cell growth (Fig.4 D), indicating that if the PKA signaling pathway was inhibited, the mitogenic action of cAMP was not blocked because the signaling pathway of the Epac remained active. In contrast to the low concentration effects of cAMP, high concentration cAMP-induced cell proliferation was normalized to control levels. H89 did not affect the low concentration cAMP stimulation, whereas it potentiated the high concentration cAMP-mediated activation of cell growth. Thus, PKA might function to inhibit cell proliferation via ERK signal-induced mechanisms only with high concentrations of intracellular cAMP. Because Rap1 is a transducer of cAMP-mediated regulation of ERK, we next tested the hypothesis that the cAMP effect on ERK activity and MC4 proliferation is the result of Rap1 activation. We established MC4 overexpressing dominant negative N17Rap1 or the constitutively active V12Rap1 mutants, and mutants of Ras were generated and several independently isolated clones analyzed for Rap1 expression by Western blotting using HA antibody. All clones demonstrated elevated Rap1 or Ras expression compared with vector–transfected control lines (data not shown). ERK activation by PTH-(1–34), Bt2cAMP, and forskolin was observed in Ras mutant clones, whereas it was completely blocked in N17Rap1-transduced MC4 cells, and accelerated in V12Rap1-transduced cells (Fig.5 A). Thus, cAMP actions on ERK were mediated via Rap1 activation and activated Rap1 induced ERK activation. We next tested"

In addition, certain mammalian tRNA synthetases link protein synthesis to cytokine signaling pathways. In particular, human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) can be split by proteolysis into two fragments having distinct cytokine activities. One of the TyrRS fragments (mini TyrRS) contains features identical to those in CXC chemokines (like interleukin-8) that also act as angiogenic factors. Here mini TyrRS (but not full-length TyrRS) is shown to stimulate chemotaxis of endothelial cells in vitro and stimulate angiogenesis in each of two in vivo animal models. The angiogenic activity of mini TyrRS can be opposed by anti-angiogenic chemokines like IP-10.

Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Initial studies were stimulated by the finding that human TyrRS contains a C-terminal domain with 49% sequence identity to the angiostatic cytokine human endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (2Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Surprisingly two separate signaling domains are embedded in human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, and both are released upon leukocyte elastase digestion (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The isolated C-terminal domain (C-domain) had similar functional activities to its homologue endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II, such as inducing migration of mononuclear phagocytes and stimulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and tissue factor. In addition, the C-domain induced migration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and stimulated them to release myeloperoxidase (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (mini TyrRS), containing the Rossmann nucleotide-binding fold common to the 10 class I tRNA synthetases, induced directed migration of PMN cells with a bell-shaped concentration dependence like that of the CXC chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, full-length TyrRS was inactive in assays for these cytokine activities (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The similarity in PMN cell responses to mini TyrRS and IL-8 suggested a functional correlation between mini TyrRS and IL-8 activity. All CXC chemokines, such as IL-8, that function as PMN chemoattractants have a conserved Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif near the N terminus. The ELR motif is critical for PMN receptor binding and PMN activation (4Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Geiser T. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ELR motif occurs within the catalytic domain that contains a Rossmann nucleotide-binding fold. The close orthologue of mini TyrRS in bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacked the cell signaling activity, thus supporting the idea that the cytokine activity was specific to the mammalian system. Mutagenesis experiments clarified that the ELR motif in human mini TyrRS is required for PMN receptor binding and for the cytokine activities of mini TyrRS just as it is for CXC chemokines (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). All CXC chemokines containing the ELR motif, such as IL-8, act as angiogenic factors (6Koch A.E. Polverini P.J.

Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Surprisingly two separate signaling domains are embedded in human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, and both are released upon leukocyte elastase digestion (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The isolated C-terminal domain (C-domain) had similar functional activities to its homologue endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II, such as inducing migration of mononuclear phagocytes and stimulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and tissue factor. In addition, the C-domain induced migration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and stimulated them to release myeloperoxidase (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (mini TyrRS), containing the Rossmann nucleotide-binding fold common to the 10 class I tRNA synthetases, induced directed migration of PMN cells with a bell-shaped concentration dependence like that of the CXC chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, full-length TyrRS was inactive in assays for these cytokine activities (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 3Wakasugi K.

All CXC chemokines, such as IL-8, that function as PMN chemoattractants have a conserved Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif near the N terminus. The ELR motif is critical for PMN receptor binding and PMN activation (4Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ELR motif occurs within the catalytic domain that contains a Rossmann nucleotide-binding fold. The close orthologue of mini TyrRS in bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacked the cell signaling activity, thus supporting the idea that the cytokine activity was specific to the mammalian system. Mutagenesis experiments clarified that the ELR motif in human mini TyrRS is required for PMN receptor binding and for the cytokine activities of mini TyrRS just as it is for CXC chemokines (1Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). All CXC chemokines containing the ELR motif, such as IL-8, act as angiogenic factors (6Koch A.E. Polverini P.J.

https://openalex.org/W1983778749,"Tissue transglutaminase (TGase) is involved in the regulation of several biological events including cellular differentiation and apoptosis. The expression and activation of TGase are up-regulated in response to retinoic acid (RA), leading to the protection of several cell lines against N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR)-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic mechanisms of TGase are poorly understood at this time. We examined the interaction of TGase with the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a substrate of TGase that is also implicated in cell survival functions. In cells undergoing HPR-induced apoptosis, Rb is degraded. This degradation is blocked when cells are pretreated with RA, an important regulator of TGase. In vitro studies revealed that TGase protects Rb from caspase-induced degradation in a transamidation-dependent manner. Experiments performed with fibroblasts from Rb(-/-) mice further demonstrated that the presence of Rb was required for TGase to exhibit anti-apoptotic activity in response to RA treatment. Microinjection of Rb(-/-) cells with a transamidation-defective TGase mutant and Rb afforded no protection from HPR-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ability of TGase to modify Rb via transamidation underlies the ability of TGase to provide protection against apoptotic insults and to ensure that cells remain viable during differentiation."

SpoIIAB is an anti-sigma that binds and negatively regulates sigmaF, as well as a serine kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the anti-anti-sigma SpoIIAA. The crystal structure of sigmaF bound to the SpoIIAB dimer in the low-affinity, ADP form has been determined at 2.9 A resolution. SpoIIAB adopts the GHKL superfamily fold of ATPases and histidine kinases. A domain of sigmaF contacts both SpoIIAB monomers, while 80% of the sigma factor is disordered. The interaction occludes an RNA polymerase binding surface of sigmaF, explaining the SpoIIAB anti-sigma activity. The structure also explains the specificity of SpoIIAB for its target sigma factors and, in combination with genetic and biochemical data, provides insight into the mechanism of SpoIIAA anti-anti-sigma activity."

The structure of the principal C3b/C4b binding site (residues 901–1095) of CR1 is reported, revealing three complement control protein modules (modules 15–17) in an extended head-to-tail arrangement with flexibility at the 16-17 junction. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified a positively charged surface region on module 15 that is critical for C4b binding. This patch, together with basic side chains of module 16 exposed on the same face of CR1, is required for C3b binding.

Here, we report that S1P induces membrane ruffling of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), Src family tyrosine kinase(s), and the CrkII adaptor protein. S1P induced prominent phosphorylation of CrkII in HUVECs, indicating that CrkII was involved in the S1P-induced signaling pathway.

By using Picchu, a real time monitoring protein for CrkII phosphorylation, we found that S1P induced rapid CrkII phosphorylation at membrane ruffles. Finally, we observed that expression of a dominant negative mutant of CrkII inhibited the S1P-induced membrane ruffling and cell migration.

VEGFR is required to develop a new vasculature by inducing endothelial cell migration and proliferation (29Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

The results demonstrate that S1P induces CrkII phosphorylation by the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric Gi protein (Giβγ)-mediated transactivation of VEGFR followed by the activation of Src family tyrosine kinase(s) and that CrkII is responsible for the membrane ruffling and cell motility induced by S1P in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).DISCUSSIONAngiogenesis, which is observed in wound repair, tumorigenesis, and tissue ischemia, is an integral feature of vascular sprouting, branching, and remodeling and is coordinated by endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal cells (51Yancopoulos G.D.

VEGF, angiopoietin, and ephrin have been shown to be key molecules in the promotion of angiogenesis via activation of the VEGFR, Tie, and Eph expressed on vascular endothelial cells, respectively (51Yancopoulos G.D.

Recently, S1P has been identified as another potent angiogenic factor because it promotes prominent endothelial cell migration (11Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z.

However, despite these extensive studies, the molecular mechanism of S1P-induced endothelial cell migration is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we delineate a novel signaling pathway required for S1P-triggered cell migration via sequential activation of Giβγ, VEGFR, Src family tyrosine kinase(s), and CrkII.Our data support the idea that CrkII is involved in the S1P-stimulated signaling pathway in HUVECs. CrkII was phosphorylated upon S1P stimulation in HUVECs, indicating that CrkII functions downstream from the EDG receptor in HUVECs, just as it functions downstream from nerve growth factor receptors in PC12 cells and EGFR in NRK cells in response to nerve growth factor and EGF, respectively (24Hashimoto Y.

To explore where and how CrkII functions, we monitored CrkII phosphorylation in S1P-stimulated HUVECs by Picchu, which reflects CrkII phosphorylation on Tyr221. Our data showed that CrkII was phosphorylated at the site of membrane ruffling. CrkII was also localized in newly assembling focal complexes at the leading edge, where CrkII was likely to bind to p130 Cas upon S1P stimulation. 2A. Endo and N. Mochizuki, unpublished results. In addition, it has been reported that p130 Cas and CrkII are colocalized at membrane ruffles upon S1P stimulation (9Ohmori T. Yatomi Y. Okamoto H. Miura Y. Rile G. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5274-5280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that the CrkII and p130 Cas complex functions as a critical molecular switch in directing the membrane ruffling and cell migration (16Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Our results together with these reports suggest that CrkII is involved in S1P-induced membrane ruffling in HUVECs. Furthermore, the inhibition of S1P-induced membrane ruffling and cell motility by the dominant negative mutant of CrkII supports our proposal. Because Rac activation via the CrkII·DOCK180 complex has already been demonstrated both biochemically and genetically (18Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,21Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), our finding connects the S1P signal transduction cascade to the actin reorganization machinery via Rac.The present study is the first to demonstrate transactivation of VEGFR and thereby to link Gi-coupled EDG receptors to CrkII phosphorylation. S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation is dependent upon PTX and βγ subunits. This observation suggests that among the eight EDG family proteins, those coupled with Gi are responsible for the CrkII phosphorylation in HUVECs. Such candidates in HUVECs are EDG-1 and -3 (11Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Recently, heparin-binding EGF, a membrane-bound EGF-like ligand, has been shown to transactivate EGFR in COS cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid (55Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M.

If this is a general mechanism for the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGF, which is the only inducer for CrkII phosphorylation tested in this study, may be released from the cell membrane of S1P-stimulated HUVECs.We have shown that activation of VEGFR and subsequent activation of Src family tyrosine kinase(s) are required for S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation in HUVECs. We have not identified which of the VEGFR family proteins plays the principal role in the CrkII phosphorylation because antibodies highly specific to each of the VEGFR family proteins are not yet available. VEGFR-2 was phosphorylated by S1P, and CrkII phosphorylation was abolished by VEGFR-2 inhibitors. In addition, CrkII phosphorylation upon either VEGF or S1P stimulation was inhibited by CSK and PP2, indicating that VEGFR indirectly induces CrkII phosphorylation. Furthermore, S1P-promoted membrane ruffling and cell motility were diminished by an inhibitor for VEGFR-2. This is consistent with the previous finding that VEGFR-2 is responsible for migration of HUVECs (60Gille H. Kowalski J., Li, B. LeCouter J. Moffat B. Zioncheck T.F. Pelletier N. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

Thus, among VEGFR family proteins, VEGFR-2 appears to be a candidate for S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation and increase in motility of HUVECs.In conclusion, we have delineated a novel S1P signaling pathway involving a sequential activation of Gi-coupled receptor(s), VEGFR, Src family tyrosine kinase(s), and the CrkII adaptor protein.

Alternative splicing of the humancrk gene generates two Crk proteins, designated as CrkI and CrkII. CrkI lacks the carboxyl-terminal SH3 of CrkII. The SH2 domain of CrkII binds several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, p130 Cas , paxillin, and Cbl, whereas the SH3 domain of CrkII binds to C3G, DOCK180, and Abl (15Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, CrkII associated with DOCK180 has received attention for its role in cell migration (16Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

The Crk-DOCK180-Rac pathway is conserved from nematode to man and plays a critical role in the regulation of membrane ruffling and cellular migration. We have shown that one of the two major Crk SH3-binding proteins, DOCK180, binds to and activates Rac1 and Rac2 to induce membrane ruffling (18Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H.

It has been proven genetically that ced-5 is downstream fromced-2, a homolog of crkII, and upstream fromced-10, a homolog of rac (21Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat.

Notably, CrkII is also phosphorylated upon S1P stimulation in NIH-3T3 cells (28Blakesley V.A. Beitner-Johnson D. Van Brocklyn J.R. Rani S. Shen-Orr Z. Stannard B.S. Spiegel S. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

Among the many receptor tyrosine kinases, the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) is the one most highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells. VEGFR is required to develop a new vasculature by inducing endothelial cell migration and proliferation (29Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

Funct. 2001; 26: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar).VEGFR-2 evokes a wide variety of biological responses, including endothelial cell proliferation and migration and increased cell permeability via SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as Src tyrosine kinase (31He H.

This study investigates the molecular mechanism of S1P-induced endothelial cell migration. The results demonstrate that S1P induces CrkII phosphorylation by the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric Gi protein (Giβγ)-mediated transactivation of VEGFR followed by the activation of Src family tyrosine kinase(s) and that CrkII is responsible for the membrane ruffling and cell motility induced by S1P in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). DISCUSSIONAngiogenesis, which is observed in wound repair, tumorigenesis, and tissue ischemia, is an integral feature of vascular sprouting, branching, and remodeling and is coordinated by endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal cells (51Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). VEGF, angiopoietin, and ephrin have been shown to be key molecules in the promotion of angiogenesis via activation of the VEGFR, Tie, and Eph expressed on vascular endothelial cells, respectively (51Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Recently, S1P has been identified as another potent angiogenic factor because it promotes prominent endothelial cell migration (11Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z.

However, despite these extensive studies, the molecular mechanism of S1P-induced endothelial cell migration is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we delineate a novel signaling pathway required for S1P-triggered cell migration via sequential activation of Giβγ, VEGFR, Src family tyrosine kinase(s), and CrkII.Our data support the idea that CrkII is involved in the S1P-stimulated signaling pathway in HUVECs. CrkII was phosphorylated upon S1P stimulation in HUVECs, indicating that CrkII functions downstream from the EDG receptor in HUVECs, just as it functions downstream from nerve growth factor receptors in PC12 cells and EGFR in NRK cells in response to nerve growth factor and EGF, respectively (24Hashimoto Y.

Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7375-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To explore where and how CrkII functions, we monitored CrkII phosphorylation in S1P-stimulated HUVECs by Picchu, which reflects CrkII phosphorylation on Tyr221. Our data showed that CrkII was phosphorylated at the site of membrane ruffling. CrkII was also localized in newly assembling focal complexes at the leading edge, where CrkII was likely to bind to p130 Cas upon S1P stimulation. 2A. Endo and N. Mochizuki, unpublished results. In addition, it has been reported that p130 Cas and CrkII are colocalized at membrane ruffles upon S1P stimulation (9Ohmori T. Yatomi Y. Okamoto H. Miura Y. Rile G. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5274-5280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that the CrkII and p130 Cas complex functions as a critical molecular switch in directing the membrane ruffling and cell migration (16Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Our results together with these reports suggest that CrkII is involved in S1P-induced membrane ruffling in HUVECs. Furthermore, the inhibition of S1P-induced membrane ruffling and cell motility by the dominant negative mutant of CrkII supports our proposal. Because Rac activation via the CrkII·DOCK180 complex has already been demonstrated both biochemically and genetically (18Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,21Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), our finding connects the S1P signal transduction cascade to the actin reorganization machinery via Rac.The present study is the first to demonstrate transactivation of VEGFR and thereby to link Gi-coupled EDG receptors to CrkII phosphorylation. S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation is dependent upon PTX and βγ subunits. This observation suggests that among the eight EDG family proteins, those coupled with Gi are responsible for the CrkII phosphorylation in HUVECs. Such candidates in HUVECs are EDG-1 and -3 (11Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

To explore where and how CrkII functions, we monitored CrkII phosphorylation in S1P-stimulated HUVECs by Picchu, which reflects CrkII phosphorylation on Tyr221. Our data showed that CrkII was phosphorylated at the site of membrane ruffling. CrkII was also localized in newly assembling focal complexes at the leading edge, where CrkII was likely to bind to p130 Cas upon S1P stimulation. 2A. Endo and N. Mochizuki, unpublished results. In addition, it has been reported that p130 Cas and CrkII are colocalized at membrane ruffles upon S1P stimulation (9Ohmori T. Yatomi Y. Okamoto H. Miura Y. Rile G. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5274-5280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and that the CrkII and p130 Cas complex functions as a critical molecular switch in directing the membrane ruffling and cell migration (16Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Our results together with these reports suggest that CrkII is involved in S1P-induced membrane ruffling in HUVECs. Furthermore, the inhibition of S1P-induced membrane ruffling and cell motility by the dominant negative mutant of CrkII supports our proposal. Because Rac activation via the CrkII·DOCK180 complex has already been demonstrated both biochemically and genetically (18Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 20Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,21Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), our finding connects the S1P signal transduction cascade to the actin reorganization machinery via Rac. The present study is the first to demonstrate transactivation of VEGFR and thereby to link Gi-coupled EDG receptors to CrkII phosphorylation. S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation is dependent upon PTX and βγ subunits. This observation suggests that among the eight EDG family proteins, those coupled with Gi are responsible for the CrkII phosphorylation in HUVECs. Such candidates in HUVECs are EDG-1 and -3 (11Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Many Gi-coupled receptors are known to transactivate EGFR and PDGFR in various cell types and in response to a wide variety of ligands (49Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 55Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). These two tyrosine kinase receptors are, to the best of our knowledge, the only two receptors identified in Gi-mediated transactivation. The transactivation of EGFR was first reported in Rat-1 fibroblasts stimulated with endothelin-1, lysophosphatidic acid, or thrombin (56Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). PDGFR is also transactivated by angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle cells (57Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and by dopamine in CHO-K1 cells (58Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to other cell types, there was no evidence that the EGFR and the PDGFR are involved in S1P signaling in HUVECs. EGFR was not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon S1P stimulation. The EGFR inhibitor AG1478 did not abrogate either CrkII phosphorylation or ERK activation upon S1P stimulation. In addition, PDGFR may not be expressed in HUVECs, as suggested by the findings that ERK was not activated by PDGF stimulation and that S1P-stimulated CrkII phosphorylation was not abrogated by a PDGFR inhibitor. Recently, heparin-binding EGF, a membrane-bound EGF-like ligand, has been shown to transactivate EGFR in COS cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid (55Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar) and in vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated with angiotensin II (59Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). If this is a general mechanism for the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGF, which is the only inducer for CrkII phosphorylation tested in this study, may be released from the cell membrane of S1P-stimulated HUVECs. We have shown that activation of VEGFR and subsequent activation of Src family tyrosine kinase(s) are required for S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation in HUVECs. We have not identified which of the VEGFR family proteins plays the principal role in the CrkII phosphorylation because antibodies highly specific to each of the VEGFR family proteins are not yet available. VEGFR-2 was phosphorylated by S1P, and CrkII phosphorylation was abolished by VEGFR-2 inhibitors. In addition, CrkII phosphorylation upon either VEGF or S1P stimulation was inhibited by CSK and PP2, indicating that VEGFR indirectly induces CrkII phosphorylation. Furthermore, S1P-promoted membrane ruffling and cell motility were diminished by an inhibitor for VEGFR-2. This is consistent with the previous finding that VEGFR-2 is responsible for migration of HUVECs (60Gille H. Kowalski J., Li, B. LeCouter J. Moffat B. Zioncheck T.F. Pelletier N. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3222-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Thus, among VEGFR family proteins, VEGFR-2 appears to be a candidate for S1P-induced CrkII phosphorylation and increase in motility of HUVECs. In conclusion, we have delineated a novel S1P signaling pathway involving a sequential activation of Gi-coupled receptor(s), VEGFR, Src family tyrosine kinase(s), and the CrkII adaptor protein. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this novel signaling pathway is responsible for the membrane ruffling and for the increase in cell motility. We thank S.

Two nearly identical copies of SMN exist and differ only by a single non-polymorphic C to T transition in exon 7. This transition leads to alteration of exon 7 splicing; that is, SMN1produces a full-length transcript, whereas SMN2 expresses a low level of full-length transcript and predominantly an isoform lacking exon 7. The truncated transcript of SMN encodes a less stable protein with reduced self-oligomerization activity that fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1. In this paper, we identified a cis-acting element (element 1), which is composed of 45 bp in intron 6 responsible for the regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing. Mutations in element 1 or treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed toward element 1 caused an increase in exon 7 inclusion. An ∼33-kDa protein was demonstrated to associate with a pre-mRNA sequence containing both element 1 and the C to T transition in SMN exon 7 but not with the sequence containing mutated element 1, suggesting that the binding of the ∼33-kDa protein plays crucial roles in the skipping ofSMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition.

The survival of the motor neurons (SMN) gene has been identified as the disease gene of SMA and is present on chromosome 5 at 5q13 (2Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P.

SMN1 mRNA expresses a full-length transcript, whereasSMN2 produces a low level of full-length transcript and predominantly an isoform lacking exon 7 (SMNΔ7) (2Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S.

A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, a deficiency in the full-length SMN protein correlates with the disease. The critical difference between SMN1 andSMN2 is a silent nucleotide transition in SMNexon 7. SMN1 contains a C located six nucleotides inside exon 7, whereas SMN2 contains a T at this position. This transition is considered to inhibit one of the splicing regulatory elements within exon 7, which are called exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) (21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated the presence of an ESE within exon 7 and that human Tra2-β1, a member of the serine-arginine-related proteins of splicing factors, binds to the elements and stimulates an ESE (22Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, the critical C to T transition is not contained within the element. Furthermore, the transition does not change the binding activity of Tra2-β1 to the ESE. Thus, it is still unclear why the C to T transition leads to a lack of exon 7 in SMN2. In this paper, we tried to elucidate the molecular mechanisms ofSMN2 exon 7 skipping by determining the critical cis-acting elements on the SMN pre-mRNA responsible for the aberrant splicing of SMN exon 7, which contains the C to T transition. Moreover, we tried to develop strategies to enhance the inclusion of exon 7 by using antisense oligonucleotides that can inhibit the function of the cis-acting element, which we identified in this study. COS-7, HEK293T, and SK-N-SH cells were used for in vivo splicing assays. COS-7 and HEK293T cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and SK-N-SH cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 60–80% confluency on 3.5-cm dishes. Constructs of SMN1 andSMN2 mini-genes containing exon 6—exon 8 in a pCI mammalian expression vector were gifts from Drs. Elliot Androphy (Tufts University) and Christian Lorson (Arizona State University) (21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Mini-genes containing SMN1 exon 6–exon 8 and the C to T transition in exon 7 cloned into the pCI vector were mutated in element 1 by site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs (1.0 μg) were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE reagent or LipofectAMINE ACE Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were lysed in buffer RLT (Qiagen), and total cellular RNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction volume using a random primer (TaKaRa) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification analysis of the plasmid-derived cDNAs was performed using the primer set, pCI forward (5′-GCT AAC GCA GTC AGT GCT TC-3′) and pCI reverse (5′-GTA TCT TAT CAT GTC TGC TCG-3′). PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl that contained 1.2 μg of first-strand cDNA, 0.4 μm each primer, 0.2 μm dNTPs supplemented with trace amounts of [α-32P]dCTP, 5 units of rTaq DNA polymerase, and 10× PCR buffer (TaKaRa). Amplification conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step (94 °C/2 min), 30 cycles (94 °C/30 s; 56 °C/1.5 min; 72 °C/1 min), and a final extension step (72 °C/10 min). Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 5% acrylamide gel. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Quantification of the density of each band was carried out using the Densitography Program (ATTO). The ratios of inclusion of exon 7 were quantified and expressed as percentages of inclusion relative to the total intensities. Various deletion mutants ofSMN1 containing intron 6, exon 7, and intron 7 were generated by PCR using the following primer sets: OF (5′-AAG CTT GAC TAT CAA CTT AAT TTC TGA TC-3′) and 600Rev (5′-GGA TCC CTG CTG TGT CTG CCT ACT AGT G-3′) for DM1 (Fig. 2 A); O-IF (5′-AAG CTT GTA AAA TGT CTT GTG AAA C-3′) and 600Rev for DM2; IF (5′-AAG CTT GCT ATC TAT ATA TAG CTA TCT ATG-3′) and 600Rev for DM3; 600Fwd (5′-AAG CTT GGC ATG AGC CAC TGC AAG AAA AC-3′) and OR (5′-GGA TCC GAG AAT TCT AGT AGG GAT GTA G-3′) for DM4; 600Fwd and OR-IR (5′-GGA TCC GTT TTA CAT TAA CCT TTC AAC T-3′) for DM5; and 600Fwd and IR (5′-GGA TCC CAC AAA CCA TAA AGT TTT AC-3′) for DM6. These PCR products were digested withNotI and BamHI and inserted into the exon trapping vector pSPL3 (Invitrogen) (23Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Trofatter J.A. Buckler A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mutations in DM1-T were generated by PCR using the template as a mutant SMNmini-gene with mutagenized oligonucleotides (5′-AGG AAA AAA AGA AGG ATA TAA AGC TAT CTA TAT ATA G-3′ and 5′-TTT TGT TTC ACA AGA CAT TTT ACT TAT TTT ATT CAA C-3′), and these PCR products were also digested withNotI and BamHI and cloned into the vector. All constructs were sequenced before use in experiments. Total cellular RNA was isolated from transfected COS-7 cells 24 h after the transfection using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Aliquots of 3.0 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed using the SA2 primer (5′-ATC TCA GTG GTA TTT GTG AGC-3′) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Splicing products were detected by PCR using a pSPL3 vector-specific primer set, SD6 (5′-TCT GAG TCA CCT GGA CAA CC-3′) and SA2. PCR was performed in a total volume of 40 μl. Amplification was conducted as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 5% acrylamide gel. All antisense oligonucleotides containing 2′-O-methyl modifications were synthesized by Japan Bio Service Inc. The sequences of the antisense oligonucleotides were 5′-GAU AGC UAU AUA UAG AU-3′ (oligo-con), 5′-GAU AGC UAU AUA UAG AU-3′ (oligo-pyr), and 5′-UGG AUG UUA AAA AGU A-3′ (oligo-element1). Antisense oligonucleotides and various exon trapping vectors or mini-genes cloned into pCI vectors were co-transfected into COS-7 or HEK293T cells by lipofection. The final concentrations of antisense oligonucleotides in the culture medium ranged from 25 to 200 nm. For the collection of nuclear extracts, SK-N-SH cells were homogenized in 50 volumes of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm (p-amidinophenyl) methane sulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Buffers and any other solutions used in this study were sterilized before each use by filtration through a Steritop (Milipore Corporation) with a pore size of 220 nm. Following the addition of 10% Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.6%, homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants thus obtained were stored at −80 °C as nuclear extracts for pre-mRNA binding assays. Pre-mRNA binding assays were performed as described previously (24Zhu J. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, sense strand RNAs were transcribed and uniformly labeled with [α-32P]GTPs in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase (TaKaRa) from templates of 214-bp sequences containing element 1 and partial sequences of wild-type (SMN1-W) or mutant SMN1 exon 7 (C to T transition, SMN1-T). Furthermore, as a control, a RNA probe was synthesized from the template, which was mutated in element 1 of mutant SMN1 (C to T transition, mSMN1-T). The RNAs were incubated on a heat block at 25 °C with SK-N-SH cell nuclear extracts. The RNA-protein complexes were UV-irradiated (300,000 μJ/cm2) at room temperature for 5 min, digested with 10 μg of RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 30 min and resolved by 10% SDS/PAGE. To examine the splicing patterns of SMN exon 7, we usedSMN1 and SMN2 mini-gene constructs including the genomic exon 6–exon 8 in a pCI mammalian expression vector (21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, we also used expression vectors containing single nucleotide conversions that were C to T or T to C substitutions in exon 7 of the SMN1 or SMN2mini-genes, respectively. These constructs were transiently transfected into human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. After collection of total RNA from the cells, RT-PCR was performed using plasmid-specific primer sets (pCI forward and pCI reverse primers) to detect RNA processing ofSMN in each construct-transfected cell. The wild-typeSMN1 mini-gene expressed full-length SMNtranscripts with no detectable SMNΔ7, whereas the wild-type SMN2 mini-gene produced lower levels of full-length SMN and abundant SMNΔ7(Fig. 1 A). Substitution of C to T located six nucleotides inside exon 7 of SMN1 led to the exclusion of exon 7, and the splicing patterns of exon 7 were similar to those of wild-type SMN2. In contrast, the mutantSMN2 (substitution of T to C in SMN2) mini-gene produced full-length SMN transcripts. These findings were consistent with previous results (21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 25Lim S.R. Hertel K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45476-45483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and indicated that the C to T transition in SMN exon 7 had disrupted the regulation ofSMN splicing. Next we examined SMN exon 7 splicing in other kinds of cells such as COS-7 and HEK293 cells. The splicing patterns of SMNexon 7 were similar to those observed in the case of SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that SMNexon 7 splicing could be regulated by common mechanisms using the same splicing machineries in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. To determine the cis-acting elements responsible for the skipping of SMN exon 7, we constructed various deletion mutants of both wild-type SMN1 and mutantSMN1 (C to T transition in exon 7) mini-genes that contained exon 7 with flanking introns 6 and 7, and these were cloned into the exon-trapping vector pSPL3 (Fig.2 A). When the various deletion mutants of wild-type SMN1 (DM1∼6-C) were transfected into COS-7 cells, all constructs expressed the full-length type of mRNA including SMN exon 7 (+exon 7), but never expressed an isoform lacking exon 7 (−exon 7) (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the longest construct of mutant SMN1 (DM1-T), which contained a C to T transition in the SMN1 exon 7 with 156 bp of flanking intron 6 and 284 bp of flanking intron 7, expressed mRNAs with both inclusion and exclusion of exon 7 (40% inclusion) (Fig. 2 C). The ratios of exon inclusion using mini-genes containing the C to T transition in exon 7 cloned into exon trap vectors were higher than those using the pCI vector. The differences indicate that there may be some cis-acting elements that regulate the splicing of SMN exon 7 in regions that are different from the mini-gene sequences (about 600 bp) cloned into the exon trap vector. However, because the mini-genes containing the C to T transition in SMN1 exon 7 cloned into the exon trap vector (pSPL3) showed a significant increase in the exclusion of exon 7, these constructs are thought to be useful for determining the cis-elements responsible for the exclusion of exon 7 in the 600-bp mini-gene. A deletion mutant, DM3-T, which contained a deletion of 89 bp at the 5′-flanking regions of intron 6 from DM1-T, predominantly produced exon 7-included mRNA (82% inclusion), whereas the splicing pattern of deletion mutant DM2-T, which contained a deletion of 44 bp from DM1-T, was similar to that of DM1-T. Thus, the 45-bp region from −112 to −68 bp of flanking intron 6 may be a significant element for the exclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. We called this element “element 1”. For the deletion mutants in flanking intron 7, deletion mutant DM6-T, which contained a deletion of 226 bp at 3′-flanking regions from DM1-T, increased exclusion ofSMN exon 7 (25% inclusion) although deletion mutant DM5-T produced equivalent amounts of inclusion and exclusion of exon 7 similar to DM1-T and DM4-T (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the 66-bp region from +59 to +124 of flanking intron 7 (element 2) may be a critical element for the inclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. The nucleotide sequences of both elements 1 and 2 in theSMN1 and SMN2 genes are presented in Fig.2 D. The alignment showed that element 1 possessed the unique pyrimidine-rich sequences, but element 2 did not contain these unique sequences. These sequences showed complete matching betweenSMN1 and SMN2 except for one base substitution in both elements 1 and 2, suggesting that the two elements may be important for the regulation of the splicing of SMN1 exon 7 containing the C to T transition and wild-type SMN2. We performed further analysis focused on the candidate cis-acting element 1 because it may be possible to develop experimental manipulation to increase the full-length SMN mRNA containing exon 7 if the function of element 1 can be inhibited. To confirm that disruption of element 1 leads to the inclusion ofSMN1 exon 7 containing the C to T transition, the pyrimidine-rich sequences in element 1 of DM1 were mutated by substitution of pyrimidines with purines as shown in Fig.3 A. Mutation in DM1-T (mDM1-T) caused a significant increase of exon 7 inclusion compared with DM1-T, and the effects on the increase in exon 7 inclusion were similar to those of deletion mutant DM3-T (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, to confirm that the cis-acting element is significant for the negative regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing, mini-genes containing SMN1 exon 6 to exon 8 and the C to T transition in exon 7 cloned into the pCI vector were mutated at element 1 (substitution of pyrimidines with purines in a similar manner to the mutations of element 1 in the exon trapping vectors) and then examined to see whether this mutation increased the inclusion of exon 7 ofSMN1 containing the C to T transition in exon 7. The inclusion of exon 7 of the construct increased about 3.4-fold compared with that of the original construct (Fig. 3 C). Taken together with the exon trapping data, element 1 is demonstrated to be an important sequence for the exclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. Having demonstrated that element 1 in intron 6 of the SMN gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of exon 7 splicing, it was of interest to examine whether treatment of cells expressing DM1-T with antisense oligonucleotides was sufficient to lead to an increase in the inclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. We synthesized antisense oligonucleotides directed toward element 1 (oligo-element1, Fig.4 A). We further synthesized antisense oligonucleotides that were directed toward the poly-pyrimidine tract on intron 6 of SMN1(oligo-pyr) and another sequence in the intron 6 (oligo-con) as controls. These antisense oligonucleotides were co-transfected with the DM1-T vector into COS-7 cells, and total RNA was extracted 24 h after the transfection. RT-PCR was performed to examine the effects of these antisense oligonucleotides on the in vivo splicing of SMN exon 7. Treatment with oligo-element1 led to increased inclusion of SMN exon 7, and the increase was dependent on the amount of antisense oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, treatment with the other oligonucleotides did not lead to increase inclusion ofSMN exon 7, but treatment with oligo-pyr, alternatively, showed a slight decrease in the inclusion (Fig. 4, C andD). We also examined the effects of the antisense oligonucleotides on the mini-gene of SMN1 containing exon 6–exon 8 and the C to T transition in the exon 7 cloned into the pCI expression vector. RT-PCR analysis showed that treatment with oligo-element1 caused an ∼2.5-fold increase in the inclusion of SMN exon 7 compared with non-treatment-antisense oligonucleotides (Fig.5 A). The maximal effects on the inclusion of exon 7 were reached at or less than 25 nmoligo-element1. In contrast, treatment with oligo-pyr (Fig.5 C) or oligo-con (data not shown) at concentrations of up to 200 nm did not lead to any changes in exon 7 inclusion. Next, we examined whether oligo-element1 led to the inclusion of exon 7 of wild-type SMN2. As expected, treatment with the antisense oligonucleotides led to a 2.7-fold increase in the inclusion ofSMN2 exon 7, similar to the case of SMN1containing the C to T transition (Fig. 5 B). Alternatively, both oligo-pyr and oligo-con did not change the inclusion ofSMN2 exon 7 (data not shown). These findings indicate that antisense oligonucleotides directed toward element 1 are an effective tool for increasing exon 7 inclusion in mutant SMN1containing the C to T transition in exon 7 and wild-typeSMN2. Moreover, taken together with the exon trapping experiments, the cis-acting element plays important roles in the regulation of the splicing of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. To detect proteins associated with element 1, 32P-labeled RNA and SK-N-SH nuclear extracts were mixed and UV cross-linked. In this experiment, as shown in Fig.6 A, we used synthetic RNAs that were transcribed from templates of 214 bp sequences containing partial sequences of intron 6 with element 1 and exon 7 of wild-type (SMN1-C) or mutant SMN1 (C to T transition,SMN1-T). Furthermore, as a control, we synthesized RNA probes from the template, which was mutated in element 1 ofSMN1-T (mSMN1-T) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After digestion of these complexes with RNase A, proteins cross-linked to RNA were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Several kinds of bands were detected to bind to each probe in the same pattern, but an ∼33-kDa protein specifically bound to the SMN1-T probe but not to the SMN1-C probe (Fig. 6 B). The binding of the ∼33-kDa protein could not be detected in binding assays using the mSMN1-T probe, suggesting that the ∼33 kDa protein specifically bound to SMN1 pre-mRNA containing the C to T transition, and that the element 1 was essential for this binding. We performed RNA binding experiments using shorter RNA probes containing element 1 to determine whether the ∼33 kDa protein bound directly to element 1, but we could not obtain the binding activities of these shorter probes to nuclear proteins including the ∼33 kDa protein. This suggests that the ∼33 kDa protein may bind to the probes by recognizing the higher order structure of the pre-mRNA containing the C to T transition in theSMN exon 7. Therefore, it is still unclear whether or not the ∼33-kDa protein binds directly to element 1. We also observed that complexes with molecular masses about 40 kDa specifically bound to the mSMN-T probe (Fig. 6 B). However, these complexes did not bind to either the SMN1-C or –T probes. The significance of this binding has yet to be elucidated. SMN1 mRNA expresses a full-length transcript, whereas SMN2 produces a low level of the full-length transcript and predominantly an isoform lacking exon 7 (2Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S.

The critical difference between SMN1 and SMN2 is a silent nucleotide transition in SMN exon 7; that is,SMN1 contains a C located six nucleotides inside exon 7, whereas SMN2 contains a T at this position. This transition leads to alteration of the recognition of exon 7 by components of the splicing machinery (18Lorson C.L. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Cis-acting RNA elements like ESEs facilitate the splicing by recruiting general splicing factors to the adjacent exon/intron junctions (26Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 28Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that Tra2β-1, a member of the serine-arginine-related proteins of splicing factors, interacted with an exon 7 ESE common to bothSMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNAs (22Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, the critical C to T transition is not contained within the ESE where Tra2β-1 binds directly. Furthermore, the transition does not change the binding activity of Tra2β-1 to the ESE. Thus, it was still unclear why the C to T transition leads to the lack of exon 7 inSMN2. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the critical cis-acting elements on the SMN pre-mRNA responsible for the skipping of SMN exon 7, which contains the C to T transition. Deletion analysis of SMN1 pre-mRNA sequences showed that the regions from −112 to −68 bp of flanking intron 6 (element 1) and from +59 to +124 of flanking intron 7 (element 2) are significant elements for the exclusion of SMN1 exon 7 containing the C to T transition and for the inclusion of SMN1 exon 7, respectively. However, deletion of these elements from wild-typeSMN1 pre-mRNA did not affect the splicing ofSMN exon 7. Therefore, combined conditions of deletion of these elements and the C to T transition in exon 7 are necessary for the alteration of SMN exon 7 splicing patterns. The elements that we identified in the present study have not been demonstrated to be critical for the splicing of SMN exon 7. Therefore, it is unknown why the deletion of these elements leads to changes in the processing for exon 7. However, a possible mechanism is that alteration of the splicing patterns of SMN exon 7 may result from the binding of specific regulatory factors to these elements caused by changes in the higher order structure of the pre-mRNA containing the C to T transition in exon 7, and the binding of regulatory factors may sterically hinder the recognition or usage of 3′- or 5′-splice sites by splicing machineries. Previously, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 was demonstrated to inhibit splicing of HIV-tat via a hnRNP A1-responsive intron-splicing silencer (29Tange T.O. Damgaard C.K. Guth S. Valcarcel J. Kjems J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5748-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this paper, hnRNP binding sites in the tat intron were shown to match the hnRNP A1 consensus binding site, UAGGG(U/A) (30Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The element 1 identified in the present study is considered to act for an intron splicing silencer because of the increase in SMN splicing by deletion or mutation of the element. However, element 1 does not contain the hnRNP A1 consensus sequence, although it contains the unique pyrimidine-rich sequence. Therefore, element 1 could not be regulated by hnRNP A1, but a novel molecule(s) may associate with this element to inhibit the splicing ofSMN1 containing the C to T transition or wild-typeSMN2. Indeed, we found that an ∼33-kDa nuclear protein could interact with RNA probes containing element 1 and the C to T transition in SMN exon 7, although it is unclear whether or not the ∼33-kDa protein binds directly to element 1. The protein did not associate with the probe containing the wild-type SMNexon 7, suggesting that the ∼33-kDa protein does not basically act as a regulator of the splicing of wild-type SMN exon 7, but rather it plays crucial roles in the skipping of exon 7 only in the case of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. However, it remains unclear why the binding of the ∼33-kDa protein toSMN pre-mRNA sequence containing element 1 inhibits the splicing and leads to the resultant exclusion of SMN exon 7. Identification and characterization of the ∼33-kDa protein are needed to elucidate the mechanisms. Only homozygous deletions or mutations of SMN1 result in the SMA phenotype (6Coovert D., Le, T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J. Prior T.W. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1997; 6: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 9Lefebvre S. Burlet P. Liu Q. Bertrandy S. Clermont O. Munnich A. Dreyfuss G. Melki J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). SMA patients retain SMN2 alleles. Therefore, increasing the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 could provide a new therapy to lower the clinical severity of SMA. We have demonstrated that treatment of cultured cells with an antisense oligonucleotide directed toward element 1, which we identified as the cis-acting element for the exclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition, increased the inclusion of wild-typeSMN2 exon 7 and SMN1 exon 7 containing the transition. The efficiencies of antisense oligonucleotides on the increase in inclusion of SMN exon 7 are dependent on the interaction between the oligonucleotides and the target sequence. The resultant binding of antisense oligonucleotides to the target sequence, such as element 1 in the pre-mRNA of SMN, may inhibit the direct interaction of splicing silencers with the element and lead to the inclusion of SMN exon 7. Under the present conditions, treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide caused a 2.5-fold increase in the inclusion of SMN exon 7, but did not induce a shift to complete inclusion of exon 7 due to the technical limits of antisense methods. These effects were equivalent to a previously reported treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide designed to hybridize to the 3′ splice junction site of exon 8 (25Lim S.R. Hertel K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45476-45483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this report, the antisense oligonucleotide also increasedSMN2 exon 7 inclusion 2.5-fold. Therefore, the method of antisense treatment may be limited in its effects on the increase in inclusion of SMN exon 7. It has been demonstrated that increased levels of SMN2 copy numbers correlate with decreasing severity of the SMA phenotype. Therefore, even if treatment with antisense oligonucleotides leads only to a 2.5-fold increase in full-length SMN transcripts, it may still lower the clinical severity of SMA. In the present study, we found a pyrimidine-rich sequence in element 1 and a 66-bp sequence in element 2 that regulate the splicing ofSMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. Further experiments that clarify the functions of these elements, including the identification of their RNA-binding proteins, will address the mechanisms of splicing regulation of SMN exon 7. Moreover, based on these observations, experimental manipulation to modify the function of the cis-acting elements or the trans-acting factors might allow the development of therapeutic strategies for SMA.

We report on the characterization of recombinant type XIII collagen. The shed ectodomain was purified from insect cell culture medium and shown to form 240-kDa trimers with a T m of 42 °C. Correct chain association into a triple-helical conformation was confirmed by limited pepsin digestion and CD spectroscopy. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of the ectodomain revealed it to be a 150-nm rod with two flexible hinges separating 31-, 52-, and 68-nm portions. The rods represent the collagenous domains 1–3, and the hinges coincide with the non-collagenous domains 2 and 3. By using surface plasmon resonance analysis, the ectodomain showed interaction with immobilized fibronectin, nidogen-2, and perlecan with K D values in the nanomolar range. The binding sites of type XIII collagen for fibronectin were localized to the collagenous domains, whereas the binding activities for nidogen-2 and perlecan resided in the pepsin-sensitive portions of the ectodomain. Furthermore, the ectodomain bound significantly to heparin, which also inhibited shedding of the ectodomain in insect cell cultures. The results reveal that type XIII collagen is notably distinct in its structure compared with other cell-surface proteins, and the in vitro binding with fibronectin, heparin, and two basement membrane components is indicative of multiple cell-matrix interactions in which this ubiquitously expressed protein participates.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Human types I and III collagens were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). The antibodies used in this study were antiserum against the NC3 domain (5Hägg P. Rehn M. Huhtala P. Väisänen T. Tamminen M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol.

A monoclonal antibody against the recombinant human type XIII collagen ectodomain was produced and pre-screened with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (VTT Biotechnology, Espoo, Finland). The positive sera of the immunized mice were further tested with Western blotting (data not shown). One mouse was chosen for final boosting, and only one of the culture media of the fused cells showed positive signals in ELISA and Western blotting. The fusion was cloned further, and the IgG of one clone was affinity-purified. For isolation of the type XIII collagen del1–38 ectodomain, the previous purification protocol (11Nykvist P., Tu, H.

A suspension culture of High Five insect cells (1 × 106cells/ml, Invitrogen) was coinfected in serum-free Express Five medium (Invitrogen) with the del1–38 virus encoding human type XIII collagen α chains lacking the cytosolic domain (6Snellman A. Keränen M.-R. Hägg P.O. Lamberg A. Hiltunen J.K. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol.

Forty eight h post-infection, cell culture medium (400 ml) was separated from the cells by centrifuging at 340 ×g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and applied to a HiTrap Q 5-ml column (Amersham Biosciences AB). The unbound portion that contained the type XIII collagen ectodomain was loaded onto a Resource S 6-ml or a HiTrap SP 5-ml column (AmershamBiosciences AB) and eluted using a gradient program on ÄKTA explorer 10 (Amersham Biosciences AB). The fractions that contained the type XIII collagen ectodomain were concentrated to 1 ml and purified on a Sephacryl S-500 column (1.6 × 100 cm, Amersham Biosciences AB) using 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl. The purity of the elution fraction was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis (27Reisfeld R.A. Lewis U.J. Williams D.E. Nature. 1962; 195: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar) and SDS-PAGE combined with Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting. The purified sample was adapted to 50 mm acetic acid using an Ultrafree Centrifugal Filter Device (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and then lyophilized. For pepsin digestion, the purified type XIII collagen ectodomain was dissolved in 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mmNaCl, and the pH was adjusted to 2 with 0.3 m HCl. The protein was then digested with pepsin (100:1 w/w) for 10–30 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by neutralization to pH 7.0. For isolation of pepsin-resistant fragments, the digested mixture was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm,Amersham Biosciences AB) and subsequently eluted with a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 0.15m NaCl. The pepsin-digested fragments were purified withÄKTA Explorer 10 (Amersham Biosciences AB). All the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected with Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting. Glycerol spraying and rotary shadowing for electron microscopy were performed as described previously (28Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml with appropriate volumes of 40% glycerol, sprayed onto mica discs, dried in a vacuum, and rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon. The amount of purified type XIII collagen ectodomain was determined by a Micro BCA assay according to the supplier's instructions (29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Amino acid analysis was performed in a 421 amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a manual gas phase hydrolysis method according to the manufacturer's protocol. The N-terminal protein sequences were determined with a 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with samples electroblotted onto the ProBlottTM membrane (Applied Biosystems) (30Mozdzanowski J. Hembach P. Speicher D.W. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopy was carried out at 15 °C using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). The far-UV spectra of proteins were measured from 195 to 250 nm in 50 mm acetic acid. The melting curve was obtained at 222 nm by increasing the temperature linearly at a rate of 20 °C/h. Glycoproteins were detected with an Immuno-Blot Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad), and an enzymatic deglycosylation kit (Bio-Rad) was used for further glycosylation analysis. Heparin (Sigma) was added to monolayer or suspension cultures of High Five cells (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 57 μg/ml culture media (10 units/ml) before infection, and the media and cells were separated, as described previously (6Snellman A.

High Five cells were coinfected as above, and 100 ml of the cell culture (1 × 106 cells/ml) was pelleted 48 h post-infection, homogenized with 50 ml of 70 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 30 min to remove the insoluble material. The supernatant was loaded at 1 ml/min onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences AB), which was pre-equilibrated with the same homogenization buffer at 4 °C. The column was eluted in steps with the same buffer containing 0.5 and 1 m NaCl. Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed with a BIAcore® 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Proteins were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips (research grade) (Biacore AB) with standard amine coupling chemistry (25Göhring W. Sasaki T. Heldin C.-H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They were immobilized at different levels from 200 to 2000 resonance units for affinity analyses or binding kinetics studies. Binding analyses were carried out in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl containing 0.05% P-20 surfactant (Biacore AB) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The association phase was monitored for 3 min, and the dissociation curve was recorded for 10 min. The bulk effects were subtracted using reference surfaces. The chips were regenerated by treatment with 2.5 m NaCl for 2 min. In the case of regenerating a BM-40 immobilized chip, 10-s injections of 2.5m NaCl containing 5 mm NaOH were applied three times. For the calculation of kinetics constants, the association and dissociation phases of the sensorgrams for each protein analyte at different concentrations (0–100 nm) were fitted globally to the available models with BIAevaluation software version 3.1. The final models for rate constants calculation were chosen based on the residual plots, the parameters of χ2, and visual inspections of the fitting curves. Solid phase assays were performed following a published protocol (31Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Various proteins (5 μg/ml) were coated onto the plastic surface of microtiter wells at 4 °C overnight. All the other steps were performed at room temperature. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA (crystallized, SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) in 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl (TBS) for 1.5 h and then washed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated for 2.5 h with type XIII collagen ectodomain as a soluble ligand serially diluted in 1% BSA, 2 mm CaCl2, and TBS. After thorough washing, the samples were incubated for 1.5 h with an antibody against the NC3 domain of type XIII collagen (5Hägg P. Rehn M. Huhtala P. Väisänen T. Tamminen M. Pihlajaniemi T. J.

The amount of bound ligand was detected by adding 5-aminosalicylic acid (Sigma) in the presence of 0.01% H2O2. The detection was performed at 490 nm. For the heparin binding studies the microtiter wells were coated with 10 μg/ml of heparin-BSA (Sigma), and the type XIII collagen ectodomain was added as a soluble ligand. A monoclonal antibody against the type XIII collagen ectodomain was applied as the first antibody, and the secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) was used as the substrate, and detection took place at 450 nm. The heparin binding was further confirmed by means of a HiTrap heparin column (5 ml, Amersham Biosciences AB). The purified type XIII ectodomain protein was applied to a 10 mm HEPES, 0.15m NaCl-equilibrated HiTrap heparin column at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min and then eluted at 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of NaCl.

Both the full-length and the N-terminally deleted chains are known to form triple-helical molecules, but the del1–38 protein is expressed in higher amounts and shed significantly more efficiently from insect cells than the full-length type XIII collagen (32Snellman A., Tu, H.

In order to study the chemical, structural, and binding properties of type XIII collagen, we have now isolated it from the medium of High Five insect cells coinfected with the del1–38 virus and a virus 4PHαβ encoding the enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which is needed to obtain sufficient hydroxylation of proline residues in the recombinant collagen chains (33Lamberg A.

The purity of the recombinant protein was more than 95% as analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions and by acidic native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Non-reduced SDS-PAGE revealed a single band with molecular mass of about 240 kDa, whereas the reduced sample had an apparent molecular mass of 70–80 kDa, indicating that the isolated protein is a disulfide-bonded trimer. The presence of a single band in the acidic native gel electrophoresis confirmed the homogeneity of the purified protein. The purified collagen XIII was subject to amino acid analysis (TableI). A close match was observed between the measured amino acid composition and the predicted data based on the cDNA sequence, indicating that the purified protein did not contain any significant impurities. Because proline or lysine residues in the Lys position of XYG amino acid triplets in collagens are subject to hydroxylation (35Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C.

In the present case, limited pepsin digestion of the purified type XIII collagen ectodomain revealed four pepsin-resistant fragments of 20, 29, 34, and 39 kDa (Fig.2). These were subjected to N-terminal protein sequence analysis, which showed that the cleavages occurred in the non-collagenous domains NC1, NC2, and NC3 (see Figs. 1 and 2). The sequenced fragments included four prolines in positions amenable to hydroxylation, and each one of these was indeed found hydroxylated (see Fig. 2). The 20-kDa band represented the COL1 domain and 13 residues derived from NC1, whereas the 29-kDa band represented the COL2 domain, including 10 extreme C-terminal residues of the NC2. The two bands with molecular masses of 34 and 39 kDa represented the COL3 domain, and both included the four extreme C-terminal residues of the 21-residue NC3. Antibody XIII/NC4-SO against the extreme C-terminal end of type XIII collagen (6Snellman A. Keränen M.-R. Hägg P.O. Lamberg A. Hiltunen J.K. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol.

The 34- and 39-kDa pepsin fragments were subsequently separated by gel filtration and their amino acid compositions analyzed. The only difference between the two fragments was a low level of hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in the former compared with the latter (data not shown), indicating some heterogeneity produced in the protein. Low hydroxylysine levels may lead to decreased glycosylation and thus could account for the difference in size between the 34- and 39-kDa COL3 domain fragments. Type XIII collagen contains several cysteine residues, which can form either intrachain or interchain disulfide bonds (see Fig. 1). When the purified pepsin-resistant fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, the mobility of the COL2- and COL3-derived fragments were the same as detected in reduced SDS-PAGE, whereas the COL1 fragment had a reduced mobility, with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa (data not shown). The size and shape of type XIII collagen can be predicted from the sizes of fibril-forming collagen molecules, whose uninterrupted collagenous domains of about 1000 amino acid residues have lengths of around 300 nm (36Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders, Molecular, Genetics, and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). Depending on the splice variant in question, the ectodomain of human type XIII collagen is 581–706 residues in length (8Juvonen M. Sandberg M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267"
https://openalex.org/W2064284165,"CK2 is an essential, ubiquitous, and highly pleiotropic protein kinase whose catalytic subunits (α and α′) and holoenzyme (composed by two catalytic and two regulatory β-subunits) are both constitutively active, a property that is suspected to contribute to its pathogenic potential. Extensive interactions between the N-terminal segment and the activation loop are suspected to underlie the high constitutive activity of the isolated catalytic subunit. Here we show that a number of point mutations (Tyr26 → Phe, Glu180 → Ala, Tyr182 → Phe) and deletions (Δ2–6, Δ2–12, Δ2–18, Δ2–24, Δ2–30) expected to affect these interactions are more or less detrimental to catalytic activity of the α-subunit of human CK2, the deleted mutants Δ2–24 and Δ2–30 being nearly inactive under normal assay conditions. Kinetic analyses showed that impaired catalytic activity of mutants Δ2–12, Δ2–18, Δ2–24, and Y182F is mainly accounted for by dramatic increases in theK m values for ATP, whereas a drop inK cat with K m values almost unchanged was found with mutants Y26F and E180A. Holoenzyme reconstitution restored the activity of mutants Δ2–12, Δ2–18, Y26F, E180A, and Y182F to wild type level and also conferred catalytic activity to the intrinsically inactive mutants, Δ2–24 and Δ2–30. These data demonstrate that specific interactions between the N-terminal segment and the activation loop are essential to provide a fully active conformation to the catalytic subunits of CK2; they also show that these interactions become dispensable upon formation of the holoenzyme, whose constitutive activity is conferred by the β-subunit through a different mechanism.

In eukaryotic organisms nearly all aspects of cell life are controlled by reversible protein phosphorylation affecting specific seryl, threonyl, and tyrosyl residues. This reaction is catalyzed by protein kinases, which altogether make up one of the largest family of enzymes (1Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar, 2Plowman G.D. Sudarsanam S. Bingham J. Whyte D. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13603-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) committed to the regulation of most cellular functions with special reference to signal transduction, metabolic pathways, gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation (3Marks F. Marks F. Protein Phosphorylation. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Federal Republic of Germany1996: 1-31Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Given these premises it is not surprising that protein kinases generally are tightly controlled enzymes whose activity is turned on only in response to specific stimuli, through conformational modifications induced by extracellular ligands, second messengers, intrasteric interactions, association/dissociation of regulatory subunits or domains, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of residues located in critical positions. Often several regulatory devices co-exist in the same kinase to ensure a tighter control over its activity, as exemplified by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) whose activation requires both the phosphorylation of a threonyl residue in the activation loop and the association of the catalytic subunit with the cognate cyclin and whose activity can be turned off by the phosphorylation of two residues in its glycine-rich loop and by the association of the active CDK-cyclin complex with a variety of down-regulatory subunits. The crucial relevance of these regulatory devices is highlighted by the observation that numerous pathological conditions, including those due to uncontrolled cell proliferation, can be related to mutations and other kinds of genetic accidents giving rise to constitutively active forms of kinases no more susceptible to regular control (4Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar). The existence of a small number of protein kinases, which display high basal activity even under normal conditions, appears therefore a challenge to canons. Somewhat paradoxically one of these constitutively active protein kinases, CK2 (an acronym derived from the misnomer “casein kinase-2” or “-II”), belongs to the same CMGC group, including also CDKs (1Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar), and it shares with CDKs the property of forming an active holoenzyme, including both catalytic and regulatory subunits. In the case of CK2, however, not only the holoenzyme, composed by two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory β-subunits, but also the isolated catalytic subunits, are active as judged from their ability to readily phosphorylate specific peptide substrates under basal conditions, i.e. without the requirement of either specific effectors or phosphorylation events. It is possible that the high constitutive activity of CK2 on one hand reflects the extraordinary pleiotropicity of this kinase and on the other hand may account for its pathogenic potential. The increasing list of CK2 targets includes now-a-days not less than 200 proteins (5Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions and whose phosphoacceptor sites are specified by clusters of acidic side chains mostly located downstream from seryl, threonyl, and, in special cases, also tyrosyl residues (6Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 7Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marin O.

Both ATP and GTP can act as phosphate donors in CK2-catalyzed reactions. It is conceivable therefore that CK2, which is essential for viability (9Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L.P. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), is always active within the cell. Apparently this property has been exploited by many viruses to perform the phosphorylation of proteins essential for their life cycle (10Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and it may also account for the oncogenic potential of CK2, whose activity is invariably elevated in tumors (11Ahmed K.

While substantial information about the structural features conferring to CK2 its unusual site specificity (16Sarno S. Vaglio P. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Ruffato K. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11717-11724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and ability to use GTP, besides ATP, as phosphate donor (17Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) is already available, the structural bases for its high constitutive activity are still a matter of conjecture. An important clue has been provided by the resolution of the crystal structure of maize CK2 α-subunit (70% identical to its human homologue) (18Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), revealing extensive contacts between the N-terminal segment (which in CK2 is longer than it is in CDKs) and the catalytic core. As a consequence the activation loop is locked in an open conformation, similar to the one adopted in the CDK2-cyclin A complex thanks to interactions with the N-terminal part of the cyclin molecule. This suggested the possibility that in CK2α the N-terminal segment could play a role similar to cyclin in the CDK2-cyclin A complex by conferring intrinsic activity to the isolated catalytic subunits. As a corollary of this hypothesis it was also conceivable that, upon formation of CK2 holoenzyme, the activatory role of the N-terminal segment is taken over by the β-subunit, acting like a cyclin thanks to its C-terminal domain, responsible for physical interaction with the α-subunits and displaying a weak homology with the sequence of cyclin A, which makes contacts with the active site of CDK2 (19Sarno S. Marin O. Ghisellini P. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Sarno S. Marin O. Boschetti M. Pagano M.A. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12324-12329Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To assess the validity of these hypotheses a series of mutants of human CK2α have been generated bearing deletions in the N-terminal segment or substitutions of residues responsible for interactions between the activation loop and the N-terminal segment. These mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and assayed for their residual catalytic activity either as isolated entities or in association with the β-subunits. The results of this study, highlighting the crucial role of the N-terminal segment in conferring constitutive activity to the catalytic subunit by a mechanism which is different from that operated by the β-subunit, are described here. [γ-32P]ATP (2 mCi/ml) was fromAmersham Biosciences. Polylysine and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Osteopontin was kindly provided by Dr. Pi-Ling Chang (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). The K68R mutant was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (21Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All the other mutants were obtained using the “QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis” kit (Stratagene) by a strategy already described for mutants αΔ2–6 and Y26F, αΔ2–12, αΔ2–18, αΔ2–24, E180A, and Y182F (19Sarno S. Marin O. Ghisellini P. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Sarno S. Ghisellini P. Cesaro L. Battistutta R. Pinna L.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To generate the αΔ2–30 mutant the two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GGAGATATACATATGGTGGAATGGGGAAATCAAGATGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCATCTTGATTTCCCCATTCCACCATATGTATATCTCC-3′ were used, each complementary to opposite strands of human α cDNA inserted in the pT7-7 vector. The template was the α cDNA of αΔ2–24. The synthetic primers used to generate Y188F were 5′-GGCCAAGAGTTTAATGTCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGACATTAAACTCTTGGCC-3′. CK2 β-subunit and all the mutated forms of α were expressed and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (23Sarno S. Vaglio P. Meggio F. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10595-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 50% of glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Phosphorylation experiments were routinely performed at 30 °C for 10 min in a medium (30 μl final volume) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2. The presence of 100 mmNaCl and the concentration of the kinase are detailed in the legends of the figures and tables. The reaction was started by addition of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 300–1000 cpm/pmol). 32P incorporation was evaluated by the phosphocellulose paper procedure (25Ruzzene M. Pinna L.A. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 221-253Google Scholar) using the synthetic peptide RRRADDSDDDDD as specific substrate. In the case of protein phosphorylation and CK2 autophosphorylation experiments the reaction was blocked by addition of Laemmli solution followed by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar), and the gel was subjected to direct scanning on an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard). Kinetic constants were determined by double-reciprocal plots constructed from initial rate measurements fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. A synopsis of the mutants generated to assess the role of the N-terminal segment in conferring constitutive activity to the catalytic subunit of CK2α is provided in Fig. 1, where the main interactions between the N-terminal and the activation segments detected in the crystal structure of maize α-subunit (18Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) are also outlined. It can be seen that the residues involved are concentrated into a central triplet, EFY182, of the activation loop, whereas in the N-terminal segment they are spread along the sequence spanning between residues 9 and 26. The mutants fall into two categories: truncated forms with increasingly larger deletions in the N terminus, from Δ2–6 to Δ2–30, and substituted mutants in which three conserved residues whose side chains are responsible for polar interactions between the activation loop and the N-terminal segment have been individually replaced by residues unable to make the same kind of interaction (Y26F, E180A, Y182F). Two additional mutants were also generated: the “dead” mutant K68R, lacking the conserved lysine required in all protein kinases for the correct positioning of the ATP phosphate moiety and a mutant in which a tyrosyl residue of the activation loop whose phenolic group is not engaged in polar interactions with the N terminus (Y188), was replaced by phenylalanine. All the mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” They were almost completely free of contaminant proteins, as shown elsewhere for many of the mutants (22Sarno S. Ghisellini P. Cesaro L. Battistutta R. Pinna L.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As expected the dead mutant K68R was fully inactive (Fig. 2 A). Whenever tested in the absence of the β-subunit under normal assay conditions (50 μm ATP and 100 μm peptide substrate), either in the presence (Fig. 2 A) or in the absence of 100 mm NaCl (not shown), all the other mutants proved more or less defective in catalytic activity. Such a loss of activity, however, was amply variable depending on the extension of the N-terminal truncation and on the individual residue undergoing substitution. In particular the 2–6 deletion and the point mutation of Tyr188 to Phe, not expected to deeply affect the interactions between the N-terminal and the activation segments (see Fig. 1), had only marginal effect on catalytic activity. In contrast the activities of the other mutants were markedly reduced with special reference to Y182F and the deleted mutants Δ2−18, Δ2–24, and Δ2–30, the last one being entirely inactive under standard assay conditions (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained if CK2α activity was assayed on protein substrates, instead of using the specific CK2 peptide substrate. As shown in Fig.3 the phosphorylation of osteopontin and calmodulin was drastically reduced and almost suppressed, respectively, by Δ2–18, Δ2–30, and Y182F mutations. Similar data with the Δ2–30 and Y182F mutants were obtained if the protein substrates were casein and UBC3B (not shown). It can be concluded therefore that the N-terminal segment is essential to confer high constitutive activity to CK2α and that its activatory function is dependent on interactions with the activation loop. It should also be noted that the largest deletion, Δ2–30, makes the N-terminal domain of CK2α almost as short as that of p34 cdk2 , which is constitutively inactive.Figure 3Phosphorylation of protein substrates by CK2α mutants. The phosphorylation of 0.52 μm osteopontin (A) and 5.9 μmcalmodulin (B), both physiological substrates of CK2 (5Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), by CK2α wild type and the mutants Δ2–18, Δ2–30, and Y182F was performed and evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar results were obtained using as phosphorylatable substrates casein and UBC3B. This latter is a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family recently shown to be phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro and in vivo (37Semplici, F., Meggio, F., Pinna, L. A., and Oliviero, S. (2002)Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To gain more information about the molecular mechanism by which the above mutations are detrimental to catalytic activity, the kinetic constants for the phosphorylation reaction were determined whenever possible. The results, summarized in TableI, show that the drop in phosphorylation efficiency promoted by the N-terminal truncations is mostly accounted for by increased K m values with respect to the phosphodonor substrate, ATP, whereas the K catvalues, whenever these could be calculated, were only marginally altered. The same applies to mutant Y182F, where two important interactions with the backbone of the N-terminal segment (residues 9 and 16) have been abrogated (see Fig. 1). Also in this case the detrimental effect of the mutation is almost entirely accounted for by a dramatic raise of the K m for ATP (from 10 to 377 μm). In contrast the mutations of Tyr26 and Glu180, which hydrogen bond to each other (see Fig. 1), only marginally affect the K m value, while causing a 4-fold drop in K cat. These data are consistent with a scenario whereby the interactions between the distal part of the N-terminal segment and the activation loop are of crucial importance for keeping the active site readily accessible to ATP, whereas additional interactions with residues closer to the proximal (C-terminal) end of the N-terminal segment are required to optimize the catalytic event.Table IKinetic constants of CK2α mutantsMutants K m K cat μm min −1Wild type1064Δ2–61569Δ2–1220644Δ2–1830034.5Δ2–24>500n.d.Δ2–30>500n.d.Y26F3032E180A18.512Y182F37733Y188F3769All the kinetics was performed using the peptide RRRADDSDDDD (200 μm) as phosphorylatable substrate and variable amounts of CK2α wild type and mutants (0.22–2.2 pmol).

Experimental conditions are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” K m and K cat are expressed as μm and min−1, respectively. The data presented are the means of at least three separate determinations with a S.E. less than 15%. All the mutants considered above were able to associate with the β-subunit to give heterotetrameric holoenzymes similar to wild type CK2, as judged from gel filtration experiments (not shown). This raised the question of whether association with β-subunit restores the activity of defective CK2α mutants to wild type level. As shown in Fig.2 B this is the case of mutants Y26F, E180A, Y182F, Y188F, Δ2–6, Δ2–12, and Δ2–18, whose activity becomes comparable with that of wild type upon addition of equimolar amounts of the β-subunit. Especially noteworthy is in this respect the behavior of mutants E180A and Y182F, since these residues are crucial for the anchoring of the N-terminal segment as judged from both crystallographic evidence (17Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1) and the detrimental effect of mutating them (Fig. 2 A and Table I). Therefore the finding that the activity of these mutants is restored to wild type level upon association with the β-subunit would imply that the N-terminal segment and the β-subunit activate CK2α by distinct and independent mechanisms. On the other hand also the intrinsically inactive mutants Δ2–24 and Δ2–30 are activated upon association with the β-subunit, reaching 50 and 25% of the activity of the wild type holoenzyme, respectively, at variance with the dead mutant K68R, which remains nearly inactive also once combined with the β-subunit (Fig. 2 B). These data were obtained using the specific CK2 peptide substrate, but the same extent of re-activation by the β-subunit was also observed if the assay was run with the protein substrates osteopontin and UBC3B (not shown). To gain more information about the properties of normoactive holoenzymes reconstituted with CK2 α-subunits intrinsically defective in catalytic activity, their kinetic constants were compared with those of the wild type holoenzyme. As shown in TableII their values are similar to those of wild type, with the exception of mutants Δ2–24 and Δ2–30, whose persistently impaired catalytic efficiencies are accounted for both by higher K m and lower K catvalues. It is noteworthy anyway that the huge K m values typical of the isolated α-subunit mutants Δ2−12, Δ2−18, Δ2–24, and Y182F (see Table I) are now drastically lowered to values close to wild type (Table II). This would indicate that the proper conformation of the ATP binding site, which is altered by the disruption of interactions between the activation loop and the N-terminal segment, is restored upon association with the β-subunit. Apparently, however, this is not sufficient for conferring a conformation identical to that of the wild type holoenzyme, based on at least two independent lines of evidence: first the holoenzymes reconstituted with mutants Δ2–24 and Δ2–30 still display reduced catalytic activity (see fig. 2B); second, as shown in Fig.4, the truncated holoenzymes are more thermolabile than wild type.Table IIKinetic constants of CK2 holoenzymes reconstituted with mutants of the α-subunitMutants + β K m K cat μm min −1Wild type2095Δ2–63094Δ2–122683Δ2–1828.572Δ2–2470.328Δ2–3010333E180A2778Y182F2863CK2α wild type and mutants (0.22–2.2 pmol) and equimolar amount of β-subunit were combined to reconstitute CK2 holoenzymes. 100 mm NaCl was present in the phosphorylation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).

K m andK cat are expressed as μm and min−1, respectively. The data presented are the means of at least three separate determinations with a S.E. less than 15%. Also the autophosphorylation pattern of CK2 holoenzymes reconstituted with mutants bearing large N-terminal deletions is symptomatic of significant conformational alteration. With CK2 wild type autophosphorylation under basal conditions almost exclusively occurs at the β-subunit. Upon addition of polylysine and other polycationic effectors such a β-autophosphorylation decreases, while a concomitant autophosphorylation of α becomes detectable (27Meggio F. Brunati A.M. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 this pattern is significantly altered with mutants Δ2–12 and Δ2–18; at variance with wild type both display a marked autophosphorylation of the α-subunit, even in the absence of polylysine. Addition of polylysine triggers the autophosphorylation of CK2 α wild type, whose intensity, however, is negligible as compared with that of the mutants. It can be concluded therefore that high α autophosphorylation is a hallmark of deleted mutants, possibly reflecting a better exposure of the phosphoacceptor site(s), which in the case of the α-subunit are still unidentified. At variance with the great majority of protein kinases the catalytic subunits of CK2 are endowed with intrinsic catalytic activity in the absence of phosphorylation events, which are required by other kinases for conferring to the activation loop the correct conformation (28Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and/or for removing autoinhibitory domains from the active site (29Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Association with the regulatory β-subunit, to give the heterotetrameric holoenzyme, further increases catalytic activity assayed with peptide substrates, but is not a sine qua non requirement for activity, as it is in the case of the cyclin dependent protein kinases, belonging to the same group as CK2, whose association with the cognate cyclin is an absolute prerequisite for the catalytic subunit to become active. Since constitutive activity is suspected to underlie the pathogenic potential of CK2, the understanding of the structural features responsible for it could help to develop new strategies and/or inhibitors capable to attenuate the consequences of uncontrolled CK2 activity within the cell. The data presented here disclose the existence of two distinct molecular mechanisms conferring constitutive activity to the isolated catalytic subunits of CK2 and to CK2 holoenzyme, respectively. Constitutive activity of CK2 catalytic subunit is conferred by interactions between the activation loop and the N-terminal segment, which in CK2 is about 30 residues longer than it is in CDKs. Both deletions of the N-terminal segment in fact and mutation of residues shown in the crystal structure of maize CK2α to make contacts between it and the activation loop are detrimental to catalytic activity, and in particular truncated mutants entirely lacking the N-terminal segment are fully inactive, similar to the catalytic subunits of CDKs. Disruption of the interactions between the activation loop and the N-terminal segment primarily results in a dramatic drop in affinity for ATP whose K m value raises from 10 μm(with wild type) to >500 μm with the most defective mutants. This validates the hypothesis based on the crystal structure of maize CK2α (17Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) that the N-terminal segment plays an essential role in making the active site readily accessible to ATP by keeping the activation loop in an “open” conformation. The function of the N-terminal segment, however, appears to be even more crucial and complex if it is taken into account that on one side the catalytic activity of the deleted mutant Δ2–30 cannot be restored to any appreciable extent even raising the ATP concentration beyond 500 μm, while, on the other, the two point mutations of Tyr26 and Glu180, which make an important hydrogen bond between each other, to Phe and Ala, respectively, are both severely detrimental by affecting the K catof the reaction and not the K m for ATP (see TableI). This shows that the N-terminal segment is a key structural element essential for conferring to the active site of CK2 at least two important functions, high affinity binding of ATP and high catalytic efficiency. From our data it appears that the former function is mediated by the distal part of the N-terminal segment, approximately upstream from residue 18, since the disruption of the interactions occurring within this stretch give only rise to increasedK m values for ATP and the consequent loss of function of mutants Δ2–12, Δ2–18, and Y182F can be overcome by increasing the ATP concentration. In contrast the more proximal part of the N-terminal segment appears to be relevant to catalysis, since the disruption of the hydrogen bond between Tyr26 and Glu180, by mutating either of the two side chains, causes a drop in K cat with only a marginal effect on theK m for ATP. This would also explain why the loss of activity of mutants Δ2–30 and, to a lesser extent Δ2–24, cannot be overcome by increasing ATP concentration. Presently we do not know whether this mechanism of CK2α activation is reversible, a possibility that could underlay a new mode of regulation. The interactions between the N-terminal and the activation segments are very tight, and peptides reproducing these two structural elements (α1–30 and α175–201) had little effect on the constitutive activity of CK2α, even if their concentration was raised up to 800-fold molar excess over that of the kinase (30Sarno, S., Moro, S., Meggio, F., Zagotto, G., Dal Ben, D., and Pinna, L. A. (2001) Pharmacol. Ther., in pressGoogle Scholar). The possibility, however, cannot be ruled out that specific and more efficient ligands of the N-terminal segment might exist, which could display a down-regulatory effect. Partial inactivation could also be promoted by limited proteolysis cleaving the distal part of the N-terminal segment. Pertinent to this may be the observation that one component of the anthrax lethal toxin, LF, is a metalloprotease that cleaves the N terminus of MAPKK1 and MAPKK2 and that this cleavage inactivates the kinase and blocks the MAPK signal transduction pathway (31Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to check whether the N terminus of CK2 catalytic subunits is also susceptible to specific cleavage by proteases. Another noteworthy outcome of our study was that all the mutants with deletions or substitutions in either the N-terminal segment or the activation loop were still able to interact with the β-subunit and, more important, to undergo thereby a recovery of catalytic activity. In the case of mutants that are only defective in K m for ATP the recovery of activity, accounted for by a drop in the abnormally high K m for ATP, was nearly complete. In the other cases, with special reference to the “inactive” α mutants Δ2–24 and Δ2–30 the recovery of activity was only partial, with K cat values still quite lower than wild type. In general it may be concluded anyway that the β-subunit makes the N-terminal segment, or at least its more distal part, dispensable as far as both high affinity binding of ATP and, to a lesser extent, catalytic efficiency are concerned. Intriguingly, however, the β-subunit does not simply replace the N-terminal segment by making interactions with the activation loop, as it was tempting to assume (19Sarno S. Marin O. Ghisellini P. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), also by analogy with the similar role played by the cyclin molecule in the CDK2-cyclin complex (32Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Such a simplistic interpretation in fact would be not consistent with either the mutational analysis presented here or the structural data published elsewhere (33Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On one side two detrimental mutations in the activation loop, Glu180 → Ala and Tyr182 → Phe, become fully ineffective upon association with the β-subunit, indicating that these residues are not required to mediate activation by the β-subunit. On the other hand the crystal structure of a complex between maize CK2α subunit and a fragment of the β-subunit (33Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) revealed no contacts whatsoever with that region of the catalytic core (with special reference to the activation loop), which in the structure of the isolated α-subunit interacts with the N-terminal segment. Although only a small fragment of β is bound to α in the complex, this includes the C-terminal region of the β-subunit, which is responsible for the main physical interactions with the α-subunit, as judged from both mutational studies (34Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12672-12677Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and experiments with synthetic peptide substrates (20Sarno S. Marin O. Boschetti M. Pagano M.A. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12324-12329Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Very importantly this β peptide also mimics the stimulatory effect of the whole β-subunit on the activity of CK2α (33Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as well as on the defective mutant Δ2–18 (not shown). While this manuscript was in preparation the solution of the crystal structure of CK2 holoenzyme (35Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.-G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) corroborated our conclusions by showing that all the contacts with full size β-subunit occur with α residues concentrated in the upper lobe, between positions 36 and 108, i.e. downstream from the N-terminal segment and upstream from those elements of the catalytic core, which make contacts with the N-terminal segment. These contacts undergo no substantial alteration in either of the two structures (33Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.-G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore it has to be assumed that the molecular mechanism by which the β-subunit surrogates the activatory function of the N-terminal segment is different from that exploited by the N-terminal segment itself. Such a situation is schematically illustrated in Fig.6 showing that the activation loop in the isolated α-subunit requires the N-terminal segment to be held in the active conformation (Fig. 6 A). Our data would indicate that upon truncation of the N-terminal segment the activation loop rotates to an inactive conformation similar to that found in CDK2, where the N-terminal segment is intrinsically lacking (Fig.6 B). Such a conformational alteration detrimental to activity appears to be counteracted by the association with the β-subunits, since the complex is active also in the absence of the N-terminal segment of the α-subunit (Fig. 6 C). Looking at the overall structure of the CK2α·β peptide complex (33Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and of the holoenzyme (35Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.-G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), it is not clear how the β-subunit makes dispensable the interactions between the N-terminal segment and the activation loop to preserve the constitutive activity of the catalytic subunit; in both complexes the backbone of the α-subunit is almost perfectly superimposable to that of the isolated α-subunit. One possibility would be that small changes in the backbone could nevertheless promote significant alteration of individual side chains, resulting in the stabilization of the activation loop in its open conformation. Pertinent to this may be the observation that Ala193, i.e. the only residue falling in a disallowed position of the Ramachandran plot in the crystal structure of maize CK2α (18Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), moves to a permitted region in the complex with the β-peptide (33Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Marin O. Issinger O.-G. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5184-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Considering that the structural tension of the backbone around Ala193 is believed to reflect the tendency of the activation loop to change its orientation unless it is locked into its active conformation by the N-terminal segment (17Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.-G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6), the release of such a tension upon formation of the α·β complex could provide the key to understand why the holoenzyme is constitutively active even in the absence of the interactions between the activation loop and the N-terminal segment. Actually, as pointed out elsewhere (22Sarno S. Ghisellini P. Cesaro L. Battistutta R. Pinna L.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 227: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) the rotation around the backbone of Ala193 induces the displacement of another conserved residue of the activation loop, Ser194, whose side chain makes contacts with two residues of the catalytic loop, Asp156 and Lys158, both crucially implicated in catalysis. The finding that CK2 possesses two independent mechanisms for conferring constitutive activity to its catalytic subunits and to the holoenzyme, respectively, highlights once more the peculiarity of this enigmatic kinase and rises a new question about its biological role. Given that the heterotetrameric holoenzyme is anyway constitutively active even in the absence of intrasubunit interactions between the N-terminal and the activation segments, which the raison d'etre of constitutive activation of the isolated catalytic subunits might be? A plausible answer would be that CK2 holoenzyme(s) and isolated catalytic subunits play distinct functions within the cell and thereafter they need independent mechanisms of activation. Although incontrovertible evidence of the existence of free CK2 catalytic subunits inside the cell is not available yet, the finding that the α/β interface in the CK2 holoenzyme is far below the value of permanent protein-protein complexes (35Niefind K. Guerra B. Ermakowa I. Issinger O.-G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5320-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) suggests that CK2 holoenzyme is a complex susceptible to in vivo formation and dissociation. The recently described mechanism by which CK2 associates with TATA-binding protein (36Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 575-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) would also imply the occurrence of CK2 holoenzyme association-dissociation.

To determine whether the degree of ionization of these compounds plays a role in their interaction with OCT2, we examined the influence of external pH values on the activity of the human ortholog of OCT2, as expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells. Importantly, changing the pH value from 7.0 to 8.0 had no effect on the rate of transport of the fixed cations, tetraethylammonium and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium,i.e. the pH value did not have an effect upon the transporter itself. Cimetidine (pK a 6.92), a competitive inhibitor of hOCT2, displayed a 3.5-fold increase in IC50 as pH values increased from 7 to 8. hOCT2-mediated cimetidine transport decreased over this pH range, the consequence of an increase in K t and decrease inJ max at the higher pH value. The weak bases trimethoprim and 4-phenylpyridine showed a similar pattern of pH-sensitive interaction with hOCT2. The non-ionizable sterol, corticosterone, also inhibited hOCT2 activity, although it was neither competitive in nature nor was it sensitive to pH in the manner observed with weak bases.

Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), i.e. compounds that possess a net positive charge at physiological pH. Excretion of organic cations (OCs)1 is believed to occur in two steps: uptake of the OC by the proximal tubule cell across the basolateral membrane followed by the extrusion of the OC out of the cell across the luminal membrane (2Budiman T. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. Nagel G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29413-29420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Ullrich K.J. J. Membr.

The transporters responsible for the movement of OCs into the proximal tubule cell are the organic cation transporters (OCT). Although the term “organic cation transporter” implies that the cationic charge is a defining element in the interaction of substrate with carrier, this is currently not believed to be the case. In a landmark study, Ullrich and Rumrich (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) used the stop-flow peritubular microperfusion method to determine that the charge status has no effect on the interaction of weak bases with the peritubular OC transporter(s) in rat proximal tubules. The conclusion was based on the observation that varying pH values from 6.0 to 8.0 had no effect on the inhibitory interaction of cimetidine and several other weak bases with peritubular NMN transport. This result, along with the observation that many uncharged steroid hormones inhibit peritubular OC transport (6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), has been used to support the conclusion that renal OC transporters “do not see the degree of substrate ionization” (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several of the transporters believed to play a role in peritubular OC transport have been cloned in recent years, including OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 (7Karbach U. Kricke J. Meyer-Wentrup F. Gorboulev V.

Although all three OCTs are expressed in the kidney (13Motohashi, H., Sakurai, Y., Saito, H., Masuda, S., Urakami, Y., Goto, M., Fukatsu, A., Ogawa, O., and Inui, K.-I. (2002) J. Am. Soc.

(2002) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 13,Google Scholar). Whereas the transport properties of rat OCTs, including rOCT2, have been studied extensively, the human ortholog has received comparatively little attention. hOCT2 transport has been shown to be pH-independent, electrogenic, and polyspecific (8Gorboulev V. Ulzheimer J.C. Akhoundova A. Ulzheimer-Teuber I. Karbach U. Quester S. Baumann C. Lang F. Busch A.E. Koepsell H. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), characteristics common to all OCTs (14Burckhardt G. Wolff N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F853-F866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we reexamined the influence of substrate charge status on the interaction of weak bases with a renal organic cation transporter, the human ortholog of OCT2. Differences in extracellular pH were used to alter the degree of ionization of several weak bases, including cimetidine. In all cases, weak bases were less effective inhibitors of hOCT2-mediated transport at pH 8 than at pH 7. By contrast, changes in pH values had no effect on the interaction of hOCT2 with substrates that have fixed charge, including tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 1-methyl-4-phenypyridinium (MPP). The neutral steroid corticosterone did inhibit hOCT2 activity, but the inhibition was not competitive and may not have represented an interaction with the OCT2 binding site. We conclude that the degree of ionization does affect a compound's ability to interact with hOCT2. CHO-K1 cells were acquired form the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia) and grown in Ham's F12 Kaighn's modification (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For stable expression of hOCT2, cells were electroporated with 10 μg of hOCT2-pcDNA3.1 plasmid DNA and 10 μg of salmon sperm (Invitrogen) in a 4-mm gap cuvette using a BTX ECM 630 electroporator with settings of 1050 microfarad, 260 V, and no resistance. Forty-eight hours following the electroporation, positively transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). Five clones that tested positive for TEA transport were chosen, grown up and maintained in growth medium containing 1 mg/ml geneticin. The two clones that transported TEA at the highest level were characterized in greater detail. The time course and kinetics of TEA transport of each was measured in several separate experiments (with successive passages). Values for J max andK t for TEA transport were consistently similar for the two clones, and one was selected to conduct all the experiments in the present study. CHO-K1-hOCT2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (USA Scientific, Ocala, FL) and grown to confluency. Once confluent, the medium was aspirated and 1 ml of Waymouth buffer (in mm: 135 NaCl, 13 Hepes, 2.5 CaCl2-2H2O, 1.2 MgCl2, 0.8 MgSO4-7H2O, 5 KCl, 28 glucose) was placed in each well for 15 min. The buffer was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of fresh buffer for an additional 15 min. Following the incubations, 400 μl of transport buffer containing 0.75 μCi/ml [3H]TEA or 1 μCi/ml [3H]cimetidine (for cimetidine kinetic studies) and increasing concentrations of the inhibitor in Waymouth buffer was added to the wells. At intervals, the transport buffer was removed, and each well was rinsed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold Waymouth buffer containing 250 μmtetrapentylammonium to stop transport. Cells were solubilized with 400 μl of 0.5 n NaOH in 1% SDS by shaking for 30 min. Solubilized cells were neutralized with 200 μl of 1 nHCl. The solution was triturated, and 500 μl was removed and placed in a scintillation vial. Six ml of liquid scintillation mixture was added to each vial, and the amount of radioactivity was determined using a scintillation counter (Beckman model LS3801). Each individual transport experiment was done in triplicate on one plate. Experimental observations were confirmed, typically two or three times (i.e. n = 2 or 3), in separate experiments using different cell passages. All experiments were performed on passages 4–28 with no appreciable difference in the results obtained with early versus later passages (i.e. little change in K t for TEA). [3H]TEA (13.2 Ci/mmol) was acquired from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). [3H]Cimetidine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. TEA, cimetidine, tetrapentylammonium, and trimethoprim were purchased from Sigma. 4-Phenylpyridine was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals, corticosterone was purchased from Tokyo Chemical industry (TCI, Tokyo, Japan), and MPP was purchased from Research Biochemicals International (RBI, Natick, MA). Other chemicals were acquired from standard sources and were generally the highest purity available. Uptake of 57 nm [3H]TEA into wild-type CHO-K1 cells was comparatively low, and co-incubation with an excess of unlabeled TEA had no appreciable effect on this accumulation. Uptake of [3H]TEA into a clonal line of CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with hOCT2 was 20-fold higher than into wild type cells, and this uptake was reduced 98% by co-exposure with 2.5 mmunlabeled TEA (inset of Fig.1). Fig. 1 shows the time course of [3H]TEA uptake into these CHO-K1 cells. Accumulation of TEA increased time dependently. Because uptake remained linear through 5 min, and therefore represented the initial rate of transport, this point was chosen to do the subsequent kinetic studies. As a quaternary ammonium compound, the state of ionization of TEA is effectively independent of pH. Consequently, a shift in external pH from 7.0 to 8.0 should have no effect on the concentration of TEA+ (although it may be expected to have an effect on the operation of hOCT2-mediated transport activity). Fig.2 shows the effect of a shift in external pH from 7.0 to 8.0 on the kinetics of TEA transport in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hOCT2. As shown in Equation 1, the addition of unlabeled TEA inhibited uptake of [3H]TEA by a process adequately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition (15Malo C. Berteloot A. J. Membrane Biol. 1991; 122: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)J=Jmax[*T]Kt+[*T]+[T]+CEquation 1 where J is the rate of [3H]TEA transport from a concentration of labeled substrate equal to [*T];J max is the maximum rate of mediated TEA transport; K t is the TEA concentration that results in half-maximal transport (Michaelis constant); [T] is the concentration of unlabeled TEA in the transport reaction; andC is a constant that represents the component of total TEA uptake that is not saturated (over the range of substrate concentrations tested) and presumably reflects the combined influence of diffusive flux, nonspecific binding and/or incomplete rinsing of the cell layer. As shown in Fig. 2, the kinetics of TEA transport were virtually identical at both pH 7.0 and 8.0 (the inset shows the relationship between uptake of total TEA, i.e. labeled plus unlabeled, and the concentration of total TEA in the medium). In five separate experiments, the K t values at pH 7.0 and 8.0 were 28.5 ± 2.7 μm and 31.6 ± 7.6 μm, respectively, with J max values of 7.3 ± 1.2 and 8.4 ± 1.8 pmol cm−2min−1, respectively. If, as implied from the above observation, the transport process is not sensitive to changes in external pH between 7.0 and 8.0, then competitive interaction between transport of [3H]TEA and a second quaternary ammonium substrate should also be insensitive to this change in pH. Fig. 3 shows this to be the case with respect to the inhibition of TEA transport produced by MPP. In two separate experiments, shifting external pH from 7.0 to 8.0 had no effect on the IC50 for MPP inhibition of hOCT2-mediated TEA transport: IC50 values of 2.3 ± 0.2 and 2.0 ± 0.1 μm at pH 7.0 and 8.0, respectively. We conclude from these observations that hOCT2, as expressed in CHO-K1 cells, is insensitive to changes in external pH between the range of 7.0 and 8.0 and that interaction of quaternary ammonium substrates with hOCT2 is not influenced by this shift in external hydrogen ion concentration. Ullrich and Rumrich (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) observed in the in vivo rat kidney that changes in external pH values (from 6 to 8) influenced neither the inhibitory influence of cimetidine on basolateral NMN transport nor the rate of cimetidine transport across the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells. Because over this pH range the relative concentrations of charged (cationic) and uncharged cimetidine were expected to change dramatically, they concluded that basolateral organic cation transport does not sense the degree of substrate ionization. We tested this conclusion as it pertains to the influence of external pH on the interaction of cimetidine with hOCT2. The reported pK a of cimetidine varies between 6.8 and 7.0 (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,16Somogyi A. Gugler R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1983; 8: 463-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We independently measured a value of 6.92 and used it for subsequent calculations of the degree of cimetidine ionization at the test pH values used in this study. At pH 7, ∼46% of the molecules are protonated, whereas at pH 8, the value drops to 7.4% as calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (17Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). In other words, the 10-fold decrease in [H+] results in an ∼6-fold decrease in the concentration of protonated cimetidine. This decrease in the protonated species would likely decrease the ability of cimetidine to inhibit [3H]TEA transport if hOCT2 “sensed” the difference in the protonated (Cim+) over the unprotonated (Cim0) compound, which should be observed at pH 8 as an increase in the concentration of total cimetidine required to inhibit hOCT2-mediated TEA transport. Results of our inhibition experiments are presented in Fig.4. The shift in pH from 7 to 8 did produce an increase in IC50 for cimetidine's interaction with hOCT2. Whereas at pH 7 the IC50 for cimetidine inhibition of TEA was 12.9 ± 1.0 (n = 3) μm, at pH 8 the IC50 increased to 45.7 ± 2.9 μm. It is noteworthy that, although the amount of (Cim+) was calculated to decrease by 6-fold between pH 7 and 8, the difference in IC50 values was only 3.5-fold. Using the pK a value of 6.92, we also calculated the IC50 values on the presumption that only protonated cimetidine (CIM+) interacted with hOCT2. The resulting IC50 values were not the same, as might be expected from a calculation that used only the calculated (CIM+) concentration at each pH but were 5.9 and 3.4 μm at pH 7.0 and 8.0, respectively. Additional competitive inhibition studies were performed, and the results of one such experiment are shown in Fig. 5. In three separate experiments performed at pH 7, the addition of 45 μm cimetidine increased the K t for TEA from 24.8 ± 2.6 μm to 127.2 ± 10.9 μm with no change in J max (5.1 ± 0.4 versus6.3 ± 0.9 pmol cm−2 min−1), resulting in a calculated K i for cimetidine at pH 7 of 10.9 μm. At pH 8, the K t for TEA transport was also increased by the addition of 45 μmcimetidine, from 19.6 ± 1.2 μm to 65.5 ± 5.7 μm, with no change in J max(5.2 ± 0.3 versus 7.0 ± 0.8 pmol cm−2 min−1) and a calculatedK i of 19.2 μm. These observations support the conclusion that the degree of ionization does play a role in cimetidine's interaction with the transporter. However, it is also apparent that the inhibitory interaction of cimetidine with hOCT2 appears to be stronger at pH 8.0 than can be explained by only the protonated concentration of substrate according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Nevertheless, the interaction of cimetidine with hOCT2 is influenced by external pH in a manner consistent with the conclusion that the charged substrate interacts preferentially with the hOCT2 binding site.Figure 5Competitive inhibition of TEA transport by cimetidine at pH 7 (A) and 8 (B) in CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with hOCT2. Five-minute uptakes of 57 nm [3H]TEA ± 45 μmcimetidine were measured at pH 7 (●) and 8 (○) in the presence of increasing concentrations of TEA (0–2.5 mm). Eachpoint represents uptake from a single well. For the representative experiment shown the K t for TEA at pH 7 was 28.3 μm and increased to 144 μmwith the addition of 45 μm cimetidine. TheK t at pH 8 for TEA was 19.7 μm and increased to 69.8 μm with the addition of 45 μm cimetidine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the interaction with hOCT2 of two other weak bases, trimethoprim and 4-phenylpyridine. Like cimetidine, the protonated concentration of trimethoprim (pK a 6.85) changes substantially over the pH range of 7.0–8.0. Whereas at pH 7 ∼41.5% of the trimethoprim is protonated (trimeth+), at pH 8 only 6.6% is protonated. Fig. 6 Ashows the results of an experiment that tested the effect of shifting external pH from 7.0 to 8.0 on the kinetics of trimethoprim inhibition of hOCT2-mediated TEA uptake. In two such experiments at pH 7, the IC50 for trimethoprim inhibition was 60.0 ± 8.2 μm, whereas at pH 8, the IC50 increased to 116.5 ± 0.4 μm. As with cimetidine, the increase in the IC50 value at pH 8.0 was consistent with a preferential interaction of the protonated species with the hOCT2 binding site. However, the 2-fold increase in IC50 was not proportional to the calculated 6-fold decrease in [trimeth+] expected to result from the shift in external pH from 7.0 to 8.0. 4-Phenylpyridine (pK a 5.37) closely resembles the structure of MPP, the difference being a tertiary, rather than quaternary, nitrogen in 4-phenylpyridine. By calculation there is a 10-fold difference in the concentration of the protonated species at pH 7 versus 8, although with the low pK a of 4-phenylpyridine, the absolute concentrations are comparatively low at both pH values. Fig. 6 B shows the results of an experiment that compared the kinetics of 4-phenylpyridine inhibition of hOCT2-mediated TEA uptake at pH 7.0 and 8.0. In two such experiments the IC50 for 4-phenyl-pyridine inhibition of TEA at pH 7 was 20 ± 1.3 μm, compared with 106 ± 7.6 μm at pH 8. Again, the 5-fold increase in IC50 was less than that predicted based upon the 10-fold decrease in concentration of protonated substrate at pH 8. However, the similarity in structure between MPP, which interacted with hOCT2 in a pH-independent fashion, and 4-phenylpyridine, which showed this marked sensitivity to pH, strongly supports the contention that charge status of the substrates plays a critical role in binding to hOCT2. Corticosterone has been shown to interact with the organic cation transporters even though it does not possess a positive charge (6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We investigated inhibition of hOCT2-mediated TEA transport by corticosterone at pH 7 and 8 to determine whether it is a competitive inhibitor and to see if pH has an effect on a compound that is uncharged. Results from one of these experiments are shown in Fig. 7. Although corticosterone did inhibit TEA transport at both pH 7 and 8, that inhibition was neither competitive in nature nor was it sensitive to pH in the manner observed with weak bases. At pH 7, the presence of 12 μm corticosterone increased theK t for TEA transport by 3-fold (from 34.0 to 100 ± 2.7 μm; n = 2), while decreasing the J max by 3-fold (from 10.6 ± 1.2 to 3.4 ± 0.9 pmol cm−2 min−1). At pH 8 the J max was also decreased by ∼3-fold (from 13.3 ± 2.1 to 4.0 ± 0.8 pmol cm−2min−1), while the K t was unchanged (65.0 ± 7.3 versus 71.0 ± 2.4 μm). This inhibitory profile reflects a form of “mixed-type” inhibition (18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar) and suggests that the interaction of corticosterone with organic cation transporters should not be used as evidence that cationic charge is not a critical parameter for stabilization of substrate binding. To determine whether or not the charge of the substrate affects its ability to be transported, we measured uptake of [3H]cimetidine. As previously mentioned, the percentage of total cimetidine-bearing charge is about 6-fold higher at pH 7 than at pH 8; so if substrate charge influences hOCT2-mediated transport, cimetidine uptake should be greater at pH 7 than at pH 8. In fact, the rate of 0.1 μm cimetidine was 2.5-fold higher at pH 7 than at pH 8 (results not shown). The decrease in cimetidine transport at pH 8 reflected both an increase in average K t(from 8.6 ± 2.2 μm at pH 7 to 18.1 ± 5.0 μm at pH 8) and a decrease in averageJ max (from 0.8 ± 0.3 pmol cm−2 min−1 at pH 7.0 to 0.4 ± 0.2 pmol cm−2 min−1 at pH 8.0) in five separate experiments. The physiological dichotomy of renal secretion that includes apparently discrete pathways that handle “organic cations” or “organic anions” has been a central tenant of renal physiology (19Rennick B. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: F83-F89PubMed Google Scholar,20Roch-Ramel F. Besseghir K. Murer H. Windhager E.E. Handbook of Physiology. II. Oxford University Press, New York1992Google Scholar). Although it has long been recognized that transcellular transport of both classes of compound involves multiple parallel pathways (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), it has also been generally assumed that the central physical feature that influences interaction with one or the other of these pathways is the presence of either cationic or anionic charge. With respect to the “classical” organic cation secretory pathway, this view has been based primarily on the observation that, in addition to interaction with substrates having fixed cationic charge (e.g.quaternary ammonium compounds), the strength of interaction with weak bases is generally inversely proportional to their pK a values. In other words, bases with high pK a values (e.g. >9), which are predominantly protonated and, therefore, positively charged at physiological pH, generally interact more effectively with renal OC transporters than do weak bases with low pK a values (21Ullrich K.J. Papavassiliou F. David C. Rumrich G. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1991; 419: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two sets of observations by Ullrich et al. in the early 1990's challenged this long-held view. First, they demonstrated a substantial degree of “cross-over” between substrates generally assumed specific for one or the other of the classical OC or organic anion secretory pathways. Employing the stop-flow peritubular capillary microperfusion method, they showed that the basolateral OC transporter interacts with (i.e. is inhibited by) a broad range of non-cationic substrates, including a number of neutral steroid hormones and negatively charged (at physiological pH) organic acids (6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a separate study (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), they showed that the interaction of weak bases with peritubular OC transport in rat proximal tubules is insensitive to changes in extracellular pH over the range pH 6–8. The rate of cimetidine transport into rat proximal cells was shown to be independent of pH as well. These observations lead Ullrich to propose as one of several rules for substrate interaction that the presence of cationic charge does not play a direct role in influencing binding to renal OC transporters (3Ullrich K.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that charge does play an important role in stabilizing the binding of substrates to at least one OC transporter, i.e. the human ortholog of OCT2. When external pH was increased from 7 to 8, thereby decreasing the fraction of protonated (i.e. positively charged) weak base molecules in solution, interaction of those compounds with hOCT2 systematically decreased. Importantly, changing the pH value of the extracellular medium did not have an effect on the interaction of hOCT2 with the quaternary ammonium compounds, TEA and MPP, which possess a fixed positive charge independent of pH changes. Because theK t for TEA and the IC50 for MPP remained unchanged as the pH value of the transport buffer was increased from 7 to 8, it can be assumed that, within this pH range, there are no structural changes in hOCT2 that significantly influence its transport activity. Furthermore, the observed changes in interaction of hOCT2 with the weak bases cimetidine, trimethoprim, and 4-phenylpyridine indicate that the change in fractional protonation of these compounds is the basis for their decreased interaction with the transporter at pH 8. If binding of substrate to hOCT2 required that the molecule contain a charged group, one might expect kinetic calculations based on the proportion of molecules charged at each pH value to result in equal kinetic parameters (as seen for the compounds with fixed charge). This was not the case. Inhibition of transport activity exerted by all three weak bases was greater at pH 8 than predicted based on the comparatively low, calculated concentration of charged species at the elevated pH. For example, the IC50 values for cimetidine's inhibition of hOCT2-mediated TEA transport were 12.9 and 45.7 μm at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Given a pK a of 6.92 at pH 7, 45% of total cimetidine in solution should be charged, whereas at pH 8, this fraction decreases to 7.4%. IC50 values at pH 7 and 8, determined using the proportion of cimetidine predicted to be charged as the only inhibiting species, were not the same but were lower at pH 8 (3.4 μm) than at pH 7 (5.9 μm). In other words, cimetidine was a more effective inhibitor at pH 8 than predicted from its relatively low fractional protonation at that pH. At least three explanations for this discrepancy suggest themselves. First, it is possible that the unprotonated, as well as the protonated, form of a weak base interacts with hOCT2, albeit with a substantially reduced affinity for the receptor. If this were the case, then the shift in IC50/K i expected to occur between pH 7 and 8 would be less than that predicted on the assumption that only the charged species binds to the receptor. Second, the pH value at the membrane surface could be lower than that in the surrounding “bulk” medium. Indeed, this has been shown to be the case for a number of cell types, reflecting the influence of the activity of proton efflux processes (e.g. Na/H exchange; (22McEwan G.T. Daniel H. Fett C. Burgess M.N. Lucas M.L. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 234: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) or the negative surface charge of membrane surfaces (23Dzekunov S.M. Spring K.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whatever the reason, an elevated [H+] at the membrane surface would have a proportionately greater effect on the numbers of charged weak bases in an alkaline solution than in a more acidic one and could result in the type of disproportionate inhibitory activity of weak bases at pH 8. Third, the pK a value of a weak base as determined in bulk solution may be very different from the pK a value within the microenvironment of the receptor. To the extent that the “effective” pK a values of the weak bases were higher within the region of the transport receptor than in free solution, there would be a smaller difference in the fraction of protonated species in solution at pH 7 and 8 and a concomitant decrease in the predicted difference in IC50/K i values at the two pH values. Whatever the basis for the discrepancy between the observed and predicted degrees of interaction of weak bases with hOCT2, the principal point is that the degree of substrate ionization does play a central role in their ability to bind to hOCT2. Another observation that has been used to support the conclusion that charge does not play a role in binding of substrates to renal OC transporters is that a number of neutral steroids are highly effective inhibitors of peritubular OC transport (6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We examined the mechanistic basis of the interaction of the steroid corticosterone with hOCT2. Although we confirmed that corticosterone is an extremely effective inhibitor of hOCT2 (IC50 of <10 μm), it is not a competitive inhibitor. The reduction in transport activity produced by acute exposure to corticosterone was the result of a large decrease in J max, as well as a modest increase in K t (Fig. 7). There are many possible mechanisms to account for this “mixed type” profile of inhibition (18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar) including interactions at the binding site. However, it cannot be assumed that corticosterone is interacting with the transporter at the same site as TEA or that it is necessarily a substrate for the OCTs. Consequently, inhibitory interactions of non-charged substrates with renal OC transporters should be interpreted with caution. The importance of charge in stabilizing substrate interaction with hOCT2 contrasts sharply with the absence of such influence evident in the aforementioned studies in intact rats (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). At least three issues could be involved in this discrepancy. First is the possible influence of species differences. Marked species differences have been noted with respect to both quantitative (IC50) and qualitative (actual transport) differences in OC interactions with human, rat, mouse, and rabbit orthologs of OCT1 (24Dresser M.J. Gray A.T. Giacomini K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 1146-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, substrate charge may play a less important role in binding to rOCT2 than it does to hOCT2. Second, the interaction reported in Ullrich's (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Ullrich K.J. Papavassiliou F. David C. Rumrich G. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1991; 419: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) studies might reflect interactions with OCT homologs other than OCT2. In the human, OCT2 appears to be the only OCT homolog expressed at appreciable levels in the basolateral membrane of human proximal tubules (13Motohashi, H., Sakurai, Y., Saito, H., Masuda, S., Urakami, Y., Goto, M., Fukatsu, A., Ogawa, O., and Inui, K.-I. (2002) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 13,Google Scholar). In the rat kidney, however, OCT1 is expressed at substantial levels in the S1 and S2 segments of rat proximal tubules, whereas OCT2 is restricted to the S2 and S3 segments (7Karbach U. Kricke J. Meyer-Wentrup F. Gorboulev V. Volk C. Loffing-Cueni D. Kaissling B. Bachmann S. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F679-F687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microperfusion method employed in the studies of Ullrich et al. (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) would be expected to access both S1 and S2 segments as exposed at the surface of the cortex. Thus, the results of Ullrich's experiments may have reflected, or been dominated by the characteristics of rOCT1, rather than rOCT2. Finally, the possible discrepancy between the results reported here compared with those observed by Ullrich et al. (5Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) may reflect the different techniques used to make the measurements. The in vivo microperfusion method relies on the rapid delivery of very small volumes of test solution to the local environment of the selected proximal tubules. The substantial buffering capacity of the extracellular compartments through which the test solution must pass before reaching the transport surface may have limited the degree of change in the external pH value to which the transporters and substrates were actually exposed. This confounding point would not have been an issue in the present studies employing confluent monolayers of cells grown in culture wells. In summary, the interaction of weak bases with hOCT2 was markedly influenced by the pH of the extracellular medium, an effect almost certainly reflecting the influence of pH on the net charge of these molecules. In contrast, changes in external pH had no effect on the interaction of substrates having fixed cationic charge. In addition, the inhibitory interaction of a neutral steroid with hOCT2 was not competitive, suggesting that such interactions may not involve the binding of a neutral molecule at the OCT2 binding site. These results suggest that OCT2 does detect the degree of ionization of its substrates and that the presence of cationic charge stabilizes the binding of substrate to the transport receptor."

The resulting hydroxylysine residues have two important functions. They are essential for the stability of the intermolecular collagen cross-links, and their hydroxy groups serve as attachment sites for carbohydrate units, either the monosaccharide galactose or the disaccharide glucosylgalactose (1Kivirikko K.I.

An additional important goal was to determine whether pure recombinant LH3 preparations have any collagen glucosyltransferase activity, what the level of any such activity might be, how this activity may be related to the domain structure of the enzyme, and whether the enzyme also has collagen galactosyltransferase activity.

The constructs thus contain a baculovirus GP67 signal sequence, a histidine tag, and cDNAs coding for the processed LH polypeptides. LH fragment constructs with an N-terminal histidine tag were generated by amplifying cDNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–262, 255–572, and 565–709 of LH1 and 1–266, 261–577, and 570–714 of LH3.

The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing on an automated device (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using BigDye or dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kits (PE Biosystems). The recombinant baculovirus vectors were cotransfected intoSpodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with modifiedAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BD PharMingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant viruses were selected (18Crossen R.

High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in suspension in Sf900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells, seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate or 1 × 106/ml, were infected at a multiplicity of 5 with the viruses coding for the histidine-tagged full-length LH1, LH2, or LH3 or the LH1 and LH3 fragments and fragment pairs.

Aliquots of the soluble fractions of the cell homogenates were analyzed by 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the cell pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS and analyzed in the same manner. To purify the histidine-tagged full-length LH1, LH2, and LH3 and the LH1 and LH3 fragments and fragment pairs, the media from the suspension cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 10 min, and samples were incubated with ProBond metal chelate affinity resin (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, and 0.02 m Tris buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C overnight with gentle mixing. The amount of ProBond used was 2 ml per 100-ml medium sample. The ProBond resin was packed into a column and washed with 10 volumes of the above buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.2 or 0.4 mimidazole. Fractions of 3 ml were collected and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Fractions containing the full-length LH polypeptides or the fragments or fragment pairs were pooled, and the samples were passed through a PD-10 column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, and 0.02 m Tris buffer, pH 7.5, to remove the imidazole. The protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular weights of the full-length LH isoenzymes were determined by gel filtration in a calibrated HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted with 0.2m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 1% glycerol, and 0.02m Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Purified full-length recombinant human LH1, LH2, or LH3, 10–100 μg, was digested with thermolysin, trypsin, or proteinase K at a protease:LH ratio of 1:100 to 1:10 at 37 °C for 30–90 min, and the digestion was stopped by the addition of Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or EDTA (for thermolysin) to 3 mm. Samples were analyzed by 12% Tris-Tricine PAGE, transferred to a ProBlott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) by Western blotting, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The protease-resistant peptides were cut from the membrane and subjected to N-terminal sequencing in an Applied Biosystems, Inc., 477A pulse-liquid protein sequencer. LH activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate using a synthetic peptide (Ile-Lys-Gly)3 as the substrate (19Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). K m values were determined as described previously (20Puistola U. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T.M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I.

Collagen galactosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase activities were assayed by a method based on the transfer of [14C]galactose or [14C]glucose from radioactive UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose to hydroxylysine or galactosylhydroxylysine residues, respectively, in a denatured citrate-soluble rat skin collagen substrate, and the values were converted to mmol of the radioactive product synthesized per mol of enzyme in 1 min with a saturating concentration of the collagen substrate (19Kivirikko K.I.

Transverse 0–8m urea gradient gel electrophoresis (22Wingfield P.T. Pain R.H. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.E. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science.

In order to develop a simple method for purifying LH polypeptides, cDNAs coding for the processed LH1, LH2, and LH3 polypeptides were cloned into a pAcGP67A expression vector, and a histidine tag was inserted between the GP67 signal sequence and the LH cDNA in each case. High Five insect cells cultured in suspension were infected with baculoviruses coding for the histidine-tagged LH1, LH2, or LH3 polypeptides. Medium samples were harvested 48 h after infection and incubated with a ProBond metal chelate affinity resin, and the unbound proteins were washed off with the column equilibration buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with imidazole. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were found to contain polypeptides with sizes of 80–85 kDa, corresponding to full-length LH1, LH2, or LH3. The identities of the polypeptides were verified by N-terminal sequencing (data not shown). The fractions containing the LH1, LH2, or LH3 polypeptides were pooled; imidazole was removed in a PD-10 column, and the purified samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A) and nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 1 B). The final preparations were found to be pure after one-step metal chelate affinity purification (Fig. 1) and to have LH activity (as shown for LH1 in Table I). Gel filtration experiments in a calibrated column indicated that all three LH isoenzymes had identical molecular weights, about 180,000 (details not shown).Table ILysyl hydroxylase activities of purified recombinant LH1 and its recombinant fragmentsPolypeptideLysyl hydroxylase activity dpm/nmolLH1 Expression set 1116,000 Expression set 294,000B–C Expression set 183,000 Expression set 2142,000A0A–B0The activity values obtained for various LH1 preparations varied considerably due to inactivation.

Therefore, the values are shown for two separate sets of expression, purification, and assay (sets 1 and 2, respectively) of full-length LH1 and fragment pair B–C. All values are given as dpm of 14CO2 formed per nmol of polypeptide. In order to identify possible domain structures of the human LH1, LH2, and LH3 polypeptides, the purified recombinant enzymes were subjected to limited proteolysis with thermolysin, trypsin, or proteinase K for 30–90 min at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by 12% Tris-Tricine PAGE and Coomassie staining. Five major protease-resistant peptides of about 68, 37, 33, 18, and 16 kDa were found after digestion of the LH polypeptides with thermolysin, trypsin, and proteinase K (as shown for a thermolysin-digested sample of LH1 in Fig.2), except that the 18-kDa fragment was not obtained for LH3 (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing of the major protease-resistant LH1 peptides showed that the N terminus of the 68- and 33-kDa peptides contained the histidine tag, whereas the N-terminal amino acid of the 37-kDa peptide was either Gly-261, Ile-262 (Fig.3 A), or Asp-253 (proteinase K, data not shown) depending on the protease used, and those of the 18- and 16-kDa peptides were either Ile-571 (Fig. 3 A) or Gly-573 (proteinase K). The N-terminal amino acids of the corresponding protease-resistant LH3 peptides were a histidine from the affinity tag, Leu-241 or Thr-264 and Leu-576 (Fig. 3 A) or Gly-578 (proteinase K, not shown). The data would be consistent with the presence of at least two main protease-sensitive regions in LH polypeptides and would suggest the existence of at least three structural domains, termed fragments A, B, and C, respectively (Fig.3 B). The calculated molecular masses with these cleavage sites are 29.6, 36.2, and 15.9 kDa for the nonglycosylated LH1 fragments and 30.4, 36.2, and 15.8 for the LH3 fragments. The 68-kDa polypeptide corresponds to fragment pair A-B, the 33-kDa polypeptide to fragment A with efficient utilization of its twoN-glycosylation sites, and the 37-kDa polypeptide represents fragment B, whereas the 18-kDa peptide obtained only from LH1 is probably due to utilization of the N-glycosylation site present at residue 668 in the 16-kDa fragment C of LH1 but not LH3. The N-terminal amino acids of the protease-resistant LH2 peptides were not determined, but in view of their similarity in size to the protease-resistant LH1 and LH3 peptides, these sites were assumed to be located in the corresponding regions. Protease cleavages at some additional sites were also occasionally observed in some of the purified LH samples, mainly when a 1:10 protease to LH ratio was used (Fig. 3 A). No such additional sites were identified with either thermolysin or trypsin within regions B and C (Fig. 3), whereas two additional protease-sensitive sites were found within region A in some experiments, but not all, and therefore this region may in fact consist of up to three domains (Fig. 3). However, as these minor sites were seen only in some experiments, they may also represent protease-sensitive sites within a folded domain. Limited proteolysis with proteinase K identified a few additional sites in some experiments that were not sensitive to thermolysin or trypsin and are therefore not likely to represent additional domain boundaries (details not shown). In order to study whether it is possible to express the recombinant LH1 and LH3 fragments A–C in folded forms, recombinant pAcGP67A vectors coding for the LH1 amino acids 1–262, 255–572, and 565–709 and the LH3 amino acids 1–266, 261–577, and 570–714 were generated. Each construct contained sequences coding for a histidine tag between those coding for the GP67 signal sequence and the LH fragments. Recombinant viruses coding for the LH fragments were used to infect High Five insect cells in suspension, and the cells and medium samples were harvested 48 h after infection. The cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was homogenized further in a buffer containing 50% glycerol (11Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.-M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), incubated on ice, and centrifuged. The remaining pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All recombinant LH fragments were found to be partly soluble in the glycerol-containing buffer, but the highest amounts were found in the SDS-soluble fraction (details not shown). Similar data have been reported previously (8Passoja K. Rautavuoma K. Ala-Kokko L. Kosonen T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fragments A of LH1 and LH3 were secreted into the culture medium and could be purified to homogeneity from medium samples as described above for the full-length polypeptides (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the levels of fragments B and C in the culture medium were too low for attempts to purify them to homogeneity (details not shown). To study whether it is possible to express the LH1 and LH3 fragment pairs A-B and B-C in folded forms, recombinant pAcGP67A vectors coding for the LH1 amino acids 1–572 and 255–709 and the LH3 amino acids 1–577 and 261–714 were generated with N-terminal histidine tags, and the recombinant viruses were used to infect High Five insect cells in suspension. A significant portion of these fragment pairs was found to be secreted into the culture medium and could be purified to homogeneity as above (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). To study whether the purified recombinant A fragments and the A-B and B-C pairs were folded, purified samples were analyzed by urea gradient gel electrophoresis and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Urea gradient gel analyses indicated that the recombinant LH1 and LH3 A fragments and fragment pairs were fully folded, as a sigmoidal transition in mobility resulting from unfolding along the urea gradient was observed in all cases, as shown in Fig. 4 B for LH1 fragment A. The far-UV CD spectra of the purified recombinant LH1 and LH3 A fragments and the A-B and B-C pairs were also typical of a folded protein (Fig.5). The purified recombinant full-length LH1 and LH3 isoenzymes and their recombinant fragments were analyzed for lysyl hydroxylase activity with an assay based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate with the synthetic peptide (Ile-Lys-Gly)3 as a substrate (19Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). As reported previously (17Heikkinen J. Risteli M. Wang C. Latvala J. Rossi M. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. J. Biol.

Consequently, activity values are given in Table I only for LH1. As expected, the recombinant LH1 and LH3 A fragments and A-B pairs that lacked the C-terminal catalytic region had no LH activity (as shown for LH1 in Table I). Surprisingly, the recombinant LH1 pair B-C, which contains all the critical residues required for cosubstrate binding and lacks the N-terminal 30-kDa A fragment, was a fully active lysyl hydroxylase (Table I). The LH3 pair B-C lost its activity particularly rapidly. The activity levels obtained with this fragment pair were nevertheless found in some purification experiments to be identical to those measured for the full-length LH3 purified at the same time (details not shown), indicating that the B-C pair of LH3 is probably also a fully active enzyme. The K m values of the LH1 B-C pair for the peptide substrate and the cosubstrates Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbate were essentially identical to those of the full-length LH1 and LH3 enzymes (TableII).Table IIK m values of purified recombinant LH1 and LH3 and the recombinant LH1 fragment pair B–C for cosubstrates and peptide substrateSubstrate or cosubstrate K mLH1LH1:B–CLH3Fe2+5412-Oxoglutarate120140100Ascorbate350330350(IKG)3400380430K m values were determined as described previously (20Puistola U.

Recently we have reported that hyaluronic acid (HA) can also support the adhesion of IRBCs in vitro and appears to be another receptor for parasite sequestration in the placenta (7Beeson J.G.

Because there are thought to be no other modifications in the carbohydrate chain, the structural requirement of HA for interaction with IRBC can be readily deduced, and the major feature is believed to be a minimum chain length of 12 monosaccharide residues (7Beeson J.G.

Lawson A.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, understanding the molecular interactions involved between CSA and IRBC is more difficult due to the greater complexity of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains.CS chains comprise repeating disaccharide units of 4-O-substituted hexuronic acid (HexA) β1–3-linked toN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), i.e.4HexAβ1–3GalNAc1. CS chains show heterogeneity in sulfation patterns and hexuronic acid compositions (glucuronic acid (GlcUA)/iduronic acid (IdoUA)) due to different sulfate content and substitution and differing degrees of isomerization of GlcUA to IdoUA. Typically, GalNAc is mono-O-sulfated at either the 4- or the 6-O-position, and this differentiates the principal CSA and CSC disaccharide units, respectively. CSB (or dermatan sulfate) is similar in sulfation to CSA, but the hexuronic acid is predominantly IdoUA. In addition, other variations in sulfation pattern frequently occur, such as GalNAc being non-sulfated or 4,6-di-O-sulfated, and GlcUA can be 2-O-sulfated. Several studies demonstrate the importance of 4-O-sulfation for binding of IRBC (3Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C., Ng, K. Reeder J.C. Brown G.V. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Robert C. Pouvelle B. Meyer P. Muanza K. Fukioka H. Aikawa M. Scherf A. Gysin J. Res.

Parasite adhesion to purified or cell surface CSA can be effectively inhibited by CSA but not by CSB, CSC, heparin, or desulfated chondroitin (3Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C., Ng, K. Reeder J.C. Brown G.V. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Robert C. Pouvelle B. Meyer P. Muanza K. Fukioka H. Aikawa M. Scherf A. Gysin J. Res.

We previously defined the minimum chain length of CSA required for parasite adhesion to be 12–14 monosaccharide residues and identified that undersulfation was a structural feature of the active CSA, and oversulfation was a feature of the inactive CSC (10Beeson J.G. Chai W. Rogerson S.J. Lawson A.M. Brown G.V. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3397-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that non-sulfated disaccharide units may also be important elements of the structural motif required for parasite adhesion in addition to 4-O-sulfate groups of GalNAc.To further define key structural features that influence adhesion of IRBCs, we have isolated and characterized a range of variously sized oligosaccharide fragments from CSA polysaccharides, including fully sulfated components and undersulfated minor components, and tested their ability to competitively inhibit parasite adhesion to CSA. Selective desulfation of oligo- and polysaccharides was performed to directly compare the influence of 6-O-sulfated disaccharide units and non-sulfated units on adhesion, and undersulfated CSB oligo- and polysaccharides were prepared to evaluate the relative importance of the form of hexuronic acid (GlcUA or IdoUA).DISCUSSIONThe importance of 4-O-sulfation of CS for the adhesive interaction with P. falciparum-IRBCs has been previously demonstrated by comparing the activity of CSA, CSB, and CSC polysaccharides, CSA and CSC oligosaccharide mixtures, and desulfated chondroitin (3Rogerson S.J.

However, because of the heterogeneous composition of CS chains, particularly regarding the sulfate content and sulfation pattern, it remained possible that other structural features could influence the interaction. The present study indicates that the minimum motif of CSA for interaction with IRBCs is a sequence of 12 monosaccharide residues formed by 4-O-sulfated and non-sulfated disaccharide units, that 6-O-sulfation interferes with the interaction, and that the form of the uronic acid residues is important, with GlcUA being required for high inhibitory activity.Initial testing of size-homogenous fractions isolated from CSA digests indicated the presence of inhibitory sequences among the 12-mer and higher oligosaccharide fractions (10Beeson J.G. Chai W. Rogerson S.J. Lawson A.M. Brown G.V. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3397-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation, on the basis of sulfate content, of different-sized oligosaccharide fragments together with determination of sulfate content and sulfation pattern by ES-MS and HPLC disaccharide-composition analysis revealed the importance of non-sulfated disaccharide units for the interaction with IRBCs. Among the subfractions tested for inhibitory activity, clearly 1- and 2-undersulfated oligosaccharides of 12 monosaccharide residues or larger exhibited substantial inhibitory activity. Higher degrees of undersulfation were not detected in oligosaccharide fragments from bovine trachea CSA.The importance of non-sulfated disaccharides in forming a part of the parasite adhesive motif was clearly confirmed by selective removal of 6-O-sulfates to increase the proportion of 0S disaccharide units. This increased the inhibitory activity of CSA polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Inhibition experiments of dodecasaccharide subfractions derived from de-6-O-sulfated CSA further supported the conclusion that a combination of 4-O-sulfated and non-sulfated disaccharide units is important, the most active oligosaccharides being among the one- and two-undersulfated oligosaccharide sequences.Our data show that the minimum chain length required for inhibitory activity is 12 monosaccharide residues, but only when combined with an appropriate sulfate content and sulfation pattern. None of the undersulfated CSA 10-mer subfractions showed any inhibition, confirming the importance of size. Reflecting the significance of size and sulfation, fully sulfated 12-, 14-, and 16-mer fractions derived from bovine trachea CSA were relatively non-inhibitory when compared with their undersulfated equivalents. The inhibition activities of oligosaccharide subfractions increased with increasing chain length when measured using mass concentrations (Fig. 2). If molar concentrations are taken into account, this trend is still apparent and indicates that additional recognition elements are present in extended sequences. CSA polysaccharide has an average molecular mass of 45,500 Da, equivalent to 200 monosaccharide residues in length. It is not surprising that, on a molar basis, the polysaccharide is 13–17 times more active in inhibition than the 12-, 14-, and 16-mer fractions (average molecular masses 2675, 3135, and 3594 Da, respectively, TableI) due to the presence of multiple recognition motifs and possible polyvalent interactions.In an attempt to isolate specific sequences present in the active CSA dodecasaccharide subfraction F6C, sequential SAX- and APS-HPLC was used (13Chai W. Lawson A.M. Gradwell M.J. Kogelberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Due to the highly heterogeneous characteristics of CSA, the HPLC fractions obtained were still mixtures. Despite small differences in composition, the 12-mer HPLC fractions demonstrated significantly different inhibitory activities. From these results it is not possible to determine whether a specific sequence(s) is required for interaction with P. falciparum IRBCs or to establish the recognition epitope(s). An alternative strategy is needed to achieve the separation and preparation of different homogeneous sequences of undersulfated CSA dodecasaccharides.The present studies have demonstrated the relevance of different forms of hexuronic acid residue (GlcUA/IdoUA) in parasite adhesive interactions. Undersulfated CSB 14-mers were isolated and shown to have a slightly higher inhibitory activity than fully sulfated analogues; however, the extent of undersulfation was less than observed with the more active CSA 14-mers. Partial de-4-O-sulfation of CSB and de-6-O-sulfation of CSA polysaccharides was carried out to produce CSB and CSA with a similar proportion of 0S and 4S disaccharide elements. Significantly higher inhibitory activity was shown from partially desulfated CSA. Because the major difference between the partially desulfated CSA and CSB preparations was the sole presence of GlcUA in CSA and IdoUA in CSB, our results strongly point to specific requirement for GlcUA.Our experiments unambiguously demonstrate the importance of non-sulfated disaccharide units and the negative effect of 6-O-sulfates for the interaction between CSA and IRBCs. After removal of the 6-O-sulfates from CSA and CSC polysaccharides and CSA tetradecasaccharide subfractions, the inhibitory activities increased. The removal of 6-O-sulfates from CSA had a modest effect on its activity, probably because CSA is already a potent inhibitor of adhesion. The negative effect of sulfation at the 6-O-position was most clearly demonstrated with the tetradecasaccharide subfraction F7F, which had only modest inhibitory activity and is composed of approximately equal amounts of disaccharide unit 4S and 6S. Removal of 6-O- sulfate increased its inhibitory activity by some 10-fold. Using a different approach and a different immobilized receptor for comparing variously sulfated CS polysaccharides, Alkhalil et al. (24Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F.

This view contrasts with earlier findings suggesting that 4-O-sulfation is required for binding and that 6-O-sulfation of GalNAc interferes with binding (3Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C., Ng, K.

Consistent with our findings, Alkhalil et al. (24Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol.

CS proteoglycans isolated from placental blood and tissue support parasite adhesion in vitro and appear to comprise predominantly non-sulfated and 4-O-sulfated disaccharide units (25Achur R.N.

The proteoglycan thrombomodulin contains CS chains comprised of 4S disaccharides with GlcUA (26Nawa K. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Sato Y. Sugiyama N. Teruuchi T. Iwamoto M. Marumoto Y. Biochem. Biophys.

Undersulfated chondroitin sulfate is also prominent in normal human plasma (28Juvani M. Friman C. Ranta H. Wegelius O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 411: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and may influence parasite sequestration in vivo.In our studies, CSA from bovine trachea was used as the immobilized receptor, and the derived oligosaccharide fragments were used as inhibitors in adherence assays as they contain predominantly GlcUA with little or no IdoUA (data not shown) and can support high levels of parasite adhesion (7Beeson J.G.

Although this CSA is different from that of human placenta, it is highly effective at inhibiting parasite adhesion to placental CS proteoglycans (24Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M.

Chondroitin lyase ABC, used in our studies to generate different sized fragments, resulted in oligosaccharides with modified hexuronic acid ΔUA at the non-reducing terminal. Because oligosaccharides prepared from testicular hyaluronidase digestion of CSA (24Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol.

Caution should be applied in using hyaluronidase, an endo-type glycosidase (30Rodén L. Campbell P. Fraser J.R.E. Laurent T.C. Pertoft H. Thompson J.N. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 60-86PubMed Google Scholar), because its relatively high transglycosylation activity can result in artificial sequences generated by reconstruction of CS chains from the cleaved oligosaccharide fragments (31Saitoh H.

It is clear that dodecasaccharide is the minimum chain length of CSA to effectively interact with P. falciparum IRBCs. The minimum chain length requirement for interaction between HA or HS and P. falciparum IRBCs is also a dodecamer sequence (8Chai W. Beeson J.G. Kogelberg H. Brown G.V. Lawson A.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Barragan A. Fernandez V. Chen Q. von Euler A. Wahlgren M. Spillmann D. Blood. 2000; 95: 3594-3599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Carbohydrate-protein interactions are generally weak and are enhanced by the cooperative effect of multivalent binding sites, which may explain the apparent requirement for longer chain structures of glycosaminoglycans for parasite binding. Alternatively, it may be that longer CS chains are required because important basic amino acid residues for CS binding occur in discontiguous segments of the PfEMP1 protein. The key amino acid residues could be present in either α-helices or β-strands, and the folding of the protein brings together two or more sequences required for binding and activity. Definition of the structural motifs on host-cell chondroitin sulfate involved in the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of placental infection at the molecular level and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to inhibit this adhesion. An important pathological characteristic of red blood cells infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is their ability to adhere to host endothelial cells and accumulate in various organs. During pregnancy, the accumulation of infected red blood cells (IRBCs)1 in the placenta is a key feature of infection and is associated with adverse outcomes and excess perinatal and maternal mortality (1Brabin B.J. Bull. W. H. O. 1983; 61: 1005-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 2McGregor I.A. Wilson M.E. Billewicz W.Z. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

(Oxf.). 2000; 22: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the past few years suggest that sequestration of IRBCs in the placenta is mediated in part by adhesion of parasites to the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present on syncytiotrophoblasts lining the placental blood spaces. Recently we have reported that hyaluronic acid (HA) can also support the adhesion of IRBCs in vitro and appears to be another receptor for parasite sequestration in the placenta (7Beeson J.G. Rogerson S.J. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Chai W.G. Lawson A.M. Molyneux M.E. Brown G.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Chai W. Beeson J.G. Kogelberg H. Brown G.V. Lawson A.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HA is non-sulfated and is the simplest member of the glycosaminoglycan family. Because there are thought to be no other modifications in the carbohydrate chain, the structural requirement of HA for interaction with IRBC can be readily deduced, and the major feature is believed to be a minimum chain length of 12 monosaccharide residues (7Beeson J.G. Rogerson S.J. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Chai W.G. Lawson A.M. Molyneux M.E. Brown G.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Chai W. Beeson J.G. Kogelberg H. Brown G.V. Lawson A.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, understanding the molecular interactions involved between CSA and IRBC is more difficult due to the greater complexity of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains. CS chains comprise repeating disaccharide units of 4-O-substituted hexuronic acid (HexA) β1–3-linked toN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), i.e.4HexAβ1–3GalNAc1. CS chains show heterogeneity in sulfation patterns and hexuronic acid compositions (glucuronic acid (GlcUA)/iduronic acid (IdoUA)) due to different sulfate content and substitution and differing degrees of isomerization of GlcUA to IdoUA. Typically, GalNAc is mono-O-sulfated at either the 4- or the 6-O-position, and this differentiates the principal CSA and CSC disaccharide units, respectively. CSB (or dermatan sulfate) is similar in sulfation to CSA, but the hexuronic acid is predominantly IdoUA. In addition, other variations in sulfation pattern frequently occur, such as GalNAc being non-sulfated or 4,6-di-O-sulfated, and GlcUA can be 2-O-sulfated. Several studies demonstrate the importance of 4-O-sulfation for binding of IRBC (3Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C., Ng, K. Reeder J.C. Brown G.V. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Robert C. Pouvelle B. Meyer P. Muanza K. Fukioka H. Aikawa M. Scherf A. Gysin J. Res.

Parasite adhesion to purified or cell surface CSA can be effectively inhibited by CSA but not by CSB, CSC, heparin, or desulfated chondroitin (3Rogerson S.J. Chaiyaroj S.C., Ng, K. Reeder J.C. Brown G.V. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 9Robert C. Pouvelle B. Meyer P. Muanza K. Fukioka H. Aikawa M. Scherf A. Gysin J. Res.

We previously defined the minimum chain length of CSA required for parasite adhesion to be 12–14 monosaccharide residues and identified that undersulfation was a structural feature of the active CSA, and oversulfation was a feature of the inactive CSC (10Beeson J.G. Chai W. Rogerson S.J. Lawson A.M. Brown G.V. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3397-3402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that non-sulfated disaccharide units may also be important elements of the structural motif required for parasite adhesion in addition to 4-O-sulfate groups of GalNAc. To further define key structural features that influence adhesion of IRBCs, we have isolated and characterized a range of variously sized oligosaccharide fragments from CSA polysaccharides, including fully sulfated components and undersulfated minor components, and tested their ability to competitively inhibit parasite adhesion to CSA. Selective desulfation of oligo- and polysaccharides was performed to directly compare the influence of 6-O-sulfated disaccharide units and non-sulfated units on adhesion, and undersulfated CSB oligo- and polysaccharides were prepared to evaluate the relative importance of the form of hexuronic acid (GlcUA or IdoUA). DISCUSSIONThe importance of 4-O-sulfation of CS for the adhesive interaction with P. falciparum-IRBCs has been previously demonstrated by comparing the activity of CSA, CSB, and CSC polysaccharides, CSA and CSC oligosaccharide mixtures, and desulfated chon"

ATP regulation of KATP channel activity may involve direct binding of this nucleotide to the pore-forming inward rectifier (Kir) subunit despite the lack of known nucleotide-binding motifs. To examine this possibility, we assessed the binding of the fluorescent ATP analogue, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenylcyclo-hexadienylidene)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) to maltose-binding fusion proteins of the NH2- and COOH-terminal cytosolic regions of the three known KATP channels (Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2) as well as to the COOH-terminal region of an ATP-insensitive inward rectifier K+ channel (Kir2.1). We show direct binding of TNP-ATP to the COOH termini of all three known KATP channels but not to the COOH terminus of the ATP-insensitive channel, Kir2.1. TNP-ATP binding was specific for the COOH termini of KATP channels because this nucleotide did not bind to the NH2 termini of Kir1.1 or Kir6.1. The affinities for TNP-ATP binding to KATP COOH termini of Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2 were similar. Binding was abolished by denaturing with 4 m urea or SDS and enhanced by reduction in pH. TNP-ATP to protein stoichiometries were similar for all KATP COOH-terminal proteins with 1 mol of TNP-ATP binding/mole of protein. Competition of TNP-ATP binding to the Kir1.1 COOH terminus by MgATP was complex with both Mg2+ and MgATP effects. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking demonstrated the multimerization potential of these COOH termini, suggesting that these cytosolic segments may directly interact in intact tetrameric channels. Thus, the COOH termini of KATPtetrameric channels contain the nucleotide-binding pockets of these metabolically regulated channels with four potential nucleotide-binding sites/channel tetramer.

Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, SUR subunits are required for ADP-mediated activation of KATP channels (14Trapp S. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because ATP-mediated inhibition of channel activity must be a complex process involving residues that form an ATP-binding pocket and others that may be required for linking ATP binding to channel closure, those mutational studies of channel gating by nucleotides do not provide unequivocal evidence for direct involvement of those residues in ATP binding. In the present study, we assessed the direct binding of fluorescent 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenylcyclo-hexadienylidene) adenosine triphosphate (TNP-ATP) to purified maltose-binding fusion proteins of the cytosolic NH2 and COOH termini of the three known KATP channels and the COOH terminus of a ATP-insensitive inward rectifier K+ channel, Kir2.1 (25Collins A. German M.S. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We provide herein what we believe to be the first evidence of direct binding of ATP to cytosolic domains of the pore-forming subunits of KATP channels and show that the COOH termini, but not the NH2 termini, of Kir subunits of KATP channels bind TNP-ATP. The kinetic analyses of TNP-ATP binding suggest that the COOH termini have a single nucleotide-binding site. Based on glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies, the COOH termini of these three ATP-sensitive channels also exhibit multimerization potential so that they may interact in these intact tetrameric channels. DNAs encoding the NH2 and COOH termini of Kir6.1 (encoding amino acids 1–73 and 178–424 (247 amino acids), respectively) and the COOH terminus of Kir6.2Δ36 (encoding amino acids 169–354 (186 amino acids)) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from rat kidney and brain, respectively. The NH2 and COOH termini of Kir1.1 (encoding amino acids 1–80 and 183–391 in ROMK2 (209 amino acids), respectively) were derived from the previously cloned rat Kir1.1 (26Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,27Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of mouse Kir2.1 encoded amino acids 179–428 (250 amino acids). The sequences of all of the constructs were confirmed using the cycle sequencing method (Keck Facility, Yale). All channel cDNA constructs were ligated into the pMBPT vector kindly provided by Dr. G. A. Altenberg (28Wang C. Castro A.F. Wilkes D.M. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The vector was derived from the MALTM-c2 vector (maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector; New England Biolabs). We constructed MBP fusion proteins containing the NH2 (MBP_1.1N and MBP_6.1N) or the COOH (MBP_1.1C and MBP_6.1C) terminus of rat Kir1.1 and Kir6.1, respectively, and the COOH termini of mouse Kir2.1 (MBP_2.1C) and rat Kir6.2CΔ36 (MBP_6.2CΔ36) channels. We used the MBP_6.2CΔ36 construct for these studies because deletion of the last 36 amino acids from the end of the COOH terminus of Kir6.2 gives rise to functional and ATP-sensitive channel activity in cells in the absence of SUR1 (13Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed using the pMBPT vector as per the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose was inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight culture of Epicurian coli® BL21-CodonPlusTM-RIL-competent cells (Stratagene) expressing the fusion vector and grown to anA 600 of ∼0.5 at 37 °C. Induction was performed with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C for 2.5 h. The cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 20 m at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and frozen overnight at −20 °C. The sample was thawed in ice water and lysed with a probe sonicator (four times for 30 s, with 30-s intervals in an ice water bath. The sample was then centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 m at 4 °C. The supernatant was kept and diluted 1:5 with column buffer. The diluted extract was loaded into a 25-ml column containing 15 ml of amylose resin and washed with 12 column volumes of column buffer. The fusion protein was eluted with column buffer with 10 mm maltose, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. The protein was detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and kept at −80 °C until the experiments were performed. The yields of purified recombinant fusion proteins were 15–25 mg/liter. To assess the binding of ATP to these recombinant fusion proteins, we used fluorescent TNP-ATP (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (29Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which has been widely employed to study nucleotide binding to enzymes and other proteins (31Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11147-11154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of TNP-ATP to recombinant proteins was performed generally as described by Faller (32Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μm recombinant protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-Cl at pH 7.5 or 5 mmMES monohydrate (Sigma) at pH 6.5, and TNP-ATP binding was detected by the increase in fluorescence upon binding to recombinant protein using a SPEX Fluromax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ). The fluorescence units reported here were scaled by 1000. Excitation wavelength (403 nm) and emission wavelength (546 nm) were determined for the Kir1.1 COOH terminus fusion protein and utilized for all recombinant proteins (slit widths, 5 nm) because they did not vary significantly among proteins examined. A typical 10-nm blue shift in emission wavelength was detected upon binding of TNP-ATP to proteins (32Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The temperature was maintained at 22 ± 0.1 °C by a circulating water bath (Neslab, Newington, NH). Incremental additions of TNP-ATP were delivered to polystyrene cuvettes (Elkay Products Inc., Shrewsbury, MA) from stock solutions (0.2–1.0 mm). Total fluorescence was measured 30 s after the additions to allow for equilibration. All of the titrations were corrected for dilution. TNP-ATP fluorescence was also measured in the presence of 5 mm MgATP or by denaturing the protein with 4m urea. MgATP was added from a stock solution of 0.2m adjusted to pH 7.5 or 6.5, as indicated. Free TNP-ATP is weakly fluorescent in buffer, but upon binding to proteins fluorescence is enhanced severalfold with the absolute magnitude dependent on the specific protein environment within the nucleotide-binding pocket (31Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fluorescence enhancement factor (γ), TNP-ATP to protein subunit stoichiometry (N o), and dissociation constant (K d (μm)) were determined by least squares fitting to a modified version of the binding equation derived by Faller (32Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using GraphPad PRISMTM 3.0 software. The observed fluorescence intensity (F obs) in arbitrary units is given by the following equation.Fobs=(Q[TNP­ATP]+Q2[TNP­ATP]2)+Qc2(γ−1)([TNP­ATP]+N0P+Kd)−([TNP­ATP]+N0P+Kd)2−4N0P[TNP­ATP]1/2Equation 1 where P is the protein concentration (μm). Q and Q 2 are constants (fluorescence intensity/μm or μm2 of free TNP-ATP, respectively) derived independently from the concentration dependence of TNP-ATP fluorescence intensity in buffer alone (F Buffer) and account for the “inner filter” effect (32Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar):F Buffer = Q[TNP-ATP] +Q 2[TNP-ATP]2.Q c is the slope of theF Buffer versus [TNP-ATP] curve in buffer alone.dFBufferd[TNP­ATP]=Q+Q2[TNP­ATP]Equation 2 Concentrations of TNP-ATP above 20 μm were not used to minimize inner filter effects. Protein light scatter intensity (F light scatter) was subtracted from allF obs values. The concentration dependence of light scattering of individual recombinant proteins was:F light scatter = RP +R 2 P 2, where Rand R 2 are constants (light intensity/μm and μm2 of protein, respectively). We independently determined the enhanced factor (γ) by measuring the increase in F obs with increasing protein concentration at a fixed concentration of TNP-ATP (5 μm). The F obs data were corrected for light scatter and were fit well by a single exponential.F obsmax was determined as F obs at infinite protein concentration when all TNP-ATP would be bound. The enhancement factor was then calculated as follows.γ=FobsmaxFBufferEquation 3 Using this enhancement factor we calculated the concentrations of free ([F]) and bound ([B]) TNP-ATP as described by Moczydlowski and Fortes (31Moczydlowski E.G.

Bound versus free TNP-ATP plots were analyzed using a standard binding model that follows mass action.[B]=Bmax[F]Kd+[F]Equation 5 where B max is the maximal TNP-ATP binding. The data were also plotted for Scatchard or Hill analyses (36Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17809) Google Scholar) as described (31Moczydlowski E.G.

For noncompetitive binding the Scatchard analysis is linear as described by Moczydlowski and Fortes (31Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol.

For MgATP, NaATP, or MgCl2 competition of TNP-ATP binding, we used a two-site model as described by Faller (39Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6771-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).ΔFobsΔFobsmax=1−Sfrac[ATP][ATP]+K1+(1−Sfrac)[ATP][ATP]+K2Equation 7 where ΔF obs/ΔF obsmaxis the fractional change in fluorescence intensity,S frac is the fraction of binding sites in the first site, and K 1 and K 2are the apparent substrate affinities for the first and second sites, respectively. Photoaffinity labeling of recombinant proteins with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was performed as described previously (40Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lacapere J.-J. Bennett N. Dupont Y. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of the purified protein was added to solution A (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]azido-ATP; ICN Biochemicals, Inc.) and incubated for 15 min in the dark at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was irradiated with UV light at 350 nm for 1 min at room temperature to covalently link the azido-ATP to neighboring amino acid residues. The labeled protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Cross-linking of fusion proteins with glutaraldehyde was performed as described previously (42Lee S.F. Wang C.T. Liang J.Y. Hong S.L. Huang C.C. Chen S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15809-15819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.15 μg of purified MBP fusion proteins (total volume, 40 μl) were incubated with different concentrations (final concentrations, 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1%) of glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline on ice for 30 min. The cross-linking was quenched with the addition of 100 mm glycine, pH 8.0. The proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer with 5% β-ME and resolved by SDS-7.5% PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% milk in a shaker at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with rabbit anti-MBP antibody (1:10,000; New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C on a rocker, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. The proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Inside out patch-clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C) as described (−V p = −40 mV) (43Wang W. Giebisch G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 35-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to assess the effects of TNP-ATP on apical KATP channel activity in rat cortical collecting ducts principal cells. Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats (80–100g) were obtained from Taconic Farms Inc. and kept on normal chow diet (PMI Nutrition International, Inc.) for 7–10 days before experiments. The animals were euthanized, their kidneys were removed, and coronary slices were cut and placed in ice-cold dissection solution. Individual cortical collecting ducts were dissected at room temperature, and the tubules were immobilized on a 5 × 5-mm cover glass coated with Cell Tac (Becton Dickinson) and then transferred to a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (IMT-2; Olympus). The tubules were opened with a sharpened pipette to gain access to the apical membrane. The principal cells were identified by their hexagonal shape and large flat surface. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm MgATP, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. TNP-ATP (0–1000 μm) was added to the bath solution where indicated. MgATP is required in the bath solution to keep the KATP channels in principal cells from running down (43Wang W. Giebisch G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 35-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All of the chemicals were research grade or better and were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. All MBP fusion proteins were efficiently expressed in bacteria and could be highly purified at milligram quantities (5–25 mg/liter of bacterial culture) without exposure to detergents or denaturing agents (28Wang C. Castro A.F. Wilkes D.M. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The recombinant MBP and the NH2-terminal (MBP_1.1N and MBP_6.1N) and COOH-terminal (MBP_1.1C, MBP_6.1C, MBP_6.2CΔ36, and MBP_2.1C) MBP fusion proteins ran at their expected molecular masses as shown in Fig. 1. MBP_6.2CΔ36 consistently produced the lowest yield of 5–10 mg/liter, whereas the yields of MBP_1.1C and MBP_6.1C were 15–25 mg/liter. Cleaving the MBP from the channel protein at the thrombin site resulted in insoluble protein under our current buffer conditions, probably because of the hydrophobicity of these cytosolic NH2 and COOH termini. Thus, all of the experiments were performed using the MBP fusion proteins. We used fluorescent TNP-ATP to assess the binding of ATP to the cytosolic domains of Kir channels (31Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Divita G.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11147-11154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration dependence relationships of TNP-ATP fluorescence with MBP_1.1C, MBP_1.1N, and MBP alone at pH 7.5 are shown in Fig.2. F obs for unbound TNP-ATP in buffer without protein was low and increased in a nonlinear, concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2,A and B), consistent with the intrinsic fluorescence of this ATP analogue and the inner filter effect (29Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,31Moczydlowski E.G. Fortes P.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2346-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the buffer data were well fit using a second order polynomial that accounts for this inner filter effect (see “Materials and Methods”; r 2 ≥ 0.99). In contrast,F obs was significantly enhanced over the buffer control in the presence of MBP_1.1C (Fig. 2, A andB, F P ), consistent with binding of TNP-ATP to this fusion protein. F obs with MBP_1.1C saturated (Fig. 2 B) and was well fit by Equation 1(r 2 = 0.999) using a γ of 7.7 (see Fig. 5) and gave a K d of 2.64 ± 0.26 μm(n = 11). Denaturing MBP_1.1C protein with 4m urea (Fig. 2 A, F P Urea ;n = 15) or 0.1% SDS (Fig. 2 B,F P SDS ; n = 7) diminished the nucleotide concentration-dependent increase inF obs to values close to that of TNP-ATP in the urea or SDS buffers without protein, respectively. The increase inF obs with MBP_1.1C was not due to TNP-ATP interactions with MBP because the TNP-ATP concentration-dependent increase inF obs with MBP (Fig. 2 C,F P ; n = 5) was similar to the TNP-ATP curve in buffer alone (Fig. 2 A, buffer) and was not significantly different in the absence or presence of 5 mmMgATP (Fig 2 C; F P MgATP ) or 4m urea (Fig. 2 C; F P Urea ). The binding of TNP-ATP was specific for the COOH terminus of Kir1.1 because the increase in F obs with MBP_1.1N was small and unaffected by 5 mm MgATP or 4 m urea (Fig. 2 D; n = 10). Mixing of MBP_1.1N and MBP_1.1C (1:1) did not significantly affect the affinity for TNP-ATP binding (control K d = 1.84 ± 0.14, (n = 6); mixing K d = 1.63 ± 0.22; (n = 5); data not shown).Figure 5Enhancement factor (γ), affinity (K d ), and stoichiometry (N) of TNP-ATP binding to MBP_1.1C at pH 7.5.

The 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP labeling was competed with unlabeled MgATP consistent with specific labeling of MBP_1.1C with this nucleotide analogue. We also examined the ability of MgATP to compete the TNP-ATP binding to MBP_1.1C. The TNP-ATP concentration-dependent increase inF obs with MBP_1.1C was reduced by 5 mm MgATP (Fig. 3 B, triangles), and the K d for TNP-ATP binding affinity was significantly increased; K d increased from 3.0 ± 0.2 (F P) to 6.9 ± 1.9 (F P 5 mm MgATP; n= 13). Increasing MgATP concentration to 50 mm virtually abolished TNP-ATP fluorescence enhancement with MBP_1.1C (K d = 50.9 ± 14.7 μm; Fig.3 B; n = 5). We also assessed the competition of TNP-ATP binding to MBP_1.1C by MgATP (Fig. 3 C). Increasing concentrations of MgATP reduced ΔF obs/ΔF obsmaxin a concentration-dependent manner. The shape of the MgATP competition curve was complex, suggesting multiple binding interactions; the data were well fit, however, using the two-site model described by Equation 7 (r 2 = 0.99).K 1 and K 2 were 71 ± 5 and 3.8 ± 0.8 mm,"

In vitro and in vivostudies using nonphosphorylatable and pseudophosphorylated mutants of stathmin have questioned the view that stathmin might act only as a tubulin-sequestering factor. Stathmin was proposed to effectively regulate microtubule dynamic instability by increasing the frequency of catastrophe (the transition from steady growth to rapid depolymerization), without interacting with tubulin. We have used a noninvasive method to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants of the T2S complexes of tubulin with stathmin, pseudophosphorylated (4E)-stathmin, and diphosphostathmin. At both pH 6.8 and pH 7.4, the relative sequestering efficiency of the different stathmin variants depends on the concentration of free tubulin,i.e. on the dynamic state of microtubules. This control is exerted in a narrow range of tubulin concentration due to the highly cooperative binding of tubulin to stathmin. Changes in pH affect the stability of tubulin-stathmin complexes but do not change stathmin function. The 4E-stathmin mutant mimics inactive phosphorylated stathmin at low tubulin concentration and sequesters tubulin almost as efficiently as stathmin at higher tubulin concentration. We propose that stathmin acts solely by sequestering tubulin, without affecting microtubule dynamics, and that the effect of stathmin phosphorylation on microtubule assembly depends on tubulin critical concentration.

Upon entry into mitosis, microtubules disassemble and then reassemble into a highly dynamic mitotic spindle, with minus ends at the poles. Finally, at the end of mitosis, disassembly of the mitotic microtubules is balanced by the formation of the interphase array in the daughter cells (8Zhai Y. Kronebusch P.J. Simon P.M. Borisy G.G. J.

Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2369) Google Scholar), are responsible for monomer-polymer exchange reactions leading to microtubule turnover. Both are driven by the hydrolysis of GTP linked to tubulin assembly. Treadmilling derives from the energetic imbalance between the plus and the minus ends of microtubules and operates when the two ends are free. The steady-state concentration of dimeric GTP-tubulin allows equal net rates of assembly at the plus end and disassembly from the minus end. Dynamic instability concerns microtubules that have either two or only one free end (the plus end, generally), which switches infrequently between a rapidly depolymerizing state and a growing state. The transitions between the two states, called “catastrophe” and “rescue,” describe the stochastic loss and gain of a GTP cap at the end of the microtubule. The steady-state concentration of dimeric GTP-tubulin in this case is determined in part by the frequencies of catastrophe and rescue. Many cellular factors affect the dynamics of monomer-polymer exchange (see Ref. 11Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar for a review). Microtubule-associated proteins slow down microtubule depolymerization in a phosphorylation-controlled fashion (12Kowalski R.J. Williams R.C., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9847-9855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinesins of the KIF family bind to microtubule ends and catalyze depolymerization (13Desai A. Verna S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), whereas end stabilizers like XMAP215 prevent depolymerization (14Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As a result of these activities, the steady-state concentration of dimeric tubulin coexisting with microtubules is regulated. The microtubule-severing factor katanin modulates the fraction of microtubules with one or two free ends (15Mc Nally F.J. Thomas S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1847-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,16Quarmby L.M. Lohret T.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Microtubule dynamics in a living cell depends on the proportion of microtubules with one or two free ends (17Vorobjev I.A. Rodionov V.I. Maly I.V. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2277-2289PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rodionov V. Nadezhdina E. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), hence katanin also affects the steady-state concentration of free GTP-tubulin by changing the relative contributions of treadmilling and dynamic instability. Thus far, it has not been technically possible to evaluate the steady-state concentration of GTP-tubulin in cells with great accuracy. Nonetheless, when the fraction of free minus ends increases,e.g. by detachment of microtubules from centrosomes, the concentration of free GTP-tubulin is expected to increase from a value close to the critical concentration of the plus end to a value closer to the critical concentration of the minus end. This shift has actually been observed (18Rodionov V. Nadezhdina E. Borisy G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), supporting the view that the concentration of GTP-tubulin may vary in vivo. In contrast with regulatory factors that control microtubule assembly dynamics, tubulin-sequestering factors bind tubulin in a nonpolymerizable complex. These proteins establish a pool of unassembled tubulin, built at the expense of the microtubule pool and in equilibrium with free tubulin at its steady-state concentration. The concentration of sequestered tubulin is therefore governed by the dynamic state of microtubules. Op18/stathmin is a 17-kDa protein that has been recently revealed to bind tubulin and destabilize microtubules (19Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and is negatively regulated by phosphorylation by a variety of kinases (20Marklund U.N. Larsson H.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar for review). It is phosphorylated to a low basal level in interphase and becomes hyperphosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (27Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and a polo-like kinase (28Budde P.P. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Heald R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) upon entry into mitosis. Progression through the cell cycle requires phosphorylation of all four serines (Ser-16, -25, -38, and -63). The phosphorylation level is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A phosphatase during mitosis (29Tournebize R. Andersen S.S. Verde F. Dorée M. Karsenti E. Hyman A.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5537-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and dephosphorylation occurs at the end of mitosis (30Mistry S.J. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31209-31215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Stathmin sequesters tubulin in a T2S complex in which it interacts with two αβ-tubulin heterodimers (31Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in a polar αβ-αβ arrangement (see Ref. 11Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar for review; Refs. 32Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recent chemical cross-linking data indicate that the NH2-terminal region of stathmin is at the α end of the αβ-αβ dimer (34Muller D.R. Schindler P. Towbin H. Wirth U. Voshol H. Hoving S. Steinmetz M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Google Scholar). Whether the biological function of stathmin is supported by its tubulin-sequestering activity only or by some additional catastrophe-promoting activity, independent from tubulin binding, is not understood yet (see Ref. 35Walczak C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar for review). Conflicting results have been obtained using pseudophosphorylated mutated stathmin (4E-stathmin) in which all four phosphorylatable serines were replaced by glutamate. The 4E-stathmin showed unaltered tubulin sequestering activity, yet it failed to destabilize microtubules in vivo (36Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J., He, L.F. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J.H. Schubart U.K. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants affected in the coiled-coil domain of stathmin interacted with tubulin like wild-type stathmin but failed to destabilize microtubules in leukemia cells (36Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When injected in living cells, NH2- and COOH-terminal-truncated fragments of stathmin also had different effects on the microtubule lattice, suggesting that different activities of stathmin were carried by different regions of the protein (39Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 40Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, 4E-stathmin, which seems to lack catastrophe-promoting activity and retain unaltered tubulin-sequestering activity, is able to disrupt interphase microtubules but not mitotic microtubules (41Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistently, 4E-stathmin does not prevent normal development of Xenopusembryo (42Küntziger T. Gavet O. Sobel A. Bornens M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22979-22984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Quantitative measurements of tubulin binding to wild-type stathmin and mutated stathmin (4E-stathmin) or phosphorylated stathmin, using plasmon resonance (43Curmi P. Andersen S. Lachkar S. Gavet O.

Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showed that the affinity of stathmin for tubulin was decreased only 3–4-fold by the serine to glutamate mutation and that phosphorylated stathmin had <2-fold lower affinity for tubulin than 4E-stathmin. It was thought (40Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that these modest differences in affinity could not account for the large differences in the effects of the various stathmin variants on microtubules in cells. In contrast with the above-mentioned studies, much larger differences in affinity for tubulin were observed between wild-type, 4E-mutated, and phosphorylated stathmins when their effects on nucleotide exchange on tubulin were measured (44Amayed P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We thought that the discrepancies regarding stathmin function might originate from the lack of a quantitative evaluation of the tubulin-sequestering activity of the different stathmin derivatives. Here we set up a sequestration assay in which the concentration of free GTP-tubulin coexisting with microtubules at steady state is buffered to any desired value using Taxotere. Using this assay, the affinity of tubulin for the different stathmins differs to a greater extent than in previous measurements. Phosphorylation exerts a regulatory effect on stathmin depending on the concentration of free tubulin. We conclude that the simple sequestering activity of stathmin can support its effects on microtubules in vivo. We tentatively propose that the changes in microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle are associated with variations in the concentration of free tubulin that coexists with microtubules. Changes in the concentration of free tubulin in turn modulate the effect of phosphorylation of stathmin on its sequestering activity. Phosphocellulose-purified bovine brain tubulin (44Amayed P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used. The tubulin used in this work had been kept at −80 °C for at most 3 weeks. Older preparations showed a measurable amount of nonpolymerizable material, which increased with aging. Before each experiment, tubulin was recycled by polymerization at 37 °C in M buffer (50 mmMES1-KOH, pH 6.8, 4m glycerol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmGTP, and 6 mm MgCl2). Microtubule pellets were resuspended in M buffer containing 0.5 mm MgCl2on ice and centrifuged at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove aggregates. Tubulin was equilibrated in the desired buffer by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences). Experiments were performed immediately after the above-mentioned recycling procedure to avoid denaturation of tubulin. Before each experiment, it was verified that tubulin polymerized in microtubules that depolymerized at least 95% at 4 °C. Recombinant wild-type stathmin and 4E-stathmin were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (43Curmi P. Andersen S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Stathmin was phosphorylated on serines 16 and 63 by protein kinase A (Sigma) as described previously (44Amayed P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Spontaneous polymerization of tubulin in microtubules was monitored turbidimetrically at 350 nm in a Cary 1 spectrophotometer using a 1-cm path, 120-μl cuvette thermostated at 37 °C. Experiments were carried out in either glycerol-containing M buffer or glycerol-free P buffer (0.1 m PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm GTP, and 6 mmMgCl2) or glycerol-free H buffer (100 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm GTP, and 6 mm MgCl2) in the absence or presence of Taxotere or stathmin as indicated. In preliminary assays, the range of stathmin concentrations was selected to cause at most a 10% decrease in the mass of microtubules (see “Results”). Polymerization was started by the addition of MgCl2 and Taxotere to the tubulin + stathmin solution that was immediately brought into the prewarmed cuvette. The temperature reached 37 °C in less than 15 s. Critical concentration plots were derived from turbidity measurements as described previously (31Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Parallel samples were polymerized identically in centrifuge tubes placed in a water bath at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 15 min at 37 °C in a TL 100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The supernatants were denatured and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis for evaluation of the amount of unassembled tubulin. In the absence of stathmin, the concentration of unassembled tubulin equaled the critical concentration [T]SS. In the presence of stathmin, the concentration of unassembled tubulin was [T]U = [T]SS + 2 [T2S]. A series of tubulin standards in the appropriate range were electrophoresed on the same gel. Gels were stained with either Coomassie Blue or silver (45Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar), depending on the amounts of tubulin present in the supernatants. Gels were scanned and analyzed using NIH Image software. The amounts of nonassembled tubulin in the samples were determined by interpolation using the calibration curve obtained with standards spanning the range of tubulin concentrations found in the samples. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant for the T2S complex was determined as follows at different total concentrations of stathmin [S]0.

At 5 μm tubulin and at concentrations of stathmin as high as 50 μm, the T2S complex was the only complex observed in the analytical ultracentrifuge; no evidence was obtained for an intermediate 1:1 TS complex (31Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 44Amayed P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D.

Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and biochemical studies (40Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 41Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggested that tubulin bound cooperatively to stathmin, i.e. tubulin-tubulin interactions as well as stathmin-tubulin interactions were responsible for the high stability of the T2S complex. The lateral interaction of the two αβ-tubulin molecules with a tandem of two related consecutive α-helices in stathmin (33Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Martin-Barbey C. Charbaut E. Lachkar S. Lebeau L. Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) stabilizes the longitudinal interactions in the αβ-αβ tubulin dimer, under ionic conditions where tubulin exists only in the αβ-tubulin form. The general binding scheme of tubulin to stathmin can therefore be described by an isoenergetic square model (Fig.1) in which the intermediate 1:1 complexes TS and ST interact strongly with a second tubulin molecule, leading to T2S. The TS and ST complexes account for the binding of tubulin to the NH2-terminal or the COOH-terminal α-helix of stathmin, hence they have different structures (Fig.1 a). Whether only one of the two α-helices is sufficient to induce dimerization of tubulin in a T2S complex is not known. Alternatively (Fig. 1 b), stathmin can formerly bind strongly to a poorly represented αβ-αβ tubulin dimer (TT), leading to T2S. The kinetic mechanism of binding of tubulin to stathmin is not known. The TS, ST, and TT species are putative kinetic intermediates that play an important role in the pathway leading to T2S but are not detected at equilibrium because of their low stability (44Amayed P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of tubulin to stathmin is described by an extremely cooperative scheme.2T+S⇔T2SREACTION1The overall equilibrium dissociation constant of the T2S complex is as follows:KD=[T]2×[S]/[T2S]Equation 4 where [T] and [S] are the concentrations of free tubulin and stathmin, and [T2S] is the concentration of the tubulin-stathmin complex. Irrespective of the pathway leading to T2S, K D has the dimension of a square concentration, expressed in m2. A physically significant parameter is the concentration of free tubulin at which half of total stathmin is in complex with tubulin at equilibrium ([S] = [T2S]), called [T]12. Eq. 4 shows that [T]12 = KD 12. Because of the strong cooperativity in stathmin-tubulin interactions, the ratio of the free tubulin concentrations at which 90% and 10% of stathmin is in complex with tubulin ([T]90%/[T]10%) equals 9, whereas it would have a value of 81 if binding was noncooperative. In a solution of microtubules at steady state, the concentration of free tubulin is maintained at a steady-state value [T]SS (often called critical concentration) that depends on the dynamics of microtubules under these solution conditions. When stathmin is added to microtubules at steady state, it binds to tubulin, and because the resulting T2S complex is nonpolymerizable, microtubules depolymerize to maintain the concentration of free tubulin equal to [T]SS. The T2S complex is formed at the expense of the microtubule pool, without affecting the value of [T]SS. Depolymerization stops, and steady state is again established when both the remaining microtubules and T2S complex coexist with free tubulin at the unchanged concentration [T]SS. The amount of T2S complex at steady state is determined by the values of K D and [T]SS as follows. [T2S]=[S]0×[T]SS2/(KD+[T]SS2)Equation 5 The total concentration of stathmin is [S]0 = [S] + [T2S]. Note that if stathmin is added at a concentration high enough to cause complete depolymerization of microtubules, the concentration of free tubulin is no longer buffered by microtubules, hence Eq. 5 is no longer valid. The relevant description then is the binding and saturation of tubulin by stathmin, and a cubic equation describes the dependence of [T2S] on the concentrations of total tubulin and total stathmin. According to Eq. 5, the value of K D can easily be derived from measurements of the amount of sequestered tubulin upon addition of stathmin to a solution of microtubules at steady state (see “Materials and Methods”). In fact, in the conventional polymerization buffers used for microtrubule assembly in vitro, all the added stathmin or 4E-stathmin or diphosphostathmin was found in complex with tubulin (data not shown), in agreement with previous reports (31Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the value of [T]SS2 is much higher than the value of K D for all stathmin derivatives, in either glycerol-containing M buffer ([T]SS = 2.5 μm) or glycerol-free P buffer ([T]SS = 15 μm), therefore [T2S] = [S]0in Eq. 5. Differences in the value ofK D for the different stathmin variants would be revealed if the value of [T]SS could be lowered to a value closer to KD12. Taxotere can fulfill this function because this microtubule-stabilizing drug binds specifically to microtubules with an affinity of 2 × 107m−1 at 37 °C (46Diaz J.F. Strobe R. Engelborghs Y. Souto A.A. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26265-26276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and lowers the critical concentration. To obtain the value of K D for the different stathmin variants, the dependence of [T]SS on Taxotere concentration was established. Experiments were done in glycerol-free P buffer, in which the critical concentration can be varied from 15 μm in the absence of Taxotere to <0.25 μmat high Taxotere concentrations. Tubulin was polymerized at 40 and 15 μm in P buffer in the presence of different concentrations of Taxotere, [X]0. The relationship between the concentration of tubulin in the supernatants of sedimented microtubules, [T]SS, and the concentration of free Taxotere, [X], was established as follows. The concentration of assembled tubulin ([MT]0) was derived from the difference between the total ([T]0) and free ([T]SS) tubulin concentrations. The concentrations of microtubule-bound Taxotere [MTX] and free Taxotere [X] were calculated as follows:[MT]0=[MT]+[MTX]Equation 6 KX=[MT]×[X]/[MTX]Equation 7 [MTX]=1/2{[X]0+[MT]0Equation 8 +KX±(([X]0+[MT]0+KX)2−4[MT]0×[X]0)½}[X]=[X]0−[MTX]Equation 9 where K X represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for Taxotere binding to tubulin in microtubules. The value of [T]SS decreased with free Taxotere (Fig.2). The curves representing [T]SS versus [X] obtained at the two concentrations of tubulin tested (○ and ●) were superimposable, as expected for the dependence of an equilibrium constant on free ligand concentration, which should be independent of the total concentration of tubulin. The fact that the curves obtained at 40 and 15 μm tubulin are superimposable, within an experimental error of"
https://openalex.org/W2007180853,"The transcription factor hGABP/E4TF1 is a heterotet- rameric complex composed of two DNA-binding sub- units (hGABP/E4TF1- 60) and two transactivating sub- units (hGABP/E4TF1-53). In order to understand the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by hGABP, we searched for proteins that interact with the non-DNA-binding subunit, hGABP, using yeast two-hy- brid screening. We identified a human cDNA encoding a protein related to YAF-2 (YY1-associated factor 2), which was previously isolated as an interacting partner of the Ying-Yang-1 (YY1) transcription factor. Reflecting this similarity, both YAF-2 and this novel protein (named YEAF1 for YY1- and E4TF1/hGABP-associated factor-1) interacted with hGABP and YY1 in vitro and in vivo, indicating that YEAF1 and YAF-2 constitute a cofactor family for these two structurally distinct tran- scription factors. By using yeast three-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that hGABP and YY1 formed a complex only in the presence of YEAF1, indicating that YEAF1 is a bridging factor of these two transcription factors. These cofactors are functionally different in that YAF-2 positively regulates the transcriptional activity of hGABP but YEAF1 negatively regulates this activity. Also, YAF-2 mRNA is highly expressed in skeletal mus- cle, whereas YEAF1 mRNA is highly expressed in pla- centa. We speculate that the transcriptional activity of hGABP is in part regulated by the expression levels of these tissue-specific cofactors. These results provide a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by func- tionally distinct cofactor family members."

After force application (480 piconewton/cell), SMA protein and mRNA were increased but β-actin was unchanged. Beads coated with bovine serum albumin or poly-l-lysine produced no change of SMA. In cells transiently transfected with plasmids containing the SMA promoter fused to β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein coding sequences, SMA promoter activity was increased by ∼60% after 4 h of force, whereas control (Rous sarcoma virus) promoter activity was unaffected. Transfections with β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein reporter constructs showed that force-loaded cells exhibited higher β-galactosidase activity than cells without force. Cytochalasin D and latrunculin B inhibited force–induced increases of SMA promoter activity. Deletion analyses showed that SMA promoter activity was increased ∼70% after force with a minimal construct containing 155 bp upstream of the translation start site. The force effect on the SMA promoter was abrogated in cells transfected with CArG-B box mutants. Gel mobility shift analyses of nuclear extracts showed strong binding to the CArG-B motif after force. We conclude that the CArG-B box is a force-responsive element in the SMA promoter.

Res. 2001; 19: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)1 is associated with increased generation of contractile forces. Currently, the mechanisms by which applied forces regulate SMA expression are undefined. As SMA is an important example of a contractile force protein in non-muscle cells that is important in remodeling of extracellular matrices, a detailed definition of the force-sensitive, promoter-regulatory elements is important for a comprehensive understanding of how physical signals regulate cytoskeletal gene expression. The regulation of SMA gene expression involves a complex interaction of multiple positive and negative cis elements that act in a cell type-specific fashion (4Mack C.P. Thompson M.M. Lawrenz-Smith S. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Studies of the chicken, mouse, rat, and human SMA genes have demonstrated the importance of cell context in the characterization of promoter elements that function in transcriptional regulation (5Carroll S.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 984-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SMA promoter contains a number of highly conserved regulatory elements. Some of the important elements include CArG boxes, which have the general sequence motif CC(A/T)6GG (9Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The SMA promoter contains three CArG elements, designated CArG A (at −62), CArG B (at −112), and an intronic CArG (at +1001). These elements are completely conserved in all species in which the promoter has been examined and are required for generation of full promoter activity in cultured smooth muscle cells (9Shimizu R.T.

Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The CArG box was first described as the core sequence of the serum response element (SRE) in early response genes such as c-fos (11Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). CArG elements can direct developmental and tissue-specific expression of many muscle-specific genes (12Gustafson T.A.

Heart J. 2000; 41: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a process that could involve conserved CArG elements (8Blank R.S. McQuinn T.C. Yin K.C. Thompson M.M. Takeyasu K. Schwartz R.J. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 984-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or other upstream domains. However, presently, these processes are not defined. The CArG box-binding factor regulates the expression of SMA by binding to the CArG box, which overlaps an ETS1 binding site in the SRE of the SMA promoter (21Kamada S. Miwa T. Gene. 1992; 119: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the force-induced activation of the SRE in the SMA promoter in connective tissue cells such as osteoblasts may be different from the mechanisms involved in c-Fos activation and may also be cell type-specific. Notably, applied mechanical force can regulate SMA gene expression by the p38 kinase pathway in cardiac fibroblasts (22Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process that in turn may regulate the binding of the serum response factor (SRF) to two critical CArG boxes in the SMA promoter (23Garat C. Van Putten V. Refaat Z.A. Dessev C. Han S.Y. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22537-22543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cognizant of this background we have examined the responsiveness of the SMA promoter to applied forces in an in vitro model system (24Lew A.M Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Fan J. Ganss B. Ellen R.P McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31969-31977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As SMA is expressed in osteoblasts during contractile force generation (2Menard C. Mitchell S. Spector M. Biomaterials. 2000; 18: 1867-1877Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we used ROS17/2.8 cells, a rat osteoblastic cell line that exhibits phenotypic characteristics of differentiated osteoblasts. The data show that the SMA promoter is regulated by force-responsive elements associated with the CArG-B box. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to SMA (clone no. 1A4), β-actin (clone no. AC-15), collagenase (C5138), rhodamine phalloidin, BSA, fibronectin, and poly-l-lysine were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse IgG2a and goat anti-mouse IgG1 were purchased from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). Collagen was obtained from Celltrix (Palo Alto, CA). Rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8; hereafter ROS cells) were incubated in complete α-MEM medium at 37 °C. The medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:10 dilution of an antibiotic solution (0.17% w/v penicillin V, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, and 0.01 μg/ml amphotericin; Sigma). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 and were passaged with 0.01% trypsin (Invitrogen). As described earlier (26Wang J. Lukse E. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Tiss. Cell. Res. 2001; 33: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Glogauer M. Ferrier J. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 435: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), 0.4 g of magnetite beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated for 1 h with 1 ml of an acidic bovine collagen solution (>95% type I collagen) at 37 °C and neutralized to pH 7.4 with 100 μl of 1 nNaOH. Under these conditions collagen polymerizes and forms fibrils around the beads within 30 min. The beads were sonicated to eliminate clumps. BSA or poly-l-lysine beads were prepared in a similar fashion by incubating beads in solutions of 1 mg/ml BSA or 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and then dispersed. Analysis of bead size was performed by electronic particle counting (Coulter Channelyzer, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Particles tended to exhibit a heterogeneous size distribution with a pronounced modal peak at 5 μm, although there were many particles with smaller diameters. Beads were rinsed in PBS, washed three times, and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. A ceramic permanent magnet (grade 8, 2.2 × 9.6 × 11 cm; Jobmaster, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was used to generate perpendicular, tensile forces on beads attached to the dorsal surface of cells. For all experiments the pole face was parallel with and 2 cm from the cell culture dish surface. At this distance the force on a single osteoblast with ∼750 μm2 area of dorsal bead coverage was 480 piconewton/cell or 0.64 piconewton/μm2. As the surface area of the magnet was larger than the culture dishes, and as bead covering was relatively uniform for all cells, the forces applied to cells across the width of the culture dish were relatively uniform (27Glogauer M. Ferrier J. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 435: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A constant force of varying duration was used for all experiments. Before incubating cells, beads were rinsed in PBS, washed three times, resuspended in calcium-free buffer and added to attached cells in full medium for 10 min. Cells were washed three times to remove unbound beads and exposed to force in PBS (pH 7.4) containing calcium and magnesium ions. We assessed SMA content in cells that were fixed, immunostained for SMA, and counterstained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells were examined in an epifluorescence microscope and photographed. For immunoblotting, bead-associated proteins or cell lysates prepared from cell cultures (60-mm dishes) that had been subjected to an applied force for discrete time intervals were analyzed. Cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed with 200 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue), and transferred to a Microfuge tube. The samples were kept on ice and boiled for 5 min. Protein concentration was assessed by the BioRad assay, and equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. Isolated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. SMA and β-actin were identified by immunoblotting. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in Tween-TBS and incubated with the indicated antibody (diluted 1:1000 in 0.5% Tween-TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with buffer for 10 min, incubated with appropriate second antibodies for 1 h, washed 4× in Tween-TBS, and developed by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). X-OMAT Kodak films were exposed to the blots, and the density of the bands was analysis by IP Lab Gel Scientific Image Processing (Signal Analytics Corporation, Vienna, VA). Total RNA was isolated from cells with the Qiagen RNAeasy total RNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified by spectrophotometry (Ultrospec 3000;Amersham Biosciences). RNA samples (10 μg) were separated in 1.2% denaturing agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde in MOPS running buffer, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran; Schleicher & Schuell), cross-linked by UV, and hybridized with32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. These probes were designed from portions of the sequences of the rat α-SMA mRNA 5′-untranslated region: (5′-GAAAAGAACTGAAGGCGCTGATCCACAAAACATTCACAGTTG-3′) and from the rat β-actin mRNA 3′-untranslated region (5′-CGCCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTTTTAAATCCTTGAGTCAAAAGCGCCA-3′). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Biotechnology Service Centre (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario). Probes were labeled with [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 3′ end labeling. The blots were washed 4× with 0.5% SSC + 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 10 min and twice for 40 min at 50 °C and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT films at −70 °C. ROS cells were grown and maintained in complete α-modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to transfection, ROS17/2.8 cells were plated at 1 × 104cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated in complete α-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids containing p547/LacZ constructs obtained from Dr. G. Owens in which the whole promoter is present. Cells were co-transfected with a Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) expression plasmid to normalize for equal loading using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the supplier's instructions (Invitrogen). Following transfection (20 h), collagen beads were incubated with cells and washed, and force was applied for 4 h. Cell extracts were prepared after force application with a detergent lysis method. β-galactosidase reporter enzyme activity was measured with an enzyme assay system (Roche). β-galactosidase activities were normalized to RSV luciferase activity as a transfection control. The RSV (−124 to +34)/luciferase construct was provided by H. P. Elsholtz (University of Toronto) and was used as described earlier (24Lew A.M Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RSV luciferase assays were conducted using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RSV luciferase activity (reflecting promoter activity) was unaffected by all treatments at all experimental time periods. The p547/ β-galactosidase construct obtained from Dr. G. Owens comprises the promoter region of the SMA gene fused to β-galactosidase coding sequences. Constructs P371, P155, P92, and P56 were made by PCR amplification using P547 as the template and the following specific PCR primers: P371 = 5′-NNCCCAAGCTTTTAGCTAATGGACC-3′, P155 = 5′-NNCCCAAGCTTTGGCCACCCAGATT-3′, P92 = 5′-NNCCCAAGCTTCAGCTTCAGCCTGT-3′, P56 = 5′-NNCCCAAGCTTGAGTGGGAGGGGATCAGACCAG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-GGGGTACCCCTGATGGCGACTG-3′. Inserts of interest in the rat SMA promoter were excised with HindIII and KpnI, and the inserts were religated into the pUC19/AUG β-galactosidase vector. The CArG-B mutation in the rat SMA promoter (CCCTATATCA; mutations underlined) was constructed by PCR amplification using the p2600Int/Laz CArG-B mutation SMA promoter obtained from Dr. Owens as a template (10Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A SMA “core promoter” construct (p155GFP) was made using the proximal 155 bp of the SMA promoter, which was inserted into the promoterless pEGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH) directly proximal to the EGFP reporter gene. P155EGFP promoter constructs were synthesized by digesting the p547 plasmid withHindIII and KpnI for 4 h at 37 °C. The resultant promoter-containing restriction fragments were purified and ligated into the HindIII/KpnI-digested pEGFP-1 vector. The ligated product was transformed into competent DH5-α′ cells (Stratagene), and individual colonies were cultured overnight in 5 ml of LB + kanamycin (30 μg/μl). Plasmid DNA was isolated from these cultures (Qiagen), and the correct orientation of the insert was verified through diagnostic restriction digests withHindIII and KpnI. Subsequently, the authenticity of the inserts was established by sequencing (Centre of Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a modified Digman's method (28Ausubel F.M Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 12.1.1-12.1.7Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for EMSAs were synthesized and purified commercially (Invitrogen). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides (with only the sense strands shown) were used as probes: CArG-A, 5′-TTGCTCCTTGTTGGGGAAGC-3′, CArG-B, 5′-GAGGTCCCTATAGGTTTGTG-3′, and CArG-B mutation, 5′-GAGGTCCCTATATCATTGTG-3′. EMSA probes were generated by end labeling single-stranded oligonucleotides (20 μm) with 150 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mm; Mandel) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and purified from unincorporated nucleotides using ProbeQuant TM G-50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences). EMSAs were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 1× binding buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmol/liter KCl, 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, and 5% glycerol) and performed in a binding reaction (20 μl) containing ∼50 pg (50,000 cpm) of labeled probe, 10 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.25 μg of poly(dA-dT) in 1× binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V in 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. Serum response factor protein was producedin vitro using the Promega rabbit reticulocyte system. To monitor the efficiency of transfection after force application, we usedin situ staining for β-galactosidase. After transfection and force application, cells were washed with PBS (containing calcium and magnesium), fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, and washed with PBS. Cells were stained (5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mmpotassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal)), and plates were incubated overnight at room temperature prior to rinsing and observation in an inverted microscope. For all assays, three or more separate experiments were performed. Means ± S.E. were calculated for continuous variables, and when appropriate, comparisons between two groups were analyzed by unpaired t-tests. To determine whether force regulates SMA expression in osteoblastic cells in vitro, we used collagen-coated magnetite beads and permanent magnets to deliver precisely regulated tensile forces to the actin cytoskeleton through integrins (27Glogauer M. Ferrier J. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 435: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ROS cells are well differentiated osteoblastic cells that we have used to study regulation of smooth muscle actin promoter function by mechanical forces in vitro. Immunohistochemistry of ROS cells showed positive staining for vimentin (Fig.1 A), an intermediate filament protein that is a hallmark of connective tissue cells. Conversely, cells were not stained for desmin (Fig. 1, B andC), an intermediate filament protein marker that is expressed by smooth muscle cells. ROS cells showed very weak staining for SMA prior to force application (Fig. 1 D). After only 4 h of force application, cells exhibited increased SMA staining intensity that was notably less than cardiac myofibroblasts (Fig. 1,E and F), cells which strongly express SMAin vitro (22Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether ROS cells, following incubation with collagen, BSA, or poly-l-lysine-coated beads, would exhibit variations of SMA protein content after force application. After tensile force application for 4 h, immunoblotting of whole cell lysates showed that forces applied through collagen-coated beads increased SMA content but did not affect β-actin content (Fig.2 A). In contrast, cultured cardiac fibroblasts, which express very high basal levels of SMA, showed reduced SMA after force application (Fig. 2 B), an effect that has been observed previously (22Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The force-induced increase of SMA in ROS cells was apparently mediated through integrins because cells incubated with either BSA or poly-l-lysine beads showed no increase of SMA content after force application (Fig.2, C and D). The increase of SMA protein content by applied force suggested that force might affect selectively SMA mRNA content. Northern blotting of SMA and β-actin mRNA content showed that compared with cardiac fibroblasts, which express very high basal levels of SMA mRNA in culture (22Wang J. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2776-H2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Lukse E. Seth A. McCulloch C.A. Tiss. Cell. Res. 2001; 33: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the basal SMA mRNA content of ROS cells was virtually undetectable (Fig. 2 E). After only 4 h of force application, although β-actin mRNA content was unchanged, the ratio of SMA to β-actin mRNA was increased 6-fold (p < 0.05; n = 3; Fig. 2 F). Thus ROS osteoblastic cells provide a convenient, rapidly responsive model for studying how SMA gene expression is regulated by mechanical forces in vitro. To determine whether force regulates SMA promoter activity, we transfected ROS cells with β-galactosidase SMA reporter constructs (P547/LacZ) in which the whole SMA promoter (9Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was present. As an internal transfection control, ROS cells were co-transfected with a pEGFP-1 vector containing an SV40 promoter that constitutively drives expression of the EGFP reporter gene (Fig. 3). To directly examine SMA promoter function in response to force application, transfected ROS cells were stained for β-galactosidase in situ. Cells transfected with a promoter-less construct (Fig.3 A) or transfected with the SMA construct but without force showed minimal staining (Fig. 3 B); but after force application cells with bound beads exhibited much more intense staining than cells without force (Fig. 3 C). Fluorescence attributable to EGFP driven by an SV-40 promoter in parallel cultures of co-transfected cells was unaffected by force application (Fig. 3,D–F). This experiment indicated that in combination with force applied through collagen-coated beads, ROS cells provide a sensitive and specific model for studying SMA promoter regulation by mechanical forces in vitro. As a first step in determining the contributions of specific promoter regions to transcriptional regulation by force, cells were transfected with constructs containing specific domains of the SMA promoter (P547, P371, P208, P155, P92, and P56; Fig. 4 A). These constructs were designed to include known regulatory domains of the SMA promoter including the TATA, CArG-A, CArG-B, GArC (GGAAGAGACC), and E boxes (9Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The SMA constructs were made by PCR amplification using P547/β-galactosidase (9Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as the template and PCR primers that facilitated excision of the appropriate segment in the rat SMA promoter. The inserts were ligated into the pUC19/AUG β-galactosidase vector. Cells were co-transfected with the RSV-luciferase construct as a loading control. Transfection efficiencies for all experiments were 40–50%. The β-galactosidase activity normalized to RSV luciferase activity (Fig. 4 B) gave an estimate of promoter activity that compensated for variations of transfection efficiency. In cells transfected with P547, P371, and P155 constructs, the adjusted β-galactosidase activity was increased by ∼60% after force application compared with no force application (p < 0.05). In contrast, cells transfected with the P92 and P56 constructs showed no significant change of β-galactosidase activity after force. As SMA promoter activity was increased maximally with the P155 construct and not at all with the P92 or P56 constructs, it appeared likely that the CArG-B box (but not the CArG-A box) is an important force-responsive element in the SMA promoter. The 122-bp core promoter of the chicken SMA gene in myoblasts and fibroblasts has been identified previously (5Carroll S.L. Bergsma D.J. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As the increased promoter activity of the P155 construct after force application was equivalent to that of longer promoter constructs, we considered that the 122-bp core promoter contained within the P155 construct was important for the SMA response to force. We also considered that the P155 construct would provide a useful reagent for examining potential cellular factors that regulate force-induced SMA promoter activity. Accordingly, the first 155 bp of the SMA promoter was cloned into the promoterless pEGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH) proximal to the EGFP reporter gene. After cells were transfected with this construct, the number of fluorescent cells and the total number of cells in microscopic fields were counted (×25 objective), and the proportion of EGFP to total cell counts was computed in each field. A total of 1674 cells were counted in 50 fields. Analogous to the data shown above for the P155 β-galactosidase construct, the proportion of EGFP-expressing cells was increased 1.8-fold after force treatment compared with the proportion of fluorescent cells without force (Fig.5). Parallel cultures that were transfected with the pEGFP construct under the control of the SV40 promoter showed no change of the proportion of EGFP fluorescent cells after force application. As previous studies have indicated that actin filaments are essential for mechanotranscriptional coupling of cytoskeletal genes including filamin A (25D'Addario M. Arora P.D. Fan J. Ganss B.

Cells were loaded with beads and treated with cytochalasin D (0.5 μm) or latrunculin B (1 μm) to depolymerize actin filaments. Cells were then subjected to force (or not), and the proportion of EGFP fluorescent cells was computed. Although the proportion of untreated (baseline) EGFP fluorescent cells was lower than untreated cells and was different between the two experiments in which latrunculin or cytochalasin were used, both agents abrogated the force–i"

Checkpoints involve slowing or arresting the cell cycle until the damage is repaired, the transcriptional induction of repair enzymes, and the direct activation of repair processes (1Zhou B.B.

Genetics. 1999; 152: 909-919PubMed Google Scholar). The Dun1 kinase is activated through phosphorylation by checkpoint signals in a MEC1- andRAD53-dependent manner (15Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and its positive effect on transcription involves the phosphorylation and inactivation of the Crt1 transcriptional repressor (16Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cell cycle arrest function of the S phase checkpoint that isRAD53-dependent and largelyDUN1-independent (12Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), DUN1 seems to play a much more crucial role than RAD53 in preventing gross chromosomal rearrangements (particularly de novo telomere additions to chromosome breakpoints) after spontaneous DNA replication errors during normal cell cycles, indicating that it has a specific function in regulating postreplicative DNA repair pathways (13Myung K. Datta A. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).In addition to the transcriptional control of gene expression, posttranscriptional mRNA modifications and mRNA decay pathways play crucial roles in the eukaryotic regulation of protein levels (17Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A major posttranscriptional modification is the addition of the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of pre-mRNAs that contributes to the regulation of protein translation (18Otero L.J. Ashe M.P. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Fortes P. Inada T. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Mattaj I.W. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and mRNA stability (17Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, mRNA degradation is usually initiated by the 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic digest of the poly(A) tail by a cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase containing the Ccr4 and Caf1 proteins (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In addition to Ccr4-Caf1, poly(A) tail length distribution is also regulated by the poly(A)-nuclease (PAN) complex, which consists of the catalytic 135-kDa Pan2 subunit with sequence motifs characteristic of RNase D-like 3′ → 5′ exonucleases (21Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and the 72-kDa Pan3 subunit of unknown function. The primary function of PAN seems to be to “preset” poly(A) tails to message-specific lengths before or during the nucleocytoplasmic export of mRNAs (22Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but it also contributes to cytoplasmic mRNA turnover as an alternative or complementing pathway to Ccr4-Caf1 (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar).Here we report that Dun1 cooperates with PAN in the regulation ofRAD5 mRNA levels and cell survival in response to replicational stress. The data suggest that posttranscriptional mechanisms contribute to the regulation of gene expression by checkpoint signaling pathways.DISCUSSIONDUN1 plays a crucial role in preventing gross chromosomal rearrangements resulting from inappropriate repair pathways of spontaneous replicative DNA damage even in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging or replication-blocking agents (13Myung K. Datta A. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that the regulation of RAD5 mRNA levels by Dun1 in concert with PAN contributes to the function ofDUN1 in maintaining genome stability.dun1Δpan2Δ cells remain in S phase for considerable time (Fig. 3 B), activate Rad53 as a key player in the intra-S checkpoint normally (Fig. 3 C), and die after replication blocks with considerably delayed kinetics compared withrad53Δ cells (Fig. 2 B). At the same time, expression of the RAD5 gene, which plays a role in postreplicative DNA repair (35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), is specifically deregulated (Fig. 4) and sufficient to cause HU-dependent lethality in thedun1Δ background (Fig. 5), while the accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA contents in flow cytometry profiles (Fig.3 B) coincides temporally with the reduced viability in survival curves (Fig. 2 B). The most likely explanation for the dun1Δpan2Δ phenotype is, therefore, that these cells arrest normally in S phase while replicative DNA damage persists but that this damage is inappropriately repaired, which removes the checkpoint signal, allowing for subsequent cell division with loss of genetic material and concomitantly increased lethality.Interestingly, DUN1 has recently been indirectly linked to regulation of the RAD6 epistasis group of whichRAD5 is a member (38Datta A. Schmeits J.L. Amin N.S. Lau P.J. Myung K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rad5 is a RING finger domain protein that mediates the interaction of the Lys-63-specific ubiquitin ligases Ubc13 and Mms2 with Rad18 and the Lys-48-specific ubiquitin ligase Rad6 (35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This heteromeric complex has been proposed to generate a signal that activates pathways for the repair of DNA double strand breaks by homologous recombination (i.e. “error-free”) instead of non-homologous end joining (i.e. “error-prone”) (34Xiao W. Chow B.L. Broomfield S. Hanna M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 36Brusky J. Zhu Y. Xiao W. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The same surfaces involved in the heteromeric interaction of Rad5 and Rad18 can also mediate homodimerization of the respective subunits and thereby dissociate the pentamer into Rad5-Ubc13-Mms2 and Rad6-Rad18 subcomplexes, which may generate a Rad6-dependent signal to activate an error-prone subpathway (35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). According to this model, increased Rad5 protein levels in thedun1Δpan2Δ strain could indeed shift the equilibrium away from the heteromeric complex toward an error-prone postreplicative DNA repair pathway that causes the increased lethality (Fig. 6). This pathway seems to be particularly critical in the absence of DUN1 asRAD5 overexpression alone had only a subtle effect on replicational stress survival of wild type or pan2Δ strains (Fig. 5). This is conceivable given that DUN1 has several additional DNA damage repair functions, e.g.transcriptional induction of repair enzymes (16Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and direct regulation of repair proteins such as Rad55 (39Bashkirov V.I. King J.S. Bashkirova E.V. Schmuckli-Maurer J. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4393-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which may renderdun1Δ mutants more sensitive to deleterious effects of either pan2/3 deletion or RAD5overexpression.As synthetic lethality is usually a property of genes whose products interact in a common biochemical pathway (31Hartman J.L.I. Garvik B. Hartwell L. Science. 2001; 291: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), the simplest interpretation of our data is that Dun1 and PAN interact at the posttranscriptional level to regulate RAD5 gene expression. While the two-hybrid data indicate that Dun1 interacts directly with Pan3, a key question remaining to be answered is whether PAN activity is regulated by Dun1 in response to replication blocks. Given the synthetic effect of the two genes, it is quite possible that Dun1 does not directly regulate PAN but another enzyme with a similar function,e.g. Ccr4-Caf1. In this scenario (Fig. 6), PAN would constitutively regulate RAD5 mRNA levels, whereas Ccr4-Caf1 would be strictly Dun1-dependent and therefore compensate for the loss of PAN as long as DUN1 is present. Ccr4-Caf1 has multiple functions as an mRNA deadenylase (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and as part of the CCR4-NOT complex in control of transcriptional initiation and elongation (40Denis C.L. Chiang Y.-C. Cui Y. Chen J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 627-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tucker et al. (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) have suggested that one possible explanation for linking the cytoplasmic Ccr4-Caf1 deadenylase to the transcriptional machinery is that it needs to be cotranscriptionally loaded onto messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes. If this is so, it would transiently be in a complex with PAN during the initial trimming of the poly(A) tail. In this context, Pan3 binding by the Dun1 FHA domain could act as a transient scaffold to bring the kinase domain in contact with Ccr4-Caf1 to phosphorylate it and regulate its substrate specificity before export to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, Caf1 (also known as Pop2) has recently been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation in response to diauxic shifts by the Yak1 kinase, but it is unclear whether this affects its deadenylase function (41Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An important goal of future studies will be to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism by which Dun1 contributes to the regulation of RAD5 mRNA stability.Transcriptional control of gene expression (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar) and cotranscriptional regulation of mRNA 3′-end processing and polyadenylation reactions (42Kleimann F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) are established components of cell cycle checkpoints. Our results indicate that posttranscriptional mechanisms involving poly(A) tail length control are an additional checkpoint target in the regulation of gene expression. The Pan2-Pan3 and Ccr4-Caf1 poly(A)-exonucleases, the Dun1 kinase, and members of the RAD6 epistasis group have reasonably conserved orthologs in mammals (2Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R.

Therefore, the checkpoint-dependent regulation of posttranscriptional control pathways may be not be restricted to yeast but may also contribute to the prevention of chromosome aberrations in mammalian cells. Eukaryotic cells contain highly conserved checkpoint signaling pathways that prevent genomic instability by regulating the cellular response to DNA damage and replication blocks. Checkpoints involve slowing or arresting the cell cycle until the damage is repaired, the transcriptional induction of repair enzymes, and the direct activation of repair processes (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), is specifically deregulated (Fig. 4) and sufficient to cause HU-dependent lethality in thedun1Δ background (Fig. 5), while the accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA contents in flow cytometry profiles (Fig.3 B) coincides temporally with the reduced viability in survival curves (Fig. 2 B). The most likely explanation for the dun1Δpan2Δ phenotype is, therefore, that these cells arrest normally in S phase while replicative DNA damage persists but that this damage is inappropriately repaired, which removes the checkpoint signal, allowing for subsequent cell division with loss of genetic material and concomitantly increased lethality.Interestingly, DUN1 has recently been indirectly linked to regulation of the RAD6 epistasis group of whichRAD5 is a member (38Datta A. Schmeits J.L. Amin N.S. Lau P.J. Myung K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rad5 is a RING finger domain protein that mediates the interaction of the Lys-63-specific ubiquitin ligases Ubc13 and Mms2 with Rad18 and the Lys-48-specific ubiquitin ligase Rad6 (35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This heteromeric complex has been proposed to generate a signal that activates pathways for the repair of DNA double strand breaks by homologous recombination (i.e. “error-free”) instead of non-homologous end joining (i.e. “error-prone”) (34Xiao W. Chow B.L. Broomfield S. Hanna M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 36Brusky J. Zhu Y. Xiao W. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The same surfaces involved in the heteromeric interaction of Rad5 and Rad18 can also mediate homodimerization of the respective subunits and thereby dissociate the pentamer into Rad5-Ubc13-Mms2 and Rad6-Rad18 subcomplexes, which may generate a Rad6-dependent signal to activate an error-prone subpathway (35Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). According to this model, increased Rad5 protein levels in thedun1Δpan2Δ strain could indeed shift the equilibrium away from the heteromeric complex toward an error-prone postreplicative DNA repair pathway that causes the increased lethality (Fig. 6). This pathway seems to be particularly critical in the absence of DUN1 asRAD5 overexpression alone had only a subtle effect on replicational stress survival of wild type or pan2Δ strains (Fig. 5). This is conceivable given that DUN1 has several additional DNA damage repair functions, e.g.transcriptional induction of repair enzymes (16Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and direct regulation of repair proteins such as Rad55 (39Bashkirov V.I. King J.S. Bashkirova E.V. Schmuckli-Maurer J. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4393-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which may renderdun1Δ mutants more sensitive to deleterious effects of either pan2/3 deletion or RAD5overexpression.As synthetic lethality is usually a property of genes whose products interact in a common biochemical pathway (31Hartman J.L.I. Garvik B. Hartwell L. Science. 2001; 291: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), the simplest interpretation of our data is that Dun1 and PAN interact at the posttranscriptional level to regulate RAD5 gene expression. While the two-hybrid data indicate that Dun1 interacts directly with Pan3, a key question remaining to be answered is whether PAN activity is regulated by Dun1 in response to replication blocks. Given the synthetic effect of the two genes, it is quite possible that Dun1 does not directly regulate PAN but another enzyme with a similar function,e.g. Ccr4-Caf1. In this scenario (Fig. 6), PAN would constitutively regulate RAD5 mRNA levels, whereas Ccr4-Caf1 would be strictly Dun1-dependent and therefore compensate for the loss of PAN as long as DUN1 is present. Ccr4-Caf1 has multiple functions as an mRNA deadenylase (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and as part of the CCR4-NOT complex in control of transcriptional initiation and elongation (40Denis C.L. Chiang Y.-C. Cui Y. Chen J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 627-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tucker et al. (20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) have suggested that one possible explanation for linking the cytoplasmic Ccr4-Caf1 deadenylase to the transcriptional machinery is that it needs to be cotranscriptionally loaded onto messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes. If this is so, it would transiently be in a complex with PAN during the initial trimming of the poly(A) tail. In this context, Pan3 binding by the Dun1 FHA domain could act as a transient scaffold to bring the kinase domain in contact with Ccr4-Caf1 to phosphorylate it and regulate its substrate specificity before export to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, Caf1 (also known as Pop2) has recently been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation in response to diauxic shifts by the Yak1 kinase, but it is unclear whether this affects its deadenylase function (41Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An important goal of future studies will be to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism by which Dun1 contributes to the regulation of RAD5 mRNA stability.Transcriptional control of gene expression (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar) and cotranscriptional regulation of mRNA 3′-end processing and polyadenylation reactions (42Kleimann F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) are established components of cell cycle checkpoints. Our results indicate that posttranscriptional mechanisms involving poly(A) tail length control are an additional checkpoint target in the regulation of gene expression. The Pan2-Pan3 and Ccr4-Caf1 poly(A)-exonucleases, the Dun1 kinase, and members of the RAD6 epistasis group have reasonably conserved orthologs in mammals (2Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 20Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R.

Therefore, the checkpoint-dependent regulation of posttranscriptional control pathways may be not be restricted to yeast but may also contribute to the prevention of chromosome aberrations in mammalian cells. DUN1 plays a crucial role in preventing gross chromosomal rearrangements resulting from inappropriate repair pathways of spontaneous replicative DNA damage even in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging or replication-blocking agents (13Myung K. Datta A. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2084713144,"Yeast NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is an octamer containing two types of homologous subunits. Ligand-binding analyses were conducted to examine effects of residue changes in putative catalytic and regulatory isocitrate-binding sites respectively contained in IDH2 and IDH1 subunits. Replacement of homologous serine residues in either subunit site, S98A in IDH2 or S92A in IDH1, was found to reduce by half the total number of holoenzyme isocitrate-binding sites, confirming a correlation between detrimental effects on isocitrate binding and respective kinetic defects in catalysis and allosteric activation by AMP. Replacement of both serine residues eliminates isocitrate binding and measurable catalytic activity. The putative isocitrate-binding sites of IDH1 and IDH2 contain five identical and four nonidentical residues. Reciprocal replacement of the four nonidentical residues in either or both subunits (A108R, F136Y, T241D, and N245D in IDH1 and/or R114A, Y142F, D248T, and D252N in IDH2) was found to be permissive for isocitrate binding. This provides further evidence for two types of binding sites in IDH, although the authentic residues have been shown to be necessary for normal kinetic contributions. Finally, the mutant enzymes with residue replacements in the IDH1 site were found to be unable to bind AMP, suggesting that allosteric activation is dependent both upon binding of isocitrate at the IDH1 site and upon the changes in the enzyme normally elicited by this binding.

These and other results led to the proposal that the enzyme contains both catalytic (isocitrate/Mg2+) and noncatalytic isocitrate-binding sites. More recently, we and others (6Illingworth J.A.

The mammalian enzyme is also an octamer but is composed of three subunits, in a ratio of α4:β2:γ2, that are similarly related to each other and to the yeast enzyme subunits (10Nichols B.J. Hall L.

Yeast IDH1 and IDH2 also share ∼32% sequence identity withEscherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (13Thorsness P.E. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Biol.

Koshland D.E., Jr. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9317-9322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), led to the proposal that both yeast subunits could contain isocitrate-binding sites. All nine of the residues implicated as essential for isocitrate/Mg2+ binding in the catalytic site of the bacterial enzyme (18Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland D.E., Jr. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) are contained in the putative site of IDH2, whereas only five of the nine residues are conserved in the putative site of IDH1. This suggested that the IDH2 site may support catalysis, whereas the IDH1 site may bind isocitrate for purposes other than catalysis. We have previously examined and defined different functions for IDH1 and IDH2 using targeted mutagenesis and kinetic analyses. Initial studies (20Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) focused on serine residues in the putative isocitrate-binding sites of each subunit that are apparent homologues of the E. coli active site Ser-113 residue. This residue is the site for phosphorylation and inactivation of the bacterial enzyme (13Thorsness P.E. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a reversible regulatory mechanism for controlling relative rates of flux through the tricarboxylic acid and glyoxylate cycles in vivo (21LaPorte D.C.

Replacement of the analogous serine residue (S98A) of yeast IDH2 resulted in a dramatic decrease inV max but had little effect on cooperativity with respect to isocitrate or on allosteric activation by AMP, whereas replacement of the serine residue (S92A) of IDH1 produced dramatic defects in these regulatory properties but much less of an effect on catalytic activity. These results were consistent with differential function of the subunits and suggested that the residue replacements detrimentally affect isocitrate binding at each site. The current study addresses isocitrate-binding properties of these mutant enzymes and of a mutant enzyme containing substitutions in both subunit sites. Consistent with a model of isocitrate/Mg2+ binding for catalysis by IDH2 and of isocitrate binding for regulation by IDH1, results of other mutagenesis and kinetic studies (24Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Another study of the putative isocitrate-binding sites (25Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) examined effects of replacement of the four nonidentical residues of nine in each IDH subunit site with the corresponding residues from the other subunit site (A108R, F136Y, T241D, and N245D in IDH1 or R114A, Y142F, D248T, and D252N in IDH2). These changes were designed to disrupt the normal kinetic results of isocitrate binding by each site but to be potentially permissive for isocitrate binding per se (26Panisko E.A. Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX2000Google Scholar). The four residue replacements in IDH2, as expected, reducedV max by >150-fold, but the mutant enzyme retained kinetic cooperativity with respect to isocitrate and allosteric activation by AMP. The four residue replacements in IDH1 reduced V max by 17-fold, and the mutant enzyme displayed no cooperativity or allosteric activation. These results are consistent with the presumed functions of the two subunits. However, actual effects on isocitrate binding were not assessed prior to the current study, in which we also examine kinetic and isocitrate-binding properties of a mutant enzyme containing the four reciprocal residue substitutions in both subunits. Despite the apparent differences in primary contributions of each subunit, it is also clear that interactions between IDH1 and IDH2 are essential for holoenzyme structure and function. Both subunits are required for catalytic activity in vivo, because yeast mutants lacking either or both subunits exhibit the same growth phenotypes (8Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), including an inability to grow with acetate as a carbon source. Both subunits are required for oligomeric structure, because the independent subunits expressed in yeast appear to be monomers (20Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid assays also indicate strong heteromeric but not homomeric interactions between subunits (27Panisko E.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, based on the three-dimensional model for the active site of the homodimeric E. coli enzyme (18Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland D.E., Jr. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), mutagenesis was used to show that, of the nine residues in the putative isocitrate-binding sites of each IDH subunit, two are contributed by the other subunit (27Panisko E.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, within the octameric enzyme, the basic structural/functional unit appears to be a heterodimer of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits. However, as discussed in more detail below, a simple model with a core heterodimer containing one catalytic subunit and one regulatory subunit is inadequate because it leads to a prediction of twice the number of ligand-binding sites than are actually measured for the octameric holoenzyme. The current study assesses the isocitrate-binding properties of mutant forms of IDH to test hypotheses developed from previous kinetic evaluations. In addition, we examine a mechanism proposed by Kuehnet al. (5Kuehn G.D. Barnes L.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for allosteric activation of IDH. Based on their inability to detect binding of AMP by IDH in the absence of isocitrate, they speculated that binding of the allosteric activator requires that isocitrate be bound by a noncatalytic site of the enzyme. The availability of mutant enzymes with defects in the putative noncatalytic site in IDH1 provides a direct experimental test of this proposal. Wild-type and mutant forms of IDH were expressed in a yeast strain, IDHΔ12L (MATα ade2–1 can1–100 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 Δidh1::LEU2Δidh2::HIS3), containing deletion/disruption mutations in chromosomal IDH1 andIDH2 loci (28Przybyla-Zawislak B. Gadde D.M. Ducharme K. McCammon M.T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 153-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants of this strain were selected and maintained on agar plates containing YNB medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5) with 2% glucose and nutrient supplements as necessary for growth and selection. Codon changes in yeast IDH1 or IDH2 genes to produce the mutant enzymes used in this study were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (20Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Panisko E.A. Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX2000Google Scholar). The codon changes were designed to replace single (S92A) or multiple residues (A108R, F136Y, T241D, and N245D) of IDH1 and single (S98A) or multiple residues (R114A, Y142F, D248T, and D252N) of IDH2. For expression in previous studies (25Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Panisko E.A. Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX2000Google Scholar), centromere-based plasmids carrying bothIDH1 and IDH2 genes were used, with one of the genes containing coding region mutations and the other gene containing a pentahistidine codon tag at the 3′ end of the coding region. For current studies, subcloning was used to construct plasmids containing paired mutations in both IDH1 and IDH2 genes, and site-directed mutagenesis was used when necessary to introduce the pentahistidine codon tag. Additionally, because the current studies required high levels of enzyme expression, subcloning was used to transfer 6.4-kbp SstII/HindIII DNA fragments containing desired pairs of genes into a multicopy 2-μm based plasmid (pRS426; Ref. 29Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) containing the yeast URA3 gene for selection. Independent plasmids in the resulting collection encode the wild-type enzyme (IDH1His/IDH2) and each of the following mutant enzymes: IDH1S92A/IDH2His, IDH1/IDH2S98A/His, IDH1S92A/IDH2S98A/His, IDH1A108R,F136Y,T241D,N245D/IDH2His, IDH1His/IDH2R114A,Y142F,D248T,D252N, and IDH1A108R,F136Y,T241D,N245D/IDH2R114A,Y142F,D248T,D252N/His. Yeast transformations were conducted using a lithium acetate protocol (30Gietz D., St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). For purification of wild-type and mutant forms of IDH, transformant colonies were recovered from plates by growth for 16 h in 10 ml of YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) containing 2% glucose, then transferred and grown for 24 h in 100 ml of YNB glucose medium lacking uracil to select for plasmid replication. These cultures were used to inoculate 1-liter cultures of YP medium containing 2% ethanol as the carbon source to stimulate cell growth and to maximize levels of IDH expression (31Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After growth for 36 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested for enzyme purification, from 1–2 liters of cultures for kinetic analyses or from 6 liters of cultures for ligand-binding analyses. Cell pellets were resuspended (1 ml/5 g cells) in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm potassium citrate, and 50% glycerol, frozen by dripping into liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Preparation of cell extracts by breaking with glass beads and affinity purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography were conducted as previously described (24Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Yields were 2.5–3.3 mg of purified enzyme/∼8 g of cells/liter of culture. The purified enzymes were stored at 4 °C in affinity column elution buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole) prior to kinetic or ligand-binding assays, which were performed within 24 h following purification. Concentrations of purified enzymes were calculated from absorbance measurements made at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 168,820 m−1cm−1 (32Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Purities of >95% were assessed following gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Mutant enzymes in this study examined by high performance liquid chromatography (25Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L.

McAlister-Henn, unpublished observations. exhibit elution and sedimentation properties characteristic of the wild-type enzyme. IDH activity was routinely measured using assays containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmNAD+, and 2.0 mm dl-isocitrate. The concentration of d-isocitrate was calculated as 50% of the total concentration of dl-isocitrate. For measurement of some kinetic parameters, d-isocitrate concentrations ranged from 0 to 2.0 mm and AMP was added to 100 μm. Other variations in assay conditions are described in the text. A unit of activity is defined as production of 1 μmol of NADH/min at 24 °C. Procedures for ligand-binding assays were adapted for IDH from an ultrafiltration method described by Dean et al. (33Dean A.M. Lee M.H.I. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found wild-type IDH to be stable, with respect to retention of kinetic and allosteric properties, when stored for several weeks at 4 °C in affinity column elution buffer. To avoid removal of purified enzymes from this buffer, which contains high concentrations of NaCl and imidazole, we empirically determined conditions for concentration of the purified enzyme in this buffer followed by direct dilution into a binding assay buffer more compatible with kinetic assay conditions. Specifically, the purified enzymes were concentrated in affinity column elution buffer by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM-50, Amicon) to obtain concentrations of ∼10 mg/ml. Aliquots of 100 μl of concentrated enzyme were added to 900-μl aliquots of binding buffer containing varied concentrations of the test ligand in the top chambers of Centricon YM-50 columns (Amicon). The enzyme/ligand assay mixes were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, then centrifuged briefly (45 s at 4000 rpm in a Beckman SS34 rotor at room temperature) to obtain ∼125 μl of ultrafiltrates in the lower chambers of the columns. No enzyme was detectable in these ultrafiltrates using activity or protein assays. Parallel assays at each ligand concentration were conducted with columns loaded with 100 μl of affinity column elution buffer and 900 μl of binding buffer. For isocitrate ligand-binding assays, the binding buffer contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, and d-isocitrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 mm. These assays were conducted in the absence or in the presence of 100 μm AMP. For AMP ligand-binding assays, the buffer contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm d-isocitrate, and AMP concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.4 mm. Concentrations of isocitrate in ultrafiltrates were measured enzymatically using IDH and calculated using a standard curve of activity versus known isocitrate concentrations measured on the same day. AMP concentrations in ultrafiltrates were measured spectrophotometrically (absorbance at 260 nm) by comparison with a standard curve derived with known concentrations of AMP dissolved in affinity column buffer and diluted 1:10 in the appropriate binding buffer. The concentration of bound ligand was determined by subtracting the concentration of ligand in the ultrafiltrate of the assay containing enzyme from the concentration in the paired ultrafiltrate of the assay lacking enzyme. Binding is expressed as moles of bound ligand/mol of IDH holoenzyme (molecular weight = 303,024), and each value represents an average from two independent experimental determinations. To assess ligand-binding properties of wild-type and mutant forms of IDH, we adapted an ultrafiltration method used by Dean et al. (33Dean A.M. Lee M.H.I. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for analysis of E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase. Conditions for ligand binding were empirically developed using affinity-purified wild-type IDH as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are reproducible with different preparations of the enzyme and are compatible with those previously obtained by Kuehn et al.(5Kuehn G.D. Barnes L.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the conventionally purified enzyme in equilibrium binding analyses. Analysis of isocitrate binding by the wild-type enzyme was conducted in the absence or presence of 100 μm AMP, the allosteric activator of IDH, to compare effects on S0.5 values with those obtained in kinetic analyses. The binding assays were conducted with d-isocitrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 mm and with ∼1.0 mg of affinity-purified enzyme/assay. Mg2+ was included in the binding assay buffer at the same concentration used in kinetic assays, whereas NAD+ was omitted to prevent catalysis. The amount of isocitrate bound at each concentration (mole/mole of IDH) was calculated after measuring the concentration of free isocitrate in the ultrafiltrate using enzyme assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As illustrated in Fig. 1, the isocitrate-binding curves obtained for IDH (panel A) are quite similar to the velocity saturation curves obtained with kinetic assays (panel B). Both types of analyses demonstrate the dramatic positive effect of AMP on the affinity of IDH for isocitrate. The ligand-binding assays indicate four binding sites for isocitrate/holoenzyme as previously reported (5Kuehn G.D. Barnes L.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The parameters obtained from kinetic and ligand-binding assays of IDH are compared in Table I. The S0.5 values for isocitrate measured in the absence of AMP are essentially identical with both methods, but, in the presence of AMP, a slightly higher S0.5 value is obtained with binding assays (0.15 mm) than with kinetic assays (0.09 mm). Thus, AMP reduces the isocitrate S0.5value by ∼5-fold in these kinetic analyses and by ∼3-fold in these binding analyses. Hill coefficients obtained with both methods are quite similar, with values of ∼4 in the absence or presence of AMP. In Table I, parameters obtained in current studies with the affinity-purified enzyme are compared with those obtained in previous studies with the conventionally purified enzyme. The previous kinetic analyses by Barnes et al. (4Barnes L.D. Kuehn G.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3939-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) produced lower S0.5 values for isocitrate and a differential of 16-fold for the AMP effect. The previously reported values for kinetic cooperativity with respect to isocitrate were lower than the current values, suggesting that current rapid purification techniques may facilitate retention of this allosteric property. Results of the previous equilibrium binding analysis by Kuehn et al. (5Kuehn G.D. Barnes L.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for IDH binding of isocitrate in the presence of AMP are similar to ours with respect to number of binding sites and Hill coefficients, but they reported a lower S0.5 value. Availability of sufficient purified enzyme precluded their measurements of isocitrate binding in the absence of AMP. These differences in values for parameters of IDH for isocitrate are minor, given the significant differences in methods for purification and for kinetic and ligand-binding assays.Table IIsocitrate binding parameters for yeast isocitrate dehydrogenasesEnzymeBinding assaysKinetic assaysBinding sites −AMP/+AMPS0.5 −AMP/+AMPHill coefficient −AMP/+AMP V maxS0.5 −AMP/+AMPHill coefficient −AMP/+AMP mm units/mg mmIDH1His/IDH21-aFor affinity-purified IDH, parameters for ligand binding are averages of two or three independent determinations, and kinetic parameters were previously reported (25).

https://openalex.org/W2004595650,"We have studied the mechanism by which an acidic domain (amino acids 515–583) of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) transactivates a target gene. Studies with glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins demonstrate that the wild-type acidic domain associates in vitro with Myb-binding protein 1a, whereas a mutant domain (F542A, I569A) does not. AhR-defective cells reconstituted with an AhR containing the wild-type acidic domain exhibit normal AhR function; however, cells reconstituted with an AhR containing the mutant acidic domain do not function normally. Transient transfection of Myb-binding protein 1a into mouse hepatoma cells is associated with augmentation of AhR-dependent gene expression. Such augmentation does not occur when Myb-binding protein 1a is transfected into AhR-defective cells that have been reconstituted with an AhR that lacks the acidic domain. We infer that 1) Myb-binding protein 1a associates with AhR, thereby enhancing transactivation, and 2) the presence of AhR's acidic domain is both necessary and sufficient for Myb-binding protein 1a to increase AhR-dependent gene expression.

The liganded AhR heterodimerizes with a second protein, known as the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), to form a complex that activates transcription by binding to an enhancer in the vicinity of the TCDD-responsive target gene (5Hankinson O.

Both AhR and Arnt are prototypical members of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim class of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression in response to a variety of environmental and developmental signals (7Reisz-Porszasz S.

Efficient reconstitution of such cells by retroviral infection permits analyses of AhR and Arnt mutants in a relatively physiological setting (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell.

Studies ofCYP1A1 gene regulation in mouse hepatoma cells reveal that exposure to TCDD leads to the binding of AhR/Arnt to an enhancer upsteam of the CYP1A1 gene. The C-terminal portion of AhR (which contains several transactivation domains) communicates the induction signal to the neighboring promoter, which then assumes a more accessible chromatin structure and binds general transcription factors (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such observations reveal that the transactivation domains of AhR facilitate enhancer-promoter communication by a process that involves changes in the structure of promoter chromatin and occupancy of promoter binding sites by the transcriptional machinery.Here, we have studied AhR-dependent transactivation in more detail; we have focused on a relatively small (69 amino acid) domain of AhR that is rich in acidic residues and can transactivate the native chromosomal CYP1A1 gene (13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that this acidic activation domain (AAD) of AhR associates with a factor previously identified as Myb-binding protein 1a (Mybbp1a) and that Mybbp1a substantially augments the ability of AhR/Arnt to activate transcription. These findings reveal new aspects of AhR and Mybbp1a function.DISCUSSIONTo better understand the mechanism by which AhR transactivates its target genes, we identified Mybbp1a as a factor that associates with AhR's AAD in vitro and augments AhR function in vivo. Our findings are consistent with previous observations that Mybbp1a may influence transactivation in other systems (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M. Lutwyche J. Keough R.A. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior analyses of CYP1A1 gene regulation indicate that the C-terminal portion of AhR mediates enhancer-promoter communication, producing an accessible chromatin structure that facilitates promoter occupancy (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The findings in this paper imply that Mybbp1a participates in this process.We have shown previously that hydrophobic residues that are clustered in two regions of AhR's acidic segment are important for transactivation function (14Jones L.C. Whitlock J.P., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25037-25042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, we observe that mutation of Phe542 and Ile569 within the AAD abolishes not only its association with Mybbp1a but also its transactivation capability. These findings imply that hydrophobic forces are important both for the association between the two proteins and for transactivation function. Previous studies imply that Mybbp1a binds to c-Myb and to c-Jun via leucine zipper-like motifs (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M.

However, AhR's AAD does not contain a leucine zipper; therefore, its association with Mybbp1a must involve a different type of interaction. This conclusion is consistent with other findings which imply that Mybbp1a influences Myb-dependent and AhR-dependent gene regulation by different mechanisms. For example, Mybbp1a associates with a negative regulatory domain in the Myb protein (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M. Lutwyche J. Keough R.A. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that Mybbp1a interacts with a transactivation domain of AhR. Furthermore, overexpression of Mybbp1a fails to alter Myb-dependent gene expression (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M. Lutwyche J. Keough R.A. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that overexpression of Mybbp1a augments AhR-dependent transcription. Taken together, these observations imply that Mybbp1a can utilize several different molecular mechanisms to influence gene expression.Our GST pull-down experiments reveal that Mybbp1a can associate with AhR's AAD in vitro in the absence of TCDD. Therefore, we infer that TCDD is not required to induce a factor(s) that facilitates the Mybbp1a-AhR interaction. The constitutive interaction observedin vitro may not occur in intact cells, because, for the most part, the two proteins occupy different subcellular compartments; the unliganded AhR is cytoplasmic, while Mybbp1a is found in the nucleolus and in the nucleoplasm (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M. Lutwyche J. Keough R.A. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell.

Gonda, unpublished data. However, at any one time, most of the Mybbp1a is in the nucleus. Because of such compartmentalization, we envision that the two proteins do not have an opportunity to associate in vivo until the AhR enters the nucleus following exposure of cells to TCDD or another ligand.Our studies reveal that increased expression of Mybbp1a substantially augments the response of an AhR/Arnt-dependent reporter gene to TCDD. This observation implies that the availability of Mybbp1a can be a limiting factor for maximal AhR/Arnt function. We envision that the restricted availability of Mybbp1a reflects its localization primarily in the nucleolus (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G.

The mechanism by which Mybbp1a augments AhR/Arnt function remains to be determined. We hypothesize that Mybbp1a contributes via protein-protein interactions to the formation of productive transcriptional complexes at AhR/Arnt-dependent promoters. This process could involve recruitment and/or stabilization of any of numerous factors that participate in the transcription of genes in chromatin (29Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T.

In this regard, we note that Mybbp1a contains several so-called LCD motifs, which have been implicated in protein-protein interactions involved in inducible gene expression in other systems (20Torchia J.

Our experiments do not reveal whether Mybbp1a is essential for AhR/Arnt function; studies in Mybbp1a-defective cells could address this issue in the future.Our studies re-emphasize the concept that AhR has a modular organization and that different domains of AhR subserve different functions. Our observation that the AAD of AhR can substitute functionally for the entire C-terminal portion of AhR (which contains several transactivation domains) suggests that the C-terminal portion exhibits redundancy with respect to its transactivation capability. One possible advantage of such redundancy is that it might improve the ability of AhR/Arnt to communicate with transcriptional promoters that differ in their cognate binding proteins. In this respect, it is notable that a second, glutamine-rich transactivation domain within AhR's C-terminal portion probably interacts with proteins that are different from those that interact with the AAD (37Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given this situation, we speculate that the AAD and the glutamine-rich domain of AhR preferentially communicate with different sets of transcriptional promoters. This may be an interesting area for future research. The aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)1 is an intracellular protein that mediates transcriptional responses to certain hydrophobic ligands, the most notorious of which is the widespread environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin) (1Burbach K.M.

The liganded AhR heterodimerizes with a second protein, known as the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt), to form a complex that activates transcription by binding to an enhancer in the vicinity of the TCDD-responsive target gene (5Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 6Whitlock J.P., Jr. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Both AhR and Arnt are prototypical members of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim class of transcription factors, which regulate gene expression in response to a variety of environmental and developmental signals (7Reisz-Porszasz S.

Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of AhR/Arnt-dependent transcription stems from analyses of the TCDD-inducibleCYP1A1 gene in mouse hepatoma cells; this experimental system benefits from the availability of AhR-defective and Arnt-defective cells. Efficient reconstitution of such cells by retroviral infection permits analyses of AhR and Arnt mutants in a relatively physiological setting (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25037-25042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Studies ofCYP1A1 gene regulation in mouse hepatoma cells reveal that exposure to TCDD leads to the binding of AhR/Arnt to an enhancer upsteam of the CYP1A1 gene. The C-terminal portion of AhR (which contains several transactivation domains) communicates the induction signal to the neighboring promoter, which then assumes a more accessible chromatin structure and binds general transcription factors (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such observations reveal that the transactivation domains of AhR facilitate enhancer-promoter communication by a process that involves changes in the structure of promoter chromatin and occupancy of promoter binding sites by the transcriptional machinery. Here, we have studied AhR-dependent transactivation in more detail; we have focused on a relatively small (69 amino acid) domain of AhR that is rich in acidic residues and can transactivate the native chromosomal CYP1A1 gene (13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that this acidic activation domain (AAD) of AhR associates with a factor previously identified as Myb-binding protein 1a (Mybbp1a) and that Mybbp1a substantially augments the ability of AhR/Arnt to activate transcription. These findings reveal new aspects of AhR and Mybbp1a function. DISCUSSIONTo better understand the mechanism by which AhR transactivates its target genes, we identified Mybbp1a as a factor that associates with AhR's AAD in vitro and augments AhR function in vivo. Our findings are consistent with previous observations that Mybbp1a may influence transactivation in other systems (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M. Lutwyche J. Keough R.A. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior analyses of CYP1A1 gene regulation indicate that the C-terminal portion of AhR mediates enhancer-promoter communication, producing an accessible chromatin structure that facilitates promoter occupancy (12Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ko H.P. Okino S.T., Ma, Q. Whitlock J.P., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The findings in this paper imply that Mybbp1a participates in this process.We have shown previously that hydrophobic residues that are clustered in two regions of AhR's acidic segment are important for transactivation function (14Jones L.C. Whitlock J.P., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25037-25042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, we observe that mutation of Phe542 and Ile569 within the AAD abolishes not only its association with Mybbp1a but also its transactivation capability.

Previous studies imply that Mybbp1a binds to c-Myb and to c-Jun via leucine zipper-like motifs (19Tavner F.J. Simpson R. Tashiro S. Favier D. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Macmillan E.M.

Our experiments do not reveal whether Mybbp1a is essential for AhR/Arnt function; studies in Mybbp1a-defective cells could address this issue in the future. Our studies re-emphasize the concept that AhR has a modular organization and that different domains of AhR subserve different functions. Our observation that the AAD of AhR can substitute functionally for the entire C-terminal portion of AhR (which contains several transactivation domains) suggests that the C-terminal portion exhibits redundancy with respect to its transactivation capability. One possible advantage of such redundancy is that it might improve the ability of AhR/Arnt to communicate with transcriptional promoters that differ in their cognate binding proteins. In this respect, it is notable that a second, glutamine-rich transactivation domain within AhR's C-terminal portion probably interacts with proteins that are different from those that interact with the AAD (37Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38Triezenberg S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given this situation, we speculate that the AAD and the glutamine-rich domain of AhR preferentially communicate with different sets of transcriptional promoters. This may be an interesting area for future research. We thank Len Dahand for technical assistance."

We report here on promoter analyses of human TXAS using in vitro transcription and in vivo transfection methods. The 39-bp core promoter, containing both TATA and initiator elements, accurately initiates transcription in an orientation-dependent manner in a cell-free transcription system. Mutation of either TATA or initiator abolished transcriptional activity, but the upstream sequence had no effect on TXAS promoter activities in vitro, suggesting that the core promoter is sufficient for transcriptional activity from a naked DNA template. In contrast, mutation of both elements drastically decreased the promoter activity in vivo. Furthermore, TXAS proximal promoter containing the nucleotides −90 to −56 relative to the transcriptional start site was necessary for promoter transactivation in vivo. Transcriptional activities from 5′-deletion mutants indicated that the effects of the nucleotides −90/−56 were more pronounced in stably transfected cells (a 150-fold difference) than in the transiently transfected cells (an 8-fold difference), reflecting the effects of TXAS transcriptional activation from replicating and nonreplicating DNA templates. Partial micrococcal nuclease digestion indicated that the sequence −90/−56, where the NF-E2 site is located, is associated with alterations of nucleosomal structure at the regions of promoter and reporter gene but not the region further downstream. Mutagenesis and forced expression studies demonstrated a critical role of p45 NF-E2 in controlling TXAS expression under native chromatin conditions. Band shifting and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that p45 NF-E2 was bound to the TXAS promoter in vitro and in vivo. Indirect end labeling and ligation-mediated PCR analyses further demonstrated that the occupation of TXAS promoter NF-E2 site was associated with disruption of nucleosomal structure. Collectively, these results indicate that binding of NF-E2 is critical both for alteration of the nucleosomal structure and for activation of the TXAS promoter, whereas the TATA and initiator elements are essential for transcription.

The complete human TXAS gene contains 13 exons and spans 193 kb of contiguous DNA in chromosome 7 (15Tazawa R. Green E.D. Ohashi K., Wu, K.K. Wang L.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); the genomic structure was recently confirmed by the Celera human genomic sequence (16Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W., Li, P.W. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site of the human TXAS gene was mapped at nucleotide 137 upstream from the ATG translation site (15Tazawa R. Green E.D. Ohashi K., Wu, K.K. Wang L.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence of TXAS initiator (Inr) resembles the weakly conserved Inr element for RNA polymerase II. An upstream sequence between nucleotides −90 and −56 relative to the TXAS transcriptional start site was shown to be important for TXAS promoter activity in a megakaryotic cell line. Further detailed analysis identified transcription factor NF-E2 binding at the nucleotide region −83/−77 as being responsible for TXAS transactivation (17Lee K.D. Baek S.J. Shen R.F. Biochem.

Transcription factor NF-E2 is a basic leucine zipper heterodimer consisting of p45 and p18 subunits, which belong to the CNC protein family and the small Maf protein family, respectively (21Chan J.Y.

Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), whereas small Maf (p18) appears to be ubiquitously expressed (24Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and references therein). However, mice lacking p45 NF-E2 develop relatively normal erythropoiesis but suffer from abnormal megakaryocytic development and fail to produce platelets (26Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Megakaryocytes from p45 NF-E2-null mice do not express TXAS mRNA, whereas other tissues, such as fetal liver and bone marrow, have normal levels of TXAS mRNA (18Deveaux S. Cohen-Kaminsky S. Shivdasani R.A. Andrews N.C. Filipe A. Kuzniak I. Orkin S.H. Romeo P.H. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the transactivation mechanism of NF-E2 participates, at least in part, in the chromatin remodeling (27Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 28Caterina J.J. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Binding of the NF-E2 to the chromatin template removed nucleosomes from the β- or ε-globin promoter in both in vivo and in vitro studies (30Gong Q.H. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies describing transcriptional regulation of the TXAS promoter have primarily been carried out by transient transfection assays in which the template DNA is nonreplicating and is unlikely to be assembled into organized nucleosomes (Ref. 32Smith C.L. Hager G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27493-27496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar and references therein). Stably transfected DNA templates, however, represent replicating chromatin and are assembled into repeated arrays of nucleosomes. Considering that transcriptional activities may depend on the template state, we examined TXAS promoter activities from naked DNA, nonreplicating chromatin, and replicating chromatin templates. Our results led us to propose a model in which NF-E2 induces nucleosomal alteration in the vicinity of the TXAS promoter, thereby allowing the basic transcriptional machinery to bind to the core promoter. The G-free cassette vectors, pC2AT and pMLC2AT190, were kindly provided by Drs. Michele Sawadogo and Ming-Jer Tsai (33Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Luciferase reporter vectors, pGL3-Basic (promoterless), pGL3-Control (luciferase reporter gene driven by SV40 promoter/enhancer), and the luciferase assay kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). The β-galactosidase reporter vector pCMV-β-Gal (β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer) and the luminescent β-galactosidase assay kits were from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). p220.2, an Epstein-Barr virus vector containingoriP, EBNA-1, and the hygromycin resistance gene, was a generous gift from Dr. Bill Sugden (35Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Lipofectin reagent, PLUS reagent, OptiMEM, LipofectAMINE 2000, and hygromycin B were from Invitrogen, and FuGENE6 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) was purchased from Worthington. Antibodies against p45 NF-E2, Nrf1, and Nrf2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01) and the human erythroleukemia cell line (HEL) were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium, and HeLa human cervical cancer cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium. All of the media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. DNA fragments containing the TXAS promoter sequences −36/+3 and −248/+3 (relative to the transcriptional start site) were obtained by PCR amplification and were inserted into the Ecl136II site of a G-free cassette vector, pC2AT, to obtain both the correct orientations (pC2AT-TX36(+) and pC2AT-TX248(+)) and the reverse orientations (pC2AT-TX36(−) and pC2AT-TX248(−)). Mutations in the TATA-box (TATA to TCCC; underline indicates mutation) and Inr (CACATT to CACGTG) were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pGL3–248/+3, which has the −248/+3 TXAS promoter fragment linked to a luciferase reporter vector, was constructed first by cloning the −248/+3 PCR fragment into theEcoRV site of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) and then cloning the SacI/HindIII fragment of the resultant pBluescript into pGL3-Basic. The correct orientation was confirmed by PCR. A series of 5′-deletion mutants in the TXAS promoter linked to pGL3 (i.e. pGL3−280/+137, −190/+137, −140/+137, −90/+137, −56/+137, and −38/+137) and 3′-deletion mutations of pGL3−280/+90, −280/+75, −280/+52, and −280/+3 were constructed in a similar fashion. The numberings of the constructs indicate the nucleotide positions relative to the transcriptional start site. The minichromosome constructs, pMC−280/+137, −190/+137, −90/+137, and −56/+137, were created by first inserting theXbaI/BamHI fragment of pGL3-Basic that contains the SV40 poly(A) signal into the XbaI/BamHI site of p220.2. Subsequently, the XbaI fragments of pGL3−280/+137, −190/+137, −90/+137, and −56/+137, containing the luciferase gene and the corresponding TXAS promoter sequence, were each inserted into the XbaI site of the p220.2-SV40 poly(A) construct. A point mutation at the NF-E2 binding site (TGATTCA toGGATCCA) in pMC−280/+137, called pMC−280/+137-mNF-E2, was generated by PCR. NF-E2 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from total MEG-01 cellular RNA (17Lee K.D. Baek S.J. Shen R.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and first subcloned into TA vector and then into the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) at theBamHI/HindIII site. All constructs generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were obtained as described (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Optimal assay conditions were defined in preliminary studies. Typically, reactions (25 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 45 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of test template DNA, 0.5 μg of control adenovirus major late promoter template pMLC2AT190, 10 units of RNase T1, 20 units of RNA guard (Amersham Biosciences), 3 μl of HeLa nuclear extract, and the nucleotide mix (0.4 mm ATP, 0.4 mm TTP, 1 mm3′-O-methyl-GTP (Amersham Biosciences), 0.016 mmUTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol)). Reactions were initiated by adding the nucleotide mix, incubated for 60 min at 30 °C, and terminated by adding 150 μl of stop solution containing 0.3 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.45 μg of yeast tRNA. Products were then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. The pellets were washed with 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 50% formamide and 5 mm EDTA. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min before they were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and visualized by autoradiography. The cationic lipids used for transient transfection were Lipofectin reagent and PLUS reagent for HeLa cells and LipofectAMINE 2000 for MEG-01 cells. Transfection was initially performed following the manufacturer's instructions and then optimized in later experiments. Briefly, 1 day before transfection, 1 × 106 MEG-01 cells were seeded in six-well plates. MEG-01 cells were exposed to 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000, 2 μg of pGL3-TXAS reporter vector DNA, and 1 μg of pCMV-β-Gal in 2 ml of OptiMEM. For HeLa cells, 1 × 105 cells were transfected by 0.5 ml of OptiMEM containing 2 μg of pGL3-TXAS reporter vector DNA, 1 μg of pCMV-β-Gal, 20 μl of Lipofectin reagent, and 10 μl of PLUS reagent after washing with serum-free medium. The medium was replaced with complete medium 4 h after transfection for HeLa cells. After a 48-h incubation without changing the medium, the cells were harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed with 20 μl of lysate and 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent using a MiniLumat Luminometer LB9506 (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). β-Galactosidase activities were determined using a chemiluminescence assay kit. Stable transfection of HEL cells (1 × 106 cells in 2 ml) and HeLa cells (1 × 105 cells in 2 ml) was carried out using 6 μl of FuGENE6 and 2 μg of the minichromosome DNA. One day after transfection, cells were subcultured into 20 wells of 96-well plate (HEL) or a 100-mm dish (HeLa) and selected with 400 μg/ml of hygromycin B. Several clones of each construct were obtained. Copy numbers of each clone were determined by Southern blot analysis. Nuclear extracts of HEL cells were prepared by the method described previously (37Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C until use. EMSA was performed based on a previously described method (38Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-end-labeled probe (TXAS promoter nucleotides −121 to +5) in a binding reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 m EDTA, 15% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at room temperature. For supershift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies for 30 min before the labeled probe was added. The mixtures were electrophoresed in a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed overnight at −70 °C. ChIP and duplex PCR were carried out as previously described (39Schubeler D. Francastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). HEL cells (2.4 × 107) maintaining minichromosome pMC−280/+137 were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Formaldehyde was neutralized by incubation with 125 mm glycine for 10 min and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed for 5 min on ice in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors. Nuclei were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min and resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and then sonicated five times for 5 s each time. The nuclei preparations were cleared by centrifugation and diluted 10 times in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m NaCl. Extracts were precleared for 2 h with 60 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma), 40 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 80 μg of bovine serum albumin. An aliquot of precleared chromatin was removed, heat-treated to reverse protein-DNA interaction, and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol (referred to as input) and used in the subsequent duplex PCR analysis. The remainder of chromatin sample was then separated into two tubes for different antibody treatments. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 6 h by adding 10 μg of p45 NF-E2 antibody or irrelevant rabbit serum with 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (presaturated with salmon sperm DNA). The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) and three times with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted by three successive treatments with 150 μl of 1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3. NaCl was then adjusted to 0.3 m, and 1 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) was added. Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight, and DNA was extracted by adding 20 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 2 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) at 50 °C for 30 min. After phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol co-precipitation with 30 μg of glycogen, the pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of H2O. For the duplex PCR, 2 μl of ChIP DNA was used as template in a total volume of 10 μl of PCR buffer containing 0.5 μm each of the primer pair for TXAS promoter (corresponding to the promoter sequences −90/−72 and +118/+137) and 0.5 μm each of the primer pair for the TXAS 3′-untranslated region (corresponding to the cDNA sequences 1581/1600 and 1901/1920 downstream from the translational start site), 7.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 0.2 mm dNTP andTaq polymerase. After amplification, PCR products were separated by a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel before autoradiography. Nuclei from HEL cell clones were prepared according to a modification of published procedures (30Gong Q.H. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 107 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and chromatin-DNA was cross-linked by incubation of cells with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min (40Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) before being washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 6 ml of suspension buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.15 mmspermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 5% sucrose. After a 5-min incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged (15 min, 150 × g, 4 °C) through a 3.5-ml cushion of suspension buffer containing 10% sucrose. Nuclei were gently resuspended in 3 ml of suspension buffer containing 8.5% sucrose, and aliquots of 1 ml were digested with 10, 50, or 150 units of MNase in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 for 7 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by adding stop buffer at final concentrations of 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K and then incubated at 37 °C overnight. The cross-linking of DNA-protein was reversed by heating at 60 °C for 5 h (41Solomon M.J. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The DNA was purified by multiple phenol/chloroform extractions, analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Southern blot analysis using probes that were labeled by random primers. For indirect end-label analysis, the procedures for sample preparation including nuclei preparation, chromatin-DNA cross-linking, MNase digestion, and DNA isolation, were the same as described above except that 0, 10, and 30 units of MNase were used. Purified DNAs were digested with XbaI and BclI, separated by gel electrophoresis after phenol/chloroform extraction, and analyzed by Southern blotting using the 5′-end of the luciferase cDNA (cut withHindIII and BclI from the pGL3-basic) as the probe. MNase-treated nuclei were prepared, and total DNAs were isolated as described above. LM-PCR was carried out following a standard method (38Carey M. Smale S.T. Transcriptional Regulation in Eukaryotes: Concepts, Strategies, and Techniques. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA sample (5 μg) was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and ligated to the unidirectional linker (prepared by annealing the two oligonucleotides, linker 1 (5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′) and linker 2 (5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′)) with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The linker-ligated DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA samples (0.3–0.9 μg; based on the copy number of minichromosomes) were used as templates for 22 cycles of PCR amplification. The PCR mixture (40 μl) contained 0.4 μl of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.4 μl of 10× Expand HF PCR buffer with 15 mmMgCl2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.8 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 1.6 μl each of 10 μm linker 1 oligonucleotide and TXAS-specific primer P1. The reaction was carried out with the following conditions: first cycle, denature for 5 min at 95 °C, with the remaining cycles for 1 min at 95 °C, 2 min at optimal annealing temperature (54–56 °C, empirically determined for each primer set), 5 min at 72 °C, and an additional 5-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR product (5 μl) was added to 15 μl of a fresh PCR mixture containing 0.1 μl of Taq DNA polymerase, 1.5 μl of 10× Expand HF PCR buffer with 15 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μl of 10 mm dNTP solution, and 1.0 μl of 1 μm32P-end labeled TXAS-specific primer P2. The second amplification was carried out for 11–18 cycles (empirically determined for each primer set) of linear PCR amplification consisting of denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C for the first cycle, with the remaining cycles for 1 min at 95 °C, 2 min at optimal annealing temperature (56–58 °C, empirically determined for each primer set), 5 min at 72 °C, and an additional 5-min extension at 72 °C. After the second amplification, the reaction products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide, 7m urea-sequencing gels. The sequence of the TXAS-specific oligonucleotides were as follows: 3′ side promoter primers, P1 (5′-TCCTCTGAGACCCCAGAGTG-3′) and P2 (5′-GATCTCGCCGCCCTTATGGGAAG-3′); 5′ side promoter primers, P1 (5′-GTACAAGTCCGTGGTTACAACC-3′) and P2 (5′-GTTTCTCAGCAAACATGGGGAAG-3′). The locations of the primers in the TXAS promoter are shown in Fig.1. In initial experiments, we used the core promoter (nucleotides −36 and +3) of the TXAS gene linked to a 377-bp G-free cassette vector, pC2AT, as a template (pC2AT-TX36(+)) to examine TXAS gene expression. Transcription of this template was carried out in HeLa nuclear extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The test template yielded a 380-nucleotide transcript (Fig.2 A, lane 1), consistent with the predicted length of transcript accurately initiated from the TXAS transcriptional start site. The promoter sequence from the adenovirus major late gene (−400 to +10) inserted into a 180-bp G-free pC2AT vector (pMLC2AT190) was used as control template and resulted in correct initiation and a 190-nucleotide transcript as well as “read-through” transcripts giving a 200-nucleotide transcript after digestion by the G-specific ribonuclease T1 (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). The reverse orientation of the TXAS core promoter inserted into the pC2AT vector (pC2AT-TX36(−)), however, showed no promoter activity above that for the internal promoter template pMLC2AT190 (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). We conclude that the 39 bp of TXAS core promoter is sufficient to activate correct initiation of transcription in a direction-dependent manner in the cell-free system. To optimize concentrations of nuclear extract, templates, KCl, and MgCl2 for the TXAS in vitro transcription, we c"
