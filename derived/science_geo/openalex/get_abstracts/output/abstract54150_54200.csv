https://openalex.org/W1607062550,"Rat heart mitochondria were incubated in state 3 (with ADP) or state 4 (without ADP) in the presence of [3-14C]pyruvate, [3-14C]pyruvate plus unlabeled malate, or unlabeled pyruvate plus uniformly labeled [14C]malate. The net accumulation or loss of each intermediate in the citric acid cycle was determined by specific enzyme assays. In addition, the incorporation of radioactivity into cycle intermediates was measured after resolution of mitochondrial extracts by means of ion exchange column chromatography. In some experiments, mitochondrial suspensions were filtered through Millipore filters to determine the extramitochondrial content of metabolites. In the absence of malate, pool sizes of the citric acid cycle intermediates were very low in comparison to flux through the cycle. Recycling of 14C caused the specific activity of cycle intermediates to exceed that of the substrate, [3-14C]pyruvate. In the presence of a large pool of unlabeled malate, relatively large accumulations of 14C intermediates occurred during the oxidation of 14C-pyruvate in both state 3 and state 4. With malate added, 14C does not recycle but is diluted into the large malate pool. Thus, calculations of flux through the various steps in the cycle are made possible by comparing pyruvate disappearance with accumulation of radioactivity into the various intermediates and the final accumulation of radioactivity into malate. Rates of pyruvate utilization and oxygen consumption were linear under all conditions. Accumulations of citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and succinate were linear over the 8 min of incubation in state 4 and were largely extramitochondrial. In state 3, the accumulations of citrate and α-ketoglutarate, but not succinate, reached a constant maximum within 8 min. Both total accumulation and loss of citrate to the medium were lower in state 3 than in state 4. On the other hand, the accumulations of α-ketoglutarate and succinate were higher in state 3 than in state 4 and were mainly extramitochondrial. The accumulation of fumarate was not affected by the respiratory state of the mitochondria and was formed directly from the added malate. Addition of pyruvate alone or pyruvate plus malate to the mitochondria in both state 3 and state 4 resulted in a fall of aspartate and a stoichiometric rise of glutamate. It is suggested that the increased flux through each of the steps of the citric acid cycle observed in state 3 is mediated by coordinated interactions at several sites and that this effect is exerted mainly by changes in the ratio of NADH to NAD. The evidence indicates that the accumulations of citrate, α-ketoglutarate, and succinate in the extramitochondrial space occur by anion exchange reactions with the added malate."
https://openalex.org/W1549058772,"Abstract The similarity in the chemical structures of secretin and glucagon prompted an investigation of the comparative effects of these hormones on adenyl cyclase activity in ghosts of rat fat cells and in a preparation of purified plasma membranes from rat liver. Secretin did not activate adenyl cyclase or inhibit the stimulatory effects of glucagon on an adenyl cyclase system in plasma membranes of rat liver. Secretin and glucagon stimulated adenyl cyclase activity in ghosts of fat cells. Secretin was a more potent stimulator of the enzyme; concentrations of secretin and glucagon giving half-maximal activities were, respectively, 0.1 and 0.3 µg per ml, and maximal activity given by secretin was about twice that given by glucagon. Secretin was also more effective than glucagon in stimulating lipolysis in isolated fat cells. Combination of secretin and glucagon at maximal concentrations (20 µg per ml) did not give additive adenyl cyclase activities in ghosts, indicating that the hormones activate the same enzyme system in fat cells. Ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, a chelator of calcium, abolished the effects of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on adenyl cyclase in ghosts but did not inhibit the effects of secretin, glucagon, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormones. 1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1-hydroxy-2-t-butylamino)ethane hydrochloride, a β-adrenergic agent, stimulated adenyl cyclase and inhibited the effects of epinephrine. DCB did not inhibit the effects of secretin, glucagon, and ACTH. Pretreatment of adipose tissue with trypsin decreased by 44% the lipolytic response of isolated fat cells to glucagon, but it had no effect on their response to secretin and ACTH. Glucagon did not stimulate adenyl cyclase activity in ghosts prepared from trypsin-treated fat cells; the effects of secretin and ACTH on the enzyme were reduced by 60 and 40%, respectively. Trypsin treatment had no effect on the activation of adenyl cyclase by fluoride ion and epinephrine. It is concluded that secretin activates adenyl cyclase in fat cells via a receptor that is distinct from the receptors for glucagon and the other lipolytic hormones. It is suggested that the receptors for the peptide hormones are protein in character and are localized on the outer surface of the plasma membrane of fat cells."

Cell bodies were sensitive to acetylcholine, but half the cells were insensitive along one of their processes, suggesting an analogy with normal axons and dendrites.

https://openalex.org/W1495960900,Factors which determine the line shape in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Mn(II) bound to proteins are considered. The conclusion that a reduction in the amplitude of the Mn(II) derivative spectrum in some protein complexes may be caused by restriction of motional freedom of the bound ion rather than to line broadening caused by rapid electron spin relaxation is supported by frequency and temperature dependencies of the EPR spectra for the Mn(II)-concanavalin A complex in solution. The characteristics of the solution EPR spectra show that the environment of the bound Mn(II) is not highly distorted from cubic symmetry (zero field splitting is less than 20 gauss) and that the rotational motion of the Mn(II) is highly restricted. EPR spectra at 35.0 GHz (K band) are greatly simplified relative to spectra at 9.1 GHz (X band) thus permitting more quantitative evaluation of spectral parameters.
https://openalex.org/W1523167697,"Abstract A Mg2+-dependent enzyme which will phosphorylate protamines and histones has been isolated and purified approximately 30-fold from rainbow trout testis. The enzyme transfers the terminal phosphoryl group from ATP (but not cytidine, guanosine, or uridine triphosphates) into O-phosphoseryl linkages in the acceptor molecule. The enzyme is dependent on the addition of thiol compounds for maximal activity and cyclic 3',5'-AMP stimulates both protamine and histone phosphorylation. At a high ionic strength (0.3 m NaCl), the rate of protamine phosphorylation is enhanced approximately 3-fold while histone phosphorylation is suppressed. KCl, ammonium chloride, and sodium acetate have the same effect as NaCl. Mg2+ is essential for enzyme activity and can also satisfy the requirement of a high ionic strength for maximal activity. In a low ionic strength medium the rate of protamine phosphorylation is slightly higher than that of unfractionated histones, but in the presence of 0.3 m NaCl the ratio of protamine to histone phosphorylation rises to 13.5. Of different histone fractions, the slightly lysine-rich fraction is most readily phosphorylated by the enzyme while both the lysine-rich and the arginine-rich fractions are poor substrates. Casein and free serine are phosphorylated to a small extent. Enzymatically phosphorylated protamine can be separated from unphosphorylated protamine by starch gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1543912872,"Abstract Enhancement of sugar uptake occurs in murine sarcoma virus-infected mouse cells at the time of transformation. Direct analysis of the sugar transport and transport-associated phosphorylation system of mouse cells infected with the Harvey strain of MSV was performed with 2-deoxy-d-glucose-14C. It was shown that 2-deoxy-d-glucose-14C was taken up at various concentrations (10-2 to 10-6 m) at a greater rate and was transported with a lower Km (21.0 to 23.3 x 10-4 m for uninfected and 3.5 to 5.0 x 10-4 m for infected cells) and higher Vmax (18.2 to 19.2 nmoles per mg of protein per min at 37° for uninfected and 52.3 to 83.5 nmoles per mg of protein per min for infected cells) in the infected cells. The transported substrate was found mainly as a phosphorylated product, 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate. The increased phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose-14C by the infected cells was obtained only with intact cells, but not with cell homogenates, indicating that this phosphorylation is not due to increased intracellular hexokinase activity but rather based on a membrane-bound transport system. These data support the hypothesis that alterations in a plasma membrane sugar transport (penetration plus phosphorylation) system occurred during cellular transformation by murine sarcoma virus."

In these preparations, about 50 percent of the viable cells routinely exhibit spontaneous contractions ranging from 20 to 120 beats per minute at room temperature. The contractile activity is essentially lost at 2 degrees C but returns to normal as the temperature is increased. The rate of cellular contractions and the percentage of total cells exhibiting contractility are influenced by experimental conditions of cell preparation and the composition of the suspending medium."
https://openalex.org/W1545637156,"Abstract Tetrameric 7.5 S rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is dissociated by ATP at 0° into 4.5 S dimers or 2.8 S monomers, depending upon the protein concentration. Dissociation into two peaks is observed at protein concentrations as high as 10 mg per ml, and a 4.5 S dimer is produced in increasing quantity from the 7.5 S tetramer as the protein concentration is lowered from 10 to 2 mg per ml. At 1 mg per ml, a single 4.2 S dimer peak is observed, and at 0.1 mg per ml, a single 2.8 S monomer peak is observed. Between 1.0 and 0.1 mg per ml, only single peaks with sedimentation coefficients intermediate to those of the dimer and monomer are observed, suggesting a fairly rapidly equilibrating mixture of 2.8 S monomers and 4.5 S dimers in varying amounts. The observed inactivation is only slight at temperatures down to 12°, but the equilibrium is shifted fairly strongly toward inactive subpolymers at 7° and apparently is shifted completely to inactive monomers at 0° at 0.05 mg per ml of enzyme. The dissociation has practically no pH dependence in the range of 6.5 to 9.5, but it is somewhat greater and faster at pH 5.5 than at all others studied. Inactivation and dissociation are reversed by rewarming the enzyme to 23° and removing the ATP. Ammonium sulfate, 1 m, or 2 mm NAD protects against inactivation and dissociation. Dissociation is faster with ATP than with other adenine nucleotides and much faster and more pronounced with ATP than with GTP, UTP, CTP, FAD, and CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1579239046,"Serine dehydratase formation was induced by cyclic 3',5'-AMP and not by other cyclic nucleotides or adenosine monophosphates. A single injection of cyclic 3',5'-AMP (or its dibutyryl derivative) increased the rate of incorporation of 3H-leucine into serine dehydratase. Under the same experimental conditions the rate of synthesis of serum albumin did not change. A single administration of either glucagon or a mixture of amino acids (also an inducer of serine dehydratase) led, within 20 min, to a 40-fold and a 19-fold increase, respectively, in the concentration of cyclic 3',5'-AMP. The concentration of this nucleotide dropped to the original level within 1 hour after the beginning of the inducer administration. The induction of serine dehydratase by N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP was fully inhibited by actinomycin D only if the drug was injected 30 to 15 min prior to the injection of the cyclic nucleotide. The uptake of 3H-dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP by the liver was not inhibited by actinomycin D."
https://openalex.org/W1588306183,"Abstract 1. A new succinoxidase activity has been found in mitochondria of Euglena gracilis grown in the presence of either ethanol or succinate and antimycin. 2. The new oxidase activity is characterized by its insensitivity to antimycin and KCN and by its marked stimulation on addition of AMP. The principal products of succinate oxidation are malate, fumarate, and water. Tests for the formation of H2O2 have been negative. 3. Oxidation of NADH can be channeled through this terminal oxidase as indicated by an insensitivity to KCN and stimulation by AMP. Cyanide-insensitive oxidation of NADH is linked to phosphorylation, whereas succinate oxidation is not. These findings suggest that the new terminal oxidase is associated with the electron transport chain in the region of succinate dehydrogenase. 4. It is suggested that the alternate oxidase may account for the high respiratory rates known to accompany induction of glyoxylate cycle enzymes in Euglena."
https://openalex.org/W1601731316,"Abstract The preparation of a particulate sialyl transferase from rat liver and its properties are described. The enzyme was used, in the presence of cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid-1-14C and asialoceruloplasmin, to prepare substantive quantities of radioactive ceruloplasmin. With a completely desialylated preparation of the protein as acceptor, approximately 70% of the normal complement of N-acetylneuraminic acid was restored, and the reconstituted product was isolated and purified. Upon intravenous injection of this material into a rabbit, essentially all of the radioactivity disappeared from the circulation and was recoverable from the liver. With partially desialylated ceruloplasmin as acceptor, a radioactive preparation was obtained wherein the N-acetylneuraminic acid content approximated 85% that of the native protein. Upon injection of this material, 50% of the labeled ceruloplasmin survived in the serum with a normal half-life of 54 hours. These results are interpreted as indicating that exposure of only a small number of the total galactosyl residues of ceruloplasmin is sufficient to mark the molecule for removal from the circulation by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1551348817,"Abstract The conversions of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) to 3-enolpyruvylshikimate 5-phosphate (ES-5-P) and of N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate (PR-anthranilate) to indole-3-glycerol phosphate (InGP) are catalyzed in vitro by two multienzyme complexes from Neurospora crassa. The rates of the over-all sequential reactions catalyzed by the two complexes were found to be greater than the rates of reactions initiated later in the sequence with known intermediates. Under conditions of saturation with the substrate, the rate of formation of ES-5-P from DAHP was 10 times the rate of formation of ES-5-P from shikimate, and the rate of formation of InGP from PR-anthranilate was twice the rate of formation of InGP from 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate. With both complexes, addition of the intermediate did not increase or inhibit the more rapid over-all reaction rates. We conclude that for the over-all reaction sequences the catalytic efficiencies of the enzymic components are increased in these multienzyme complexes either by a mechanism of intermediate substrate localization or by an activation of enzymic activities. Although these cases of catalytic facilitation in vitro have not as yet been correlated directly with the phenomenon of metabolic compartmentalization or channeling as observed in vivo, the activation of the components of a specific multienzyme complex or the localization of intermediate substrates within a specific complex are both mechanisms by which the cell could effect a compartmentalization or channeling of biochemical intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1672270954,"Abstract The binding of α-keto acids and other dicarboxylic acids to the pyridoxal form of the isozymes of pig heart glutamate-aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) can be studied spectrophotometrically because the absorption of the resultant complexes differs from that of the free enzymes. Spectroscopic and catalytic rate data indicate a correlation of the inhibition of transamination with the affinity of the dicarboxylic acids for the pyridoxal form of the enzymes. Maleate and succinate are the most effective inhibitors of mitochondrial transaminase, whereas succinate, maleate, glutarate, and adipate inhibit the supernatant isozyme. The amino acid erythro-β-hydroxy-l-aspartate forms distinctive binary complexes of unique absorption maxima with either isozyme; the equilibria between these complexes are pH insensitive. Competition of dicarboxylic acids with erythro-β-hydroxy-l-aspartate shows that inhibition by 4- or 5-carbon dicarboxylic acids is accomplished through competition with the amino acid for the pyridoxal (aldimine) and pyridoxamine forms of the supernatant isozyme. In contrast, the mitochondrial isozyme is more highly affected by 4-carbon inhibitors. They compete with the amino acid for the pyridoxal form of the enzyme and also form ternary complexes of the nature enzyme-substrate-dicarboxylic acid. Combination of the keto acid with the enzyme shifts the proton ionization (pK) of the active site chromophore (bound pyridoxal phosphate) to higher pH values in both transaminases. Oxalacetate is much more effective than α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial isozyme. Differences for each isozyme in the effect of the pH on the aspartate-α-ketoglutarate and glutamate-oxalacetate transaminations are explained by preferential binding of oxalacetate to the mitochondrial enzyme and of either α-ketoglutarate or oxalacetate to the supernatant isozyme."

https://openalex.org/W1543398616,"Abstract We have partially purified and characterized a DNA polymerase activity from human KB cells. With the exception of λ DNA, the enzyme utilizes either native or denatured DNA as template and incorporates deoxyribonucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction. Under conditions of limited synthesis the polymerase produces a covalent attachment of the 3' end of the template to the 5' end of the product. In the presence of four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates the polymerase can catalyze at least a 4-fold net synthesis of DNA, and it copies a variety of templates to give products that accurately reflect the base composition of the template. The enzyme has been purified about 400-fold with respect to the specific activity of the crude extract, and the most purified fraction contains no detectable endonuclease activity. A low level of DNA-exonuclease activity is demonstrable under conditions of synthesis, but we have not yet characterized this activity. Like most of the DNA polymerases from animal cells, the KB enzyme directs at a reduced rate the incorporation of nucleotides into DNA in the presence of only three deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. This incorporation is minimized when highly purified λ DNA is used as template, but it remains substantial in comparison with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. This reaction is not due to concurrent pyrophosphorolysis during polymerization or to a combination of the exonuclease with a contaminating nucleoside diphosphokinase activity, and the most purified enzyme fraction has only very low levels of the nuclear and cytoplasmic terminal transferase activities described in calf thymus extracts. Whether this reaction represents a form of repair synthesis, contamination with an unusual type of terminal addition activity, about which nothing is known in human cells, or an intrinsic property of human DNA polymerase remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1550675594,"Abstract Diphtheria toxin is known to catalyze a reversible reaction in which the adenosine diphosphate ribose moiety of NAD is transferred to aminoacyl transferase II, resulting in the concomitant loss of transferase activity in protein synthesis. Some general characteristics of the reaction are reported and a mechanism is proposed. The rate of the reaction is proportional to toxin, aminoacyl transferase II, and NAD concentrations, but, in the presence of excess NAD, the extent of the reaction is dependent only on the amount of aminoacyl transferase II present. ADP ribosylation occurs at all temperatures between 0–40° with a maximum at 20°. The adenosine diphosphoribosylaminoacyl transferase II bond is stable to heating at 90° for 15 min in 5% trichloracetic acid. The following random mechanism for the reaction is proposed on the basis of results from kinetic studies, use of inhibitors of the reaction and isotope exchange reactions, as well as our failure to find a partial reaction. A ternary intermediate composed of toxin, NAD, and aminoacyl transferase II is formed by a series of different binary reactions. The results support the participation of all combinations of binary reactions in the formation of the ternary complex. Toxin is bound to the adenosyl moiety of NAD, as well as to the transfer enzyme. Aminoacyl transferase II is bound to the NMN moiety of NAD. The proposed ternary intermediate consisting of toxin, aminoacyl transferase II, and NAD breaks down rapidly to the final products, adenosine diphosphoribosylaminoacyl transferase II, nicotinamide, and toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1512751297,"Abstract The enzymatic synthesis of tuberculostearic acid (10-methylstearic acid) was catalyzed by extracts of Mycobacterium phlei. This process involved two reactions of the olefinic fatty acid chain of phospholipids. The chain was first alkylenated at the 10-carbon to give a methylene group, which was subsequently reduced to a methyl group. The first reaction could be measured by using S-adenosylmethionine-methyl-14C. The enzyme was found in the supernatant fraction when extracts of cells broken by sonic oscillation were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 x g. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine was the only effective donor of the 1-carbon unit. Phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine were substrates for the reaction, and both 16- and 18-carbon chains were alkylenated although only the Δ9-olefinic chains appeared to be converted. The enzyme acted upon chains at either position 1 or 2 of the glyceride molecule. Several detergents had little effect on the rate of the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1595878159,"Abstract The mechanism of inhibition of gluconeogenesis by pent-4-enoic acid was studied in isolated perfused rat livers. One millimolar pent-4-enoic acid decreased gluconeogenesis from alanine by 80% and ketogenesis from linoleate by 95% and markedly increased the concentration of the gluconeogenic intermediates from lactate to 3-phosphoglycerate and decreased the concentrations of the intermediates from d-glyceraldehyde-P to glucose-6-P. This was associated with a marked decrease in the tissue lactate-pyruvate ratio and only a 20% decrease in the ATP concentration. These data suggest that gluconeogenesis was inhibited at glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, probably as a result of decreased NADH generation from fatty acid oxidation. Another point of inhibition was present at pyruvate carboxylase, as indicated by the excessive elevation of the tissue pyruvate concentrations and by the marked decrease of the acetyl-CoA concentrations. The inhibition at pyruvate carboxylase was, however, not rate-limiting. When 8.0 mm ethanol was added after 10 min of prior perfusion with 1.0 mm pentenoic acid, ketone body production remained inhibited while gluconeogenesis from alanine was restored. It was thus possible to maintain relatively normal rates of gluconeogenesis from alanine in spite of almost complete inhibition of long chain fatty acid oxidation. Under these conditions the return toward normal of the lactate-pyruvate ratio showed that ethanol metabolism provided sufficient NADH for restoration of gluconeogenesis. When 8.0 mm ethanol was added after prior perfusion with 1.0 mm pentenoic acid for more than 10 min, the inhibition at glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase was still reversed, but gluconeogenesis remained inhibited because of inhibition at pyruvate carboxylase because of the decreased acetyl-CoA concentration. In experiments in which ethanol was added after a period of prior perfusion with pentenoic acid, the rate-limiting step for gluconeogenesis appeared to be at pyruvate carboxylase. Since varying rates of gluconeogenesis were obtained depending on the period of prior perfusion with pentenoic acid, it was possible to correlate the rate of gluconeogenesis with the tissue acetyl-CoA concentration. A sigmoidal relationship was obtained with an apparent activation constant for acetyl-CoA of 1.8 x 10-5 m, which agrees well with the value obtained for rat liver pyruvate carboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1576010951,"Abstract At 0°, native tetrameric rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (7.4 S) undergoes a reversible inactivation and dissociation into 4.4 S dimers or 3.2 S monomers, depending upon the species of salt present and upon the protein concentration. These dissociation processes have been studied using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. With 0.10 mg per ml of enzyme in 0.15 m ammonium sulfate, 4.4 S dimers predominate; with 0.05 mg per ml of enzyme in 0.15 m KCl, 3.2 S monomers predominate. At other protein concentrations in the two systems, mixtures are produced. KCl gives greater dissociation at all protein concentrations. It also destabilizes at high salt concentrations (1.0 to 2.5 m). In contrast, destabilization in ammonium sulfate is maximal at 0.15 m; 0.5 and 1.0 m ammonium sulfate stabilize against dissociation essentially completely. The native enzyme in the absence of salts shows very slow, very slight dissociation into dimers. Inactivation and dissociation do not occur at 23° in 0.15 m ammonium sulfate and only slightly in 0.15 m KCl, and then only at very low protein concentrations. Inactivation and dissociation are reversed by warming to 23° and greater than 80% of the activity is recovered. The reversible dissociation and inactivation occur at both pH 7.0 (0.1 m imidazole) and at pH 9.5 (0.2 m glycine). A reducing agent (0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol) has to be present for activity to be recovered. These data prove that this enzyme at 0° exists as an equilibrium mixture which favors association to tetramers at high protein concentrations and dissociation into dimers or monomers or both at low protein concentrations. The dimers and monomers appear to be fairly compact."

Direct proof for the participation of enzyme-bound NAD+ in this reaction was provided by spectrophotometric observation of enzyme-NADH, as well as by tritium incorporation from TDP-6-deoxy-d-glucose specifically labeled at carbon 4 of the glucose moiety with tritium. Hydrogen transfer Reactions 1 and 3 mediated by enzyme-bound coenzyme were found to have B stereospecificity with respect to the nicotinamide moiety. Formation of enzyme-NADH was accompanied by a proportional decrease of enzymatic activity. Conversely, upon incubation of TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose with enzyme-NADH, enzyme-NAD+ was obtained, resulting in restoration of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1570401369,"Abstract Mitochondria from Euglena gracilis have been examined for the possible absence of a phosphorylation coupling site and of b type cytochromes. Mitochondria from cells grown on glutamate + malate as carbon source are shown by site-specific assays to contain coupling sites analogous to Sites I, II, and III of the mammalian respiratory chain. An alternate pathway, relatively specific for oxidation of lactate and NADH, is able to bypass the antimycin-sensitive site. The lowered phosphorylation efficiency associated with this pathway suggests that it involves one less than the normal number of coupling sites. In the absence of antimycin, oxidation of lactate involves at least two coupling sites in these mitochondria. Low temperature difference spectra provide evidence for the presence of seven substrate-reducible cytochrome components in Euglena mitochondria, including components analogous to a and a3 of mammalian cytochrome oxidase, two c type cytochromes, and three b types. One of these may bind CO and cyanide; another resembles mammalian cytochrome b."
https://openalex.org/W1591032640,"Abstract An enzyme which converts retinal to retinoic acid was purified from rat intestinal mucosa approximately 160-fold via a combination of acetone precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography. The purified preparation appeared to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge, on ion exchange chromatography, and on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was approximately 80,000 and its isoelectric point was in the neighborhood of 6.7. The enzyme preparation contained approximately 2 moles of iron per mole of enzyme. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme indicated a maximum at 280 mµ and a much smaller band around 410 mµ. Purified retinal-oxidizing enzyme from rat intestinal mucosa stoichiometrically and irreversibly converted retinal to retinoic acid. The latter was identified as the product of the reaction by ultraviolet absorption spectrum, thin layer chromatography, and gas chromatography. The product was approximately 96% pure as determined by its E1%1 cm value. The enzymatic reaction exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of approximately 3.0 x 10-4 m. The rate of the reaction was constant for 120 min, directly proportional to the enzyme concentration, and maximal when GSH, NAD, FAD, and Fe2+ were added. The pH optimum was approximately 7.7. The reaction proceeded well under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The enzyme acted upon both the all-trans and 13-cis forms of retinal. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide noncompetitively inhibited the reaction and was found to exhibit a control over the utilization of retinal in vitro. Thiols and metal ions stimulated the reaction, while thiol inhibitors and chelators inhibited the reaction. It is suggested that retinal-oxidizing enzyme is a metalloprotein which requires sulfhydryl groups for maximal enzymic activity.

Present studies extend the above work to temperatures below 77° K, and demonstrate the existence of at least two species of EPR signal arising from iron-sulfur protein in this region of the respiratory chain. The previously unrecognized EPR signal is detectable only below ∼30° K, with g values at gx = 1.89, gy = 1.93 to 1.94, gz = 2.05. Both species of iron-sulfur protein EPR signal are suggested to be located on the substrate side of the piericidin A inhibition site in the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W1544563976,"Abstract The kinetic properties of a glutaraldehyde-modified phosphorylase b have been examined to understand further the mechanism of allosteric transition of this enzyme. The sigmoidal response to AMP, which is observed with native glycogen phosphorylase b, cannot be demonstrated with the modified enzyme. This enzyme derivative also exhibits no homotropic cooperativity of glucose 1-phosphate under conditions for which native phosphorylase b gives rise to sigmoidal saturation curves. The conditions include (a) use of inosine monophosphate instead of AMP as activator and (b) the presence of various inhibitors, glucose, glucose-6-P, or 2',3'cyclic AMP. In contrast to homotropic cooperativity, the heterotropic interactions which are characteristic of native phosphorylase b can be demonstrated with the glutaraldehyde-modified enzyme. The Km values of the substrates, glucose-1-P, phosphate, and glycogen depend on the concentration of AMP. For instance, when AMP concentration is raised from 0.0125 to 1 mm, a decrease in Km of glucose-1-P from 13.7 to 6.6 mm can be observed. When IMP is used instead of AMP, the Km of glucose-1-P for the modified enzyme has been found to be 0.067 m irrespective of the nucleotide concentration. This result supports the view that the major difference between AMP and IMP activation of phosphorylase b is that only AMP enhances the enzyme affinity toward the substrate. In addition to the interactions between the nucleotide activators and substrates, negative heterotropic interactions between the inhibitors, glucose, glucose-6-P, or cyclic AMP and the substrate glucose-1-P can also be demonstrated in the glutaraldehyde-modified phosphorylase b. Thus, only homotropic cooperativity in glycogen phosphorylase b is desensitized by glutaraldehyde modification. The selectivity in the desensitization indicates that homotropic and heterotropic interactions in this enzyme are not linked functions. This property of the enzyme cannot be explained on the basis of the concerted model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (J. Mol. Biol., 12, 88 (1965)); this model assumes that the two types of interactions are closely linked. The demonstration of heterotropic interactions in the absence of homotropic interactions does not, however, conflict with the predictions of the sequential model of Koshland, Nemethy, and Filmer (Biochemistry, 5,365 (1966))."

https://openalex.org/W1496748316,"Abstract The formation of a ternary complex between diphtheria toxin, transferase II (the peptidyl transfer RNA translocation factor), and diphosphopyridine nucleotide has been demonstrated by ultracentrifugation analyses. The complex has a s20,w value of 6.8 S and a molecular weight of 114,000. The reaction is specific for DPN+, and the complex is stoichiometric with respect to all three components. Experiments with labeled DPN+ indicate the participation of the complete coenzyme molecule in the formation of the complex. Transferase II is inhibited by diphtheria toxin only in the presence of DPN+. The complex-associated transferase II does not interact with or bind to ribosomes; however, preliminary evidence suggests that ribosome-bound transferase II is protected against the inactivation by diphtheria toxin and DPN+."
https://openalex.org/W1591128854,"Abstract Some physical properties of r(I-C)n and r(G-C)n copolymers have been studied. Both copolymers exhibit a strictly alternating sequence, as determined by nearest neighbor analysis. At low ionic strengths, r(I-C)n is highly sensitive to nuclease attack, while r(G-C)n is very resistant. r(I-C)n has a Tm of 49.5° in 0.1 m Na+, and r(G-C)n has a Tm of approximately 92° in 1 mm Na+. Both alternating copolymers melt below their homologous homopolymer pairs, (rI)n·(rC)n and (rG)n·(rC)n. The melting behavior of the polymers studied is probably attributable to the existence of weaker base stacking interactions in the alternating copolymers than in the homopolymer pairs. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of helical r(I-C)n closely resembles that of the deoxyanalogue, d(I-C)n, and is unlike that of helical (rI)n·(rC)n. Helical r(G-C)n has a spectrum like that of helical (rG)n·(rC)n; a shoulder characteristic of G-C pairs is noted at approximately 280 to 290 mµ. Coil form r(I-C)n has a spectrum similar to that of coil form (rI)n·(rC)n. Coil form r(G-C)n has a spectrum resembling that of a 1:1 mixture of GMP + CMP. Procedures for the purification of r(I-C)n copolymer and for the separation of r(G-C)n product from the r(I-C)n template are described."
https://openalex.org/W1662896343,"Abstract Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium LT-2 catalyzes an exchange between 14C-AMP and ATP in the absence of added ribose 5-phosphate. The exchange reaction requires Mg++ ions and low concentrations of inorganic phosphate in addition to the substrates. High concentrations of inorganic phosphate (which stimulate over-all PRPP synthesis and inhibit the over-all reverse reaction) inhibit the exchange reaction. Low concentrations (0.2 mm) of ribose 5-phosphate stimulate the exchange reaction from 10- to 55-fold depending on the pH of the reaction mixture, but higher concentrations are strongly inhibitory. The Km values for the substrates are not substantially altered by ribose 5-phosphate stimulation. PRPP synthetase also catalyzes an exchange between 14C-ribose 5-phosphate and PRPP in the absence of added adenine nucleotides. The Mg++ and phosphate requirements for this exchange reaction are similar to those of the AMP-ATP exchange reaction. Ribose 5-phosphate-PRPP exchange is stimulated more than 200-fold by low concentrations (0.1 mm) of AMP, but is strongly inhibited by higher concentrations of AMP. AMP stimulation is not a consequence of changes in Km values for the substrates. The maximal rates of the unstimulated AMP-ATP exchange reaction and of the unstimulated ribose 5-phosphate-PRPP exchange reaction are slower than the maximal rate of the over-all reverse reaction of PRPP synthetase, but the rates of the stimulated exchanges are at least as fast as the over-all reactions of PRPP synthetase. Evidence is presented that the unstimulated exchange reactions can occur in the complete absence of the stimulating partner substrates. The results are interpreted as favoring a mechanism in which an enzyme-pyrophosphate intermediate is formed during the PRPP synthesis reaction, but in which this intermediate normally occurs in a ternary complex with AMP or ribose 5-phosphate (or both) noncovalently bound. The stimulation of exchange by AMP and ribose 5-phosphate is viewed as an example of substrate synergism (Bridger, W. A., Millen, W. A., and Boyer, P. D., Biochemistry, 7, 3608 (1968))."
https://openalex.org/W1567978253,"Abstract A group, 2-acetamide-4-nitrophenol, has been incorporated at the active site sulfhydryl group of each of the four subunits of rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Changes in the spectrum of this group are produced by changes in pH, addition of DPN and DPNH, or addition of adenosine derivatives including adenosine diphosphoribose, ATP, AMP, and cyclic AMP. Below pH 7.8 the environment of the reporter group is apparently more polar than water while at higher pH there is a shift of the group to a less polar environment. This pH-dependent transition is consistent with the removal of a proton from a neighboring ionized residue with a pK of about 8.5 and is qualitatively similar to the effects observed with reporter-labeled chymotrypsin. Binding of DPN or DPNH also produces a shift of the reporter group to a nonpolar environment, although the changes are different for the two compounds. The alterations in Kdis, subunit interactions, and spectral properties of the reporter-labeled enzyme suggest that the perturbation of the reporter group is due to changes in conformation of the enzyme. The other adenosine compounds are also shown to bind to the enzyme and produce a shift in the spectrum of the reporter group. ATP is unique in that it is tightly bound to two sites on the enzyme but does not compete effectively with DPN. The properties of the reporter-labeled enzyme appear to correspond to those of the normal acyl enzyme intermediate and thus it provides a useful tool for studying the properties of this intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1603002844,"Abstract When a purified bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase was polarographically assayed by a method involving initial contact of the enzyme with Tween 80, very high turnover numbers were observed at low enzyme concentrations, e.g. 5 to 10 mµm cytochrome a3. When substrate-reduced enzyme was treated with bathocuproine, the high turnover numbers at low enzyme concentrations were abolished but could be recovered by further treatment of the inhibited enzyme with Cui. This new form of inhibition of the enzyme, called the bathocuproine effect, is ascribed to an interference by the reagent of enzyme dissociation to a unit aggregate of maximal activity. The effect is not due to copper depletion of cytochrome c oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1574415835,"Abstract r(G-C)n is the alternating copolymer of guanylic and cytidylic residues synthesized in an RNA polymerase-catalyzed reaction in which r(I-C)n or d(I-C)n copolymer serves as template. When r(I-C)n copolymer serves as template, synthesis of r(G-C)n occurs at a rate approximately 20% that found for r(I-C)n-directed r(I-C)n synthesis. Net synthesis of r(G-C)n can be obtained in an r(I-C)n-directed reaction, but separation of r(I-C)n template and r(G-C)n product is difficult and results in poor yields of purified r(G-C)n. r(G-C)n is incapable of serving as template for r(I-C)n or r(G-C)n synthesis; in fact, r(G-C)n inhibits unprimed r(I-C)n synthesis. Any synthesis of r(I-C)n found in a reaction mixture in which r(G-C)n is being tested for template activity can be attributed to the presence of small amounts of r(I-C)n contaminating the r(G-C)n preparation. r(I-C)n-directed r(G-C)n synthesis is supported by Mn++ or Mg++, and the rate of synthesis drops sharply with temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1498263582,"Abstract Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulated the oxidation of 2-ketoglutarate-1-14C to 14CO2 by isolated rat epididymal adipose tissue. The results of further studies indicated that this effect of ACTH was mediated by an increase in adipose tissue cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate which is known to result from an action of the hormone. Caffeine, an inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase which degrades cyclic AMP, in high concentration (10 mm), stimulated 2-ketoglutarate oxidation and, in lower concentration (0.5 mm), potentiated the ACTH effect. An acyl derivative of cyclic AMP, N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (dibutyryl-cAMP) stimulated 2-ketoglutarate oxidation. Phentolamine, a drug known to block the lipolytic effect of cyclic AMP, inhibited ACTH-stimulated 2-ketoglutarate oxidation. The relationship between ACTH effects upon 2-ketoglutarate oxidation and lipid metabolism was also studied. ACTH stimulated the incorporation of 3H from glucose-1-3H into total lipid, presumably reflecting enhanced fatty acid esterification known to result from ACTH action. The hormone inhibited incorporation of label into fatty acid. The enhanced synthetic activity could deplete stores of high energy compounds and indirectly stimulate oxidative processes necessary to replete the high energy stores. The findings did not support this possibility. Caffeine and phentolamine each inhibited incorporation of glucose-3H into total lipid, while stimulating 2-ketoglutarate oxidation. Caffeine inhibited the effect of ACTH upon total lipid synthesis, but potentiated the hormone stimulation of 2-ketoglutarate oxidation. Dibutyryl-cAMP stimulated 2-ketoglutarate oxidation in proportion to the nucleotide concentration over the concentration range of 1 to 10 mm. A lower concentration of dibutyryl-cAMP (0.3 mm) stimulated total lipid synthesis, but the effect of the nucleotide diminished as its concentration was increased. Inhibition of lipid synthesis was observed when the dibutyryl-cAMP concentration was 10 mm. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose suppressed lipogenesis, but did not alter 2-ketoglutarate oxidation by ACTHor dibutyryl-cAMP-stimulated tissues. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) presumably depleted high energy stores by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. This was reflected in almost completely inhibited lipogenesis. DNP only moderately stimulated 2-ketoglutarate oxidation, however. ACTH and dibutyryl-cAMP each stimulate lipolysis of adipose tissue triglycerides. Others have suggested that the fatty acids produced by this action might uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and thereby indirectly stimulate oxidative processes. This possibility is also considered unlikely. As noted above, DNP only moderately (in comparison to the other agents tested) stimulated 2-ketoglutarate oxidation. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose inhibited fatty acid reesterification, and presumably caused tissue free fatty acid levels to rise. In spite of this, no increase in 2-ketoglutarate oxidation was observed when 2-deoxy-d-glucose was added alone, or in the presence of ACTH or dibutyryl-cAMP. DNP suppressed the stimulatory effects of ACTH and of dibutyryl-cAMP upon 2-ketoglutarate oxidation."

The labeled carbon in each of the three compounds was incorporated into position C-2 of uracil. In addition, NaH14CO3 was incorporated into carbamylaspartate, orotic acid, and 3'-UMP and 3'-CMP of RNA. Exogenously added carbamylaspartate inhibited the formation of orotic acid from bicarbonate. Carbamylaspartate was converted to orotic acid, and both of these compounds were incorporated into 3'-UMP and 3'-CMP of skin RNA."
