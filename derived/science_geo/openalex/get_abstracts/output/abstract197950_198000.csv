There have been no studies regarding the nature of the ribonucleic acids that are lost during isolation, but it has tacitly been assumed that those which are lost have the same properties as those which are isolated. In the procedure of Crestfield, Smith, and Allen (I), 60 to 70 per cent of the ribonucleic acids from bakers’ yeast is isolated by a final precipitation from a 1 M solution of sodium chloride at 0”. 10 to 20 per cent of the total ribonucleic acids of the yeast is soluble in a 1 M solution of sodium chloride, together with certain proteins and deoxyribonucleic acids. The present communication deals with the isolation, purification, and characterization of the ribonucleic acids which are soluble in sodium chloride, and also describes the isolation and certain properties of a fifth nucleotide component which became evident in studying the action of ribonuclease on these ribonucleic acids.

It was of interest, therefore, to test the effect of an oxidizing agent on the fermentation of NA. One may in this manner force the accumulation of a more oxidized compound which may be an intermediate in the fermentation or may be derived from an intermediate. The oxidation of NA by methylene blue to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (HNA), catalyzed by a nicotinic acid-fermenting organism, is the subject of this report."

https://openalex.org/W98688847,"In an earlier report (l), we described the preparation, from sheep thyroid glands, of a particulate fraction consisting primarily of mitochondria and microsomes, which, when incubated with carrier-free radioactive iodide, converted as much as 30 per cent of the added 1131 to labeled iodoprotein. This thyroid particulate fraction differed from the cell-free thyroid preparations used by other workers (2,3) in the following respects: (1) it was active in the absence of added tyrosine and oxidizing agents; and (2) the major product formed was iodoprotein, not free iodotyrosine. In experiments in which the iodine metabolism of the particulate fraction was compared with that of thyroid slices, it was observed that the particulate preparation had a much lower capacity to utilize added carrier iodide; moreover, iodination by the particulate fraction led to the formation of an iodinated protein containing P31 almost exclusively in the form of monoiodotyrosine, whereas the iodinated protein formed by the slice contained almost as much P31-diiodotyrosine as 1131-monoiodotyrosine. The present report deals with our attempts to enhance the iodinating activity of the thyroid particulate fraction. It was found that the capacity of the particulate system to convert added iodide to iodoprotein could be greatly increased by adding flavin cofactors or by increasing the pH of the incubation medium, but in both instances the newly formed iodoprotein still contained 1131 almost exclusively in the form of monoiodotyrosine."

https://openalex.org/W2078296884,"THE Hausa-speaking farmers and Fulani cattle owners who live in the savannah regions of Northern Nigeria make free use of the leaves and fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata Linn.). The leaves, either fresh or dried and pulverized, are used in the soup which is poured over the dish of porridge made from guineacorn (sorghum) or millet (pennisetum and eleusine) flour. During the season while the fruit of the tree is ripe, from February to April depending on the latitude, the pulp is removed from the fibres and seeds by kneading in cold water and then passing the emulsion through a sieve. The resulting white or whitish-yellow fluid (Hausa—gubdi) is used by the farmers to dilute the thick guineacorn dough (fura) to a thin gruel (kunu), which is the traditional morning or midday meal. The cattle-owning Fulani use the emulsion to adulterate milk. This milk and baobab fruit juice mixture is a popular drink with the Hausa farmer, and is available, if he has money to buy it, at a hot time of the year when new farms are being cleared, or hoeing of old farms is taking place, preparatory to sowing. The kernels of the seeds are used to make into a cake for flavouring soup."

https://openalex.org/W204314577,"Although the intensity of the biological response to experimentally administered corticoids is known to vary widely, the relationship of the route by which a hormone is administered to its metabolism and physiological action is poorly understood. Porter and Silber (1) have described the varying glycogenic activity of cortisone, hydrocortisone, and their acetates after subcutaneous and intramuscular administration to rats. Bradlow et al. (2) reported different patterns of tritium excretion after intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection of cortisone-T in mice. However, Bocklage and coworkers (3) found essentially no difference in the amounts of Cl4 excreted or in pathways of excretion after intramuscular or intragastric administration of cortisone-4-Cl4 acetate to rats. Wyngaarden et al. (4, 5) found the physiological disposition of radioactivity after subcutaneous injection of hydrocortisone-4-Cl4 in rats to be the same as that reported for cortisone-4-Cl4 acetate (3) and ll-dehydrocorticosterone21-Cl4 (6). Since the liver is the major site of inactivation of the glucocorticoids in rodents (7-15)) the rate of absorption and of transport of these compounds to that organ should affect the amount of metabolic activity elicited. Only after hydrocortisone-4-Cl4 of sufficient specific activity (4 PC. per mg.) became available could relatively physiological quantities (50 7) of this hormone be given to animals in order to determine the metabolic pathways. These studies were initiated to ascertain whether the route of administration of the radiosteroid affects its metabolism. The intravenous, intramuscular, sublingual, and intragastric routes were chosen because these are the ones usually available for therapeusis and because they had not been studied at the same dose level before. Reabsorption of the biliary radiometabolites was investigated in animals with bile fistulas to learn whether enterohepatic circulation is a factor in the metabolism of radiohy-"

Previous investigations1–3 have shown that the reaction is rather involved, requiring the participation of a reducing agent (reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide), molecular oxygen and several enzymes."
