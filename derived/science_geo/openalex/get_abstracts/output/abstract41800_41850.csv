https://openalex.org/W1523078822,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is an intracellular second messenger, produced upon stimulation of the phosphoinositide system, capable of mobilizing calcium from intracellular stores. We have recently identified high levels of specific binding sites for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in brain membranes (Worley, P. F., Baraban, J. M., Colvin, J. S., and Snyder, S. H. (1987) Nature 325, 159-161) and have now further characterized these sites. In cerebellar membranes, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding sites are abundant (20 pmol/mg protein) and display high affinity and selectivity for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (KD approximately equal to 40 nM), whereas other inositol phosphates such as inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ki approximately equal to 10 microM) and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ki approximately equal to 10 microM) exhibit much lower affinity for this site. Submicromolar concentrations of calcium strongly inhibit inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding (IC50 approximately equal to 300 nM). A sharp increase in binding occurs at slightly alkaline pH. These results suggest that actions of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate are regulated by physiological alterations in intracellular pH and calcium concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1509513505,"The catalysis by iron of radical formation and subsequent oxidative damage has been well documented. Although many iron-chelating agents potentiate reactive oxygen formation and lipid peroxidation, phytic acid (abundant in edible legumes, cereals, and seeds) forms an iron chelate which greatly accelerates Fe2+-mediated oxygen reduction yet blocks iron-driven hydroxyl radical generation and suppresses lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, high concentrations of phytic acid prevent browning and putrefaction of various fruits and vegetables by inhibiting polyphenol oxidase. These observations indicate an important antioxidant function for phytate in seeds during dormancy and suggest that phytate may be a substitute for presently employed preservatives, many of which pose potential health hazards."
https://openalex.org/W1553348486,"The Ca2+-activated actin-binding protein gelsolin regulates actin filament length by severing preformed filaments and by binding actin monomers, stabilizing nuclei for their assembly into filaments. Gelsolin binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), with consequent inhibition of its filament severing activity and dissociation of EGTA-resistant complexes made with rabbit macrophage or human plasma gelsolin and rabbit muscle actin. This study provides evidence for an interaction of gelsolin with phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) as well as PIP2 and further describes their effects on gelsolin's function. Both phosphoinositides completely dissociate EGTA-insensitive rabbit macrophage cytoplasmic gelsolin-actin complexes and inhibit gelsolin's severing activity. The magnitude of inhibition depends strongly on the physical state of the phosphoinositides, being maximal in preparations that contain small micelles of either purified PIP or PIP2. Aggregation of PIP or PIP2 micelles by divalent cations or insufficient sonication or their incorporation into vesicles containing other phospholipids decreases but does not eliminate the inhibitory properties of the polyphosphoinositides. The presence of gelsolin partly inhibits the divalent cation-induced aggregation of PIP2 micelles. PIP2 in combination with EGTA inactivates gelsolin molecules that block the fast-growing end of actin filaments, thereby accelerating actin polymerization. Regulation of gelsolin by the intracellular messengers Ca2+ and polyphosphoinositides allows for the formation of several different gelsolin-actin intermediates with distinct functional properties that may be involved in changes in the state of cytoplasmic actin following cell stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1557143803,"The human chorionic gonadotropin-alpha (CG-alpha) gene is transcriptionally activated by cAMP. Sequencing the CG-alpha 5'-flanking region identified two copies of a palindrome, 5'-TGACGTCA-3', homologous to sequences in other cAMP-responsive genes. The two palindromes are contained within two identical 18-base pair (bp) sequences arranged as adjacent direct repeats. One or two synthetic copies of the 18-bp sequences were inserted into plasmids containing either the CG-alpha promoter or the SV40 promoter directing transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The 36-bp (double) element markedly enhanced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in placental choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cells when inserted in either orientation both 5' to the cap site or 3' of the coding sequence, thus defining it as an enhancer. Moreover, 8-br-cAMP stimulated the enhancer activity 30-40-fold. A single 18-bp element also stimulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, although 5-fold less than the double element, but still imparted a 35-fold transcriptional cAMP responsivity. The enhancer activates its homologous promoter much more efficiently than the SV40 promoter in JEG-3 cells. The alpha-promoter is not nearly as receptive to activation by the enhancer in baby hamster kidney fibroblasts, whereas the more modest enhancement of the SV40 promoter is less cell-specific. These studies suggest that the interaction of a 36-bp enhancer-like element with the homologous promoter represents part of the mechanism of cell-specific expression of the CG-alpha gene and that the enhancer is co-localized with a highly effective cAMP-response element."
https://openalex.org/W1605514660,"Respiratory defective pet mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae assigned to complementation group G5 are deficient in fumarase. A representative mutant from this complementation group was used to clone a nuclear gene (FUM1) whose sequence encodes a protein homologous to bacterial fumarase. Based on the primary structure homology and the elevated levels of fumarase in transformants harboring FUM1 on a multicopy plasmid, this gene is concluded to code for yeast fumarase. In wild type yeast, fumarase is detected in both mitochondria and the soluble postribosomal protein fraction. Several lines of evidence indicate that the two compartmentally distinct fumarases are isoenzyme products of FUM1. Mutations in FUM1 simultaneously abolish both activities. Transformation of a fumarase mutant with a plasmid containing FUM1 leads to increased fumarase activity in mitochondria and in the postribosomal supernatant fraction. Transformation of the same mutant with a plasmid construct in which the region of FUM1 coding for the amino-terminal 17 amino acids of fumarase is deleted results in a preferential increase of nonmitochondrial fumarase. Northern and S1 nuclease analysis of fumarase transcripts in wild type yeast and in a mutant transformed with FUM1 on an episomal plasmid indicate that the gene is transcribed from multiple start sites, some of which are located inside the coding sequence. The major transcript presumed to code for mitochondrial fumarase has a 5'-untranslated leader of 185 nucleotides. The most abundant shorter transcripts have 5' termini from 57 to 68 nucleotides downstream of the first ATG; their translation products lacking the amino-terminal mitochondrial import signal are proposed to target fumarase to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2168763159,"Photoaffinity labeling of isolated triads and purified dihydropyridine receptor with [3H]azidopine and (+)-[3H]PN200-110 has been used to identify and characterize the dihydropyridine-binding subunit of the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor of rabbit skeletal muscle. The 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor purified from rabbit skeletal muscle triads contains four protein subunits of 175,000, 170,000, 52,000, and 32,000 Da (Leung, A., Imagawa, T., and Campbell, K. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7943-7946). Photoaffinity labeling of isolated triads with [3H]azidopine resulted in specific and covalent incorporation of [3H]azidopine into only the 170,000-Da subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor and not into the 175,000-Da glycoprotein subunit of the receptor. The [3H]azidopine-labeled 170,000-Da subunit was separated from the 175,000-Da glycoprotein subunit by sequential elution from a wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate followed by 200 mM N-acetylglucosamine. Photoaffinity labeling of purified dihydropyridine receptor with [3H]azidopine or (+)-[3H]PN200-110 also resulted in the specific and covalent incorporation of either ligand into only the 170,000-Da subunit. Therefore, our results show that the dihydropyridine-binding subunit of the skeletal muscle 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor is the 170,000-Da subunit and not the 175,000-Da glycoprotein subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1593521639,"Endothelial cells express the product of the c-sis gene, which encodes the B-chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Through local production of growth factors such as PDGF in vascular sites, endothelial cells may stimulate proliferation of adjacent cells through a paracrine mechanism. Previously, we have shown that the expression of c-sis mRNA and release of growth factor activity by human renal endothelial cells is induced by thrombin. We now show that another agent of possible importance in mediating proliferation of cells adjacent to the endothelial cell layer, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), also induced c-sis expression in these cells. In addition, we have studied the effect of agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels upon the induction of endothelial cell c-sis mRNA. The adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and norepinephrine blocked the elevation of cellular c-sis mRNA accompanying exposure to either thrombin or TGF-beta. This effect was mediated through beta-adrenergic receptors, since propranolol but not phentolamine reversed the inhibition. Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, also blocked induction of c-sis mRNA by thrombin and TGF-beta and inhibited the release of PDGF activity into the media of these cells. Basal, as well as stimulated c-sis mRNA levels were attenuated by these agents that increase cellular cAMP levels. These data suggest that increased cAMP production inhibits the expression of c-sis encoded mitogens by endothelial cells, and that c-sis expression is subject to bidirectional regulation in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589859267,"A real-time study of the initiation of the respiratory burst in human neutrophils was made. The cells were stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) C5a, platelet-activating factor, leukotriene B4, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or ionomycin, and H2O2 production was determined by chemiluminescence. Identical average onset times (2.4 s) and closely comparable values for the apparent first-order rate constant (kapp) for the induction of NADPH-oxidase activity (0.21-0.29 s-1) were obtained following stimulation with fMLP, C5a, platelet-activating factor, or leukotriene B4, suggesting that different agonists act through a common transduction sequence. Much longer onset times and lower kapp values were obtained upon stimulation with PMA or ionomycin. Pretreatment with PMA consistently shortened the onset time of the neutrophil's responses to agonists by about 1 s. When H2O2 production was initiated with PMA, a subsequent stimulation with the agonist fMLP elicited an immediate response (onset time less than 0.2 s) which preceded further changes in fura-2-detected [Ca2+]i. The results are consistent with a mechanism in which agonist signals appear to be transduced by two sequences acting in concert–a rate-limiting one liberating Ca2+ and diacylglycerol and turning on the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C, and an essentially instantaneous one which does not appear to require further changes in cytosolic Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1523697374,"The amino acid sequence of an insect apolipoprotein, apolipophorin-III from Manduca sexta, was determined by a combination of cDNA and protein sequencing. The mature hemolymph protein consists of 166 amino acids. The cDNA also encodes for an amino-terminal extension of 23 amino acids which is not represented in the mature hemolymph protein. The existence of a precursor protein was confirmed by in vitro translation of fat body mRNA. Computer-assisted comparative sequence analysis revealed the following points: 1) the protein is composed of tandemly repeating tetradecapeptide units with a high potential for forming amphiphilic helical structures. Compared to mammalian apolipoproteins the repeat units in the insect apolipoprotein show considerable length variability; 2) the sequence has a striking resemblance to several human apolipoproteins including apoE, AIV, AI, and CI. However, the homology seems to be entirely functional since, although the insect and mammalian apoproteins contain very similar types of amino acid residues, the actual degree of sequence identity is quite low. Whether the mammalian and insect apoproteins are derived from a common ancestral amphiphilic helix forming, lipid-binding protein, or arose by convergent evolution can not be determined at present. This represents the first complete amino acid sequence for an insect apolipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2101449943,"Treatment of hamsters with the beta-agonist isoproterenol caused a dramatic increase in a series of unusual proteins in the parotid and submandibular glands. These proteins are acid soluble and they contain high amounts (mol%) of glutamate plus glutamine (30-35), proline (23-30), and glycine (12-25). Three proteins (HP45, HP43a, and HP43b) were isolated from trichloroacetic acid extracts of parotid glands of isoproterenol-treated hamsters. The basic protein (HP45) was not retained by DEAE-cellulose and did not contain phosphate or carbohydrate. Two acidic proteins (HP43a and HP43b) had the same apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but these were separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. HP43a and HP43b contained 4.3 and 5.7 phosphate residues/mol of protein, respectively. Levels of mRNAs encoding this series of proteins showed striking increases following isoproterenol treatment as determined by cell-free translations and Northern analysis. Feeding tannins to rats and mice mimicks the effects of isoproterenol treatment on the parotid gland (Mehansho, H., Hagerman, A., Clements, S., Butler, L., Rogler, J., and Carlson, D.M. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 3948-3952; Mehansho, H., Clements, S., Sheares, B. T., Smith, S., and Carlson, D. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4418-4423]. However, hamsters on a high tannin diet (2%) did not respond like rats and mice and instead displayed an unusual growth inhibition. Weanling hamsters maintained on a 2% tannin diet initially lost weight for 3 days and then failed to gain weight for up to 6 months when kept on this diet. Essentially a normal growth rate was observed when the tannin-fed hamsters were switched to a normal diet."
https://openalex.org/W1573240638,"We have begun the molecular characterization of genes encoding napin, the 1.7 S embryo-specific storage protein of Brassica napus. Genomic Southern blot analysis indicates that napin is encoded by a multigene family comprised of a minimum of 16 genes. Two DNA fragments containing single napin genes have been recovered from B. napus genomic libraries. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of one member of the napin gene family, gNa. The gene has a simple structure lacking introns and containing the canonical features expected for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The site of the initiation of transcription was determined to be 37 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon by S1 and primer extension analyses. A gene-specific hybridization probe from the 3' non-translated portion of gNa was used to demonstrate transcription of gNa."
https://openalex.org/W2144054900,"As part of our studies on the functional role of the cytoskeleton in exocytosis we have reported (Cheek, T.R., and Burgoyne, R.D. (1986) FEBS Lett. 207, 110-114) that a calcium-independent transient disassembly of cortical actin filaments occurs on activation of the chromaffin cell nicotinic receptor but not when the cell is exposed to 55 mM K+. In order to determine whether this actin disassembly is required, in conjunction with a rise in intracellular Ca2+, to elicit a maximum secretory response from these cells, we have examined the relationship between actin disassembly, the elevation in intracellular Ca2+, and secretion in detail. The results show that the dose dependence of nicotine-induced secretion and actin disassembly are essentially identical with maximal effects at a dose of nicotine that produced a submaximal rise in intracellular Ca2+. Intracellular cAMP, elevated by three independent means, did not inhibit 55 mM K+-induced secretion but inhibited nicotine-induced secretion. Forskolin inhibited actin disassembly while not affecting the rise in intracellular Ca2+. These results demonstrate that a close inter-relationship exists between the secretory response and actin disassembly and provide further evidence suggesting that actin disassembly could be required in addition to the rise in intracellular Ca2+ in order to elicit a maximal secretory response in chromaffin cells. In addition, the results point to a role for cAMP in the regulation of stimulus-induced actin disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W1501910289,"Two cDNA clones isolated from a HepG2 lambda gt11 library encode the classical asialoglycoprotein receptor, H1, as well as a homologous membrane glycoprotein, H2 (Spiess, M., and Lodish, H.F. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 6465-6469). To study the relationship of H2 to H1 and its possible role in receptor-mediated endocytosis of desialyated glycoproteins, we generated anti-peptide antibodies that are specific for each polypeptide. As judged by metabolic labeling of HepG2 cells and specific immunoadsorption, the biosynthesis of H2 is similar to H1 (Schwartz, A.L., and Rup, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11249-11255); H2 is synthesized as a 43,000-dalton precursor polypeptide containing high mannose-type oligosaccharides, that is processed to a 50,000-dalton mature glycoprotein containing complex-type oligosaccharides. Both H1 and H2 have a half-life of approximately 12 h. Trypsin and neuraminidase digestion of intact cells at 4 and 12 degrees C was used to determine that, at steady state, 50-60 percent of both H1 and H2 are on the cell surface. Furthermore, all of the H2 molecules were digested by extracellular neuraminidase in 1 h at 37 degrees C, indicating that all gain access to the plasma membrane. Both H1 and H2 were purified to homogeneity when Triton X-100-solubilized membrane proteins from [35S]cysteine-labeled cells were subjected to affinity chromatography on galactose-agarose. Since we cannot detect a complex between mature H1 and H2, H2 must be a galactose-binding protein. Both quantitative immunoprecipitation of each polypeptide from HepG2 cells and the recovery of purified H1 and H2 from galactose-agarose affinity chromatography indicate that there is 5-6 times more H1 relative to H2. That H2 is a minor species, compared to H1, might explain why it was not observed until a specific antibody was utilized."
https://openalex.org/W1517095984,"Soybean lipoxygenase is a non-heme iron enzyme that catalyzes the hydroperoxidation of linoleic acid by dioxygen. Exposure of ferrous lipoxygenase to nitric oxide yields a species displaying an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum characteristic of a nearly axial S = 3/2 electronic spin system arising from the ferrous-nitrosyl complex. That spectrum is pH-sensitive, reflecting changes in the environment of the metal ion between pH 7 and 11. Addition of ethanol abolishes the effects of pH in a saturable fashion, resulting in a spectrum similar to that seen at pH 7. Exchange of lipoxygenase into H2(17)O leads to no significant line broadening in the low field portion of the spectrum, suggesting no coordination of water. The ferrous enzyme displays greater affinity for NO at pH 9 (where the enzyme is most active) than at pH 7. The binding of linoleic acid is competitive with that of NO at pH 9, but not at pH 7. These results are interpreted in terms of a model including only one iron site for exogenous ligands and an otherwise relatively stable iron coordination environment."
https://openalex.org/W1540796239,"Abstract Previous reports from this laboratory have demonstrated that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors accelerate Na+/H+ exchange in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells and evoke platelet secretion via a pathway involving Na+/H+ exchange. The present studies were designed to examine whether agents that interact with Na+/H+ antiporters also might influence alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-ligand interactions. We observed that Na+ decreases receptor affinity for the agonists epinephrine, norepinephrine, and UK14304 and slightly increases receptor affinity for the antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan in digitonin-solubilized preparations from porcine brain cortex. Increases in [H+] also decrease receptor affinity for agonists and cause either a slight increase or no change in receptor affinity for antagonists. Amiloride analogs accelerate the rate of [3H] yohimbine dissociation from digitonin-solubilized receptors with a relative effectiveness that parallels their ability to block Na+/H+ exchange in other systems. Interestingly, these modulatory effects of Na+,H+ and 5-amino-substituted analogs of amiloride are retained in homogeneous preparations of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor, suggesting that the allosteric-binding sites for these agents are on the receptor-binding protein itself."
https://openalex.org/W1558507319,"The initiator AUC of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) was converted to ACG by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for expression in cultured monkey cells using an SV40 recombinant called SVGT5dhfr26m2. Synthesis of apparently full-length dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein was significantly reduced compared to wild-type, but not entirely abolished, suggesting that the ACG triplet was being utilized for translation initiation. In addition, a truncated form of DHFR was produced, apparently by initiation at the next in-frame AUG downstream. This result was confirmed in vitro. Transcripts of the dhfr sequence were produced by SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG and translated in vitro using reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. The results paralleled those observed in vivo. Synthesis of full-length DHFR was reduced, but not eliminated, and a new species was produced by initiation at an internal site. Amino acid sequence analysis of the products of in vitro translation demonstrated that translation does indeed initiate at the ACG triplet and that it initiates with methionine. Additional mutations were introduced which altered the sequence context of the ACG triplet. Mutation of the translation initiation consensus sequence by substitution of the A residue at position -3, or of the G at +4 resulted in a significant decrease in initiation at the ACG and an increase in the level of the internal initiation product. Thus, translation initiation at a non-AUG triplet depends on a favorable sequence context."
https://openalex.org/W1513011654,"Serum-induced DNA synthesis, as measured by increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation, in Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts was markedly inhibited by exposure of the cells to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin. The inhibition was well correlated with the toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of a membrane GTP-binding protein with Mr = 41,000. The IAP-induced inhibition of cell growth was characterized by the following two features. First, the inhibition was selective to certain growth factors. DNA synthesis in 3T3 cells was supported by a combination of one of the competence factors and a progression factor such as insulin or epidermal growth factor. IAP was inhibitory when thrombin, fibroblast growth factor, prostaglandin F2 alpha, or phosphatidic acid was employed as a competence factor, but was not inhibitory when DNA synthesis was induced by combined addition of cholera toxin or phorbol ester with insulin. Second, IAP-induced inhibition was still observed when the toxin was added to cell culture 1-6 h later than the addition of the IAP-sensitive competence factors, which triggered rapid cellular responses such as adenylate cyclase inhibition, releases of inositol trisphosphate and arachidonic acid, and 45Ca influx within several minutes (Murayama, T., and Ui, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7226-7233; Murayama, T., and Ui, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5522-5529). Thus, IAP substrate GTP-binding protein(s) appears to be involved in the duration of rapid signals or the occurrence of new slow signals which are responsible for growth factor-induced cell proliferation. The site of the involvement may be proximal to protein phosphorylation by phorbol ester-activated and cAMP-dependent kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1534277448,"Abstract alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) deficiency is a hereditary disorder associated with serum alpha 1-AT levels less than 35% of normal. There are two categories of alpha 1-AT genes that cause this state: the deficient alleles, in which alpha 1-AT is present in serum but in low levels, and the null alleles, in which no alpha 1-AT in serum can be attributed to the gene. The present study defines the molecular basis for the alpha 1-AT gene nullGranite Falls, identified and cloned from genomic DNA of an individual with severe alpha 1-AT deficiency and emphysema resulting from the heterozygous inheritance of the nullGranite Falls and Z alpha 1-AT genes. Sequencing of the 5'-flanking region, all five coding exons, and all exon-intron junctions of nullGranite Falls demonstrated it was identical with the common normal M1(Ala213) alpha 1-AT gene, except for two bases: a single deletion in the codon for amino acid Tyr160 of the mature protein and a single base substitution 168 base pairs 5' to exon I. Although no role for the promoter region mutation could be assigned, the coding exon deletion [Tyr(TAC)----(TA-)] resulted in a frameshift causing a stop coding to be formed approximately 44% from the N terminus of the precursor protein. Using oligonucleotide probes to evaluate the family of the index case demonstrated the deletion----frameshift/stop mutation was inherited in an autosomal co-dominant fashion. Thus, although the molecular basis for alpha 1-AT deficiency of the alpha 1-AT null haplotype such as nullGranite Falls is very different from the molecular basis of the more common deficient haplotypes such as Z, the phenotypic consequences of the two genes are similar; i.e. severe alpha 1-AT deficiency and an association of a high risk for the development of emphysema."
https://openalex.org/W1519198040,"We have re-examined, by high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedures, the hydrolysis of 3H-labeled inositol phospholipids in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Previous studies showed no clear correlation between the release of any particular inositol metabolite and the calcium signal in these cells. Paradoxically no responses were observed when the cells were stimulated with the antigen, aggregated ovalbumin, in the absence of external Ca2+. We report here that in the absence of external Ca2+ aggregation of the IgE receptor by agents other than aggregated ovalbumin causes the release of small amounts of [3H]inositol phosphates and a small increase in levels of cytosol Ca2+ (approximately 25 nM). The response, however, varied with the type of stimulant used. Within seconds after addition of 24 mol of dinitrophenol conjugated with 1 mol of bovine serum albumin to cells primed with dinitrophenol-specific IgE there was a small burst in release of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, and [3H]inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate which was followed by a gradual rise in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate. Eventually, all inositol phosphates reached different steady state levels which were maintained for at least 40 min. In contrast, the initial response to oligomeric IgE, which aggregates receptors at a relatively slow rate, was muted although the subsequent development of the response was the same. The levels of inositol pentakisphosphate and hexakisphosphate remained unchanged. These and other studies with cell extracts support the conclusion that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a putative messenger for release of intracellular Ca2+, was converted to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and thence to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Both trisphosphate metabolites were dephosphorylated in sequential fashion by phosphatase enzymes in the cytosolic and membrane fractions. However, the appearance of several isomers of inositol monophosphates and bisphosphates suggested that degradation proceeded through multiple pathways in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1568361931,"The nucleotide sequence of the gene for folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase (folC) has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence codes for a protein of Mr 45,380 and contains regions with homology to the A and B regions of ATP-binding sites. The folC gene is adjacent to a gene located 70 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon for folC. The nucleotide sequence of this upstream gene was also determined. Deletion of the upstream gene sequences from recombinant plasmids containing the folC gene results in about a 100-fold decrease in plasmid-dependent folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity, suggesting that the major promoter for folC is 5' to the upstream gene. The upstream gene codes for a protein of Mr 33,346, which is expressed in maxicells and amplified in cells containing the upstream gene in recombinant pUC8 plasmids. Expression of the upstream gene in maxicells was greater than that of folC, as determined by the intensity of 35S-labeled proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. A region of dyad symmetry exists between the coding sequences of the two genes which may code for a transcription termination signal and be responsible for the attenuation of the expression of the folC gene relative to the upstream gene. The folC gene is located about 1 kilobase upstream of the purF gene region at 50 min on the Escherichia coli map. The function of the upstream gene product is unknown. It contains sequences with homology to metal-binding domains in nucleic acid-binding proteins. A new purification procedure for obtaining large quantities of folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase is described."
https://openalex.org/W1567897268,"A 9.7-kilobase pair segment of the Escherichia coli chromosome spanning the hisT and purF loci has been characterized. Six genes were identified in this region by complete DNA sequence analysis, in vivo expression in maxicells, and RNA transcript analysis. S1 nuclease analysis has demonstrated that some of these genes are part of the hisT or purF operons. Two of the newly identified genes, dedA and dedB, were localized immediately downstream of hisT in the hisT operon. Two other genes, denoted dedC and dedD, have been localized between the hisT and purF operons. The other two genes, dedE and dedF flank the purF gene. dedE has been previously described as the first gene in the purF operon (Makaroff, C.A., and Zalkin, H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10378-10387). dedF was localized downstream from purF and is part of the purF operon. In addition, dedF is homologous to the ubiX gene of Salmonella typhimurium. Adjacent to dedF is the E. coli homologue of the S. typhimurium argT locus encoding the lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein. All of the genes in this region of the chromosome were found to be transcribed in a counter-clockwise direction on the E. coli map which revises the direction of purF transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2118298665,"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a singlecell organism whose process of mating provides an excellent opportunity to study cell-cell interactions and response to diffusible factors. In this process, two partners of opposite type (a and a) fuse to produce a diploid cell. Each partner produces a peptide mating factor (a-factor or a-factor) that acts on the opposite cell type to prepare cells for mating by inducing expression of various genes whose products are necessary for cell and nuclear fusion (Tiueheart et al., MCB 7, 2316-2328, 1987; Rose et al., MCB 6, 3490~3497,1986) and by causing arrest in the Gl phase of the cell cycle. How do these mating factors trigger the multitude of cellular responses? The surprising answer, as the outlines of a molecular understanding become visible, seems to be that the machinery that yeast uses to respond to mating factors has similarity to the apparatus used in many other cells, including cells of the nervous system, for various signal transductions. The Receptors The receptor for yeast a-factor is coded by the STE2 gene, and the receptor for a-factor by the STE3 gene (Burkholder and Hartwell, NAR 73,8463-84751985; Nakayama et al., EMBO J. 4, 2643-2648, 1985; Hagen et al., PNAS 83, 1418-1422, 1986). The deduced amino acid sequence of the STf2 and STE3 products revealed that they are members of the rhodopsinlp-adrenergic receptor/muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family of integral membrane proteins. All of these proteins contain seven hydrophobic segments, each long enough to span a lipid bilayer membrane (see figure). These receptors are hypothesized to exhibit a transmembrane arrangement similar to that of bacteriorhodopsin, for which a partial three-dimensional structure is available. Amino acid sequence similarity among these receptors is modest; similarity between STf2 and STf3 polypeptides is virtually absent. The yeast receptors thus provide a striking example of gene products of similar function in which the topology of the protein (its arrangement with respect to the membrane), not primary sequence, has been strongly conserved (figure). The ligands for this receptor family are diverse: a skinny lipid chromophore (retinal) and small organic molecules (epinephrine and acetylcholine). The ligands for STE2 and STE3 proteins, a-factor and a-factor, respectively, are peptides of 13 and 12 amino acids (a-factor is probably a modified peptide). Intracellular Machinery Receptor switching experiments suggest that the response pathway in a and a cells may differ only in the type of receptor and that the intracellular machinery involved in subsequent transmission of the signal evoked by binding of the mating factors is the same in both cell types.

In the presence of reduced cytochrome c, a large delta p was generated with a maximum value at pH 6.0. Apparent H+/amino acid stoichiometries (napp) have been determined at external pH values between 5.5 and 8.0 from the steady state levels of accumulation and the delta p. For L-leucine napp (0.8) was nearly independent of the pH. For L-alanine and L-serine napp decreased from 0.9-1.0 at pH 5.5 to 0-0.2 at pH 8.0. The napp for the different amino acids decreased with increasing external amino acid concentration. At pH 6.0, first order rate constants for amino acid exit (kex) under steady state conditions for L-leucine, L-alanine, and L-serine were 1.1-1.3, 0.084, and 0.053 min-1, respectively. From the pH dependence of kex it is concluded that amino acid exit in steady state is the sum of two processes, pH-dependent carrier-mediated amino acid exit and pH-independent passive diffusion (external leak). The first order rate constant for passive diffusion increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the side chain of the amino acids. As a result of these processes the kinetic steady state attained is less than the amino acid accumulation ratio predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium. The napp determined from the steady state accumulation represents, therefore, a lower limit. It is concluded that the mechanistic stoichiometry (n) for L-leucine, L-alanine, and L-serine transport most likely equals 1."
https://openalex.org/W2129616474,"An enzyme system from Escherichia coli activates an inactive form of ribonucleotide reductase by transforming a tyrosine residue of the enzyme into a cationic free radical. The process requires NAD(P)H, a flavin, dithiothreitol, and oxygen and at least three proteins. After purification to near homogeneity two of the proteins were identified as superoxide dismutase and NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase (Fontecave, M., Eliasson, R., and Reichard, P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12325-12331). The nature of the third protein, provisionally named Fraction b, is unknown. The flavin reductase is believed to reduce the ferric iron center of the ribonucleotide reductase as a prerequisite for radical generation. Here we demonstrate that the flavin reductase under aerobic conditions generates superoxide anions which inactivate ribonucleotide reductase. Superoxide dismutase protects the enzyme or a sensitive intermediate formed during the generation of the tyrosyl radical from the harmful effects of superoxide. Hydrogen peroxide, formed by superoxide dismutase, is also harmful. In this case, catalase present in Fraction b might protect the system. Fraction b has, however, an additional unknown function in the overall process of radical generation."
https://openalex.org/W1491680804,"LTB4 20-hydroxylase (P-450LTB) is the cytochrome P-450 in the microsomes of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes that catalyzes the omega-oxidation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to 20-OH LTB4. The activity of P-450LTB for LTB4 compared to isomers and analogs of LTB4 at a concentration of 0.3 microM revealed a preference of P-450LTB for both the triene bond configuration of LTB4 and for the chirality of the 5S and 12R hydroxyl groups. 15S-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 8(R/S), 15S-dihydroxy-5-cis-9,11,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid, 8R,15S-dihydroxy-5,13-cis-9,11-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 5S,15S-dihydroxy-6,13-trans-8,11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid were each not subject to omega-oxidation, indicating a negative effect of the presence of a 15-hydroxyl group on substrate recognition. At a concentration of 1.5 microM, 12R- and 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were converted to their respective 20-OH derivatives at rates that were 34.2 +/- 11.6% (mean +/- S.D., n = 3) and 3.5 +/- 4.3% (mean +/- S.D., n = 4), respectively, of that of LTB4 to 20-OH LTB4, further indicating that P-450LTB can distinguish the chirality of the 12-hydroxyl group. The lower Km of LTB4 (2.0 microM), as compared to those of its 6-trans-12-epi isomer (3.8 microM) and 5-epi-LTB4 (6.6 microM) confirmed the preference of P-450LTB for the specific triene bond structure of LTB4 and its preference for the chirality of the hydroxyl groups of LTB4 within this structurally related class of molecules. At equal 1.5-microM concentrations, LTB4 completely inhibited the omega-oxidation of all other substrates and partially suppressed that of leukotriene B5, consistent with the lower Km of LTB4 and indicating that P-450LTB catalyzed the omega-oxidation of all substrates. Thus, P-450LTB is a novel cytochrome P-450 of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with substrate recognition determined by the triene bond configuration and the chirality of the hydroxyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1535775317,"Androgens, while stimulating the growth of the rat ventral prostate, can also repress the levels of a limited number of mRNAs. The cDNA for one of the androgen-repressed mRNAs has been identified by nucleotide sequence analysis as coding for the glutathione S-transferase Yb1 subunit. The prostate cDNA is 1071 nucleotides long, and only 2 or 4 bases of this sequence do not match the two published sequences of the cDNA for the Yb1 subunit of rat liver glutathione S-transferase. The amino acids in the protein encoded by the prostate cDNA matched completely with that for one of the liver cDNAs and differ with the other cDNA only in two of 218 amino acids. The identification of the androgen-repressed mRNA as a glutathione S-transferase subunit may indicate that some of the cellular actions of the enzyme may be important in the control of androgen-dependent growth of the prostate. Since Yb forms of the transferases have been colocalized with uridylic acid-rich small nuclear RNAs at interchromatinic regions of the cell nucleus, autoregulation of prostate growth by androgens may be carried out through the modulation of RNA production or processing in this target organ."
https://openalex.org/W2165448480,"The spatial arrangement of the F protein spike in the Sendai virus was studied after purifying the protein and reconstituting it in lipid vesicles (Sechoy, O., Philippot, J. R., and Bienvenue, A. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 857, 1-12). The different components of the F protein spikes were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under various conditions of treatment, i.e. at different temperatures and sodium dodecyl sulfate concentrations, using different detergents for F protein solubilization (Triton X-100 and octyl glucoside), by fast protein liquid chromatography analysis, and by chemical cross-linking between subunits with bifunctional agents such as dimethyl adipimidate and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). The F protein spike appeared to be a structurally stable complex, composed of a noncovalent association of four homooligomers, each consisting of two peptides, F1 and F2, linked by a disulfide bond. Octyl glucoside and Triton X-100 solubilized the F protein, preserving the tetramer, which is probably the native form. Using chemical cross-linking, a covalent bond was formed between two monomers. We hypothesize that the tetrameric form of the F protein in its native form (spike) consists of two identical dimers that can be chemically cross-linked in a stable complex."
https://openalex.org/W1508268598,"Aggregation of the receptor with high affinity for immunoglobulin E (IgE) in rat basophilic leukemia cells leads to a calcium-dependent and a calcium-independent hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. The increase in the levels of inositol phosphates induced in the absence of calcium is only 25% of that observed with 1 mM Ca2+. The inositol phosphates reach a new steady state level 2 min after stimulation in EGTA, whereas with calcium they continue to increase up to 15 min. A similar response is observed when the receptors are aggregated due to the interaction of bound IgE with antigen or with anit-IgE, or by the binding of IgE cross-linked chemically. The antigen-mediated response is inhibited by hapten and disruption of such antigen-antibody aggregates late after stimulation leads to a rapid decline in the levels of the inositol phosphates to basal values. Separation of the inositol phosphates by Dowex columns shows that there is a fast rise in inositol trisphosphate which peaks at 15 s and slowly declines to a lower plateau within 2 min. Analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography reveals a 5-fold increase in the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in less than 10 s after stimulation, which precedes any major change in the other inositol phosphates. Aggregation of the receptor in the absence of external calcium induces a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium which reaches a maximum of approximately 25 nM over basal levels after activation. The onset of the rise in Ca2+ lags after the initial rise in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate."

The levels of the same transcripts were also increased following transformation by polyoma virus and by ras and myc oncogenes. The presence of the ID element appeared to be determinant, since a similar pattern of expression was observed for a construct where one element had been inserted in the 3' noncoding region of a rabbit beta-globin gene expressed under control of an SV40 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1535893204,"Biotin is added to biotin-containing enzymes as a post-translational modification catalyzed by holoenzyme synthetase. This reaction is fairly general in that synthetase from one organism will modify enzymes from heterologous sources. This suggests that the polypeptides share some structural characteristic(s) that define(s) them as biotin enzymes. We have reported previously that when the gene coding for the 1.3 S biotinyl subunit of transcarboxylase is expressed in Escherichia coli, the polypeptide produced is biotinated by the cellular synthetase. Using in vitro mutagenesis of this gene, we have begun to define the primary structure involved in the enzymatic addition of biotin to a lysine residue. We show here that the carboxyl terminus of the 1.3 S subunit is critical in biotination. Mutations affecting the COOH-terminal residue do not influence the modification, but elimination of the hydrophobic side chain of the penultimate residue abolishes biotin addition."
https://openalex.org/W1823097703,"5-Iminodaunomycin forms a 3:1 complex with Fe(III) at pH 7.4. Drug-metal complex formation is associated with a marked decline in absorbance at 548 and 593 nm and the appearance of a broad band above 625 nm. The 5-iminodaunomycin-Fe(III) complex reacts with hydrogen peroxide to yield .OH radicals. This reaction is at a maximum at a drug/iron ratio of 2:1, and the yield is far less than that obtained with the doxorubicin-iron complex. In contrast to the results with doxorubicin, the production of .OH declines markedly at high 5-iminodaunomycin/iron ratios. There is a close parallel between the formation of hydroxyl radicals and the ability of the 5-iminodaunomycin complex to nick supercoiled SV40 DNA. The suppression of both .OH and DNA damage at high 5-iminodaunomycin:iron ratios is the result of several factors. 1) The presence of DNA stimulates .OH production from the doxorubicin complex, but not 5-iminodaunomycin; 2) doxorubicin reduces its chelated Fe(III) to Fe(II), but 5-iminodaunomycin does not; 3) 5-iminodaunomycin forms such a stable drug-metal complex that solvent water and, therefore, presumably H2O2, has diminished access to the chelated iron. The affinity of 5-iminodaunomycin is such that it can quantitatively abstract iron from doxorubicin. As a result, 5-iminodaunomycin is an effective competitive inhibitor of .OH radical formation by the doxorubicin-iron complex."
https://openalex.org/W1494220567,"Aerobic incubations of the Tritrichomonas foetus hydrogenosomal fraction containing pyruvate, CoA, and the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) gave spectra of two radical adducts. One was a carbon-centered radical adduct of DMPO. This radical was centered at C-3 of pyruvate as determined in experiments using [13C]pyruvate. The other radical detected was identified as the CoA radical adduct of DMPO by comparison with an adduct obtained by incubating CoA with DMPO, H2O2 and horseradish peroxidase. Deletion of CoA led to an increased stability of the carbon-centered radical adduct of DMPO, disappearance of the thiyl radical adduct of DMPO, and appearance of a hydroxyl radical adduct of DMPO. Superoxide dismutase suppressed the appearance of the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct but did not have any inhibitory effect on the appearance of the other adducts. Catalase had no significant effect on any of the adducts. Addition of pyruvate to these hydrogenosomal preparations stimulated oxygen consumption. Addition of CoA led to a further increase in the rate of O2 uptake but had no effect in the absence of pyruvate. The formation of two substrate free radicals as intermediates in the generation of acetyl-CoA represents a novel mechanism for this enzymatic reaction and indicates that the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from T. foetus differs significantly from the pyridine nucleotide-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of other eukaryotic cells in its catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1645068331,"The properties of the nonheme iron of bromoperoxidase from Corallina pilulifera were studied. The enzyme lost its activity when reduced with formamidine-sulfinic acid and recovered it when oxidized by air. Incubation of the enzyme with ferric or ferrous ion-chelating agents indicated that its nonheme iron was ferric. Analyses of circular dichroism and proton NMR spectra suggested that the ferric ion tightly bound to cysteine, histidine, or tyrosine residues of the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzed Br--dependent catalase reactions to yield 1 mol of O2 from 2 mol of H2O2. No O2 evolution was observed when bromination reaction of monochlorodimedone occurred. From these results, together with previous knowledge of this enzyme, it was concluded that it activated bromide anion (Br-) to bromonium cation (Br+) using one molecule of H2O2, and this Br+OH- formed at the active site then decomposed another H2O2 to yield O2 in the absence of halogen acceptors (substrate). When substrate was present in the reaction mixture, it and H2O2 competitively reacted with the reaction intermediate (Br+OH-) to give brominated products."

However, transferrin was found to react with the formate radical, CO-.2, and the hydrated electron, e-aq, with second-order rate constants of 3.8 X 10(8) and 1.1 X 10(10) M-1 S-1, respectively. These reactions produced a transient species (lambda max = 420 nm) which subsequently decayed by a second-order process. However, no reduction of the Fe(III) in transferrin was detected. Fe(III)-EHPG was also found to react with CO-.2 and e-aq, k = 7.3 X 10(6) and 1.1 X 10(9) M-1 S-1, respectively. The reactions of CO-.2 and e-aq with Fe(III)-EHPG resulted in no transient species but rather in reduction of the iron. These results are consistent with the inability of transferrin and Fe(III)-EHPG to catalyze the Haber-Weiss reaction."
https://openalex.org/W129211217,"A procedure has been developed for purification of the porcine brain alpha 2-adrenergic receptor to homogeneity. alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors were solubilized from porcine brain particulate preparations using sequential extraction into sodium cholate- and digitonin-containing buffers. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the digitonin extract were identified using the alpha 2-adrenergic selective antagonist, [3H]yohimbine, and demonstrated the same specificity for interaction with adrenergic ligands as did the receptors in particulate preparations. Extraction into digitonin-containing buffers eliminated the modulation of receptor-agonist interactions by guanine nucleotides, but not by monovalent cations. A novel affinity resin, yohimbine-agarose, was synthesized and used for purification of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Using two sequential yohimbine-agarose affinity chromatography steps, digitonin-solubilized alpha 2-adrenergic receptors from porcine brain cortex were purified to homogeneity as assessed by radioiodination and silver stain analysis of these preparations on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified alpha 2-adrenergic receptor has an approximate Mr = 65,000, as determined by photolabeling of the adrenergic ligand-binding subunit. The yohimbine-agarose affinity resin should be useful for purifying quantities of receptor sufficient for studies of receptor structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2100943250,"Two cDNA clones for mitochondrial adenylate kinase were isolated from a cDNA library of bovine liver poly(A)+ RNA by using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as probes. The clone containing a 0.9-kilobase insert had the reading frame for a 241-residue protein (AK2A), while the other clone containing a 1.6-kilobase insert had the frame for a 234-residue protein (AK2B). Nucleotide sequences of these two clones were the same in the 5' portion up to the coding sequence for the 233rd residue, but different in the remaining 3' portions. The reported amino acid sequence of mitochondrial adenylate kinase from bovine heart corresponded to AK2A. Neither AK2A nor AK2B had a cleavable NH2-terminal presequence as that found in other imported mitochondrial proteins. RNA blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNAs from bovine liver and heart revealed three species of mRNA with approximate sizes of 0.9, 1.4, and 1.7 kilobases. The 1.7- and 1.4-kilobase species were specific for AK2B, whereas the 0.9-kilobase species was specific for AK2A. In the liver, the 1.7-kilobase mRNA was more abundant, whereas in the heart the 0.9-kilobase mRNA was predominant. The 1.4-kilobase mRNA was present only in the heart. The AK2A- and AK2B-coding sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli cells under the control of trc promoter. Both the products reverted the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the adenylate kinase mutant of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1514389649,"When applied to ischemic hearts digitalis exhibits depressed inotropic effect and increased toxicity. The molecular basis of these effects was investigated at the level of the digitalis receptors characterized by Na,K-ATPase assays and [3H]ouabain-binding measurements. In sarcolemma obtained from dog hearts rendered ischemic for 15, 30, and 60 min (left anterior descending), two populations (high and low affinity) of digitalis receptors were detected. The apparent affinity (KD, 300 nM) and the binding capacity of the low-affinity sites (responsible for toxicity) remained constant and similar to those found in normal hearts. The KD value of the high-affinity sites, responsible for inotropy, remained unchanged (2 nM), but the site number sharply decreased (up to 90%). These inotropic sites that account for 66% of the total binding in normals are gradually inactivated, as the duration of ischemia increases. This inactivation would occur in situ since it was detectable in homogenates and was not depressed by the isolation procedure per se. The loss of function of the inotropic sites and the increased contribution of the low-affinity toxic sites represent the setting of a new distribution of the digitalis receptors in the ischemic heart before reperfusion is instituted. This constitutes the molecular basis of the deleterious pharmacological effects observed with digitalis."
https://openalex.org/W2149370946,"A nuclear extract from HeLa cells was fractionated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The obtained fractions were assayed for binding to an RNA transcript carrying a splice site sequence of 9-16 nucleotides by a filter binding technique. The U1 RNA-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) fractions, which showed binding activities for both 5' and 3' splice site RNAs, were studied for the sequence specificity of their binding. Results indicate that the U1-rich snRNP fraction can recognize both 5' and 3' splice site sequences. The U1 RNP, which was highly purified from the snRNP fractions, bound to at least some 5' splice site sequences, but not to a consensus 3' splice site sequence. Therefore, purified U1 RNP can directly recognize a 5' splice site, but not a 3' splice site. The binding activity for the 5' splice sites was lost either by digestion with micrococcal nuclease or by digestion of the 5' end of U1 RNA with RNase H and a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide, indicating the involvement of U1 RNA. Involvement of a protein moiety as well in this binding was suggested by the loss of binding activity upon heating at 60 degrees C. The binding activity to a 3' splice site sequence was not sensitive to digestion by micrococcal nuclease and was removed by protein A-coupled anti-Sm antibody. This activity was found in sucrose gradient fractions of about 8 S."
https://openalex.org/W1497753291,"The catabolite activator protein (CAP) binding sites of the Escherichia coli galactose and lactose operons were probed by hydroxyl radical footprinting. This method reveals each base that is protected by the bound protein. The patterns of protection seen for the primary CAP sites at gal and lac were virtually identical. In the presence of RNA polymerase the footprint of the second CAP molecule at gal was found to be very similar to those at the other two sites. This upstream site in gal align's perfectly with the lac CAP site with respect to the start of P1 transcription. Replacing most of the gal second CAP site DNA with heterologous sequences did not abolish binding although it became noticeably weaker. In vitro transcription studies of this hybrid gal promoter DNA further demonstrated the reduced affinity of the second CAP. These results are consistent with molecular models proposed for specific CAP binding and suggest that the second CAP at gal may be responsible for overall stimulation of transcription at this operon. Thus, in spite of differences in stoichiometry, the mechanisms of activation by CAP at gal and lac may be quite similar."

A widely studied modified (Mr = 61,000) form of nitrite reductase, that has lost much of the native enzyme's ability to use ferredoxin as an electron donor, contains approximately 1 mol of siroheme/mol of enzyme. Quantitation of the high spin ferri-siroheme EPR signals and of nitrite-binding sites of the two preparations confirmed that the native enzyme's siroheme content is approximately twice that of the modified enzyme. Plots of nitrite and cyanide binding to the native enzyme versus ligand concentration are sigmoidal, with Hill coefficients of 1.6-1.8 and 2.3-2.8, respectively. Plots of enzyme activity versus nitrite concentration for the native enzyme are sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 2.4. Cyanide inhibition of enzymatic activity was shown to be not competitive. Addition of cyanide to the native enzyme resulted in a diminution of the high spin ferri-siroheme EPR signal and produced EPR signals with g values of 2.71, 2.33, and 1.49 due to low spin ferri-siroheme."

https://openalex.org/W1593540164,"The kinase and sugar phosphate exchange reactions of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase were inactivated by treatment with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine or 8-azido-ATP, but activity could be restored by the addition of dithiothreitol. This inactivation was accompanied by incorporation of 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl[8-14C]adenosine into the enzyme that was not released by the addition of dithiothreitol. The lack of effect of ATP analogs on the ATP/ADP exchange or on bisphosphatase activity and reversal of their effects on the kinase and sugar phosphate reactions by dithiothreitol suggest that 1) they reacted with sulfhydryl groups important for sugar phosphate binding in the kinase reaction, and 2) the inactivation of the kinase by these analogs involves a specific reaction that is not related to their general mechanism of attacking nucleotide-binding sites. In addition, alkylation of the enzymes' sulfhydryls with iodoacetamide prevented inactivation by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, suggesting that the same thiols were involved. o-Iodosobenzoate inactivated the kinase and sugar phosphate exchange; the inactivation was reversed by dithiothreitol; but there was no effect on the bisphosphatase or nucleotide exchange, indicating that oxidation occurred at the same sulfhydryl that are associated with sugar phosphate binding. ATP or ADP, but not fructose 6-phosphate, protected these groups from modification by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, 8-azido-ATP, and o-iodosobenzoate. ATP also induced dramatic changes in the circular dichroism spectrum of the enzyme, suggesting that adenine nucleotide protection of thiol groups resulted from changes in enzyme secondary structure. Analysis of cyanogen bromide fragments of 14C-carboxamidomethylated enzyme showed that all radioactivity was associated with cysteinyl residues in a single cyanogen bromide fragment. Three of these cysteinyl residues are clustered in a 38-residue region, which probably plays a role in maintaining the conformation of the kinase sugar phosphate-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1659018589,"Abstract Since Na+,K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) of pig kidney modified with a fluorescent sulfhydryl reagent, N-[p-(2-benzimidazolyl) phenyl]maleimide, at Cys-964 of the alpha-chain showed ATP-dependent, reversible, and dynamic fluorescence changes (Nagai, M., Taniguchi, K., Kangawa, K., Matsuo, S., Nakamura, S., and Iida, S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13197-13202), we studied the conformational change during Na+,K+-ATPase reaction using the modified enzyme. The addition of K+ to the enzyme increased the fluorescence intensity to 2% in the presence of 160 mM Na+ and 3 mM Mg2+ (K0.5 = 16.4 mM). Addition of low concentrations of ATP immediately increased the intensity to 3.2% (K0.5 less than 0.1 microM) to accumulate fully K+-bound enzyme in the presence of 43 mM K+ with Na+ and Mg2+, but further addition of higher concentrations of ATP diminished the increase (K0.5 = 120 microM). After exhaustion of ATP, the fluorescence intensity decreased to -0.4% (K0.5 = 0.3 microM) and -2% (K0.5 = 20 microM), respectively, in the presence of low and high concentrations of ADP produced from ATP. High concentrations of ATP accelerated Na+,K+-ATPase activity with a simultaneous increase in the amount of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme irrespective of the modification. Adenylyl imidodiphosphate and ADP accelerated Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the presence of 2.7 microM ATP by decreasing the extent of the fluorescence without affecting the amount of phosphoenzyme, irrespective of the modification. These data suggest that Na+,K+-ATPase activity was accelerated due to the acceleration of the breakdown of K+-bound enzyme by high concentrations of ATP and ATP analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1607901162,"The biological effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are mediated by binding to a membrane-bound receptor. Probes designed to trap this receptor by binding to it in a covalent way may suffer from a greatly reduced affinity. We report here, for the VIP receptor, the use of a photoaffinity probe obtained by derivatization of receptor-bound VIP with para-azidophenylglyoxal. This method protected the parts of the molecule essential for receptor binding. The VIP derivative thus obtained became covalently linked when irradiated. In the dark, however, it exhibited normal VIP-like behavior and retained its biological activity. This derivatization method might be generally applicable when hormone analogues have to be prepared without loss of receptor affinity. Receptor characterization studies on liver plasma membranes showed the presence of high- and low-affinity binding sites with KD = 0.1 and 5 nM, respectively. Treatment of membranes with dithiothreitol causes loss of high-affinity binding. The high-affinity site, trapped by the photoaffinity probe, resolved into two molecular mass forms, 50 and 200-250 kDa. Reduction of the receptor-probe complex left the 50-kDa form intact, whereas the amount of the 200-250-kDa form greatly diminished. We demonstrate the importance of the presence of disulfide bonds in one of the molecular forms involved in high-affinity binding."
https://openalex.org/W1646257409,"The membrane topology of the envelope of Sendai virus was investigated using various radioactive photoactivable hydrophobic reagents: 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine and the two phospholipid analogues, 1-palmitoyl-2-(2-azido-4-nitro)benzoyl-sn -glycero-3- phospho[3H]choline and 1-myristoyl-2,12-amino-(4-N-3-nitro-1-azidophenyl)dodecanoyl-sn-glycero- 3-phospho[14C]choline. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein and the fusogenic (F) glycoprotein were labeled by all three probes, confirming that these proteins are integral components of the viral envelope. The labeled F glycoprotein, composed of the two subunits F1 and F2, was cleaved in situ with trypsin to yield two fragments, F32 (32 kDa) and F19 (19 kDa). F2 was not labeled by any of the probes, suggesting an external location; whereas F19 was labeled by all probes and hence contains the portion of the F glycoprotein which traverses the viral envelope. Fragment F32 reacted both with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine and with 1-palmitoyl-2-(2-azido-4-nitro)benzoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho[3H]choline, but not with 1-myristoyl-2,12-amino-(4-N-3-nitro-1-azidophenyl)dodecanoyl-sn-glycero- 3- phospho[14C]choline. This result opens the possibility that the F glycoprotein is formed by a loop-like structure having multiple interactions with viral lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1507646905,A new positional isotope exchange method has been developed that can be used for the analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which have ping-pong kinetic mechanisms. The technique can be used to measure the relative rates of ligand dissociation from enzyme-product complexes. Enzyme is incubated with the labeled substrate and an excess of the corresponding unlabeled product. The partitioning of the enzyme-product complex back toward free enzyme is determined from the rate of positional isotope exchange within the original labeled substrate. The partitioning of the enzyme-product complex forward toward free enzyme is determined from the rate of formation of totally unlabeled substrate. It has been shown that the ratio of the two rates provides a lower limit for the release of product from the enzyme-product complex. The technique has been applied to the reaction catalyzed by galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. The lower limit for the release of glucose 1-phosphate from the uridyl-enzyme relative to the maximal velocity of the reverse reaction was determined to be 3.4 +/- 0.5.
https://openalex.org/W1582158630,"In human erythrocytes, in which the fractional turnover rate of glucose 6-phosphate is rather low, menadione increases to almost the same relative extent the oxidation of D-[U-14C]glucose and D-[U-14C]galactose. However, in pancreatic tumoral islet cells (RINm5F line), in which the fractional turnover rate of glucose 6-phosphate is considerably higher, menadione increases the oxidation of D-[1-14C]glucose but not that of D-[1-14C]galactose. These results suggest that alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate generated from exogenous D-galactose is channeled preferentially into the glycolytic rather than pentose phosphate pathway. Such was no more the case, however, when the RINm5F cells were exposed simultaneously to both D-glucose and D-galactose."

https://openalex.org/W1931782419,"The glutamate dehydrogenase-NADPH-alpha-ketoglutarate complex, an active intermediate on the reaction pathway has a number of unusual properties: 1) it is the only blue-shifted natural complex of this enzyme; 2) it has an anomalously slow rate of dissociation; 3) its off-rate shows a substantial pH-independent D2O solvent isotope effect not exhibited by any other ternary complex of this enzyme; and 4) it has an unusually large enthalpy of interaction parameter. These properties must be ascribable to at least one of the two possibilities conferred on the complex by the presence of the alpha-carbonyl group of alpha-ketoglutarate; the ability to engage in carbonyl addition reactions; and/or the ability to form a specific hydrogen bond. Oxalylglycine, a competitive inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate in this enzyme-catalyzed reaction, provides a means of discriminating between these two modes of action. The structure of oxalylglycine provides a dicarboxylic compound which has the same intercarboxylate proton distance and has a carbonyl group in a position spatially analogous to that of alpha-ketoglutarate. Its carbonyl group, however, is that of an amide group and cannot, therefore, engage in carbonyl addition reactions, but can hydrogen bond. Therefore, any effects observed with both oxalylglycine and alpha-ketoglutarate must be ascribed to formation of specific alpha-carbonyl hydrogen bonding, whereas any effects observed with alpha-ketoglutarate alone must be due to an alpha-carbonyl addition reaction. We have used this logic to test the source of the four phenomena listed above. In each case, oxalylglycine and alpha-ketoglutarate showed the same effect. Therefore, we conclude that all four phenomena are in fact due to the formation of a specific alpha-carbonyl hydrogen bond and that the specific carbonyl addition reaction between alpha-ketoglutarate and an enzyme lysine group, postulated in one proposed catalytic mechanism, does not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1562811605,"We exposed simian virus 40-infected CV-1 monkey cells to the carcinogen N-acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene and monitored the removal of lesions from cellular DNA and from various regions of viral DNA. Exposure to 5.5 microM 3H-labeled carcinogen produced 20-80 adducts per 10(6) bases in cellular DNA in different experiments. The initial adduct concentration in viral DNA was always approximately half that in cellular DNA. At various times after treatment, cellular and viral DNA, and restriction fragments of viral DNA, were purified and examined for adduct density. Independent of the initial adduct concentration three rates of repair were observed. Cellular DNA was repaired at the lowest rate. Viral DNA was repaired about 50% more rapidly than was cellular DNA isolated from the same carcinogen-treated monolayers. Within the viral DNA a 366-base pair region containing the major nuclease-hypersensitive site was repaired at twice the rate of the rest of the viral genome. This region contains regulatory sequences that govern the initiation of DNA replication and viral gene expression. As reported previously this region was initially modified 1.71 +/- 0.20-fold higher than expected from its guanine content. Selective repair diminished the extent of hypermodification of this region by 6.0 +/- 2.1% per hour, partly compensating for the higher initial level of adducts."
