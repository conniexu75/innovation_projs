https://openalex.org/W2598899113,"Effective derivation of functional airway organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) would provide valuable models of lung disease and facilitate precision therapies for airway disorders such as cystic fibrosis. However, limited understanding of human airway patterning has made this goal challenging. Here, we show that cyclical modulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway enables rapid directed differentiation of human iPSCs via an NKX2-1+ progenitor intermediate into functional proximal airway organoids. We find that human NKX2-1+ progenitors have high levels of Wnt activation but respond intrinsically to decreases in Wnt signaling by rapidly patterning into proximal airway lineages at the expense of distal fates. Using this directed approach, we were able to generate cystic fibrosis patient-specific iPSC-derived airway organoids with a defect in forskolin-induced swelling that is rescued by gene editing to correct the disease mutation. Our approach has many potential applications in modeling and drug screening for airway diseases."

However, while necroptosis has been shown to contribute to antiviral immunity, death-independent roles for RIPK3 in host defense have not been demonstrated. Using a mouse model of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, we show that RIPK3 restricts WNV pathogenesis independently of cell death. Ripk3-/- mice exhibited enhanced mortality compared to wild-type (WT) controls, while mice lacking the necroptotic effector MLKL, or both MLKL and caspase-8, were unaffected. The enhanced susceptibility of Ripk3-/- mice arose from suppressed neuronal chemokine expression and decreased central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of T lymphocytes and inflammatory myeloid cells, while peripheral immunity remained intact. These data identify pleiotropic functions for RIPK3 in the restriction of viral pathogenesis and implicate RIPK3 as a key coordinator of immune responses within the CNS."

Here, we identify H3K4 methylation as a major epigenetic roadblock that limits transcriptional reprogramming and efficient nuclear transfer (NT). Widespread expression of donor-cell-specific genes was observed in inappropriate cell types in NT embryos, limiting their developmental capacity. The expression of these genes in reprogrammed embryos arises from epigenetic memories of a previously active transcriptional state in donor cells that is characterized by high H3K4 methylation.

During development, cells lose their pluripotent status and acquire a stable cell identity, which only rarely, if ever, changes to another kind. Yet, somatic cells can be reprogrammed to another cell fate by nuclear transfer (NT) to eggs (Gurdon, 1960Gurdon J.B. The developmental capacity of nuclei taken from differentiating endoderm cells of Xenopus laevis.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1960; 8: 505-526PubMed Google Scholar), by the expression of a combination of transcription factors (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

Chiu C.P. Webster C. Cytoplasmic activation of human nuclear genes in stable heterocaryons.Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In these reprogramming procedures, the gene-expression pattern and epigenetic state characteristic of one differentiated cell identity is erased and the gene expression pattern specific to another cell type is established. However, the efficiency of complete reprogramming via NT is low, as less than 10% of NT embryos generated from differentiated cells reach adulthood (Gurdon, 1960Gurdon J.B.

Dyn. 2006; 235: 2460-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that differentiated cells acquire a resistance to reprogramming procedures, which during normal development, helps to stabilize their cell fate. Due to this resistance, eggs cannot fully reprogram the incoming somatic nuclei, so that embryos with aberrant gene expression patterns arise and normal embryonic development is not supported (Gao et al., 2003Gao S.

So far, it has been shown that a failure in reactivating genes, e.g., the pluripotency gene Oct4, during nuclear reprogramming is indicative of a poor developmental outcome of NT embryos (Boiani et al., 2002Boiani M.

Furthermore, epigenetic modifications inhibiting the re-activation of genes during the reprogramming procedure have been investigated and their removal has been utilized to improve reprogramming efficiency and to increase the viability of NT embryos (Blelloch et al., 2006Blelloch R.

However, the expression of donor cell-type-specific genes in the wrong cell type of NT embryos could also lead to a severe disruption of normal gene expression patterns resulting in developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Indeed, the existence of such an active transcription state memory has been suggested in NT and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) experiments (Polo et al., 2010Polo J.M. Liu S. Figueroa M.E.

Epigenetic memory of active gene transcription is inherited through somatic cell nuclear transfer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1957-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Currently, however, the extent and functional importance of persistent donor-cell-type-specific gene expression in resistance to reprogramming is not known. Furthermore, the epigenetic mechanisms that confer memory of an active state of gene expression and that maintain the differentiated state of cells during nuclear reprogramming and embryonic development remain elusive. Here we show that in Xenopus and human NT embryos, memory of an active transcriptional state (ON-memory) is a phenomenon as widespread as the memory of an inactive transcriptional state. ON-memory genes are associated with increased levels of the active histone mark H3K4me3 when compared to properly reprogrammed genes in Xenopus and human somatic donor cells. Importantly, while a reduction in H3K4 methylation levels has little effect on gene expression in the donor cells, it significantly improves transcriptional reprogramming and enhances the developmental potential of the resultant NT embryos in Xenopus. Our study thus identifies H3K4 methylation as a critical epigenetic barrier in NT-mediated reprogramming and implicates its role as stabilization mechanism of cell differentiation. The low success rate of current cloning strategies was suggested to be partly due to the persistence of a donor-cell-type-specific gene expression pattern in NT embryos, which could hinder the generation of new cell types (Firas et al., 2014Firas J. Liu X. Polo J.M.

Embryonic development following somatic cell nuclear transfer impeded by persisting histone methylation.Cell. 2014; 159: 884-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As a first step to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the extent of memory gene expression in Xenopus NT embryos on a transcriptome-wide level. For this purpose, the nucleus of a neurula-stage endoderm cell was transplanted to an enucleated egg to obtain NT embryos and as a control for normal gene expression, in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos were generated (Figure 1A). Properly cleaved embryos were collected at the gastrula stage, a time point where ectoderm and endoderm identity is established and before any developmental defects can be observed in these NT embryos. Endoderm donor cells as well as ectoderm cells of single NT and IVF embryos were then subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in biological triplicate (Figures 1A and S1A–S1F; Tables S1 and S2). To test the extent of memory and reprogramming in the newly generated cell type, we addressed which transcripts differ between endoderm donor cells and ectoderm cells of IVF embryos. When the expression of these genes also differs between NT- and IVF- ectoderm cells, we consider them to be examples of donor cell memory (Figure S1A). If they are expressed at similar levels in NT and IVF, we consider them as reprogrammed (Figure S1B). Of all 24,215 identified transcripts (Figure 1B, in gray), a large number (17,587; Table S2) was differentially expressed between endoderm donor cells and ectoderm cells of IVF embryos. 13,083 of these genes were reprogrammed as they were expressed at similar levels in the ectoderm of NT and control IVF embryos (Table S2). In contrast, 4,504 genes were resistant to reprogramming as they were differentially expressed between ectoderm cells of NT and control IVF embryos (Figures 1B and 1C). This gene set included 1,534 ON-memory genes- these are genes that were expressed in donor endoderm cells and continued to be significantly (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.05) upregulated in NT ectoderm cells when compared to IVF ectoderm cells (Figures 1B and 1C, group 1). Another 1,346 of the same gene set are described as OFF-memory genes, because their transcripts were expressed at significantly (FDR ≤ 0.05) lower levels in ectoderm cells of NT embryos when compared to IVF controls (Figure 1B and 1C, group 4). The remaining 1,624 genes were either too much down- or upregulated in the ectoderm of NT embryos when compared to the IVF controls (Figure 1C, group 2 and group 3, respectively). We therefore see that a total of 2,880 ON-memory and OFF-memory genes are not reprogrammed by NT to eggs in Xenopus, and instead remember their donor cell expression pattern. Furthermore, this result suggests that NT embryos show endoderm ON-memory gene expression to the same extent as OFF-memory gene expression in the newly generated ectoderm cell type. To obtain insight into biological processes associated with the inappropriately reprogrammed genes, we performed gene ontology analysis. This revealed that as a whole, reprogramming resistant genes are enriched for genes involved in development, transcriptional activity, and metabolic processes (Figure 1C). Importantly, we observed that the ON-memory gene set was enriched for genes implicated in endoderm development (Figure 1C, group 1). Furthermore, we found that master regulators of endoderm specification in Xenopus, such as sox17 and gata6, were among the ON-memory genes showing the highest upregulation in NT embryos when compared to IVF (Figure S1C). Hence, these results point toward retention of endoderm donor cell identity in the ectoderm cells of the NT embryos. Next, we investigated the mechanism by which the ON-memory gene transcripts are accumulated in the ectoderm cells of the NT embryos. In Xenopus, there is no transcription for the first 12 cell cycles of embryonic development (Hörmanseder et al., 2013Hörmanseder E. Tischer T. Mayer T.U. Modulation of cell cycle control during oocyte-to-embryo transitions.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 2191-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistently, we did not observe gene expression of the ON-memory genes sox17β, gata6, and a2m (endodermin) at stage 7, prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA; Figures S1G and S1H). This indicates that there was no carry-over of transcripts for these genes during NT, and that transcripts detected here were newly synthetized after ZGA. We therefore conclude that the memory of an active state of gene transcription of the donor nucleus was transmitted to its mitotic progeny during early embryonic cell divisions in the absence of the conditions that induced that state, and independently of ongoing gene transcription. It implies that the memory of the donor cell gene expression pattern observed in NT embryos is stabilized by epigenetic mechanisms. We then investigated which epigenetic feature of the donor nuclei could account for the fact that ON-memory genes resist the reprogramming process and commence expression in the wrong cell type of NT embryos. Actively transcribed genes are characterized by the presence of methylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) (Santos-Rosa et al., 2002Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Active genes are tri-methylated at K4 of histone H3.Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that accumulation of H3K4me3 following transcription of endoderm genes in donor cells could confer ON-memory gene-expression after NT. Our transcriptome analysis identified reprogrammed-down genes that were active in endoderm donor cells (Figure 2A) but are reprogrammed and downregulated to IVF levels in the ectoderm of NT embryos (Figure 2B). ON-memory genes were initially expressed in endoderm donor cells at similar levels to reprogrammed-down genes (Figure 2A). However, they remained significantly upregulated in ectoderm cells of the NT embryo when compared to IVF (ON-memory; Figure 2B). Within the ON-memory group, a subset were especially resistant to reprogramming as they were more than 3-fold overexpressed (ON-memory(3FC); Figure 2B). Using these three sets of genes we tested if differences in H3K4me3 features could explain resistance to transcriptional reprogramming. We performed H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis on neurula-stage endoderm donor cells in biological duplicate (Figures 2C–2F and S2A–S2D). The intensity of the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal around the transcriptional start site (TSS) was significantly higher in ON-memory genes when compared to reprogrammed-down genes (Figures 2C and 2D). Previous studies suggested that broad H3K4me3 domains are linked to cell identity and transcriptional consistency (Benayoun et al., 2014Benayoun B.A. Pollina E.A. Ucar D. Mahmoudi S. Karra K. Wong E.D. Devarajan K. Daugherty A.C. Kundaje A.B. Mancini E. et al.H3K4me3 breadth is linked to cell identity and transcriptional consistency.Cell. 2014; 158: 673-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and since endoderm ON-memory genes are also enriched for endoderm lineage genes and maintain their transcriptionally active state even after the nuclear reprogramming procedure, we tested if ON-memory genes showed high H3K4me3 breadth. Indeed, when comparing the empirical cumulative distribution of H3K4me3 domain size spanning the TSS, ON-memory(3FC) genes showed significantly broader H3K4me3 domains than reprogrammed-down genes (Figure 2E). For example, the ON-memory genes gata6 and sox17β are marked by broader domains than the reprogrammed-down gene abhd4 (Figure 2F). These results suggest that ON-memory genes are enriched for H3K4me3, as they show higher ChIP-seq intensity and broader domains of this mark when compared to reprogrammed-down genes in the endoderm donor cells. Increased H3K4me3 levels and breadth could act together as barrier to cell-fate changes and hence explain why the set of memory-ON genes are resisting the reprogramming process. Our observations in Xenopus prompted us to investigate if ON-memory gene expression is conserved in human NT embryos and whether ON-memory genes, when compared to reprogrammed-down genes, are also enriched for H3K4me3 levels in the human donor cells. In previous studies (Chung et al., 2015Chung Y.G. Matoba S. Liu Y. Eum J.H. Lu F. Jiang W. Lee J.E. Sepilian V. Cha K.Y. Lee D.R. Zhang Y.

Embryonic development following somatic cell nuclear transfer impeded by persisting histone methylation.Cell. 2014; 159: 884-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), epigenetic marks correlating with ON-memory genes were not addressed. Therefore, we obtained the published RNAseq datasets generated from pools of human eight-cell IVF embryos, as well as from eight-cell NT embryos using human dermal fibroblast (DFB-8) cell nuclei as donors (Chung et al., 2015Chung Y.G. Matoba S. Liu Y. Eum J.H. Lu F. Jiang W. Lee J.E. Sepilian V. Cha K.Y. Lee D.R. Zhang Y. Histone demethylase expression enhances human somatic cell nuclear transfer efficiency and promotes derivation of pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 758-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our transcriptome comparison between the donor DFB cells and IVF and NT embryos identified a set of 76 ON-memory genes that remained more than 5-fold upregulated in NT embryos when compared to IVF control (ON-memory(> 5FC); Figures 2G–2I). A set of 364 genes showed partial inactivation (ON-memory(2-5 FC)) (Figures 2G–2I) and a third set of 508 genes was efficiently downregulated in the NT-embryo when compared to IVF (reprogrammed-down; Figures 2I and 2J). Therefore, our analysis of human NT embryo RNA-seq data suggests that the phenomenon of ON-memory gene expression is conserved in human NT embryos. We then investigated the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq intensities of ON-memory and reprogrammed-down genes using publicly available H3K4me3 ChIP-seq datasets for NHDF cells, which are related to the DFB-8 cells used as donors to generate the NT embryos. In agreement with the results obtained for Xenopus, ON-memory genes showed increased H3K4me3 intensity around their TSS when compared to reprogrammed-down genes (Figure 2J). However, when comparing H3K4me3 domains breadth of ON-memory genes and reprogrammed-down genes, we could not observe a significant difference (Figure 2K). These results suggest that also in human, high H3K4me3 levels at the TSS could confer ON-memory gene expression in NT embryos and hence act as barrier to nuclear reprogramming. Having established a correlation between ON-memory gene expression and H3K4me3 enrichment, we next asked whether this modification is responsible for resistance to reprogramming. Hence, one-cell embryos were injected with mRNA encoding the H3K4-specific demethylase Kdm5bwt, or with Kdm5bci, the catalytic inactive version of the enzyme, and grown to neurula-stage (Figure 3A). Western blot analysis confirmed that Kdm5bwt-expressing embryos showed reduced H3K4me3 levels when compared to uninjected embryos (Figure 3B). Furthermore, H3K4me3 ChIP-RTqPCR analysis verified the reduction in H3K4me3 levels following Kdm5bwt treatment around the TSS and in the gene body of candidate ON-memory genes (Figure S2E). We then used Kdm5bwt- and Kdm5bci-expressing neurula-stage endoderm cells as donors to generate NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos and NT(Kdm5bci) embryos, respectively (Figure 3A). As controls, we in vitro fertilized embryos. We collected gastrula stage embryos and subjected them, as well as the endoderm donor cells, to RNA-seq analysis (Figure 3A; Tables S1 and S3). First, we addressed the effect of H3K4 demethylation on gene expression in donor cells. Interestingly, we identified that only 102 out of 24,758 identified transcripts were differentially expressed between Kdm5bWT and Kdm5bci treated donor cells (Table S3). Therefore, changes in H3K4 methylation do not result in strong changes of gene expression levels, as reported previously (Clouaire et al., 2012Clouaire T. Webb S. Skene P. Illingworth R. Kerr A. Andrews R. Lee J.H. Skalnik D. Bird A. Cfp1 integrates both CpG content and gene activity for accurate H3K4me3 deposition in embryonic stem cells.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1714-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Second, we addressed if H3K4 methylation is important for stabilizing an active state of gene expression by evaluating if genes lose resistance to reprogramming as well as their ON-memory state following Kdm5bwt treatment of the donor cell. Transcriptome comparison of Kdm5bci expressing endoderm donor cells, the ectoderm of IVF embryos and NT(Kdm5bci) embryos identified 1,434 reprogramming resistant genes as they were differentially expressed between ectoderm cells of NT(Kdm5bci) and IVF embryos (Figure 3C). By comparison, in NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos, the number of reprogramming resistant genes was substantially reduced, as our analysis identified only 573 differentially expressed genes between the ectoderms of NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos and IVF embryos (Figure 3D). Importantly, Kdm5bwt treatment of the donor cells significantly reduced ON-memory gene expression from 231 ON-memory(3FC) genes in NT(Kdm5bci) embryos (Figure 3C) to 140 ON-memory(3FC) genes in NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos (Figure 3D). While the expression levels of ON-memory genes in the donor tissues was unaffected by the treatment with Kdm5bwt when compared to Kdm5bci, we observed a significant reduction of average ON-memory gene expression levels in NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos when compared to NT(Kdm5bci) embryos (Figures 3E and 3F). Hierarchical clustering (Figure 3G), as well as principal component analysis (PCA) (Figures S2F and S2G) of the transcriptome revealed that three out of seven NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos have a gene expression pattern in their ectoderm cells that is more similar to the one of IVF embryos than to the one of control NT(Kdm5bci) embryos. This implicates that expression of Kdm5bwt in the donor cell reduces ON-memory gene expression and is able to improve the whole transcriptome of the resultant NT embryos. Next, we analyzed the expression of selected candidate ON-memory genes (sox17β, gata6, foxA4, a2m, and darmin) during gastrulation of NT and IVF embryos via qRT-PCR. In donor endoderm cells, ON-memory gene expression was not affected by H3K4 demethylation (Figures S2H–S2L). We observed that ON-memory genes were upregulated in NT(Kdm5bci) ectoderm cells at all stages of gastrula embryos (Figures S2M–S2Q). While sox17β, gata6 and foxA4 showed a decrease in gene expression in NT(Kdm5bwt) ectoderm cells at all stages (Figures S2M–S2O), a2m and darmin were insensitive to Kdm5bwt treatment of the donor cell as they did not show a significant reduction in gene expression in the resultant NT(Kdm5bwt) ectoderm cells when compared to NT(Kdm5bci) ectoderm cells (Figures S2P–S2Q). We propose that this is due to an additional, unknown epigenetic barrier other than H3K4me3, as we could observe that H3K4me3 levels were reduced at the TSS and at the gene body of darmin to a similar extent as of the other, Kdm5bwt sensitive ON-memory genes (Figure S2E). These results corroborate that Kdm5bwt treatment can reduce ON-memory gene expression in the resultant NT embryos throughout gastrulation. Finally, we confirmed that the observed reduction in ON-memory gene expression following Kdm5bwt expression is indeed due to the demethylation of H3K4. We reduced H3K4me3 levels in the donor cells by expressing a dominant-negative version of histone H3.3 (H3.3K4M) that binds and inhibits the SET domain of H3K4-specific methyltransferases (Lewis et al., 2013Lewis P.W. Müller M.M. Koletsky M.S. Cordero F. Lin S. Banaszynski L.A. Garcia B.A. Muir T.W. Becher O.J. Allis C.D. Inhibition of PRC2 activity by a gain-of-function H3 mutation found in pediatric glioblastoma.Science. 2013; 340: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Transcriptome comparison between donor cells, the ectoderm cells of IVF embryos and of the NT(H3.3wt) embryos or NT(H3.3 K4M) embryos corroborated the finding that a reduction of H3K4 methylation decreases ON-memory gene expression in NT embryos (Figure S3; Table S3). Together, our data show that a H3K4 demethylation of donor nuclei not only improves the reprogramming of ON-memory genes but can also restore the global transcriptome of NT embryos. Finally, we investigated whether H3K4 demethylation in donor cells and the associated reduction in ON-memory gene expression in the resultant NT embryos are able to improve their survival. We generated NT embryos from Kdm5bwt- and Kdm5bci-treated donor cells, and while they developed to properly cleaved early gastrula embryos at a similar rate (Figures 4A and 4B ; Table S1), NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos showed fewer morphological abnormalities when compared to NT(Kdm5bci) embryos (Figures 4A and 4B; Table S1) as development proceeded. Notably, NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos reached the feeding tadpole stage and beyond at a significantly higher rate than NT(Kdm5bci) embryos (Figure 4C). The developmental potential of NT(Kdm5bci) embryos was consistent with previous results using uninjected endoderm cells as donors for NT (Gurdon, 1960Gurdon J.B. The developmental capacity of nuclei taken from differentiating endoderm cells of Xenopus laevis.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1960; 8: 505-526PubMed Google Scholar), as 30% of cleaved NT(Kdm5bci) embryos reached the feeding tadpole stage (Figures 4B and 4C). Instead, the developmental outcome of NT(Kdm5bwt) embryos was comparable to the one of NT embryos generated from undifferentiated blastula cells (Gurdon, 1960Gurdon J.B. The developmental capacity of nuclei taken from differentiating endoderm cells of Xenopus laevis.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1960; 8: 505-526PubMed Google Scholar), as 60% of all cleaved embryos reached the feeding tadpole stage (Figures 4B and 4C). These results show that H3K4 methylation acts as a barrier to nuclear reprogramming, and that its removal significantly improves the developmental potential of NT embryos. Our study identifies H3K4 methylation as an epigenetic barrier to nuclear reprogramming and suggests it as a safeguarding mechanism for cellular identity.

https://openalex.org/W2600824926,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in Malaysia, and people with diabetes have been reported to suffer from depression and diabetes distress which influences their self-efficacy in performing diabetes self-care practices. This interviewer administered, cross sectional study, conducted in the district of Hulu Selangor, Malaysia, involving 371 randomly selected patients with type 2 diabetes, recruited from 6 health clinics, aimed to examine a conceptual model regarding the association between depression, diabetes distress and self-efficacy with diabetes self-care practices using the partial least square approach of structural equation modeling. In this study, diabetes self-care practices were similar regardless of sex, age group, ethnicity, education level, diabetes complications or type of diabetes medication. This study found that self-efficacy had a direct effect on diabetes self-care practice (path coefficient = 0.438, p<0.001). Self-care was not directly affected by depression and diabetes distress, but indirectly by depression (path coefficient = -0.115, p<0.01) and diabetes distress (path coefficient = -0.122, p<0.001) via self-efficacy. In conclusion, to improve self-care practices, effort must be focused on enhancing self-efficacy levels, while not forgetting to deal with depression and diabetes distress, especially among those with poorer levels of self-efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2602455567,"ShigaShield™ is a phage preparation composed of five lytic bacteriophages that specifically target pathogenic Shigella species found in contaminated waters and foods. In this study, we examined the efficacy of various doses (9x105-9x107 PFU/g) of ShigaShield™ in removing experimentally added Shigella on deli meat, smoked salmon, pre-cooked chicken, lettuce, melon and yogurt. The highest dose (2x107 or 9x107 PFU/g) of ShigaShield™ applied to each food type resulted in at least 1 log (90%) reduction of Shigella in all the food types. There was significant (P<0.01) reduction in the Shigella levels in all phage treated foods compared to controls, except for the lowest phage dose (9x105 PFU/g) on melon where reduction was only ca. 45% (0.25 log). The genomes of each component phage in the cocktail were fully sequenced and analyzed, and they were found not to contain any ""undesirable genes"" including those listed in the US Code for Federal Regulations (40 CFR Ch1). Our data suggest that ShigaShield™ (and similar phage preparations with potent lytic activity against Shigella spp.) may offer a safe and effective approach for reducing the levels of Shigella in various foods that may be contaminated with the bacterium."

This study aimed to investigate this relationship in 1,351 Western Australian children between 6 and 17 years of age. All participants had computer access at school and 98.9% at home. Neighbourhood SES was related to computer use, IT activities, playing musical instruments, and participating in vigorous physical activity. Participants from higher SES neighbourhoods were more exposed to school computers, reading, playing musical instruments, and vigorous physical activity. Participants from lower SES neighbourhoods were more exposed to TV, electronic games, mobile phones, and non-academic computer activities at home. These patterns may impact future economic, academic, and health outcomes. Better insight into neighbourhood SES influences will assist in understanding and managing the impact of computer use on young people’s health and development."
https://openalex.org/W2599584940,"Blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and gonad-derived embryonic germ cells (EGCs) represent two classic types of pluripotent cell lines, yet their molecular equivalence remains incompletely understood. Here, we compare genome-wide methylation patterns between isogenic ESC and EGC lines to define epigenetic similarities and differences. Surprisingly, we find that sex rather than cell type drives methylation patterns in ESCs and EGCs. Cell fusion experiments further reveal that the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes dictates methylation levels, with female hybrids being hypomethylated and male hybrids being hypermethylated. We show that the X-linked MAPK phosphatase DUSP9 is upregulated in female compared to male ESCs, and its heterozygous loss in female ESCs leads to male-like methylation levels. However, male and female blastocysts are similarly hypomethylated, indicating that sex-specific methylation differences arise in culture. Collectively, our data demonstrate the epigenetic similarity of sex-matched ESCs and EGCs and identify DUSP9 as a regulator of female-specific hypomethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2603446044,"Anoctamin 1 (ANO1), a calcium-activated chloride channel, is highly amplified in prostate cancer, the most common form of cancer and leading causes of cancer death in men, and downregulation of ANO1 expression or its functional activity is known to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Here, we performed a cell-based screening for the identification of ANO1 inhibitors as potential anticancer therapeutic agents for prostate cancer. Screening of ~300 selected bioactive natural products revealed that luteolin is a novel potent inhibitor of ANO1. Electrophysiological studies indicated that luteolin potently inhibited ANO1 chloride channel activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 9.8 μM and luteolin did not alter intracellular calcium signaling in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Luteolin inhibited cell proliferation and migration of PC-3 cells expressing high levels of ANO1 more potently than that of ANO1-deficient PC-3 cells. Notably, luteolin not only inhibited ANO1 channel activity, but also strongly decreased protein expression levels of ANO1. Our results suggest that downregulation of ANO1 by luteolin is a potential mechanism for the anticancer effect of luteolin."

We have shown previously that circulating galectin-3, which is increased up to 30-fold in cancer patients, promotes blood-borne metastasis in an animal cancer model. This effect is partly attributable to the interaction of galectin-3 with unknown receptor(s) on vascular endothelial cells and causes endothelial secretion of several metastasis-promoting cytokines. Here we sought to identify the galectin-3-binding molecule(s) on the endothelial cell surface responsible for the galectin-3-mediated cytokine secretion. Using two different galectin-3 affinity purification processes, we extracted four cell membrane glycoproteins, CD146/melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM)/MUC18, CD31/platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), CD144/VE-cadherin, and CD106/Endoglin, from vascular endothelial cells. CD146 was the major galectin-3-binding ligand and strongly co-localized with galectin-3 on endothelial cell surfaces treated with exogenous galectin-3. Moreover, galectin-3 bound to N-linked glycans on CD146 and induced CD146 dimerization and subsequent activation of AKT signaling. siRNA-mediated suppression of CD146 expression completely abolished the galectin-3-induced secretion of IL-6 and G-CSF cytokines from the endothelial cells. Thus, CD146/MCAM is the functional galectin-3-binding ligand on endothelial cell surfaces responsible for galectin-3-induced secretion of metastasis-promoting cytokines.

Therefore, here we assessed whether the yeast Pry1 protein binds fatty acids. Computational modeling and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the mode of fatty acid binding is conserved between tablysin-15 and Pry1. Pry1 bound fatty acids with micromolar affinity in vitro, and its function was essential for fatty acid export in cells lacking the acyl-CoA synthetases Faa1 and Faa4. Fatty acid binding of Pry1 is independent of its capacity to bind sterols, and the two sterol- and fatty acid-binding sites are nonoverlapping. These results indicate that some CAP family members, such as Pry1, can bind different lipids, particularly sterols and fatty acids, at distinct binding sites, suggesting that the CAP domain may serve as a stable, secreted protein domain that can accommodate multiple ligand-binding sites.

https://openalex.org/W2598044883,"It has been proposed that estrogen regulates the mechanosensitivity of osteocytes; however, the effects of estrogen deficiency that arises during postmenopausal osteoporosis on mechanical stimulation–induced calcium signaling in osteocytes remain elusive. Here, we pretreated MLO-Y4 osteocytes with 10 nM E2 for 2, 3 and 5 d, then simulated postmenopausal conditions either by estrogen withdrawal (EW) from culture medium, or by inhibiting the estrogen receptor by using fulvestrant and estrogen (FE; ICI 182,780) in vitro. We investigated [Ca2+]i oscillations and mechanobiologic responses of osteocytes (EW and FE) that were exposed to oscillatory fluid flow (OFF; 1 Pa, 0.5 Hz). We demonstrated that estrogen treatment enhanced OFF-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations and that this effect was abrogated both by FE and EW. Moreover, osteocytes in both estrogen-depleted groups (EW and FE) had reduced levels of NO and prostaglandin E2 release, down-regulated dentin matrix protein-1, sclerostin, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression, and reduced F-actin fiber formation after OFF stimulation compared with estrogen-treated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2599487202,"Knowledge about sexual segregation and gender-specific, or indeed individual specialization, in marine organisms has improved considerably in the past decade. In this context, we tested the “Intersexual Competition Hypothesis” for penguins by investigating the feeding ecology of Gentoo penguins during their austral winter non-breeding season. We considered this during unusual environmental conditions (i.e. the year 2009 had observations of high sea surface and air temperatures) in comparison with the long term average at Bird Island, South Georgia. Through conventional (i.e. stomach contents) and stable isotopic values from red blood cells, plasma and feathers of both male and female Gentoo penguins, we showed that there were significant differences between sexes, with males feeding mainly on fish (54% by mass) followed by crustaceans (38%) whereas females fed mainly on crustaceans (89% by mass) followed by fish (4%). Themisto gaudichaudii was the most important crustacean prey for males (64% by mass; 82% by number; 53% by frequency of occurrence) and females (63% by mass; 77% by number; 89% by frequency of occurrence), contrasting with all previous studies that found Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were generally the main prey. Stable isotopic data showed that, in terms of habitat use (based on δ 13C), there were significant differences in short-term carbon signatures between males and females (based on plasma and red blood cells), suggesting that both sexes explored different habitats, with females exploring more offshore pelagic waters and males feeding more in coastal benthic waters. Based on δ 15N, males fed on significantly higher trophic level than females (based on plasma and red blood cells), in agreement with our diet results., Thus, Gentoo penguins behave in a similar manner to other non-breeding penguins species (e.g. king, macaroni and rockhopper penguins), albeit at a smaller spatial scale (as they do not disperse as these other penguins do), in that they have a wider habitat and trophic niche during the Antarctic Winter (in comparison to Summer). We also detected individual specialization in feeding/trophic levels for each gender, with certain males feeding mainly on fish and certain females mainly on crustaceans, which may be driven the prevailing environmental conditions that lead individuals to search for alternative prey, and cause sexual diet segregation. Our results provide further information to help improve understanding about sexual segregation and individual specialization of marine organisms, while contributing valuable information on the winter diet for Antarctic monitoring programs and for modelling Antarctic marine food webs."
https://openalex.org/W2597804221,"Background Women attending antenatal care (ANC) in resource-limited countries are frequently screened for syphilis and HIV, but rarely for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We assessed the prevalence of curable STIs, defined as infection with either Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Trichomonas vaginalis, from July to September 2015. Methods In a cross-sectional study, women attending ANC at the Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, had a urine sample tested for C. trachomatis/N. gonorrhoeae by GeneXpert® and a vaginal swab for T. vaginalis by culture. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was defined as a Nugent score of 7–10 of the Gram stain of a vaginal smear in combination with self-reported vaginal discharge. Genital ulcers were observed during collection of vaginal swabs. All women responded to questions on socio-demographics and sexual health and clinical symptoms of STIs. Predictors for curable STIs were assessed in multivariable logistic regression. Results A total of 42/202 (20.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI):15.4–27.0) women had a curable STI. The prevalence was 14.9% for C. trachomatis (95% CI:10.2–20.5), 1.0% for N. gonorrhoeae (95% CI: 0.1–3.5), 7.4% for T. vaginalis (95% CI:4.2–12.0), 19.3% for BV (95% CI: 14.1–25.4) and 2.5% for genital ulcers (95% CI: 0.8–5.7). Predictors for infection with curable STIs included women with a genital ulcer (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 35.0, 95% CI: 2.7–461.6) compared to women without a genital ulcer, women who used water for cleaning after visiting the toilet compared to those who used toilet paper or other solid means (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI:1.5–11.3), women who reported having sexual debut ≤ 17 years compared to women having sexual debut ≥18 years (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI:1.1–6.6), and BV-positive women (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI:1.1–6.6) compared to BV-negative women. Conclusion One in five women attending ANC had a curable STI. These infections were associated with genital ulcers, hygiene practices, early sexual debut and bacterial vaginosis."

Identifying PDI substrates is challenging because PDI catalyzes conformational changes that cannot be easily monitored (e.g. compared with proteolytic cleavage or amino acid phosphorylation); PDI has multiple substrates; and it can catalyze either oxidation, reduction, or isomerization of substrates. Kinetic-based substrate trapping wherein the active site motif CGHC is modified to CGHA to stabilize a PDI-substrate intermediate is effective in identifying some substrates. A limitation of this approach, however, is that it captures only substrates that are reduced by PDI, whereas many substrates are oxidized by PDI. By manipulating the highly conserved -GH- residues in the CGHC active site of PDI, we created PDI variants with a slowed reaction rate toward substrates. The prolonged intermediate state allowed us to identify protein substrates that have biased affinities for either oxidation or reduction by PDI. Because extracellular PDI is critical for thrombus formation but its extracellular substrates are not known, we evaluated the ability of these bidirectional trapping PDI variants to trap proteins released from platelets and on the platelet surface. Trapped proteins were identified by mass spectroscopy. Of the trapped substrate proteins identified by mass spectroscopy, five proteins, cathepsin G, glutaredoxin-1, thioredoxin, GP1b, and fibrinogen, showed a bias for oxidation, whereas annexin V, heparanase, ERp57, kallekrein-14, serpin B6, tetranectin, and collagen VI showed a bias for reduction.

https://openalex.org/W2602242389,"Phosphorus is an essential nutrient involved in many pathobiological processes. Less than 1% of phosphorus is found in extracellular fluids as inorganic phosphate ion (Pi) in solution. High serum Pi level promotes ectopic calcification in many tissues, including blood vessels. Here, we studied the effect of elevated Pi concentration on macrophage polarization and calcification. Macrophages, present in virtually all tissues, play key roles in health and disease and display remarkable plasticity, being able to change their physiology in response to environmental cues.High-throughput transcriptomic analysis and functional studies demonstrated that Pi induces unpolarized macrophages to adopt a phenotype closely resembling that of alternatively-activated M2 macrophages, as revealed by arginine hydrolysis and energetic and antioxidant profiles. Pi-induced macrophages showed an anti-calcifying action mediated by increased availability of extracellular ATP and pyrophosphate.We conclude that the ability of Pi-activated macrophages to prevent calcium-phosphate deposition is a compensatory mechanism protecting tissues from hyperphosphatemia-induced pathologic calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2598928966,"The development of GPS tags for tracking wildlife has revolutionised the study of home ranges, habitat use and behaviour. Concomitantly, there have been rapid developments in methods for estimating habitat use from GPS data. In combination, these changes can cause challenges in choosing the best methods for estimating home ranges. In primatology, this issue has received little attention, as there have been few GPS collar-based studies to date. However, as advancing technology is making collaring studies more feasible, there is a need for the analysis to advance alongside the technology. Here, using a high quality GPS collaring data set from 10 proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus), we aimed to: 1) compare home range estimates from the most commonly used method in primatology, the grid-cell method, with three recent methods designed for large and/or temporally correlated GPS data sets; 2) evaluate how well these methods identify known physical barriers (e.g. rivers); and 3) test the robustness of the different methods to data containing either less frequent or random losses of GPS fixes. Biased random bridges had the best overall performance, combining a high level of agreement between the raw data and estimated utilisation distribution with a relatively low sensitivity to reduced fixed frequency or loss of data. It estimated the home range of proboscis monkeys to be 24–165 ha (mean 80.89 ha). The grid-cell method and approaches based on local convex hulls had some advantages including simplicity and excellent barrier identification, respectively, but lower overall performance. With the most suitable model, or combination of models, it is possible to understand more fully the patterns, causes, and potential consequences that disturbances could have on an animal, and accordingly be used to assist in the management and restoration of degraded landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2600897277,"Exposure to armed conflict and/or war have been linked to an increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) against women. A substantial body of work has focused on non-partner rape and sexual violence in war and post-war contexts, but research about IPV is limited, particularly in Asian settings. This paper presents the finding of a study conducted in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. The study explored women's experiences of and responses to IPV as well as how health and social service providers perceive the problem. It also explored the IPV-related services and supports available after the end of a 30-year civil war.We conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews with 15 women who had experienced IPV and 15 service providers who were knowledgeable about IPV in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. Interviews were translated into English, coded and organized using NVivo8, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.Participants described IPV as a widespread but hidden problem. Women had experienced various forms of abusive and controlling behaviours, some of which reflect the reality of living in the post-war context. The psychological effects of IPV were common, but were often attributed to war-related trauma. Some men used violence to control women and to reinstate power when their gender roles were reversed or challenged due to war and post-war changes in livelihoods. While some service providers perceived an increase in awareness about IPV and more services to address it, this was discordant with women's fears, feelings of oppression, and perception of a lack of redress from IPV within a highly militarized and ethnically-polarized society. Most women did not consider leaving an abusive relationship to be an option, due to realistic fears about their vulnerability to community violence, the widespread social norms that would cast them as outsiders, and the limited availability of related services and supports.These findings revealed the need for more research about IPV in post-war contexts. Women's experiences in such contexts are influenced and may be masked by a complex set of factors that intersect to produce IPV and entrap women in violence. A more nuanced understanding of the context-specific issues that shape women's experiences of IPV- and community responses to it-is needed to develop more comprehensive solutions that are relevant to the local context."
https://openalex.org/W2604348366,"Inborn defects in DNA repair are associated with complex developmental disorders whose causal mechanisms are poorly understood. Using an in vivo biotinylation tagging approach in mice, we show that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF complex interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF, the cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3 and with MBD2; the factors co-localize with ATRX at the promoters and control regions (ICRs) of imprinted genes during postnatal hepatic development. Loss of Ercc1 or exposure to MMC triggers the localization of CTCF to heterochromatin, the dissociation of the CTCF-cohesin complex and ATRX from promoters and ICRs, altered histone marks and the aberrant developmental expression of imprinted genes without altering DNA methylation. We propose that ERCC1-XPF cooperates with CTCF and cohesin to facilitate the developmental silencing of imprinted genes and that persistent DNA damage triggers chromatin changes that affect gene expression programs associated with NER disorders."

In this study, EPDCs from post-MI rat hearts highly expressed the ectoenzyme CD73 and secreted the profibrotic matricellular protein tenascin-C (TNC). CD73 on EPDCs extensively generated adenosine from both extracellular ATP and NAD. This in turn stimulated the release of additional nucleotides from a Brefeldin A-sensitive intracellular pool via adenosine-A2BR signaling, forming a positive-feedback loop. A2BR activation, in addition, strongly promoted the release of major regulatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-11, and VEGF. TNC was found to stimulate EPDC migration and, together with ATPP2X7R signaling, to activate inflammasomes in EPDCs via TLR4.

An effective treatment response was a ≥2% reduction in body weight on day 7. The association of patient pretreatment characteristics with therapeutic effects was analyzed.Mean weight reduction on day 7 of tolvaptan therapy was -2.9% ± 3.2%, and treatment was effective in 52% of patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 at baseline was the only factor independently related to therapeutic effect, with an odds ratio of 7.85 (95% confidence interval 2.64-23.40, p = 0.0002). Weight reduction percentage on day 7 was -4.0% ± 2.8% in patients with spot urine Na/K ≥2.5, which was significantly greater than the 0.7% ± 2.7% loss in those with urine Na/K < 2.5 (p < 0.05). A spot urine Na/K ratio ≥2.5 had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 60% for predicting effective treatment. No adverse events of treatment led to treatment discontinuation.Baseline spot urine Na/K was predictive of an effective response to tolvaptan therapy. It is simple to perform and readily available and might serve as an indicator of optimal timing of tolvaptan administration in patients with inadequate response to conventional Na diuretic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2600268576,"miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3′-UTR of genes. Many recent studies have reported that miRNAs play important biological roles by regulating specific mRNAs or genes. Many sequence-based target prediction algorithms have been developed to predict miRNA targets. However, these methods are not designed for condition-specific target predictions and produce many false positives; thus, expression-based target prediction algorithms have been developed for condition-specific target predictions. A typical strategy to utilize expression data is to leverage the negative control roles of miRNAs on genes. To control false positives, a stringent cutoff value is typically set, but in this case, these methods tend to reject many true target relationships, i.e., false negatives. To overcome these limitations, additional information should be utilized. The literature is probably the best resource that we can utilize. Recent literature mining systems compile millions of articles with experiments designed for specific biological questions, and the systems provide a function to search for specific information. To utilize the literature information, we used a literature mining system, BEST, that automatically extracts information from the literature in PubMed and that allows the user to perform searches of the literature with any English words. By integrating omics data analysis methods and BEST, we developed Context-MMIA, a miRNA-mRNA target prediction method that combines expression data analysis results and the literature information extracted based on the user-specified context. In the pathway enrichment analysis using genes included in the top 200 miRNA-targets, Context-MMIA outperformed the four existing target prediction methods that we tested. In another test on whether prediction methods can re-produce experimentally validated target relationships, Context-MMIA outperformed the four existing target prediction methods. In summary, Context-MMIA allows the user to specify a context of the experimental data to predict miRNA targets, and we believe that Context-MMIA is very useful for predicting condition-specific miRNA targets."
https://openalex.org/W2598356327,"The genus Borrelia comprises arthropod-borne bacteria, which are infectious agents in vertebrates. They are mainly transmitted by ixodid or argasid ticks. In Hokkaido, Japan, Borrelia spp. were found in deer and Haemaphysalis ticks between 2011 and 2013; however, the study was limited to a particular area. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted large-scale surveillance of ticks and wild animals in the western part of the main island of Japan. We collected 6,407 host-seeking ticks from two regions and 1,598 larvae obtained from 32 engorged female ticks and examined them to elucidate transovarial transmission. In addition, we examined whole blood samples from 190 wild boars and 276 sika deer, as well as sera from 120 wild raccoons. We detected Borrelia spp. in Haemaphysalis flava, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa, Haemaphysalis kitaokai, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis formosensis. In addition, we isolated a strain from H. megaspinosa using Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. The minimum infection rate of ticks was less than 5%. Transovarial transmission was observed in H. kitaokai. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolated strain and DNA fragments amplified from ticks identified at least four bacterial genotypes, which corresponded to the tick species detected. Bacteria were detected in 8.4%, 15%, and 0.8% of wild boars, sika deer, and raccoons, respectively. In this study, we found seasonal differences in the prevalence of bacterial genotypes in sika deer during the winter and summer. The tick activity season corresponds to the season with a high prevalence of animals. The present study suggests that a particular bacterial genotype detected in this study are defined by a particular tick species in which they are present."

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) has an important role in pancreatic β-cells, and mutations of the human HNF4A gene cause a type of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1). However, it remains unclear whether hypoxia affects the expression of HNF4α in β-cells. Here, we report that hypoxia reduces HNF4α protein expression in β-cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor was not involved in the down-regulation of HNF4α under hypoxic conditions. The down-regulation of HNF4α was dependent on the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the reduction of HNF4α protein expression by metformin, an AMPK activator, and hypoxia was inhibited by the overexpression of a kinase-dead (KD) form of AMPKα2. In addition, hypoxia decreased the stability of the HNF4α protein, and the down-regulation of HNF4α was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KD-AMPKα2 improved insulin secretion in metformin-treated islets, hypoxic islets, and ob/ob mouse islets. These results suggest that down-regulation of HNF4α could be of importance in β-cell dysfunction by hypoxia. Hypoxia plays a role in the deterioration of β-cell function.

The long yellow daylily, Hemerocallis citrina Baroni. is rich in beneficial secondary metabolites and is considered as a functional vegetable. It is widely cultivated and consumed in East Asian countries. However, reference genes for use in RT-qPCR in H. citrina are not available. In the present study, six potential reference genes, actin (ACT), AP-4 complex subunit (AP4), tubulin (TUB), ubiquitin (UBQ), 18S and 60S ribosomal RNA, were selected and their expression stability in different developmental stages, organs and accessions was evaluated using four statistical software packages (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). For commercial flower buds of different landraces, the combination of 60S, TUB, and AP4 was appropriate whereas ACT and 60S was suitable for normalization of different organs. In addition, AP4 exhibited the most stable expression in flower buds among different developmental stages. UBQ was less stable than the other reference genes under the experimental conditions except under different organs was 18S. The relative expression levels of two genes, primary-amine oxidase (HcAOC3) and tyrosine aminotransferase (HcTAT) which play important roles in alkaloid biosynthesis were also examined in different organs of the 'Datong' landrace, which further confirmed the results of selected reference genes. This is the first report to evaluate the stability of reference genes in the long yellow daylily that can serve as a foundation for RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in this species."

We examined the incidence, risk, and associated factors of depression in Taiwanese adults with physical/sensory disabilities.Two national databases were used to retrospectively analyze 749,491 ≥20-year-old Taiwanese with physical/sensory disabilities in 2002-2008. The incidence of depression was analyzed by univariate Poisson regression. Risk factors of depression were followed up through 2014 and examined with a Cox proportional hazards model.Among the study subjects, the incidence of depression was 6.29 per 1000 person-years, with 1.83 per 1000 person-years corresponding to major depression. The subjects' depression risk was affected by disability type, disability severity, gender, age, education, marital status, aboriginal status, monthly salary, residence urbanization level, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Subjects with rare diseases, mild disability, female gender, age 35-44 years, a high school education level, divorced/widowed status, non-aboriginal status, a NT$22,801-28,800 monthly salary, a highly urbanized residence area, or a CCI≥3 were at higher risk for depression.Adults with physical/sensory disabilities have a 3.7-fold higher incidence of depression than the general population.

One unusual feature of DQ2.5 is its high class-II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) content. Moreover, HLA-DQ2.5 preferentially binds the non-canonical CLIP2 over the canonical CLIP1. To better understand the structural basis of HLA-DQ2.5's unusual CLIP association characteristics, better insight into the HLA-DQ2.5·CLIP complex structures is required. To this end, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the HLA-DQ2.5· CLIP1 and HLA-DQ2.5·CLIP2 complexes at 2.73 and 2.20 Å, respectively. We found that HLA-DQ2.5 has an unusually large P4 pocket and a positively charged peptide-binding groove that together promote preferential binding of CLIP2 over CLIP1. An α9-α22-α24-α31-β86-β90 hydrogen bond network located at the bottom of the peptide-binding groove, spanning from the P1 to P4 pockets, renders the residues in this region relatively immobile. This hydrogen bond network, along with a deletion mutation at α53, may lead to HLA-DM insensitivity in HLA-DQ2.5.

https://openalex.org/W2597895164,"Feeding decisions are highly plastic and bidirectionally regulated by neurons that either promote or inhibit feeding. In Drosophila melanogaster, recent studies have identified four GABAergic interneurons that act as critical brakes to prevent incessant feeding. These GABAergic neurons may inhibit target neurons that drive consumption. Here, we tested this hypothesis by examining GABA receptors and neurons that promote consumption. We find that Resistance to dieldrin (RDL), a GABAA type receptor, is required for proper control of ingestion. Knockdown of Rdl in a subset of neurons causes overconsumption of tastants. Acute activation of these neurons is sufficient to drive consumption of appetitive substances and non-appetitive substances and acute silencing of these neurons decreases consumption. Taken together, these studies identify GABAA receptor-expressing neurons that promote Drosophila ingestive behavior and provide insight into feeding regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2600693036,"Due to their relatively homogeneous lifestyle and living environment, the Amish offer a novel opportunity to study the health associations of tobacco smoke exposure, particularly secondhand smoke. We hypothesized that secondhand smoke exposure is associated with worse pulmonary and cardiometabolic health. We examined cross-sectional data on 3568 Amish study participants, including tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure from family members included in the study. Thirty-four percent of Amish men reported ever smoking. Of this proportion, 64% used cigars, 46% cigarettes, and 21% pipes. Less than 1% of women reported ever smoking. Smoking was associated with lower spirometric lung function, higher body mass index, lower HDL cholesterol, higher heart rate, lower ankle-brachial index, and larger aortic diameter in men. A greater number of sources of secondhand smoke exposure (defined from the total of spouses, parents, and siblings who smoke) was associated with higher body mass index (p = 0.03) and with higher fasting glucose in men (p = 0.01), but not in women (p = 0.007 for sex*secondhand smoke interaction). Secondhand smoke exposure was also associated with reduced HDL cholesterol only in women (p = 0.002) and a lower heart rate only in men (p = 0.006). Smoking habits among the Old Order Amish are notable for the absence of female participation and a high proportion of cigar and pipe use. Smoking is associated with decreased spirometric indices of lung function and increased cardiovascular risk in this population and secondhand smoke exposure is associated with a greater burden of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Sex differences in correlations could reflect differences in exposure patterns, mechanisms, or susceptibilities."

However, little is known about how energy metabolism and antioxidant systems are altered in anoikis-resistant (AR) HCC cells. We evaluated anti-tumor effects of a combination treatment of 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in AR HCC cells.We compared glycolysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and chemoresistance among Huh-BAT, HepG2 HCC cells, and the corresponding AR cells. Expression of hexokinase II, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (rGCS), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in AR cells was assessed. Anti-tumor effects of a combination treatment of 3-BP and BSO were evaluated in AR cells and an HCC xenograft mouse model.AR HCC cells showed significantly higher chemoresistance, glycolysis and lower ROS production than attached cells. Expression of hexokinase II, rGCS, and EMT markers was higher in AR HCC cells than attached cells. A combination treatment of 3-BP/BSO effectively suppressed proliferation of AR HCC cells through apoptosis by blocking glycolysis and enhancing ROS levels. In xenograft mouse models, tumor growth derived from AR HCC cells was significantly suppressed in the group treated with 3-BP/BSO compared to the group treated with 3-BP or sorafenib.These results demonstrated that a combination treatment of 3-BP/BSO had a synergistic anti-tumor effect in an AR HCC model. This strategy may be an effective adjuvant therapy for patients with sorafenib-resistant HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2602359618,"The filamentous fungus Lomentospora (Scedosporium) prolificans is an emerging opportunistic pathogen associated with fatal infections in patients with disturbed immune function. Unfortunately, conventional therapies are hardly of any use against this fungus due to its intrinsic resistance. Therefore, we performed an integrated study of the L. prolificans responses to the first option to treat these mycoses, namely voriconazole, with the aim of unveiling mechanisms involved in the resistance to this compound. To do that, we used a wide range of techniques, including fluorescence and electron microscopy to study morphological alterations, ion chromatography to measure changes in cell-wall carbohydrate composition, and proteomics-based techniques to identify the proteins differentially expressed under the presence of the drug. Significantly, we showed drastic changes occurring in cell shape after voriconazole exposure, L. prolificans hyphae being shorter and wider than under control conditions. Interestingly, we proved that the architecture and carbohydrate composition of the cell wall had been modified in the presence of the drug. Specifically, L. prolificans constructed a more complex organelle with a higher presence of glucans and mannans. In addition to this, we identified several differentially expressed proteins, including Srp1 and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), as the most overexpressed under voriconazole-induced stress conditions. The mechanisms described in this study, which may be directly related to L. prolificans antifungal resistance or tolerance, could be used as targets to improve existing therapies or to develop new ones in order to successfully eliminate these mycoses."
https://openalex.org/W2603754581,"Inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) are associated with accelerated coronary artery disease (CAD), which may result from both systemic and vascular wall inflammation. There are indications that complement may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAD in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study aimed to evaluate the associations between circulating complement and complement activation products with mononuclear cell infiltrates (MCI, surrogate marker of vascular inflammation) in the aortic media and adventitia in IRDCAD and non-IRDCAD patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Furthermore, we compared complement activation product deposition patterns in rare aorta adventitial and medial biopsies from SLE, RA and non-IRD patients.We examined plasma C3 (p-C3) and terminal complement complexes (p-TCC) in 28 IRDCAD (SLE = 3; RA = 25), 52 non-IRDCAD patients, and 32 IRDNo CAD (RA = 32) from the Feiring Heart Biopsy Study. Aortic biopsies taken from the CAD only patients during CABG were previously evaluated for adventitial MCIs. The rare aortic biopsies from 3 SLE, 3 RA and 3 non-IRDCAD were assessed for the presence of C3 and C3d using immunohistochemistry.IRDCAD patients had higher p-TCC than non-IRDCAD or IRDNo CAD patients (p<0.0001), but a similar p-C3 level (p = 0.42). Circulating C3 was associated with IRD duration (ρ, p-value: 0.46, 0.03). In multiple logistic regression analysis, IRD remained significantly related to the presence and size of MCI (p<0.05). C3 was present in all tissue samples. C3d was detected in the media of all patients and only in the adventitia of IRD patients (diffuse in all SLE and focal in one RA).The independent association of IRD status with MCI and the observed C3d deposition supports the unique relationship between rheumatic disease, and, in particular, SLE with the complement system. Exaggerated systemic and vascular complement activation may accelerate CVD, serve as a CVD biomarker, and represent a target for new therapies."

We amplified a cDNA from the salivary glands of the tropical bont tick (Amblyomma variegatum) using primers based on the variegin sequence, which we previously identified as a novel thrombin inhibitor from the same tick species. The transcript encodes a precursor protein comprising a signal peptide and 5 repeats of variegin-like sequences that could be processed into multiple short peptides. These peptides share 31 to 34% identity with variegin. Here, we structurally and functionally characterized one of these peptides named ""avathrin."" Avathrin is a fast, tight binding competitive inhibitor with an affinity of 545 pM for thrombin and is 4 orders of magnitude more selective towards thrombin than to the other serine proteases of the coagulation cascade. The crystal structure of thrombin-avathrin complex at 2.09 Å revealed that avathrin interacts with the thrombin active site and exosite-I. Although avathrin is cleaved by thrombin, the C-terminal cleavage product continues to exert prolonged inhibition. Avathrin is more potent than hirulog-1 in a murine carotid artery thrombosis model. Such precursor proteins that could be processed into multiple thrombin inhibiting peptides appear to be widespread among Amblyomminae, providing an enormous library of molecules for development as potent antithrombotics.-Iyer, J.

Asymmetric segregation of polar domain at 8-16 cell division generate two cell types, polar cells which adopt an outer position and develop in TE and apolar cells which are allocated to inner position as the precursors of ICM. It is still not know when the blastomeres of 8-cell stage start to be determined to undergo asymmetric division. Here, we analyze the frequency of symmetric and asymmetric divisions of blastomeres isolated from 8-cell stage embryo before and after compaction. Using p-Ezrin as the polarity marker we found that size of blastomeres in 2/16 pairs cannot be used as a criterion for distinguishing symmetric and asymmetric divisions. Our results showed that at early 8-cell stage, before any visible signs of cortical polarity, a subset of blastomeres had been already predestined to divide asymmetrically. We also showed that almost all of 8-cell stage blastomeres isolated from compacted embryo divide asymmetrically, whereas in intact embryos, the frequency of asymmetric divisions is significantly lower. Therefore we conclude that in intact embryo the frequency of symmetric and asymmetric division is regulated by cell-cell interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2601043908,"Background Serum infliximab (IFX) and antibody-to-infliximab (ATI) levels are objective parameters, that may have a great role in the therapeutic decisions during maintenance biological therapy. Research design and methods 48 inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving maintenance IFX therapy were prospectively enrolled and divided into adequate (complete remission N = 20) and inadequate responder (partial response, loss of response, dose escalation; N = 28) groups. Blood samples were collected just before (trough level, TL) and two (W2aTL) and six weeks (W6aTL) after the administration of IFX. Results Single measurement of ATI titer was insufficient for predicting therapeutic response due to transient expression of ATI, however, using the three points’ measurements, significant difference has been detected between the adequate and inadequate responder group (5.0% vs 35.7%; p = 0.016). The mean value of TL was significantly higher in the adequate responder group (3.11±1.64 vs.1.19±1.11; p<0.001) without further difference on the second and sixth week. Sensitivity and specificity for predicting the therapeutic response were 85.0% and 71.4% based on the cut-off value of TL 2.0 μg/ml. Conclusion Simultaneous measurement of serum IFX level prior to administration of regular IFX infusion and ATI titers significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy for the therapeutic decision in patients uncertainly responding to the therapy. The measurement of W2aTL and W6aTL levels did not result in further improvement in the prediction of therapeutic response."
https://openalex.org/W2602487141,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by immune-mediated damage of myelin sheath. Current therapies aim to block such immune responses. However, this blocking is not sufficiently specific and hence compromises immunity, leading to severe side effects. In addition, blocking medications usually provide transient effects and require frequent administration, which further increases the chance to compromise immunity. In this regard, myelin-specific therapy may provide the desired specificity and a long-lasting therapeutic effect by inducing myelin-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells. Tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDCs) are one such therapy. However, ex vivo generated TolDCs may be converted into immunogenic DCs in a proinflammatory environment. In this study, we identified a potential novel myelin-specific therapy that works with immunogenic DCs, hence without the in vivo conversion concern. We showed that immunization with DCs, engineered to overexpress 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase for de novo synthesis of a focally high 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, induced Treg cells. In addition, such engineered DCs, when pulsed with a myelin antigen, led to myelin-specific suppression of ongoing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (an MS animal model), and the disease suppression depended on forkhead-box-protein-P3(foxp3)+ Treg cells.

https://openalex.org/W2601238620,"Total duration of stay adjusted for percentage of the total body surface area burned (TBSA%) is a commonly used outcome measure in burn care. However, it has been criticised as it is affected by many factors, some of which are not strictly part of burn care. A division into operative stay and postoperative stay may improve this measure. The aim was to evaluate if operative stay can serve as a more standardised measure by: comparing the variation in operative stay/TBSA% with the variation in total stay/TBSA%, and to study different factors associated with operative stay and postoperative stay. Patients and methods Surgically managed burn patients admitted between 2010–14 were included. Operative stay was defined as the time from admission until the last operation, postoperative stay as the time from the last operation until discharge. The difference in variation was analysed with F-test. A retrospective review of medical records was done to explore reasons for extended postoperative stay. Multivariable regression was used to assess factors associated with operative stay and postoperative stay. Results Operative stay/TBSA% showed less variation than total duration/TBSA% (F test = 2.38, p<0.01). The size of the burn, and the number of operations, were the independent factors that influenced operative stay (R2 0.65). Except for the size of the burn other factors were associated with duration of postoperative stay: wound related, psychological and other medical causes, advanced medical support, and accommodation arrangements before discharge, of which the two last were the most important with an increase of (mean) 12 and 17 days (p<0.001, R2 0.51). Conclusion Adjusted operative stay showed less variation than total hospital stay and thus can be considered a more accurate outcome measure for surgically managed burns. The size of burn and number of operations are the factors affecting this outcome measure."
https://openalex.org/W2603244499,"Introduction About 2.5 million men have voluntarily been circumcised since Uganda started implementing the WHO recommendation to scale up safe male circumcision to reduce HIV transmission. This study sought to understand what influences men's circumcision decisions, their experiences with health education at health facilities and their knowledge of partial HIV risk reduction in Wakiso district. Methods Data were collected in May and June 2015 at five public health facilities in Wakiso District. Twenty-five in-depth interviews were held with adult safe male circumcision clients. Data were analysed using thematic network analysis. Findings Safe male circumcision decisions were mainly influenced by sexual partners, a perceived need to reduce the risk of HIV/STIs, community pressure and other benefits like hygiene. Sexual partners directly requested men to circumcise or indirectly influenced them in varied ways. Health education at facilities mainly focused on the surgical procedure, circumcision benefits especially HIV risk reduction, wound care and time to resumption of sex, with less focus on post-circumcision sexual behaviour. Five men reported no health education. All men reported that circumcision only reduces and does not eliminate HIV risk, and could mention ways it protects, although some extended the benefit to direct protection for women and prevention of other STIs. Five men thought social marketing messages were ‘misleading’ and feared risk compensation within the community. Conclusions Participants reported positive community perception about safe male circumcision campaigns, influencing men to seek services and enabling female partners to impact this decision-making process. However, there seemed to be gaps in safe male circumcision health education, although all participants correctly understood that circumcision offers only partial protection from HIV. Standard health education procedures, if followed at health facilities offering safe male circumcision, would ensure all clients are well informed, especially about post-circumcision sexual behaviour that is key to prevention of risk compensation."

From the crystal structure viewpoint the observation emerges that PpcA protein can bind with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not. But it is yet to be established with certainty the reason behind this from primary protein sequence information. This study is primarily based on primary protein sequence analysis through the chemical basis of embedded amino acids. Firstly, we look for the chemical group specific score of amino acids. Along with this, we have developed a new methodology for the phylogenetic analysis based on chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids. This new methodology is applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and pinpoint how a particular sequence is differing with others. Secondly, we build a graph theoretic model on using amino acid sequences which is also applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and some unique characteristics and their domains are highlighted. Thirdly, we search for unique patterns as subsequences which are common among the group or specific individual member. In all the cases, we are able to show some distinct features of PpcA that emerges PpcA as an outstanding protein compared to its other homologs, resulting towards its binding with deoxycholate. Similarly, some notable features for the structurally dissimilar protein PpcD compared to the other homologs are also brought out. Further, the five members of cytochrome family being homolog proteins, they must have some common significant features which are also enumerated in this study."

The aim of this study was to assess the association between hyperlipidemia and the risk of new-onset anxiety/depression after the diagnosis of HNC and the influence of administering statins.A matched longitudinal cohort study of 1632 subjects (408 HNC patients with preexisting hyperlipidemia and 1224 age- and sex-matched HNC patients without hyperlipidemia) was included and analyzed by using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1996 to December 2012. The incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for the development of new-onset anxiety/depression were examined between the two groups. Cox proportional hazard regression was applied to estimate the relative risks of anxiety/depressive disorders adjusted for potential confounding factors. To estimate the risks of anxiety/depression in different sub-groups, a stratified analysis was also used.HNC patients with preexisting hyperlipidemia had a higher risk for comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease (P <0.001). The incidence rate of anxiety/depression in the HNC patients with preexisting hyperlipidemia was also significantly higher than that among patients without hyperlipidemia (10.78% vs 7.27%, respectively; P = 0.03). A Cox regression model revealed that preexisting hyperlipidemia was an independent risk factor for anxiety/depression (aHR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30-2.94). Statins use was protective against anxiety/depression among HNC patients with hyperlipidemia (aHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.46-1.57), especially for individuals older than 65 years and for females.Preexisting hyperlipidemia was associated with increased risk of new-onset anxiety/depression in the HNC patients. Statins use for HNC patients with hyperlipidemia could decrease the risk of anxiety/depression, especially for those older than 65 years and for female patients."

During exercise at altitude, ventilatory demands increase due to the combined effects of exercise and hypoxia.To investigate the relationships between thoraco-abdominal coordination, ventilatory pattern, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and endurance performance in runners during high-intensity uphill exercise.Fifteen participants (13 males, mean age 42±9 yrs) ran a ""Vertical Kilometer,"" i.e., an uphill run involving a climb of approximately 1000 m with a slope greater than 30%. The athletes were equipped with a portable respiratory inductive plethysmography system, a finger pulse oximeter and a global positioning unit (GPS). The ventilatory pattern (ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), and VE/VT ratio), thoraco-abdominal coordination, which is represented by the phase angle (PhA), and SpO2 were evaluated at rest and during the run. Before and after the run, we assessed respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength and the occurrence of interstitial pulmonary edema by thoracic ultrasound.Two subjects were excluded from the respiratory inductive plethysmography analysis due to motion artifacts. A quadratic relationship between the slope and the PhA was observed (r = 0.995, p = 0.036). When the slope increased above 30%, the PhA increased, indicating a reduction in thoraco-abdominal coordination. The reduced thoraco-abdominal coordination was significantly related to reduced breathing efficiency (i.e., an increased VE/VT ratio; r = 0.961, p = 0.038) and SpO2 (r = -0.697, p<0.001). Lower SpO2 values were associated with lower speeds at 20%≥slope≤40% (r = 0.335, p<0.001 for horizontal and r = 0.36, p<0.001 for vertical). The reduced thoraco-abdominal coordination and consequent reduction in SpO2 were associated with interstitial pulmonary edema.Reductions in thoraco-abdominal coordination are associated with a less efficient ventilatory pattern and lower SpO2 during uphill running. This fact could have a negative effect on performance."

Where present, to determine how common risk factors for diabetic complications might be associated with it, and what might be driving it. Materials and methods Longitudinal cohort study with seven examination phases between 1980 and 2014. Multivariate logistic regression models and ordinal parameterization were used to test for and evaluate any period effect. Results There is a period effect in the prevalence of gross proteinuria and peripheral neuropathy (decreasing), as seen with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (p < 0.001). Adjusting for changing levels of common risk factors attenuates the period effect, particularly for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. For gross proteinuria and peripheral neuropathy, however there is a persistent period effect in spite of adjusting for the major risk factors. Conclusions There are period effects in the prevalence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, gross proteinuria and peripheral neuropathy that cannot be fully explained by changes in common risk factors for complications of type 1 diabetes in this cohort. The role of other potential confounders warrants further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2602774882,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) evolves rapidly in a single host and circulates as a quasispecies wich is a complex mixture of genetically distinct virus’s but closely related namely variants. To identify intra-individual diversity and investigate their functional properties in vitro, it is necessary to define their quasispecies composition and isolate the HCV variants. This is possible using single genome amplification (SGA). This technique, based on serially diluted cDNA to amplify a single cDNA molecule (clonal amplicon), has already been used to determine individual HCV diversity. In these studies, positive PCR reactions from SGA were directly sequenced using Sanger technology. The detection of non-clonal amplicons is necessary for excluding them to facilitate further functional analysis. Here, we compared Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with De Novo assembly and Sanger sequencing for their ability to distinguish clonal and non-clonal amplicons after SGA on one plasma specimen. All amplicons (n = 42) classified as clonal by NGS were also classified as clonal by Sanger sequencing. No double peaks were seen on electropherograms for non-clonal amplicons with position-specific nucleotide variation below 15% by NGS. Altogether, NGS circumvented many of the difficulties encountered when using Sanger sequencing after SGA and is an appropriate tool to reliability select clonal amplicons for further functional studies."

Specifically, one fixed volume of 0.109 mmol/L sodium citrate is added to 9 volumes of blood. Since little is known about the impact of hypercalcemia on the calcium-binding capacity of citrate, this study was planned to investigate the effect of experimental hypercalcemia on routine hemostasis testing.Fifteen pooled citrated plasmas with matching lithium-heparin pooled plasma from patients with different values of prothrombin time (PT) were divided in three aliquots of 0.6mL each. The first paired aliquots of both citrate and lithium-heparin plasma were supplemented with 60μL of saline, the second paired aliquots with 30μL of saline and 30μL of calcium chloride and the third paired aliquots with 60μL of calcium chloride. Total and ionized calcium was measured in all aliquots of citrate and lithium-heparin plasma, whereas PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and fibrinogen were measured in citrate plasma aliquots.Total calcium concentration gradually increased in both lithium-heparin and citrate plasma aliquots 2 and 3 compared to baseline aliquot 1. The concentration of ionized calcium also gradually increased in lithium-heparin plasma aliquots 2 and 3, whereas it remained immeasurable (i.e., <0.10 mmol/L) in all citrate plasma aliquots. No significant differences were observed for values of PT, APTT and fibrinogen in citrate plasma aliquots 2 and 3 compared to the baseline aliquot 1, with a mean bias was always comprised within the desirable quality specifications derived from biological variability data.Hypercalcemia, up to severe hypercalcemia does not generate significant bias in results of first-line coagulations tests, so that hypothetical consideration of adjusting citrate-blood ratio is unjustified in hypercalcemic patients."

The Crystal Structure of Cytochrome P450 4B1 (CYP4B1) Monooxygenase Complexed with Octane Discloses Several Structural Adaptations for ω-HydroxylationJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 292Issue 13PreviewP450 family 4 fatty acid ω-hydroxylases preferentially oxygenate primary C–H bonds over adjacent, energetically favored secondary C–H bonds, but the mechanism explaining this intriguing preference is unclear. To this end, the structure of rabbit P450 4B1 complexed with its substrate octane was determined by X-ray crystallography to define features of the active site that contribute to a preference for ω-hydroxylation. The structure indicated that octane is bound in a narrow active-site cavity that limits access of the secondary C–H bond to the reactive intermediate. Full-Text PDF Open Access Cytochrome P450 enzymes perform a variety of chemically arduous tasks in biosynthesis, metabolism, and detoxification, mediated by a catalytic intermediate formed by the heme cofactor and refined by the unique characteristics of each polypeptide. Many cytochrome P450 enzymes in family 4 hydroxylate fatty acids specifically at the terminal, or ω, carbon. Such hydroxylation involves hydrogen abstraction, which is energetically much more favorable to do at the penultimate, or ω-1, position. Thus, biochemists have long wondered how these enzymes block the chemically more tractable ω-1 position and favor the ω position. Although biochemical evidence has provided some clues, the field has eagerly awaited structures that could help elucidate how this is accomplished. One member of this family, CYP4B1, hydroxylates C7-C10 fatty acids and alkanes and has yielded a new X-ray structure with octane (1.Hsu M.-H. Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. Johnson E.F. The crystal structure of cytochrome P450 4B1 (CYP4B1) monooxygenase complexed with octane discloses several structural adaptations for ω-hydroxylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 5610-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that now provides these answers. One significant challenge in getting this structure, as with many membrane-bound cytochromes P450, is that the human CYP4B1 enzyme has proved recalcitrant to recombinant expression (2.Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. CYP4B1: An enigmatic P450 at the interface between xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.Drug Metab. Rev. 2006; 38: 451-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To bypass this difficulty, the new report by Hsu et al. (1.Hsu M.-H. Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. Johnson E.F. The crystal structure of cytochrome P450 4B1 (CYP4B1) monooxygenase complexed with octane discloses several structural adaptations for ω-hydroxylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 5610-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) used the rabbit homolog of CYP4B1, which had already been obtained in a functional form via partial truncation of the single, N-terminal transmembrane helix followed by liberation from the membrane with detergents (3.Cheesman M.J. Baer B.R. Zheng Y.M. Gillam E.M. Rettie A.E. Rabbit CYP4B1 engineered for high-level expression in Escherichia coli: Ligand stabilization and processing of the N-terminus and heme prosthetic group.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hsu et al. (1.Hsu M.-H. Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. Johnson E.F. The crystal structure of cytochrome P450 4B1 (CYP4B1) monooxygenase complexed with octane discloses several structural adaptations for ω-hydroxylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 5610-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) first confirmed that the truncated rabbit CYP4B1 binds octane with spectral changes and an affinity similar to that of the full-length enzyme. They then used conventional cryocrystallography and molecular replacement to solve the CYP4B1/octane structure. The overall features of CYP4B1 mirror those of other cytochromes P450, but the 2.7 Å complex further revealed that the octane substrate approaches the heme iron—the site of the catalytic oxygen intermediate during turnover—end on (Fig. 1). The linear hydrocarbon is constrained to an extended conformation within a “slot-like” active site cavity that narrows near the heme so that the (ω-1)- hydrogens are more shielded from the heme than those ω-carbons, thus promoting the observed regioselectivity of the hydroxylation reaction. A key portion of the protein constraining this orientation is an ester bond between one of the heme methyls and the side chain of Glu-310. Formed autocatalytically, this type of interaction is unusual for cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is restricted to those in family 4 and associated with the capacity for ω-hydroxylation. This stabilizes the Glu-310 conformation such that side chain atoms help restrict substrate access to the heme. Consistent with this idea, an E310A mutation yields a 4-fold decrease in the regioselectivity of octane hydroxylation. While extrapolation from the rabbit enzyme to the human CYP4B1 (2.Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. CYP4B1: An enigmatic P450 at the interface between xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.Drug Metab. Rev. 2006; 38: 451-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and to other CYP4 enzymes can be uncertain, the new structure provides opportunities to form testable hypotheses about the structure/function relationships in these enzymes. Many of the residues surrounding octane, including Glu-310, are highly conserved in human and other mammalian CYP4B1 enzymes. The authors point out, however, that Glu-310 is not conserved throughout human family 4—those CYP4 enzymes that are not ω-hydroxylases have either a Gly or Ala at this position, generally consistent with altered activity observed in tests of rabbit CYP4B1 mutants (1.Hsu M.-H. Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. Johnson E.F. The crystal structure of cytochrome P450 4B1 (CYP4B1) monooxygenase complexed with octane discloses several structural adaptations for ω-hydroxylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 5610-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition to identifying amino acids of interest in the active site, the authors used this new structure as a template for homology modeling of human CYP4A11, which performs ω-hydroxylation on fatty acids as long as C16. The authors' model is consistent with lauric acid binding in an orientation that would promote such regioselectivity and provides some indication as to how the longer chain might be accommodated. Although the physiological necessity of CYP4B1 is uncertain—knock-out mice are phenotypically normal (4.Parkinson O.T. Liggitt H.D. Rettie A.E. Kelly E.J. Generation and characterization of a Cyp4b1 null mouse and the role of CYP4B1 in the activation and toxicity of ipomeanol.Toxicol. Sci. 2013; 134: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)—there are obvious translational motivations to understand the mechanism of this enzyme. First, in many species CYP4B1 first came to attention because it often selectively bioactivates protoxins to active toxins in the extrahepatic tissues in which it is expressed (2.Baer B.R. Rettie A.E. CYP4B1: An enigmatic P450 at the interface between xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.Drug Metab. Rev. 2006; 38: 451-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In humans, CYP4B1 has been investigated for possible associations with bladder cancer (5.Imaoka S. Yoneda Y. Sugimoto T. Hiroi T. Yamamoto K. Nakatani T. Funae Y. CYP4B1 is a possible risk factor for bladder cancer in humans.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In fact, this toxin-activating activity has even been evaluated as a potential gene therapy, in which a CYP4B1 transgene is delivered to tumors to activate a systemic protoxin in a site-specific manner (6.Rainov N.G. Dobberstein K.U. Sena-Esteves M. Herrlinger U. Kramm C.M. Philpot R.M. Hilton J. Chiocca E.A. Breakefield X.O. New prodrug activation gene therapy for cancer using cytochrome P450 4B1 and 2-aminoanthracene/4-ipomeanol.Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, a number of human hepatic P450 enzymes also have some propensity to activate this same protoxin, likely explaining the liver toxicity observed in cancer patients (7.Rowinsky E.K. Noe D.A. Ettinger D.S. Christian M.C. Lubejko B.G. Fishman E.K. Sartorius S.E. Boyd M.R. Donehower R.C. Phase I and pharmacological study of the pulmonary cytotoxin 4-ipomeanol on a single dose schedule in lung cancer patients: Hepatotoxicity is dose limiting in humans.Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1794-1801PubMed Google Scholar). The new structural information for CYP4B1 versus hepatic, drug-metabolizing P450 enzymes could support more selective prodrug development. Second, the CYP4B1 1-octanol product has desirable fuel characteristics similar to diesel and has been explored as a biofuel (8.Akhtar M.K. Dandapani H. Thiel K. Jones P.R. Microbial production of 1- octanol: A naturally excreted biofuel with diesel-like properties.Metab. Eng. Commun. 2015; 2: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although mammalian membrane-bound P450 enzymes are typically unsuitable for biotechnology applications due to their poor stability and low turnover, the current structural information has the potential to broadly assist in advanced engineering of soluble P450 enzyme systems being studied for this purpose (9.Lonsdale T.H. Lauterbach L. Honda Malca S. Nestl B.M. Hauer B. Lenz O. H2-driven biotransformation of n-octane to 1-octanol by a recombinant Pseudomonas putida strain co-synthesizing an O2-tolerant hydrogenase and a P450 monooxygenase.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2015; 51: 16173-16175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, however, the most satisfying aspect of the new CYP4B1/octane structure is likely the visualization of two of the most intriguing aspects of CYP4 enzymes—the propensity for energetically unfavorable ω-hydroxylation and an unusual heme-polypeptide ester bond."
https://openalex.org/W2600458726,"Identification of synaptic cleft components has been hampered by the lack of a suitable preparation enriched in synaptic junctions devoid of adjoining peripheral membranes. Prior strategies for the isolation of synaptic junctions, relying on detergents for the removal of peripheral membranes, resulted in substantial loss of membranes lining the cleft. Here, a novel, detergent-free method is described for the preparation of a synaptic junction (SJ) fraction, using phospholipase A2. Limited digestion of synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) fraction with phospholipase A2 followed by centrifugation over a sucrose cushion results in selective removal of membranes peripheral to the cleft while junctional membranes remain relatively intact as observed by electron microscopy. Enrichment in synaptic junctional structures and loss of membranes peripheral to the junctional area are further verified by demonstrating enrichment in PSD-95 and loss in mGluR5, respectively. The SJ fraction is enriched in neuroligins and neurexins, in agreement with immuno-electron microscopy data showing their selective localization to the junctional area. Among additional cell adhesion molecules tested, N-cadherin and specific isoforms of the SynCAM and SALM families also show marked enrichment in the SJ fraction, suggesting preferential localization at the synaptic cleft while others show little enrichment or decrease, suggesting that they are not restricted to or concentrated at the synaptic cleft. Treatment of the SJ fraction with glycosidases results in electrophoretic mobility shifts of all cell adhesion molecules tested, indicating glycosylation at the synaptic cleft. Biochemical and ultrastructural data presented indicate that the novel synaptic junction preparation can be used as a predictive tool for the identification and characterization of the components of the synaptic cleft."

For cohort 1 and 2, prognostic significance of each method by disease-specific survival was analyzed using Akaike and Bayesian information criterion (AIC and BIC).The total LNs in four cohorts significantly differed [median (range), 28 (6-97) in cohort 1, 37 (8-120) in cohort 2, 48 (7-122) in cohort 3, and 54 (4-221) in cohort 4; p<0.001]. The numbers of negative LNs increased with increase of total LN (p<0.001), but the numbers of metastatic LNs did not increase from cohort 1 to 4. MLR and LODDS in four cohorts had decreasing tendency with increase of total LNs in each pT3 and pT4 category (p<0.001), while the numbers of metastatic LNs did not differ significantly in any pT category (p>0.05). The AIC and BIC varied according to different cut-off values for MLR; model by cut-offs of 0.2 and 0.5 being better for cohort 1, while cut-offs 0.1 and 0.25 was better for cohort 2.Our study showed that the number of metastatic LNs did not increase with maximal pathologic examination of regional LNs. AJCC 7th system is suggested as the simplest method with single cut-off value, but prognostic significance of MLR may be influenced by various cut-offs."
