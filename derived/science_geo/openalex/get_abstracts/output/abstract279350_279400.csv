Variable tropical SSTs may explain the interhemispheric synchroneity of global climate change as recorded in ice cores, snowline reconstructions, and vegetation records. Radiative changes due to cloud type and cloud cover are plausible mechanisms for maintaining cooler tropical SSTs in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2000327775,"Intercalated layered materials comprising an organic dye and inorganic MPS(3) [where M is either the manganese ion (Mn(2+)) or the cadmium ion (Cd(2+))] phases have been prepared. The intercalation process induces a spontaneous poling, giving rise to an efficiency of 750 times that of urea in second-harmonic generation for the cadmium derivative. In addition, the manganese derivative displays a permanent magnetization below 40 kelvin. Thus, these materials exhibit both a large optical nonlinearity and magnetic ordering."
https://openalex.org/W3025765350,"The publication of The Internal Constitution of the Stars by Arthur Eddington in 1926 was a major landmark in the development of modern theoretical astrophysics. Not only did Eddington effectively create the discipline of the structure, constitution, and the evolution of the stars, but he also recognised and established the basic elements of our present understanding of the subject. The influence of the book is indicated by the remark by H. N. Russell in 1945: 'This volume has every claim to be regarded as a masterpiece of the first rank'."
https://openalex.org/W1974440507,"A high-resolution, regional climate model nested within a general circulation model was used to study the interactions between the atmosphere and the large Pleistocene lakes in the Great Basin of the United States. Simulations for January and July 18,000 years ago indicate that moisture provided by synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation features was the primary component of the hydrologic budgets of Lakes Lahontan and Bonneville. In addition, lake-generated precipitation was a substantial component of the hydrologic budget of Lake Bonneville at that time. This local lake-atmosphere interaction may help explain differences in the relative sizes of these lakes 18,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2032442024,"Excavations at the Mesa site in arctic Alaska provide evidence for a Paleoindian occupation of Beringia, the region adjacent to the Bering Strait. Eleven carbon-14 dates on hearths associated with Paleoindian projectile points place humans at the site between 9,730 and 11,660 radiocarbon years before present (years B.P.). The presence of Paleoindians in Beringia at these times challenges the notion that Paleoindian cultures arose exclusively in mid-continental North America. The age span of Paleoindians at the Mesa site overlaps with dates from two other cultural complexes in interior Alaska. A hiatus in the record of human occupation occurs between 10,300 and 11,000 years B.P. Late Glacial climatic fluctuations may have made northern Alaska temporarily unfavorable for humans and spurred their southward dispersal."

https://openalex.org/W2089281443,"Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realized. For him, perhaps it was enough to taste the joy of living, to watch the rising and the setting of the sun, to gaze upon the mountain, the river and the restless sea, and never to ask himself the question what is this world in which I live, and how did it come into being? But this problem eventually presented itself, for there has been implanted within the human breast that which distinguishes its possessor from the beasts which perish, the passion for knowledge, the deep longing for Authentie tidings of invisible things, Of ebb and flow and ever-during power: And central peace subsisting at the heart Of endless agitation."
