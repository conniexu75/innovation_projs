https://openalex.org/W2045316197,"Tissue specific patterns of methylated cytosine residues vary with age, can be altered by environmental factors, and are often abnormal in human disease yet the cellular consequences of DNA methylation are incompletely understood. Although the bodies of highly expressed genes are often extensively methylated in plants, the relationship between intragenic methylation and expression is less clear in mammalian cells. We performed genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression to determine how the pattern of intragenic methylation correlates with transcription and to assess the relationship between methylation of exonic and intronic portions of the gene body. We found that dense exonic methylation is far more common than previously recognized or expected statistically, yet first exons are relatively spared compared to more downstream exons and introns. Dense methylation surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) is uncoupled from methylation within more downstream regions suggesting that there are at least two classes of intragenic methylation. Whereas methylation surrounding the TSS is tightly linked to transcriptional silencing, methylation of more downstream regions is unassociated with the magnitude of gene expression. Notably, we found that DNA methylation downstream of the TSS, in the region of the first exon, is much more tightly linked to transcriptional silencing than is methylation in the upstream promoter region. These data provide direct evidence that DNA methylation is interpreted dissimilarly in different regions of the gene body and suggest that first exon methylation blocks transcript initiation, or vice versa. Our data also show that once initiated, downstream methylation is not a significant impediment to polymerase extension. Thus, the consequences of most intragenic DNA methylation must extend beyond the modulation of transcription magnitude. Sequencing data and gene expression microarray data have been submitted to the GEO online database (accession number SRA012081.1). Supporting information including expanded methods and ten additional figures in support of the manuscript is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2019678208,"Myeloid cells have been associated with physiological and pathological angiogenesis, but their exact functions in these processes remain poorly defined. Monocyte-derived tissue macrophages of the CNS, or microglial cells, invade the mammalian retina before it becomes vascularized. Recent studies correlate the presence of microglia in the developing CNS with vascular network formation, but it is not clear whether the effect is directly caused by microglia and their contact with the endothelium.We combined in vivo studies of the developing mouse retina with in vitro studies using the aortic ring model to address the role of microglia in developmental angiogenesis. Our in vivo analyses are consistent with previous findings that microglia are present at sites of endothelial tip-cell anastomosis, and genetic ablation of microglia caused a sparser vascular network associated with reduced number of filopodia-bearing sprouts. Addition of microglia in the aortic ring model was sufficient to stimulate vessel sprouting. The effect was independent of physical contact between microglia and endothelial cells, and could be partly mimicked using microglial cell-conditioned medium. Addition of VEGF-A promoted angiogenic sprouts of different morphology in comparison with the microglial cells, and inhibition of VEGF-A did not affect the microglia-induced angiogenic response, arguing that the proangiogenic factor(s) released by microglia is distinct from VEGF-A. Finally, microglia exhibited oriented migration towards the vessels in the aortic ring cultures.Microglia stimulate vessel sprouting in the aortic ring cultures via a soluble microglial-derived product(s), rather than direct contact with endothelial cells. The observed migration of microglia towards the growing sprouts suggests that their position near endothelial tip-cells could result from attractive cues secreted by the vessels. Our data reveals a two-way communication between microglia and vessels that depends on soluble factors and should extend the understanding of how microglia promote vascular network formation."

Epigenetic mechanisms are defined as heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve coding sequence modifications. Both mechanisms play an important role in maintaining physiological functions and are also related to disease development. However, few studies report that miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulations are involved in atherosclerosis. In the present study, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) significantly increased primary human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) migration through MMP-2/MMP-9 up-regulation associated with decreased DNA methylation levels. Either mRNA or protein level of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) showed a dose-dependent down-regulation in oxLDL-mediated HASMCs. Knockdown DNMT3b expression enhanced oxLDL-induced DNA demethylation levels of MMP-2/MMP-9. The expression of miRNA-29b (miR-29b), directly targeting DNMT3b, was up-regulated by oxLDL treatment in a dose-dependent manner. OxLDL-mediated MMP-2/MMP-9 up-regulation, DNMT3b down-regulation, and DNA demethylation were all attenuated after knockdown miR-29b expression by antagomiR-29b. We find that oxLDL can up-regulate miR-29b expression, resulting in DNMT3b down-regulation in HASMCs and epigenetically regulated MMP-2/MMP-9 genes involved in cell migration. These results show that miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation may be a novel mechanism in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2071261883,"Purpose Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) detection and phenotyping are currently evaluated in Breast Cancer (BC). Tumor cell dissemination has been suggested to occur early in BC progression. To interrogate dissemination in BC, we studied CTCs and HER2 expression on CTCs across the spectrum of BC staging. Methods Spiking experiments with 6 BC cell lines were performed and blood samples from healthy women and women with BC were analyzed for HER2-positive CTCs using the CellSearch®. Results Based on BC cell lines experiments, HER2-positive CTCs were defined as CTCs with HER2 immunofluoresence intensity that was at least 2.5 times higher than the background. No HER2-positive CTC was detected in 42 women without BC (95% confidence interval (CI) 0–8.4%) whereas 4.1% (95%CI 1.4–11.4%) of 73 patients with ductal/lobular carcinoma in situ (DCIS/LCIS) had 1 HER2-positive CTC/22.5 mL, 7.9%, (95%CI 4.1–14.9%) of 101 women with non metastatic (M0) BC had ≥1 HER2-positive CTC/22.5 mL (median 1 cell, range 1–3 cells) and 35.9% (95%CI 22.7–51.9%) of 39 patients with metastatic BC had ≥1 HER2-positive CTC/7.5 mL (median 1.5 cells, range 1–42 cells). In CTC-positive women with DCIS/LCIS or M0 BC, HER2-positive CTCs were more commonly detected in HER2-positive (5 of 5 women) than HER2-negative BC (5 of 12 women) (p = 0.03). Conclusion HER2-positive CTCs were detected in DCIS/LCIS or M0 BC irrespective of the primary tumor HER2 status. Nevertheless, their presence was more common in women with HER2-positive disease. Monitoring of HER2 expression on CTCs might be useful in trials with anti-HER2 therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2019488107,"Reducing the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity increases lifespan and health span in a variety of organisms. Alterations in protein homeostasis and mTOR activity and signaling have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD); however, the causes of such deregulations remain elusive. Here, we show that mTOR activity and signaling are increased in cell lines stably transfected with mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in brains of 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD. In addition, we show that in the 3xTg-AD mice, mTOR activity can be reduced to wild type levels by genetically preventing Aβ accumulation. Similarly, intrahippocampal injections of an anti-Aβ antibody reduced Aβ levels and normalized mTOR activity, indicating that high Aβ levels are necessary for mTOR hyperactivity in 3xTg-AD mice. We also show that the intrahippocampal injection of naturally secreted Aβ is sufficient to increase mTOR signaling in the brains of wild type mice. The mechanism behind the Aβ-induced mTOR hyperactivity is mediated by the proline-rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as we show that the activation of PRAS40 plays a key role in the Aβ-induced mTOR hyperactivity. Taken together, our data show that Aβ accumulation, which has been suggested to be the culprit of AD pathogenesis, causes mTOR hyperactivity by regulating PRAS40 phosphorylation. These data further indicate that the mTOR pathway is one of the pathways by which Aβ exerts its toxicity and further support the idea that reducing mTOR signaling in AD may be a valid therapeutic approach.

Mohs R.C. Heyman A. Arch. Neurol. 1992; 49: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Growing evidence is converging on soluble Aβ as a mediator of early cognitive decline in AD (8Glabe C.C. Subcell. Biochem. 2005; 38: 167-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klein W.L. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ-induced cognitive decline remain elusive, soluble Aβ oligomers have been shown to alter signal transduction pathways that are key for learning and memory, suggesting that alterations in such pathways may underlie the onset of cognitive decline in AD (10Palop J.J. Mucke L. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that forms two multiprotein complexes known as mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and 2 (11Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4573) Google Scholar). mTORC1 controls protein homeostasis; its activity is inhibited by rapamycin, and it contains mTOR, raptor, proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), and mLT8. mTORC2, which is insensitive to rapamycin, controls cellular shape by modulating actin function and contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8, and hSIN (11Wullschleger S.

In mTORC1, raptor binds to mTOR substrates and is necessary for mTOR activity (13Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). PRAS40 is another mTOR regulatory protein, which inhibits mTOR by directly binding to it (14Sancak Y.

When PRAS40 is phosphorylated at Thr-246, it detaches from mTOR, thereby facilitating mTOR activity (14Sancak Y. Thoreen C.C. Peterson T.R. Lindquist R.A. Kang S.A. Spooner E. Carr S.A. Sabatini D.M.

Several mTOR functions are executed via its downstream targets, namely the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase I (p70S6K), which is directly activated by mTOR through phosphorylation at the Thr-389 site (16Das F.

Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4573) Google Scholar). Notably, the steady-state levels of p70S6K phosphorylated at Thr-389 are often used as an indirect measurement of mTOR output as they greatly correlate with mTOR activity (16Das F. Ghosh-Choudhury N.

Indeed, evidence from AD brains shows that mTOR signaling is selectively increased in neurons predicted to develop neurofibrillary tangles and that such an increase correlates with Tau phosphorylation (25An W.L.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This evidence has led to the hypothesis that the chronic increase in mTOR function occurring during aging may facilitate the development of Tau pathology (27Pei J.J. Hugon J. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). By regulating both protein synthesis and degradation, mTOR plays a key role in controlling protein homeostasis and hence brain function; indeed, mTOR activity has been directly linked to learning and memory (29Ehninger D.

Bell K. Cox H. Broadie K.S. Tully T. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For example, complete inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin has detrimental effects on long term memory facilitation and consolidation in gerbils and Aplysia californica (31Casadio A. Martin K.C.

In contrast, low concentrations of rapamycin improve memory deficits associated with cannabinoid consumption and rescue learning deficits in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis, which is characterized by hyperactive mTOR (29Ehninger D.

In summary, there seems to be an optimal window for mTOR activity that is most beneficial for learning and memory, and alterations that lead to an increase or decrease in mTOR signaling outside such an optimal window may have detrimental effects on learning and memory (34Cao R.

All mice were given ad libitum access to food and water. All animal procedures were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all appropriate measures were taken to minimize pain and discomfort in experimental animals. Mice were anesthetized with avertin (1.3% tribromoethanol, 0.8% amyl alcohol, given 0.6 ml/25 g of body weight) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. Mice received single intrahippocampal injections of either 6E10 (2 μg) or conditioned medium prepared as described below. Solutions were injected through a 33-gauge injector attached to a 5-μl Hamilton syringe. The coordinates, with respect to bregma, were −0.34 mm posterior, −2.2 mm lateral, and −1 mm ventral to the skull. Injections occurred over 5 min, after which the cannula was left in place for an additional 5 min to allow for diffusion. Animals were kept on a warming pad until they had fully recovered from anesthesia. To prevent damage to the scalp sutures, mice were kept in individual cages until they were sacrificed for tissue processing. With the exception of the anti-APP 6E10 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), all the other antibodies used here were purchased from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA. The Akt inhibitor VII, TAT-Akt-in was purchased from Calbiochem. The PIM-1 inhibitor 1 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). mTOR activity was measured using the K-LISATM mTOR activity kit (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) following the manufacturer's protocol. 7PA2 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with humidified environment (5% CO2) in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks until 90% confluent. At this time, the medium was replaced with 7 ml of serum-free DMEM for 18 h. Conditioned medium was then centrifuged to remove debris and frozen at −80 °C. The medium was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifuge filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with a 3000 molecular weight cut-off. Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS. Subsequently, one-half brain was dropped-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 48 h and then transferred to 0.02% sodium azide in PBS until slicing. The other half was frozen in dry ice for biochemical analysis.

Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4573) Google Scholar), unveiling the molecular pathways leading to its deregulation in AD may lead to a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis. Commonly, mTOR activity is indirectly determined by measuring the steady-state levels of phosphorylated p70S6K and 4E-BP1, two downstream targets of mTOR (11Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4573) Google Scholar, 19Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis, we measured the levels of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice as a function of age. Two-month-old 3xTg-AD mice have no detectable neuropathological alterations in the brain (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At this age, we found that the levels of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 were similar between 3xTg-AD mice and age- and gender-matched non-transgenic (NonTg) mice (n = 6/genotype; Fig. 1, A–C). As the 3xTg-AD mice age, they gradually accumulate Aβ and Tau pathology in their brains. Specifically, 6-month-old mice are characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of soluble Aβ (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 53Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tran L. Lambert M.P. Glabe C.G.

Tau pathology (e.g. somatodendritic Tau accumulation and hyperphosphorylation) starts to become apparent at this age, although to a smaller degree than intraneuronal Aβ (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 48Oddo S. Caccamo A. Cheng D. Jouleh B. Torp R. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Intraneuronal Aβ accumulation and Tau pathology are both significantly higher at 12 months of age when compared with 6-month-old mice (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We found that the ratio of the steady-state levels of p70S6K phosphorylated at Thr-389 over the levels of total p70S6K was significantly increased in the brains of 6- and 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice when compared with age-matched NonTg mice (Fig. 1, D, E, G, and H). Similarly, we found that at both ages, the ratio of 4E-BP1 phosphorylated at Ser-65 over total 4E-BP1 was also increased in the 3xTg-AD mice when compared with age- and gender-matched NonTg mice (Fig. 1, D, F, G, and I). Notably, previous reports clearly show that mTOR directly phosphorylates p70S6K and 4E-BP1 at Thr-389 and Ser-65, respectively (16Das F. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Mahimainathan L. Venkatesan B. Feliers D.

To directly assess mTOR activity in the brains of the 3xTg-AD mice, we measured mTOR enzymatic activity using an ELISA system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with the Western blot data, we found no changes in mTOR activity in pre-pathological 2-month-old mice (Fig. 1J); in contrast, we found a significant increase at 6 and 12 months of age when compared with age- and gender-matched NonTg mice (Fig. 1J). These results clearly indicate that as in AD brains, mTOR is hyperactive in the 3xTg-AD mice, and such an increase in mTOR activity mirrors the progression of Aβ and Tau pathology previously established in this mouse model of AD. Previously, we showed that Aβ causes mTOR hyperactivity in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding APP751 containing the V717F familial AD mutation (known as 7PA2 cells (54Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). To determine whether Aβ accumulation also causes mTOR hyperactivity in vivo, we first used a genetic approach to prevent Aβ accumulation in the brains of the 3xTg-AD mice. We previously reported the generation of the APP/Tau mice, which were obtained by breeding the 3xTg-AD mice to NonTg mice (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In doing so, we replaced the mutant PS1 alleles with its wild type counterpart. Six-month-old APP/Tau mice have virtually no Aβ deposits in the CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig. 2, A and B) and in other brain regions (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine the effect of preventing Aβ accumulation on mTOR signaling and activity. Western blot experiments indicate that phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr-389 (reported as the ratio of phosphorylated over total protein levels) was significantly reduced in the APP/Tau mice (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating a reduction of mTOR activity. Indeed, we found that mTOR enzymatic activity was similar between APP/Tau and NonTg mice (Fig. 2E). Because 6-month-old APP/Tau mice do not show any Aβ accumulation, despite no changes in APP and Tau expression levels with respect to 3xTg-AD mice (45Oddo S. Caccamo A. Tseng B. Cheng D. Vasilevko V. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12163-12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), these data highlight a strong correlation between Aβ levels and mTOR hyperactivity. Recently, it was shown that presenilin 1 (PS1) modulates autophagy induction (55Lee J.H. Yu W.H. Kumar A. Lee S. Mohan P.S. Peterhoff C.M. Wolfe D.M. Martinez-Vicente M. Massey A.C. Sovak G.

Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4573) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible interaction between PS1 and mTOR. We thus sought to determine whether the effects on mTOR in the APP/Tau mice were thoroughly mediated by a reduction in Aβ levels or were simply due to the lack of mutant PS1. To address this question, we stereotaxically injected 2 μg of the anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 into the left hippocampi of 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. We and others have shown that a single intrahippocampal injection of anti-Aβ antibodies is sufficient to remove Aβ deposits (49Oddo S. Billings L. Kesslak J.P. Cribbs D.H. LaFerla F.M.

https://openalex.org/W2146302435,"Background Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are key components in malaria prevention and control strategy. However, the development of resistance by mosquitoes to insecticides recommended for IRS and/or ITNs/LLINs would affect insecticide-based malaria vector control. We assessed the susceptibility levels of Anopheles arabiensis to insecticides used in malaria control, characterized basic mechanisms underlying resistance, and evaluated the role of public health use of insecticides in resistance selection. Methodology/Principal findings Susceptibility status of An. arabiensis was assessed using WHO bioassay tests to DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin, malathion and propoxur in Ethiopia from August to September 2009. Mosquito specimens were screened for knockdown resistance (kdr) and insensitive acetylcholinesterase (ace-1R) mutations using AS-PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. DDT residues level in soil from human dwellings and the surrounding environment were determined by Gas Chromatography with Electron Capture Detector. An. arabiensis was resistant to DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin and malathion, but susceptible to propoxur. The West African kdr allele was found in 280 specimens out of 284 with a frequency ranged from 95% to 100%. Ace-1R mutation was not detected in all specimens scored for the allele. Moreover, DDT residues were found in soil samples from human dwellings but not in the surrounding environment. Conclusion The observed multiple-resistance coupled with the occurrence of high kdr frequency in populations of An. arabiensis could profoundly affect the malaria vector control programme in Ethiopia. This needs an urgent call for implementing rational resistance management strategies and integrated vector control intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2096327613,"Striatal adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) are highly expressed in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the indirect efferent pathway, where they heteromerize with dopamine D(2) receptors (D(2)Rs). A(2A)Rs are also localized presynaptically in cortico-striatal glutamatergic terminals contacting MSNs of the direct efferent pathway, where they heteromerize with adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs). It has been hypothesized that postsynaptic A(2A)R antagonists should be useful in Parkinson's disease, while presynaptic A(2A)R antagonists could be beneficial in dyskinetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorders and drug addiction. The aim or this work was to determine whether selective A(2A)R antagonists may be subdivided according to a preferential pre- versus postsynaptic mechanism of action. The potency at blocking the motor output and striatal glutamate release induced by cortical electrical stimulation and the potency at inducing locomotor activation were used as in vivo measures of pre- and postsynaptic activities, respectively. SCH-442416 and KW-6002 showed a significant preferential pre- and postsynaptic profile, respectively, while the other tested compounds (MSX-2, SCH-420814, ZM-241385 and SCH-58261) showed no clear preference. Radioligand-binding experiments were performed in cells expressing A(2A)R-D(2)R and A(1)R-A(2A)R heteromers to determine possible differences in the affinity of these compounds for different A(2A)R heteromers. Heteromerization played a key role in the presynaptic profile of SCH-442416, since it bound with much less affinity to A(2A)R when co-expressed with D(2)R than with A(1)R. KW-6002 showed the best relative affinity for A(2A)R co-expressed with D(2)R than co-expressed with A(1)R, which can at least partially explain the postsynaptic profile of this compound. Also, the in vitro pharmacological profile of MSX-2, SCH-420814, ZM-241385 and SCH-58261 was is in accordance with their mixed pre- and postsynaptic profile.

An influenza vaccine that can confer cross-protection against antigenically different influenza A strains is highly desirable for improving public health.To develop a cross protective vaccine, we generated influenza virus-like particles containing the highly conserved M2 protein in a membrane-anchored form (M2 VLPs), and investigated their immunogenicity and breadth of cross protection. Immunization of mice with M2 VLPs induced anti-M2 antibodies binding to virions of various strains, M2 specific T cell responses, and conferred long-lasting cross protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic influenza viruses. M2 immune sera were found to play an important role in providing cross protection against heterosubtypic virus and an antigenically distinct 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, and depletion of dendritic and macrophage cells abolished this cross protection, providing new insight into cross-protective immune mechanisms.These results suggest that presenting M2 on VLPs in a membrane-anchored form is a promising approach for developing broadly cross protective influenza vaccines."

In this study, we assessed whether urate is a likely physiological substrate for MPO and if the products of their interaction have the potential to exacerbate inflammation. Urate was readily oxidized by MPO and hydrogen peroxide to 5-hydroxyisourate, which decayed to predominantly allantoin. The redox intermediates of MPO were reduced by urate with rate constants of 4.6 × 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) for compound I and 1.7 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1) for compound II. Urate competed with chloride for oxidation by MPO and at hyperuricemic levels is expected to be a substantive substrate for the enzyme. Oxidation of urate promoted super-stoichiometric consumption of glutathione, which indicates that it is converted to a free radical intermediate. In combination with superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, MPO oxidized urate to a reactive hydroperoxide. This would form by addition of superoxide to the urate radical. Urate also enhanced MPO-dependent consumption of nitric oxide. In human plasma, stimulated neutrophils produced allantoin in a reaction dependent on the NADPH oxidase, MPO and superoxide. We propose that urate is a physiological substrate for MPO that is oxidized to the urate radical. The reactions of this radical with superoxide and nitric oxide provide a plausible link between urate and MPO in cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1995318696,"GPR30, also known as GPER, has been suggested to mediate rapid effects induced by estrogens in diverse normal and cancer tissues. Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors involved in apoptosis, cell survival, and proliferation. The response to low oxygen environment is mainly mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor named HIF-1α, which activates signaling pathways leading to adaptive mechanisms in tumor cells. Here, we demonstrate that the hypoxia induces HIF-1α expression, which in turn mediates the up-regulation of GPER and its downstream target CTGF in estrogen receptor-negative SkBr3 breast cancer cells and in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we show that HIF-1α-responsive elements located within the promoter region of GPER are involved in hypoxia-dependent transcription of GPER, which requires the ROS-induced activation of EGFR/ERK signaling in both SkBr3 and HL-1 and cells. Interestingly, the apoptotic response to hypoxia was prevented by estrogens through GPER in SkBr3 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the hypoxia-induced expression of GPER may be included among the mechanisms involved in the anti-apoptotic effects elicited by estrogens, particularly in a low oxygen microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2112543849,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important in early development and maintenance of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The miRNA miR-302–367 is specifically expressed in hESCs, and its expression decays on differentiation. We previously identified the structure of the gene coding for the human miR-302–367 cluster and characterized its promoter. The promoter activity was functionally validated in hESCs, opening up new avenues to further investigate how these miRNA molecules fit in the complex molecular network conferring “sternness” properties to hESCs. The physiological roles of specific miRNA-mRNA interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated putative miR-302–367 mRNA targets in hESCs, potentially relevant for ESC biology. We found that the Nodal inhibitors Lefty1 and Lefty2 are post-transcriptionally targeted by miR-302s in hESCs. Functional analyses indicate that miR-302s negatively modulate the level of lefties, and become upstream regulators of the TGFβ/Nodal pathway, functioning via Smad-2/3 signaling. Overexpression of the miR-302–367 cluster in hESCs causes a delay in early hESC differentiation, as measured by enhanced levels of ESC-specific transcription factors, coupled to a faster teratoma formation in mice transplanted with miR-302–367-expressing hESCs and a concomitant impairment of germ layer specification, displaying robust decreased levels of early mesodermal, endodermal, and ectoder-mal specific markers. These findings suggest that Lefty is negatively modulated by miR-302s in hESCs, which plays an important role in maintaining the balance between pluripotency and germ layer specification.—Barroso-delJesus, A., Lucena-Aguilar, G., Sanchez, L., Ligero, G., Gutierrez-Aranda, I., Menendez, P.

Here we find that the high- and low-affinity interactions between EGFR and its ligands activate different signaling pathways. While high-affinity ligand binding is sufficient for activation of most canonical signaling pathways, low-affinity binding is required for the activation of the Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) and Phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLCγ1). As the Stat proteins are involved in many cellular responses including proliferation, migration and apoptosis, these results assign a function to low-affinity interactions that has been omitted from computational models of EGFR signaling. The existence of receptors with distinct signaling properties provides a way for EGFR to respond to different concentrations of the same ligand in qualitatively different ways."
https://openalex.org/W1990484619,"Background New antimalarials are needed for P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria. This study compared the efficacy and safety of pyronaridine-artesunate with that of chloroquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria. Methods and Findings This phase III randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial included five centers across Cambodia, Thailand, India, and Indonesia. In a double-dummy design, patients (aged >3–≤60 years) with microscopically confirmed P. vivax mono-infection were randomized (1∶1) to receive pyronaridine-artesunate (target dose 7.2∶2.4 mg/kg to 13.8∶4.6 mg/kg) or chloroquine (standard dose) once daily for three days. Each treatment group included 228 randomized patients. Outcomes for the primary endpoint, Day-14 cure rate in the per-protocol population, were 99.5%, (217/218; 95%CI 97.5, 100) with pyronaridine-artesunate and 100% (209/209; 95%CI 98.3, 100) with chloroquine. Pyronaridine was non-inferior to chloroquine: treatment difference −0.5% (95%CI −2.6, 1.4), i.e., the lower limit of the 2-sided 95%CI for the treatment difference was greater than −10%. Pyronaridine-artesunate cure rates were non-inferior to chloroquine for Days 21, 28, 35 and 42. Parasite clearance time was shorter with pyronaridine-artesunate (median 23.0 h) versus chloroquine (32.0 h; p<0.0001), as was fever clearance time (median 15.9 h and 23.8 h, respectively; p = 0.0017). Kaplan-Meier estimates of post-baseline P. falciparum infection incidence until Day 42 were 2.5% with pyronaridine-artesunate, 6.1% with chloroquine (p = 0.048, log-rank test). Post-baseline P. vivax or P. falciparum infection incidence until Day 42 was 6.8% and 12.4%, respectively (p = 0.022, log rank test). There were no deaths. Adverse events occurred in 92/228 (40.4%) patients with pyronaridine-artesunate and 72/228 (31.6%) with chloroquine. Mild and transient increases in hepatic enzymes were observed for pyronaridine-artesunate. Conclusion Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy in acute uncomplicated P. vivax malaria was at least that of chloroquine. As pyronaridine-artesunate is also efficacious against P. falciparum malaria, this combination has potential utility as a global antimalarial drug. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00440999"
https://openalex.org/W2129940176,"Nowadays, the emerging role of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) oligomers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely accepted, putting aside the old idea that fibrils are the primary entities responsible for the onset of the disease. Besides, carrying the E4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE) represents the highest risk of developing AD. Nevertheless, the involvement of apoE4 in AD remains confusing. The goal of this study was to bring new insights into the role of apoE4 in Aβ aggregation. We used infrared spectroscopy, thioflavin T fluorescence, and Western blots to evaluate the influence of apoE isoforms on Aβ aggregation in vitro. Comparing Aβ controls with Aβ incubated either with the apoE3 or apoE4 isoform, we report a 30% reduction of the Aβ fibrillar content, whereas the oligomeric content is 2 times higher on incubation with the pathological isoform apoE4. ApoE4 would bind and block Aβ in its oligomeric conformation, inhibiting further formation of less toxic fibrillar forms of Aβ. While previous studies mostly correlated E4 with fibrils, our report underlines a link between apoE4 and Aβ oligomers and therefore reconciles apoE4 with the new amyloid cascade hypothesis. Our observations suggest that apoE4 strongly stabilizes Aβ oligomers, the pathological species responsible for Alzheimer's disease.—Cerf, E., Gustot, A., Goormaghtigh, E., Ruysschaert, J.-M., Raussens, V.

https://openalex.org/W2040462046,"The double-stranded RNA analog, poly(I:C), extracellularly activates both the endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and the cytoplasmic RNA helicase, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism by which extracellular poly(I:C) is delivered to TLR3-positive organelles and the cytoplasm remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic lipid raft protein, Raftlin, is essential for poly(I:C) cellular uptake in human myeloid dendritic cells and epithelial cells. When Raftlin was silenced, poly(I:C) failed to enter cells and induction of IFN-β production was inhibited. In addition, cellular uptake of B-type oligodeoxynucleotide that shares its uptake receptor with poly(I:C) was suppressed in Raftlin knockdown cells. Upon poly(I:C) stimulation, Raftlin was translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it colocalized with poly(I:C), and thereafter moved to TLR3-positive endosomes. Thus, Raftlin cooperates with the uptake receptor to mediate cell entry of poly(I:C), which is critical for activation of TLR3."
https://openalex.org/W2091769316,"Previous genetic, anthropological and linguistic studies have shown that Roma (Gypsies) constitute a founder population dispersed throughout Europe whose origins might be traced to the Indian subcontinent. Linguistic and anthropological evidence point to Indo-Aryan ethnic groups from North-western India as the ancestral parental population of Roma. Recently, a strong genetic hint supporting this theory came from a study of a private mutation causing primary congenital glaucoma. In the present study, complete mitochondrial control sequences of Iberian Roma and previously published maternal lineages of other European Roma were analyzed in order to establish the genetic affinities among Roma groups, determine the degree of admixture with neighbouring populations, infer the migration routes followed since the first arrival to Europe, and survey the origin of Roma within the Indian subcontinent. Our results show that the maternal lineage composition in the Roma groups follows a pattern of different migration routes, with several founder effects, and low effective population sizes along their dispersal. Our data allowed the confirmation of a North/West migration route shared by Polish, Lithuanian and Iberian Roma. Additionally, eleven Roma founder lineages were identified and degrees of admixture with host populations were estimated. Finally, the comparison with an extensive database of Indian sequences allowed us to identify the Punjab state, in North-western India, as the putative ancestral homeland of the European Roma, in agreement with previous linguistic and anthropological studies."

To uncover an explanation for how drug binding at a distance from the kinase active site could lead to inhibition and how inhibitors could combine their effects, hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX MS) was employed to monitor conformational effects in the presence of both dasatinib, a clinically approved ATP-site inhibitor, and GNF-5. While dasatinib binding to wild type Abl clearly influenced Abl conformation, no binding was detected between dasatinib and T315I. GNF-5, however, elicited the same conformational changes in both wild type and T315I, including changes to dynamics within the ATP site located approximately 25 Å from the site of GNF-5 interaction. Simultaneous binding of dasatinib and GNF-5 to T315I caused conformational and/or dynamics changes in Abl such that effects of dasatinib on T315I were the same as when it bound to wild type Abl. These results provide strong biophysical evidence that allosteric interactions play a role in Abl kinase downregulation and that targeting sites outside the ATP binding site can provide an important pharmacological tool to overcome mutations that cause resistance to ATP-competitive inhibitors."

These enzymes cleave the polar headgroup from membrane lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, intracellular second messengers that mobilize intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C enzymes, respectively. To date, 13 human PLC isozymes have been identified comprising six distinct and differentially regulated families (β1–4, γ1–2, δ1,3–4, ϵ, η1–2, and ζ) (1Harden T.K. Sondek J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

They vary in molecular size from the ∼70-kDa PLCζ to the much larger ∼250-kDa PLCϵ, but they share a common core domain structure including the EF domain, the C2 domain, and the highly conserved catalytic core made up of two regions, commonly referred to as X and Y domains (4Rhee S.G.

Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Given the highly conserved active site residues within all PLCs, it is not surprising that they all act predominantly on just two substrates, PIP and PIP2, with some catalytic activity toward PI (6Rhee S.G.

Therefore, PLC isozymes likely achieve selectivity in their physiological functions through either isozyme-specific receptor activation or through unique downstream signaling mechanisms. PLC-mediated signaling has been implicated in a number of critical cellular functions such as motility (7Jones N.P. Peak J. Brader S. Eccles S.A. Katan M. J.

Many studies have since reported that several isozymes of PLC are inhibited by U73122, but not by U73343, a close structural analog of U73122 containing N-alkylsuccinimide moiety in place of N-alkylmaleimide (15Carvou N.

These reports have established U73122 as the prototypical inhibitor of PLC enzymes.

However, several recent reports suggest that U73122 may not be selective for PLCs, as effects on numerous cellular proteins have been reported, including telomerase (20Chen Y.J. Sheng W.Y. Huang P.R.

Maleimides are inherently reactive and readily interact with cellular thiols and amines; therefore, covalent modification of nucleophiles on other proteins provides a likely mechanism for the observed off-target effects. However, the fact remains that there are numerous reports of U73122 as an inhibitor of PLCs (14Bleasdale J.E. Bundy G.L. Bunting S. Fitzpatrick F.A. Huff R.M. Sun F.F. Pike J.E. Adv.

It is disconcerting that little work has been done to understand the interaction of this molecule with PLCs at the molecular level, considering that modulation of cellular functions by U73122 is often considered unequivocal evidence for involvement of PLCs in those cellular functions. In this study, interaction between U73122 and specific PLC isozymes was evaluated in a simple, cell-free, mixed micellar system. Surprisingly, these studies revealed that U73122 activates, not inhibits, the activity of several PLC isozymes, uncovering a novel and potentially general activation mechanism for lipases such as PLCs.DISCUSSIONU73122 has long been regarded as a prototypical inhibitor of PLCs and almost exclusively reported as a potent and selective inhibitor of PLC activity in cellular systems. In fact, modulation of a cellular event by U73122 is often purported as evidence of the involvement of PLCs in that event. Recent studies have questioned the use of U73122 as a specific inhibitor of PLCs by uncovering a number of “off-target” interactions, likely due to covalent modification of nucleophiles by the maleimide moiety in U73122 (27Gloyna W. Schmitz F. Seebeck J. Regul. Pept. 2005; 125: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 28Horowitz L.F. Hirdes W. Suh B.C. Hilgemann D.W. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Gen.

Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings point to the complication of using U73122 as a tool to study PLC function in complex cellular systems and suggest the need for a clearer understanding of how U73122 interacts with PLCs at the molecular level.In this study, interaction of U73122 with hPLCβ3 was investigated in a cell-free system to elucidate the mechanism by which U73122 inhibits PLC enzymes in cellular systems. To limit the presence of confounding components that may act as nucleophilic targets for U73122, the simplest system available, i.e. mixed micelles, was employed. The expectation was that U73122 would irreversibly inhibit the lipase activity via a mechanism involving covalent modification of nucleophilic residues on hPLCβ3 (i.e. cysteines). Surprisingly, U73122 caused an increase, rather than a decrease, of the lipase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, U73122 also caused activation of hPLCβ2 and hPLCγ1 enzymes in mixed micelles, indicating that the enzyme activation mechanism is applicable to other members of the PLC enzyme family (Fig. 3, A–C). This is the first study demonstrating activation of PLC enzymes by U73122 in a well defined cell-free system. Interestingly, a recent study in whole cells observed weak and transient activation effects in addition to potent inhibition (28Horowitz L.F. Hirdes W. Suh B.C. Hilgemann D.W. Mackie K. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 243-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), providing both a precedent and potential relevance to cellular systems for the current observation.The activation observed in mixed micelles reached maximal effect rapidly and was sustained upon longer incubation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the activation was attenuated with competing nucleophiles, glutathione and cysteine, in solution (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggested that the activation of hPLCβ3 occurs via covalent modification of one or more nucleophiles, presumably sulfhydryl groups, by the reactive maleimide moiety of U73122. A simple replacement of the maleimide moiety in U73122 with a succinimide moiety rendered the resulting compound (U73343) completely ineffective as a PLC activator. This result provided strong support to the hypothesis that covalent modification of hPLCβ3 by U73122 was a requisite step for enzyme activation.Mass spectral analysis of the hPLCβ3 protein that was allowed to react with U73122 as a function of time provided direct evidence for covalent modification of the protein by U73122. With increasing incubation times, reaction of up to eight U73122 molecules per molecule of the hPLCβ3 protein could easily be detected based on increases in mass-to-charge of intact hPLCβ3 by multiples of the molecular weight of U73122 (∼0.5 kDa) (Fig. 6). These data unequivocally demonstrate that U73122 reacts covalently with as many as eight distinct sites on hPLCβ3 and suggest an underlying molecular mechanism for modulation of PLC activity in cell-free experimental systems.There are 14 cysteine residues in hPLCβ3 (Fig. 7). To unambiguously confirm cysteines as the sites of alkylation by U73122, as well as to identify specific residues modified by U73122, LC/MS/MS was used for peptide mapping of U73122-modified hPLCβ3. Peptides containing 12 of the 14 cysteines were identified from protease-digested hPLCβ3, excluding Cys-669 and Cys-834. When hPLCβ3 was incubated with U73122 under conditions similar to those that led to its activation, 8 of the 12 identified cysteine residues were found to be alkylated, including Cys-360 and Cys-614 located in the so-called “X” and “Y” boxes that make up the highly conserved catalytic domain of all PLCs. Other modified residues include Cys-516 in the less conserved linker region between the X and Y boxes, as well as Cys-193, Cys-221, Cys-892, Cys-1176, and Cys-1207 outside of the catalytic domain. Interestingly, Cys-193 and Cys-221 are located within the pleckstrin homology domain, a region thought to be critical for the membrane recruitment of PLCβ isozymes, and recently implicated in the interaction of PLCβ2 with Rac1 during substrate catalysis (41Jezyk M.R. Snyder J.T. Gershberg S. Worthylake D.K. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1135-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Time-dependent activation studies (Fig. 4) demonstrated that maximal activation was observed within 30 s of preincubation of U73122 with hPLCβ3; however, after 1 min of incubation, mass spectra of intact hPLCβ3 revealed only four additions of U73122 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that alkylation of four or fewer residues are primarily responsible for the activation. Site-directed mutagenesis of each alkylated cysteine residue would be useful to explore the role of individual cysteines in the observed activation by U73122.Maleimides are inherently reactive and readily interact with thiols, such as cysteine residues, on cellular proteins; therefore, it was important to determine whether protein alkylation at cysteine residues on hPLCβ3 was the sole mechanism for the U73122-mediated activation. NEM (Fig. 8) is a small water-soluble maleimide, which contains an ethyl group in place of the lipophilic alkylamino steroid functionality of U73122; and it is capable of modifying sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Interestingly, NEM had no effect on the activity of hPLCβ3 in DDM-mixed micelles at concentrations as high as 400 μm, despite the fact that mass spectra of hPLCβ3 incubated with NEM identified protein species consistent with reaction of up to eight NEM molecules (Fig. 9A). This result indicates that simply alkylating the sulfhydryl groups on PLCs does not cause activation of the enzyme. In addition, U73343, which is nearly identical to U73122 with respect to chemical structure except that it does not contain the reactive maleimide moiety (but contains succinimide moiety instead), does not cause activation of the enzyme. Together, these results suggest that the activation mechanism involves covalent modification of several sulfhydryl groups on hPLCβ3 by a hydrophobic steroid moiety. As expected based on the above observations, the combined treatment of NEM and the succinimide derivative, U73343, had no effect on activity (data not shown). Importantly, the lack of any effect of NEM on the activity of hPLCβ3, activation or inhibition, also suggests that the eight cysteine residues alkylated by NEM do not play a direct role in the catalytic activity of hPLCβ3 in this system. Although NEM was unable to activate hPLCβ3, excess NEM attenuated the U73122-mediated activation in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, mass spectral data demonstrated that NEM pretreatment prevented covalent modification of hPLCβ3 by U73122 (Fig. 9B). Together, these studies imply that alkylation of several sulfhydryl groups on hPLCβ3, none of which is playing a direct role in the catalytic function, by a lipophilic steroid causes activation of the enzymatic activity.The following hypothesis for activation of hPLCβ3 is consistent with the results presented herein. U73122 irreversibly binds to multiple cysteine residues on hPLCβ3 and serves as either a lipid anchor or interfacial recognition site for the enzyme, facilitating adsorption of the enzyme to the substrate interface (i.e. the micelle surface). The protein-linked U73122 increases the rate of lipase activity by keeping the enzyme in close proximity to the membrane where the substrate resides (Fig. 10). Because the proposed mechanism of enzyme activation involves U73122 chaperoning the enzyme molecules to the lipid micelles where the substrate is located, it is not surprising that PLC isozymes other than hPLCβ3 were also activated by this agent. The proposed mechanism for activation is consistent with the recent observation that U73122 enhances in vitro yeast vacuole membrane fusion mediated by the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor domain of Vam7p through enhanced membrane binding (31Fratti R.A. Collins K.M. Hickey C.M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14861-14867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Implications for PLC BiochemistryBecause all PLC isozymes work on primarily two substrates, PIP or PIP2, their selectivity in cellular functions must derive from their differential activation by receptors to which they are linked. The molecular mechanisms underlying cellular PLC activation and subsequent substrate hydrolysis at cellular membranes are not completely understood. Recruitment of the cytosolic PLC enzymes to the cell membrane and conformational changes upon membrane binding that expose the active site and increase enzyme activity are believed to be an activation mechanism for a number of lipases (i.e. the opening of the lid providing access to the active site) (42Aloulou A.

Post-translational modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation, have clearly been shown to trigger rapid conformational changes in many proteins leading to significant alterations in protein function (59Canagarajah B.J.

For example, nitrosation of caspase 3 by nitric oxide at a specific cysteine residue was reported to be critical for promotion of apoptosis (52Mitchell D.A. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem.

S-Nitrosothiols have also been shown to modify phosphatases such as PTEN, a phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase, leading to a reversible inhibition of its phosphatase activity (55Yu C.X. Li S. Whorton A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and supporting a hypothesis for cysteine-dependent changes in protein function.

Based on the proposed U73122-mediated activation mechanism for PLC enzymes in cell-free systems, it is tempting to speculate that activation of PLC enzymes inside the cell occurs via recruitment of cytosolic PLCs to the cell membrane through transient modification of sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme by lipophilic moieties, triggered as a result of receptor activation.Implications for the Use of U73122 as a Prototypical PLC InhibitorThe present results provide unequivocal evidence that in cell-free systems U73122 activates PLC enzymes. This contrasts with the “established” role of U73122 as a specific inhibitor of this family of enzymes. It is conceivable that U73122 has opposite effects on PLC enzymes depending on the environment in which it finds the enzyme molecules. For example, it could activate the cytosolic PLC enzymes by a mechanism similar to the one proposed for PLC activation in cell-free systems but inhibit PLCs that are already associated with the cell membrane (the site of PLC catalysis) due to receptor-mediated activation. Alternatively, the observed inhibition of PLCs by U73122 in cellular systems may result indirectly by covalent modification of other cellular proteins"
https://openalex.org/W2080430580,"Background The recent outbreak of bluetongue virus in northern Europe has led to an urgent need to identify control measures for the Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges that transmit it. Following successful use of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae against larval stages of biting midge Culicoides nubeculosus Meigen, we investigated the efficacy of this strain and other fungi (Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea and Lecanicillium longisporum) as biocontrol agents against adult C. nubeculosus in laboratory and greenhouse studies. Methodology/Findings Exposure of midges to ‘dry’ conidia of all fungal isolates caused significant reductions in survival compared to untreated controls. Metarhizium anisopliae strain V275 was the most virulent, causing a significantly decrease in midge survival compared to all other fungal strains tested. The LT50 value for strain V275 was 1.42 days compared to 2.21–3.22 days for the other isolates. The virulence of this strain was then further evaluated by exposing C. nubeculosus to varying doses (108–1011 conidia m−2) using different substrates (horse manure, damp peat, leaf litter) as a resting site. All exposed adults were found to be infected with the strain V275 four days after exposure. A further study exposed C. nubeculosus adults to ‘dry’ conidia and ‘wet’ conidia (conidia suspended in 0.03% aq. Tween 80) of strain V275 applied to damp peat and leaf litter in cages within a greenhouse. ‘Dry’ conidia were more effective than ‘wet’ conidia, causing 100% mortality after 5 days. Conclusion/Significance This is the first study to demonstrate that entomopathogenic fungi are potential biocontrol agents against adult Culicoides, through the application of ‘dry’ conidia on surfaces (e.g., manure, leaf litter, livestock) where the midges tend to rest. Subsequent conidial transmission between males and females may cause an increased level of fungi-induced mortality in midges thus reducing the incidence of disease."
https://openalex.org/W1994106810,"Chronic acquired neuropathies of unknown origin are classified as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (CIDP) and chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathies (CIAP). The diagnosis can be very difficult, although it has important therapeutic implications since CIDP can be improved by immunomodulating treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the possible abnormalities of nodal and paranodal regions in these two types of neuropathies. Longitudinal sections of superficial peroneal nerves were obtained from biopsy material from 12 patients with CIDP and 10 patients with CIAP and studied by immunofluorescence and in some cases electron microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed multiple alterations in the nodal and paranodal regions which predominated in Schwann cells in CIDP and in axons in CIAP. In CIDP paranodin/Caspr immunofluorescence was more widespread than in control nerves, extending along the axon in internodes where it appeared intense. Nodal channels Nav and KCNQ2 were less altered but were also detected in the internodes. In CIAP paranodes, paranodin labeling was irregular and/or decreased. To test the consequences of acquired primary Schwann cells alteration on axonal proteins, we used a mouse model based on induced deletion of the transcription factor Krox-20 gene. In the demyelinated sciatic nerves of these mice we observed alterations similar to those found in CIDP by immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting demonstrated increased levels of paranodin. Finally we examined whether the alterations in paranodin immunoreactivity could have a diagnosis value. In a sample of 16 biopsies, the study of paranodin immunofluorescence by blind evaluators led to correct diagnosis in 70±4% of the cases. This study characterizes for the first time the abnormalities of nodes of Ranvier in CIAP and CIDP, and the altered expression and distribution of nodal and paranodal proteins. Marked differences were observed between CIDP and CIAP and the alterations in paranodin immunofluorescence may be an interesting tool for their differential diagnosis."

In this study, OleA from Xanthomonas campestris was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity.

IntroductionCommodity hydrocarbons derive from petroleum, but nature provides a rich source of hydrocarbons for which biosynthetic pathways are being elucidated. Isoprenoid biosynthesis has been well studied (1Muntendam R. Melillo E. Ryden A. Kayser O. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009; 84: 1003-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and an enzymatic decarbonylation of fatty aldehydes to produce alkanes has recently been demonstrated for cyanobacteria (2Schirmer A. Rude M.A. Li X. Popova E. del Cardayre S.B. Science. 2010; 329: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). It has been known for more than 40 years that some bacteria biosynthesize long (C23–C33) hydrocarbon chains containing a double bond at the median carbon via a mechanism known as a “head-to-head” condensation of fatty acyl groups (3Tornabene T.G. Oró J. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 94: 349-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C.

For example, bacteria from the genus Arthrobacter produce largely C15 fatty acids (9Unell M. Kabelitz N. Jansson J.K. Heipieper H.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 266: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and make predominantly C29 olefins (10Frias J.A. Richman J.E. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with studies in 1969 showing the loss of the 14C label at carbon-1 of one of the acyl groups undergoing head-to-head condensation (6Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These early in vitro studies were conducted with crude cell protein extracts. It was not until 2010 that the genes involved in the head-to-head biosynthetic pathway were described in the peer-reviewed literature (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Hunt K.A. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), providing new insights into the biosynthetic pathway based on a bioinformatics analysis of the gene and protein families.OleA is homologous to proteins in the thiolase or condensing enzyme superfamily (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is a very large superfamily of over 13,000 known proteins. The known thiolase superfamily proteins typically catalyze condensation reactions between acyl-thioester substrates, either with or without the loss of a carboxyl group. Approximately 70 bacteria are known to contain genes denoted as oleABCD, and those tested produce long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons (13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The precise role of each ole gene product in the biosynthesis remains to be defined. When the oleC gene is deleted or only the oleA gene is present in vivo, a long-chain ketone(s) is observed. These data supported the idea that OleA is involved in the initial stages of the head-to-head hydrocarbon biosynthetic reactions (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Friedman, L., Rude, M., (September 18, 2008) International Patent WO2008/113041.Google Scholar).There are two alternative proposals in the literature regarding the OleA condensation reaction (Fig. 1). Beller et al. (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) have proposed that OleA catalyzes a decarboxylative condensation between a β-ketoacyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA. Sukovich et al. (13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) have proposed that OleA catalyzes a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation between two fatty acyl-CoA substrates. These two types of condensation reactions are difficult to differentiate in vivo, where both fatty acyl-CoAs and β-ketoacyl-CoAs may be present simultaneously, and many enzymes are present. The study by Beller et al. (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) used a purified OleA enzyme, but their demonstration of activity required the addition of a crude soluble protein extract from Escherichia coli. The proposed β-ketoacyl-CoA substrate was suggested to have been generated from the corresponding acyl-CoA by the proteins present in the E. coli soluble fraction. A clear differentiation between OleA reaction A and B could be obtained using a purified OleA preparation in admixture with defined substrates in vitro. The two types of condensation reactions could also be differentiated by determining the reaction product. OleA reaction A produces a 1,3-diketone, whereas OleA reaction B yields a β-ketoacid (Fig. 1).There are other important questions that can be answered directly using a purified OleA protein and purified single substrates. These include determining the substrate specificity of OleA with respect to chain length, determining the complete reaction stoichiometry, determining what drives the apparent Claisen condensation to completion, and revealing why cloning oleA genes in heterologous hosts produces monoketones. These issues are addressed in the present work.The OleA protein from Xanthomonas campestris was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity. The putative product of the reaction was synthesized chemically to allow comparison with the biochemical product. OleA was shown to react with myristoyl 2Myristoyl is equivalent to tetradecanoyl. -CoA to produce the corresponding β-ketoacid via a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation reaction. This intermediate was shown to react, in the presence of OleC and OleD, to yield a long-chain olefin. In the absence of OleC and OleD, the product of the OleA reaction was shown to undergo spontaneous chemical decarboxylation to yield a ketone. This explains previous in vivo observations of ketone formation with the expression of an oleA gene in a heterologous host (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this study, the OleA protein from X. campestris was purified to homogeneity and shown to condense fatty acyl-CoA substrates to produce a condensed β-ketoacid with the release of 2 mol of CoA. The β-ketoacid, synthesized chemically or enzymatically, was shown to undergo further metabolism to yield a long-chain olefin in the presence of OleC and OleD. These studies confirmed that OleA catalyzes the first reaction in alkene biosynthesis with acyl-CoA substrates and carries out a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation reaction.An OleA protein was previously purified from M. luteus, and it was proposed to catalyze a different reaction (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) than the one demonstrated here with the OleA protein from X. campestris. The Xanthomonas and Micrococcus OleA proteins showed 38% sequence identity (Table 1) in a pairwise alignment of their amino acid sequences (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar), so they could conceivably catalyze different reactions. The oleA genes from both organisms cluster with oleBCD genes. In the Micrococcus genome, the oleB and oleC genes are fused and likely produce a multidomain protein. However, the OleA, OleB, OleC, and OleD domains are present in both organisms. It was shown in the present study that OleC and OleD proteins act on the β-ketoacid product generated by X. campestris OleA to produce a long-chain olefin. When the Micrococcus oleA gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli, long-chain ketones were observed (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, the recombinant E. coli strain expressing the X. campestris OleA protein alone was also observed to produce long-chain ketones that were not observed in the wild-type E. coli (data not shown). The in vitro data in this study showed that the ketones readily arise from the decarboxylation of a corresponding β-ketoacid intermediate. These observations are all consistent with a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation as shown in Fig. 1B and difficult to reconcile with the proposed decarboxylative reaction shown in Fig. 1A.The reaction catalyzed by OleA is somewhat reminiscent of the Zoogloea thiolase reaction that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (23Davis J.T. Moore R.N. Imperiali B. Pratt A.J. Kobayashi K. Masamune S. Sinskey A.J. Walsh C.T. Fukui T. Tomita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 82-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter reaction, however, the condensed product is a β-ketoacetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and with OleA, the product is a β-keto acid. Several lines of evidence strongly suggested that OleA does not produce a β-ketoacetyl-CoA that is hydrolyzed to the acid by another enzyme. First, the oleA gene was cloned as a single open reading frame (ORF) from synthetic DNA and expressed in E. coli, a bacterium that does not natively synthesize hydrocarbons. Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing 2-myristoylmyristoyl-CoA are not likely to be present in E. coli. Second, OleA was highly purified as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), so even the unlikely E. coli hydrolytic enzyme would have been removed. Last, our HPLC conditions would have detected 2-myristoylmyristoyl-CoA, and this was never detected.Based on the data obtained and the known role of the conserved cysteine found in other members of the thiolase superfamily, a working reaction mechanism can be presented for the OleA-catalyzed reaction (Fig. 7). We propose that initially an active site cysteine in the resting enzyme (Fig. 7A) is acylated, and coenzyme A is liberated (Fig. 7B). Subsequently, the tethered substrate is probably activated by an active site base to yield a carbanion on the tethered substrate (Fig. 7C). The carbanion then can react at the active site with the carbonyl carbon of a non-covalently bound acyl-CoA (Fig. 7D). That reaction forms a carbon-to-carbon bond with the condensed product still tethered to the enzyme cysteine and producing the second molecule of coenzyme A formed in the reaction cycle (Fig. 7E). The covalently bound condensation product can then undergo hydrolysis to yield the final β-ketoacid product and regenerate the free cysteine residue of the resting enzyme state (Fig. 7A). Although several features of this proposed mechanism are not yet demonstrated directly, there are multiple data that support this proposal. First, this mechanism explains the observed stoichiometry in which 2 mol of coenzyme A are observed/mol of condensed product. Second, the observed high rate of hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to produce fatty acids is not unexpected if the enzyme has a mechanism to hydrolyze thioester-linked intermediates during its normal reaction cycle. Thus, there could be a kinetic competition between hydrolysis of the initially bound acyl group (Fig. 7B) and the tethered condensation product (Fig. 7E). Depending upon the binding affinity for the different length acyl-CoA used in the experiment described in Table 3, hydrolysis of intermediate 7B or 7E would occur preferentially. Last, proteins in the thiolase superfamily typically use an active site cysteine to acquire an acyl chain to initiate catalysis (27Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Haapalainen A.M. Meriläinen G. Wierenga R.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 64-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the region around the cysteine residue shown in Table 1 is the most highly conserved region of OleA with other members of the superfamily.FIGURE 7Proposed reaction cycle for OleA.

The products of the reaction, two molecules of coenzyme A (CoASH) and a β-keto acid, are highlighted by boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are significant questions that remain to be addressed regarding this proposed mechanism (Fig. 7). First, the identity of the proposed cysteine nucleophile has not been directly demonstrated here. Second, the suggested generation of a carbanion (Fig. 7B) requires a general base that remains to be identified. Additionally, this mechanism would be supported by the identification of the binding sites for the acyl chains and that the chains are covalently and non-covalently bound, respectively.This study identified the product of the OleA-catalyzed reaction to be a β-keto acid. The production of olefins required the presence of OleC and OleD in addition to OleA. These data indicated that OleC and OleD catalyze further reactions with the β-ketoacid intermediate generated by OleA. This was supported by experiments in which 2-myristoylmyristic acid was transformed to an olefin by OleC and OleD. The corresponding ketone was not transformed to an olefin, consistent with the idea that the ketone is not a physiologically relevant intermediate. There is also the issue that C-2 in 2-myristoylmyristic acid is a chiral center. The synthetic 2-myristoylmyristic acid is racemic, and it is plausible that only one enantiomer will react with OleD. The chirality of the reaction is currently under investigation. IntroductionCommodity hydrocarbons derive from petroleum, but nature provides a rich source of hydrocarbons for which biosynthetic pathways are being elucidated.

Biotechnol. 2009; 84: 1003-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and an enzymatic decarbonylation of fatty aldehydes to produce alkanes has recently been demonstrated for cyanobacteria (2Schirmer A. Rude M.A. Li X. Popova E. del Cardayre S.B. Science. 2010; 329: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). It has been known for more than 40 years that some bacteria biosynthesize long (C23–C33) hydrocarbon chains containing a double bond at the median carbon via a mechanism known as a “head-to-head” condensation of fatty acyl groups (3Tornabene T.G. Oró J. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 94: 349-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Albro P.W. Meehan T.D. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1893-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, bacteria from the genus Arthrobacter produce largely C15 fatty acids (9Unell M. Kabelitz N. Jansson J.K. Heipieper H.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 266: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and make predominantly C29 olefins (10Frias J.A. Richman J.E. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with studies in 1969 showing the loss of the 14C label at carbon-1 of one of the acyl groups undergoing head-to-head condensation (6Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These early in vitro studies were conducted with crude cell protein extracts. It was not until 2010 that the genes involved in the head-to-head biosynthetic pathway were described in the peer-reviewed literature (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Hunt K.A. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), providing new insights into the biosynthetic pathway based on a bioinformatics analysis of the gene and protein families.OleA is homologous to proteins in the thiolase or condensing enzyme superfamily (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is a very large superfamily of over 13,000 known proteins. The known thiolase superfamily proteins typically catalyze condensation reactions between acyl-thioester substrates, either with or without the loss of a carboxyl group. Approximately 70 bacteria are known to contain genes denoted as oleABCD, and those tested produce long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons (13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The precise role of each ole gene product in the biosynthesis remains to be defined. When the oleC gene is deleted or only the oleA gene is present in vivo, a long-chain ketone(s) is observed. These data supported the idea that OleA is involved in the initial stages of the head-to-head hydrocarbon biosynthetic reactions (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Friedman, L., Rude, M., (September 18, 2008) International Patent WO2008/113041.Google Scholar).There are two alternative proposals in the literature regarding the OleA condensation reaction (Fig. 1). Beller et al. (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) have proposed that OleA catalyzes a decarboxylative condensation between a β-ketoacyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA. Sukovich et al. (13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) have proposed that OleA catalyzes a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation between two fatty acyl-CoA substrates. These two types of condensation reactions are difficult to differentiate in vivo, where both fatty acyl-CoAs and β-ketoacyl-CoAs may be present simultaneously, and many enzymes are present. The study by Beller et al. (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) used a purified OleA enzyme, but their demonstration of activity required the addition of a crude soluble protein extract from Escherichia coli. The proposed β-ketoacyl-CoA substrate was suggested to have been generated from the corresponding acyl-CoA by the proteins present in the E. coli soluble fraction. A clear differentiation between OleA reaction A and B could be obtained using a purified OleA preparation in admixture with defined substrates in vitro. The two types of condensation reactions could also be differentiated by determining the reaction product. OleA reaction A produces a 1,3-diketone, whereas OleA reaction B yields a β-ketoacid (Fig. 1).There are other important questions that can be answered directly using a purified OleA protein and purified single substrates. These include determining the substrate specificity of OleA with respect to chain length, determining the complete reaction stoichiometry, determining what drives the apparent Claisen condensation to completion, and revealing why cloning oleA genes in heterologous hosts produces monoketones. These issues are addressed in the present work.The OleA protein from Xanthomonas campestris was cloned, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity. The putative product of the reaction was synthesized chemically to allow comparison with the biochemical product. OleA was shown to react with myristoyl 2Myristoyl is equivalent to tetradecanoyl. -CoA to produce the corresponding β-ketoacid via a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation reaction. This intermediate was shown to react, in the presence of OleC and OleD, to yield a long-chain olefin. In the absence of OleC and OleD, the product of the OleA reaction was shown to undergo spontaneous chemical decarboxylation to yield a ketone. This explains previous in vivo observations of ketone formation with the expression of an oleA gene in a heterologous host (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ.

There are two alternative proposals in the literature regarding the OleA condensation reaction (Fig. 1). Beller et al. (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ.

Sukovich et al. (13Sukovich D.J. Seffernick J.L. Richman J.E. Gralnick J.A. Wackett L.P. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 2010; 76: 3850-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONIn this study, the OleA protein from X. campestris was purified to homogeneity and shown to condense fatty acyl-CoA substrates to produce a condensed β-ketoacid with the release of 2 mol of CoA. The β-ketoacid, synthesized chemically or enzymatically, was shown to undergo further metabolism to yield a long-chain olefin in the presence of OleC and OleD. These studies confirmed that OleA catalyzes the first reaction in alkene biosynthesis with acyl-CoA substrates and carries out a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation reaction.An OleA protein was previously purified from M. luteus, and it was proposed to catalyze a different reaction (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) than the one demonstrated here with the OleA protein from X. campestris. The Xanthomonas and Micrococcus OleA proteins showed 38% sequence identity (Table 1) in a pairwise alignment of their amino acid sequences (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar), so they could conceivably catalyze different reactions. The oleA genes from both organisms cluster with oleBCD genes. In the Micrococcus genome, the oleB and oleC genes are fused and likely produce a multidomain protein. However, the OleA, OleB, OleC, and OleD domains are present in both organisms. It was shown in the present study that OleC and OleD proteins act on the β-ketoacid product generated by X. campestris OleA to produce a long-chain olefin. When the Micrococcus oleA gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli, long-chain ketones were observed (11Beller H.R. Goh E.B. Keasling J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, the recombinant E. coli strain expressing the X. campestris OleA protein alone was also observed to produce long-chain ketones that were not observed in the wild-type E. coli (data not shown). The in vitro data in this study showed that the ketones readily arise from the decarboxylation of a corresponding β-ketoacid intermediate. These observations are all consistent with a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation as shown in Fig. 1B and difficult to reconcile with the proposed decarboxylative reaction shown in Fig. 1A.The reaction catalyzed by OleA is somewhat reminiscent of the Zoogloea thiolase reaction that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (23Davis J.T. Moore R.N. Imperiali B. Pratt A.J. Kobayashi K. Masamune S. Sinskey A.J. Walsh C.T. Fukui T. Tomita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 82-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter reaction, however, the condensed product is a β-ketoacetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and with OleA, the product is a β-keto acid. Several lines of evidence strongly suggested that OleA does not produce a β-ketoacetyl-CoA that is hydrolyzed to the acid by another enzyme. First, the oleA gene was cloned as a single open reading frame (ORF) from synthetic DNA and expressed in E. coli, a bacterium that does not natively synthesize hydrocarbons. Enzymes capable of hydrolyzing 2-myristoylmyristoyl-CoA are not likely to be present in E. coli. Second, OleA was highly purified as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), so even the unlikely E. coli hydrolytic enzyme would have been removed. Last, our HPLC conditions would have detected 2-myristoylmyristoyl-CoA, and this was never detected.Based on the data obtained and the known role of the conserved cysteine found in other members of the thiolase superfamily, a working reaction mechanism can be presented for the OleA-catalyzed reaction (Fig. 7). We propose that initially an active site cysteine in the resting enzyme (Fig. 7A) is acylated, and coenzyme A is liberated (Fig. 7B). Subsequently, the tethered substrate is probably activated by an active site base to yield a carbanion on the tethered substrate (Fig. 7C). The carbanion then can react at the active site with the carbonyl carbon of a non-covalently bound acyl-CoA (Fig. 7D). That reaction forms a carbon-to-carbon bond with the condensed product still tethered to the enzyme cysteine and producing the second molecule of coenzyme A formed in the reaction cycle (Fig. 7E). The covalently bound condensation product can then undergo hydrolysis to yield the final β-ketoacid product and regenerate the free cysteine residue of the resting enzyme state (Fig. 7A). Although several features of this proposed mechanism are not yet demonstrated directly, there are multiple data that support this proposal. First, this mechanism explains the observed stoichiometry in which 2 mol of coenzyme A are observed/mol of condensed product. Second, the observed high rate of hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to produce fatty acids is not unexpected if the enzyme has a mechanism to hydrolyze thioester-linked intermediates during its normal reaction cycle. Thus, there could be a kinetic competition between hydrolysis of the initially bound acyl group (Fig. 7B) and the tethered condensation product (Fig. 7E). Depending upon the binding affinity for the different length acyl-CoA used in the experiment described in Table 3, hydrolysis of intermediate 7B or 7E would occur preferentially. Last, proteins in the thiolase superfamily typically use an active site cysteine to acquire an acyl chain to initiate catalysis (27Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Haapalainen A.M. Meriläinen G. Wierenga R.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 64-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the region around the cysteine residue shown in Table 1 is the most highly conserved region of OleA with other members of the superfamily.There are significant questions that remain to be addressed regarding this proposed mechanism (Fig. 7). First, the identity of the proposed cysteine nucleophile has not been directly demonstrated here. Second, the suggested generation of a carbanion (Fig. 7B) requires a general base that remains to be identified. Additionally, this mechanism would be supported by the identification of the binding sites for the acyl chains and that the chains are covalently and non-covalently bound, respectively.This study identified the product of the OleA-catalyzed reaction to be a β-keto acid. The production of olefins required the presence of OleC and OleD in addition to OleA. These data indicated that OleC and OleD catalyze further reactions with the β-ketoacid intermediate generated by OleA. This was supported by experiments in which 2-myristoylmyristic acid was transformed to an olefin by OleC and OleD. The corresponding ketone was not transformed to an olefin, consistent with the idea that the ketone is not a physiologically relevant intermediate. There is also the issue that C-2 in 2-myristoylmyristic acid is a chiral center. The synthetic 2-myristoylmyristic acid is racemic, and it is plausible that only one enantiomer will react with OleD. The chirality of the reaction is currently under investigation. In this study, the OleA protein from X. campestris was purified to homogeneity and shown to condense fatty acyl-CoA substrates to produce a condensed β-ketoacid with the release of 2 mol of CoA. The β-ketoacid, synthesized chemically or enzymatically, was shown to undergo further metabolism to yield a long-chain olefin in the presence of OleC and OleD.

There are significant questions that remain to be addressed regarding this proposed mechanism (Fig. 7). First, the identity of the proposed cysteine nucleophile has not been directly demonstrated here. Second, the suggested generation of a carbanion (Fig. 7B) requires a general base that remains to be identified. Additionally, this mechanism would be supported by the identification of the binding sites for the acyl chains and that the chains are covalently and non-covalently bound, respectively. This study identified the product of the OleA-catalyzed reaction to be a β-keto acid. The production of olefins required the presence of OleC and OleD in addition to OleA. These data indicated that OleC and OleD catalyze further reactions with the β-ketoacid intermediate generated by OleA. This was supported by experiments in which 2-myristoylmyristic acid was transformed to an olefin by OleC and OleD. The corresponding ketone was not transformed to an olefin, consistent with the idea that the ketone is not a physiologically relevant intermediate. There is also the issue that C-2 in 2-myristoylmyristic acid is a chiral center. The synthetic 2-myristoylmyristic acid is racemic, and it is plausible that only one enantiomer will react with OleD. The chirality of the reaction is currently under investigation. We thank David Sukovich for providing a selection of oleA genes used in these studies.

https://openalex.org/W2078375833,"Research on adolescent substance use has consistently identified a strong relationship between adolescent behavior and the behavior of their peers. However, peer effects are difficult to estimate and causal interpretations must be undertaken with caution since individuals in most cases choose with whom to associate. In this paper we seek to empirically quantify the causal role of peer social networks in explaining marijuana usage among adolescents.Using data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents we utilize a multivariate structural model with school-level fixed effects to account for the problems of contextual effects, correlated effects and peer selections to purge the potential biases from the estimates of peer influence. Our peer group measures are drawn not only from the nomination of close friends (N = 6,377), but also from classmates (N = 19,335). Marijuana usage among the peer groups were constructed using the peers' own report of their marijuana consumption. Controlling for parent level characteristics, and other demographic parameters, we find that a 10% increase in the proportion of close friends and classmates who use marijuana increases the probability that an individual chooses to use marijuana by 5%.Our findings indicate that peer effects are important determinants of marijuana use even after controlling for potential biases We also found evidence to show that the influence of close friends and the more exogenous classmates are quite similar in magnitude under our preferred specification, supporting theory predicting the importance of peer influence. Effective policy aimed at reducing marijuana usage among adolescents would consider these significant peer effects."
https://openalex.org/W2039023342,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonate to prostaglandin H(2). We have previously synthesized and chemically characterized nitroarachidonic acid (AANO(2)), a novel anti-inflammatory signaling mediator. Herein, the interaction of AANO(2) with PGHS was analyzed. AANO(2) inhibited oxygenase activity of PGHS-1 but not PGHS-2. AANO(2) exhibited time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of peroxidase activity in both PGHS-1 and -2. The plot of k(obs) versus AANO(2) concentrations showed a hyperbolic function with k(inact) = 0.045 s(-1) and K(i)(*app) = 0.019 μM for PGHS-1 and k(inact) = 0.057 s(-1) and K(i)(*app) = 0.020 μM for PGHS-2. Kinetic analysis suggests that inactivation of PGHS by AANO(2) involves two sequential steps: an initial reversible binding event (described by K(i)) followed by a practically irreversible event (K(i)(*app)) leading to an inactivated enzyme. Inactivation was associated with irreversible disruption of heme binding to the protein. The inhibitory effects of AANO(2) were selective because other nitro-fatty acids tested, such as nitrooleic acid and nitrolinoleic acid, were unable to inhibit enzyme activity. In activated human platelets, AANO(2) significantly decreased PGHS-1-dependent thromboxane B(2) formation in parallel with a decrease in platelet aggregation, thus confirming the biological relevance of this novel inhibitory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2045701732,"We previously showed that thrombin induces interleukin (IL)-8/CXCL8 expression via the protein kinase C (PKC)α/c-Src-dependent IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β)/NF-κB signaling pathway in human lung epithelial cells. In this study, we further investigated the roles of Rac1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt in thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression. Thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release and IL-8/CXCL8-luciferase activity were attenuated by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), an Akt inhibitor (1-l-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-((R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate)), and the dominant negative mutants of Rac1 (RacN17) and Akt (AktDN). Treatment of cells with thrombin caused activation of Rac and Akt. The thrombin-induced increase in Akt activation was inhibited by RacN17 and LY294002. Stimulation of cells with thrombin resulted in increases in IKKα/β activation and κB-luciferase activity; these effects were inhibited by RacN17, LY294002, an Akt inhibitor, and AktDN. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gβγ, p85α, and Rac1 complex formation in a time-dependent manner. These results imply that thrombin activates the Rac1/PI3K/Akt pathway through formation of the Gβγ, Rac1, and p85α complex to induce IKKα/β activation, NF-κB transactivation, and IL-8/CXCL8 expression in human lung epithelial cells.

IntroductionThrombin is a procoagulant serine protease, is released during initiation of intravascular coagulation by tissue injury, and is well known for its pivotal role in the coagulation cascade, but it also promotes a wide range of cellular responses including inflammatory and immune responses (1Steinhoff M. Buddenkotte J. Shpacovitch V. Rattenholl A. Moormann C. Vergnolle N. Luger T.A. Hollenberg M.D. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence reveals that thrombin exerts its action through proteolytic activation of its receptors, named protease-activated receptors (PARs). 2The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; DN, dominant negative mutant; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IKKα/β, IκB kinases α/β; PBD, p21-binding domain; PI, phosphoinositide; PLC, phospholipase C; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. To date, four PARs have been identified, and each receptor was shown to modulate a variety of pathophysiological processes such as chemokine release (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Sokolova E. Reiser G. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115: 70-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 are activated by thrombin, whereas PAR2 is activated by trypsin and cofactor Xa (4Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Previous reports showed that thrombin plays important roles in lung inflammation, such as inducing the accumulation of neutrophils in the airway and elevating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, MIP-2, and keratinocyte-derived chemokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of thrombin-treated mice (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Moffatt J.D. Lever R. Page C.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, thrombin, acting through PAR1 and PAR4, can induce the release of proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8/CXCL8 in lung epithelial cells (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Asokananthan N. Graham P.T. Fink J. Knight D.A. Bakker A.J. McWilliam A.S. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, thrombin appears to be a common feature of a variety of inflammatory lung diseases and plays pivotal roles in lung inflammation.The CXC chemokine IL-8/CXCL8 is a potent chemoattractant and controls neutrophil chemotaxis toward sites of infection and induced airway inflammation (7Kunkel S.L. Standiford T. Kasahara K. Strieter R.M. Exp. Lung. Res. 1991; 17: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 8Richman-Eisenstat J.B. Jorens P.G. Hébert C.A. Ueki I. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L413-L418PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8/CXCL8 is produced by a wide array of cell types, including lung epithelial cells in response to various stimuli (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Asokananthan N. Graham P.T. Fink J. Knight D.A. Bakker A.J. McWilliam A.S. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). IL-8/CXCL8 is abundant in sputum from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis (8Richman-Eisenstat J.B. Jorens P.G. Hébert C.A. Ueki I. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L413-L418PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chung K.F. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm.

Respiration. 1996; 63: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and it is related to the neutrophil chemoattractant activity exhibited by these diseases. IL-8/CXCL8 expression is primarily regulated by activation of activator protein (AP)-1, nuclear factor (NF)-IL-6, and NF-κB transcription factors (11Mukaida N. Shiroo M. Matsushima K. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, NF-κB appears to be essential for the induction of IL-8/CXCL8 transcription (12Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S. Kasahara T. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13289-13295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas AP-1 and NF-IL-6 are required for maximal gene expression (13Hoffmann E. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Holtmann H. Kracht M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 847-855PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that thrombin coupling of PAR1 and PAR4 in different cell types is required for NF-κB activation and gene expression (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar, 14Rahman A. True A.L. Anwar K.N. Ye R.D. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A previous study demonstrated that thrombin acting through PAR1 induces NF-κB activation and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression by engaging the Gαq/protein kinase C (PKC)δ/Akt and Gβγ/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways (14Rahman A. True A.L. Anwar K.N. Ye R.D. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies demonstrated that thrombin induces NF-κB activation and protein expression through multiple signaling pathways such as PKCα/c-Src, Rac1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), IκB kinases α/β (IKKα/β), and PI3K/Akt (2Lin C.H.

Our previous study showed that thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression are mediated through the PAR1- and PAR4-dependent phosphoinositide (PI)-phospholipase C (PLC)/PKCα/c-Src and IKKα/β signaling pathways (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but little information is available about the roles of Rac1 and PI3K/Akt in regulating NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression following thrombin stimulation in human lung epithelial cells.Rac, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, is divided into three major classes: Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 (17Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Rac1 acts as a molecular switch to mediate multiple cellular mechanisms such as actin cytoskeletal organization and transcriptional regulation of genes (18Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that Rac can be activated by Gβγ subunits of the G protein (19Soulet C. Hechler B. Gratacap M.P. Plantavid M. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Payrastre B. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 2296-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rac was reported to induce activation of NF-κB by stimulation with NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), IKKβ, and phosphorylation of the IκB signal pathway, resulting in transcription of multiple genes (20Mohan S. Koyoma K. Thangasamy A. Nakano H. Glickman R.D. Mohan N. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C362-C371Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Diebold et al. (23Diebold I. Djordjevic T. Hess J. Görlach A. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that thrombin mediates pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression through activation of Rac1-dependent NF-κB activation signaling pathways.PI3K is a family of lipid kinases involved in mitogenic signal transduction and gene expression (24Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). PI3K can be activated by either receptor tyrosine kinase or a G protein-coupled receptor. Once activated, PI3K generates phosphatidyinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, leading to the recruitment and activation of Akt (25Oudit G.Y. Sun H. Kerfant B.G. Crackower M.A. Penninger J.M. Backx P.H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 449-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, acts as a direct downstream effector of PI3Ks and is activated by multiple intracellular signaling pathways (26Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 27Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway plays a critical role in Ras-mediated cellular transformation, adhesion, and survival (28Osada M. Tolkacheva T. Li W. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Saez R. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6333-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, Akt can stimulate signaling pathways that mediate NF-κB activity in Jurkat T-cells (29Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Akt also activates NF-κB through phosphorylation of IKKs, which, in turn, phosphorylate IκB, allowing NF-κB to be translocated to the nucleus and induce gene expression (30Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). It was reported that activation of PI3K and Akt mediated NF-κB activation and gene expression in human lung epithelial cells (31Chang M.S. Lee W.S. Chen B.C. Sheu J.R. Lin C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We previously reported that thrombin induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression via PAR1- and PAR4-dependent PI-PLC/PKCα/c-Src/IKKα/β signaling pathways (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this connection, we propose another signaling pathway of Rac1-dependent PI3K/Akt, which is associated with NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression. In this study, we found that thrombin might activate the Rac1/PI3K/Akt pathway through formation of a Rac1, Gβγ, and p85α complex to induce IKKα/β activation and NF-κB transactivation, ultimately causing IL-8/CXCL8 expression and release in human lung epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONIt is known that increased thrombin levels occur in most inflammatory pulmonary diseases and that thrombin plays a critical role in various pathological processes. For example, thrombin modulates lung inflammation by stimulating the secretion of proinflammatory mediators (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Asokananthan N. Graham P.T. Fink J. Knight D.A. Bakker A.J. McWilliam A.S. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has accumulated to suggest that IL-8/CXCL8 plays a pivotal role in respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and asthma (8Richman-Eisenstat J.B. Jorens P.G. Hébert C.A. Ueki I. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L413-L418PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sakito O. Kadota J. Kohno S. Abe K. Shirai R. Hara K.

Brightling C.E. Pang L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 4682-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that thrombin induced IL-8/CXCL8 expression and release in human lung epithelial cells, suggesting that thrombin and IL-8/CXCL8 expression and release contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases. Our previous study showed that thrombin activates the PI-PLC/PKCα/c-Src pathway, which in turn initiates IKKα/β and NF-κB activation and ultimately induces IL-8/CXLC8 expression and release in human lung epithelial cells (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide the first description of a second pathway linking the small GTP-binding protein, Rac1, to thrombin-stimulated PI3K/Akt activation, IKKα/β activation, NF-κB transcriptional activation, and subsequent IL-8/CXCL8 expression in human lung epithelial cells.Activation of Rac by cell surface receptors including G protein-coupled receptors occurs through incompletely characterized effector routes. A previous study showed that in A549 cells, thrombin leads to activation of Rac through the PI-PLC pathway (39Kawkitinarong K. Linz-McGillem L. Birukov K.G. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Rac becomes activated by thrombin in lung epithelial cells are still unclear. In other cell models, various Gi and Gq/G11 G protein-coupled receptors, including P2Y12, PAR1, and M1 muscarinic receptors, were shown to activate Rac (19Soulet C. Hechler B. Gratacap M.P. Plantavid M. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Payrastre B. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 2296-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Azim A.C. Barkalow K. Chou J. Hartwig J.H.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1528-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In many cases, however, Rac activation is critically dependent on PI3K activity. For example, lysophosphatidic acid-induced Rac activation in neuroblastoma cells is dependent on PI3K activation (42Van Leeuwen F.N. Olivo C. Grivell S. Giepmans B.N. Collard J.G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 400-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, the intracellular calcium-dependent PKC signal pathway mediates thrombin-induced Rac activation in human prostate carcinoma cells (43Price L.S. Langeslag M. ten Klooster J.P. Hordijk P.L. Jalink K. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39413-39421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, Soulet et al. (19Soulet C. Hechler B. Gratacap M.P. Plantavid M. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Payrastre B. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 2296-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated that P2Y12-induced Rac activation is mediated by Gβγ subunits in human platelets. In this study, we found that thrombin induced an increase in Rac activity. Furthermore, we found that thrombin can induce an association of Rac1 with Gβγ after 1 min of treatment. Our data also revealed that Gβγ mediated thrombin-induced Rac activity in human lung epithelial cells. PI3Ks are divided into three classes according to their substrate specificity and molecular structure (25Oudit G.Y. Sun H. Kerfant B.G. Crackower M.A. Penninger J.M. Backx P.H. J. Mol.

J. 1996; 315: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that thrombin can induce the association of p85α and Gβγ. Furthermore, we also found that thrombin can induce Rac1 and p85α complex formation. In support of our findings, Bokoch et al. (44Bokoch G.M. Vlahos C.J. Wang Y. Knaus U.G. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the active GTP-bound form of Rac1 can directly bind to p85 and increase PI3K activity. Therefore, p85α may function as an adaptor for Gβγ and Rac1. Taken together, these results suggest that the rapid signal complex assembly involved Gβγ, Rac1, and p85α in human lung epithelial cells stimulated by thrombin.Rac was shown to be required for the activation of the NF-κB pathway and mediates protein expression by various stimuli (33Gonzalez E.

Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that activation of Rac1 is required for IL-8/CXCL8 release caused by β1 integrin. Moreover, Rac was shown to be activated by TNF-α and to mediate IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8 release in HeLa cells (32Williams L.M. Lali F. Willetts K. Balague C. Godessart N. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that treatment of A549 cells with thrombin caused activation of Rac1, and a Rac1 dominant negative mutant (RacN17) inhibited thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression. These results indicate that Rac1 is required for NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression caused by thrombin in human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, a large body of evidence has implicated the PI3K/Akt pathway involvement in gene expression by various stimuli (29Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 31Chang M.S. Lee W.S. Chen B.C. Sheu J.R. Lin C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether thrombin stimulates the Rac1-dependent PI3K/Akt pathway in lung epithelial cells and whether activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 expression. The results of this study showed that the Rac1 and PI3K pathway is essential for Akt activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression stimulated by thrombin. This is based on the fact that RacN17 and LY294002, a PI3K-specific inhibitor, blocked Akt activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression and release. Moreover, AktDN and an Akt inhibitor suppressed thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 expression and release. This is therefore consistent with reports that Akt plays an important role in mediating the effects of PI3K on lung epithelial cell IL-8/CXCL8 expression with human rhinovirus infection (46Newcomb D.C.

Many chemokines including IL-8/CXCL8 are dependent upon MAPK pathways by thrombin stimulation in various cell types (34Chung S.W. Park J.W. Lee S.A. Eo S.K. Kim K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 2010; 396: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that in vascular smooth muscle cells, MAPKs mediate thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release. Another report showed that thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release depends on ERK and JNK in human lung epithelial cells (A549) (36Ostrowska E. Reiser G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 366: 1030-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we present data that confirmed the role of ERK and JNK in thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release in human lung epithelial cells. We found that a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) and a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) both significantly inhibited thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release. However, we found that a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did not affect thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release. These results indicate that ERK and JNK, but not p38 MAPK, also participate in thrombin-induced CXCL8 release.Thrombin-induced cellular effects in different kinds of cells including human lung epithelial cells are primarily mediated by G protein-coupled receptors known as PARs. Upon thrombin stimulation, activated PARs couple with the G protein and activate downstream signaling molecules to mediate IL-8/CXCL8 expression in lung epithelial cells (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W.

PAR1 and PAR4 are considered essential for the release of lung epithelial cell inflammatory mediators (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that in human platelets, stimulation of PAR1 and PAR4 induced Akt phosphorylation (47Reséndiz J.C. Kroll M.H. Lassila R. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 2484-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, our results also revealed that thrombin, a PAR1 agonist peptide (SFLLRN-NH2), and a PAR4 agonist peptide (GYPGQV-NH2), but not a PAR3 agonist peptide (TFRGAP-NH2), induced increases in Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. Thus, we suggest that thrombin can induce Akt Ser-473 activation in A549 cells through PAR1 and PAR4. This is consistent with our previous report that thrombin activates PAR1 and PAR4 to induce IL-8/CXCL8 expression in A549 epithelial cells (2Lin C.H. Cheng H.W. Hsu M.J. Chen M.C. Lin C.C. Chen B.C.

Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Recent investigations clarified multiple signaling intermediates involved in the regulation of NF-κB, which regulates the expressions of many genes (2Lin C.H.

Immunol. 2006; 177: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also found that thrombin induces IKKα/β activation, IκBα phosphorylation, and IκBα degradation, as well as an increase in NF-κB activity. Moreover, Rho family GTPases were previously shown to induce the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (49Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that in A549 cells, a Rac1-dependent reactive oxygen species signal pathway mediates TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (50Kim H. Hwang J.S. Woo C.H. Kim E.Y. Kim T.H. Cho K.J.

Given that PI3K/Akt plays a critical role in NF-κB activation (31Chang M.S. Lee W.S. Chen B.C. Sheu J.R. Lin C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we speculated that PI3K/Akt might be upstream of NF-κB and investigated this possibility. In this study, we found that a Rac1 dominant negative mutant (RacN17), a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), an Akt inhibitor, and an Akt dominant negative mutant (AktDN) blocked thrombin-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation, kinase activity, and NF-κB reporter activity, suggesting that Rac1, PI3K, and Akt are involved in thrombin-mediated NF-κB activation through an increase in IKKα/β activity.A previous report demonstrated that thrombin induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression by engaging parallel Gαq/PKCδ/Akt and Gβγ/PI3K/Akt pathways that converge at Akt (14Rahman A.

https://openalex.org/W1987054862,"Background A hallmark of the latter half of the 20th century is the widespread, rapid intensification of a variety of anthropogenically-driven environmental changes—a “Great Acceleration.” While there is evidence of a Great Acceleration in a variety of factors known to be linked to water quality degradation, such as conversion of land to agriculture and intensification of fertilizer use, it is not known whether there has been a similar acceleration of freshwater eutrophication. Methodology/Principal Findings Using quantitative reconstructions of diatom-inferred total phosphorus (DI-TP) as a proxy for lake trophic state, we synthesized results from 67 paleolimnological studies from across Europe and North America to evaluate whether most lakes showed a pattern of eutrophication with time and whether this trend was accelerated after 1945 CE, indicative of a Great Acceleration. We found that European lakes have experienced widespread increases in DI-TP over the 20th century and that 33% of these lakes show patterns consistent with a post-1945 CE Great Acceleration. In North America, the proportion of lakes that increased in DI-TP over time is much lower and only 9% exhibited a Great Acceleration of eutrophication. Conclusions/Significance The longer and more widespread history of anthropogenic influence in Europe, the leading cause for the relatively pervasive freshwater eutrophication, provides an important cautionary tale; our current path of intensive agriculture around the world may lead to an acceleration of eutrophication in downstream lakes that could take centuries from which to recover."
https://openalex.org/W2052198334,"Successful dental and orthopedic implants require the establishment of an intimate association with bone tissue; however, the mechanistic explanation of how biological systems accomplish osseointegration is still incomplete. We sought to identify critical gene networks involved in osseointegration by exploring the implant failure model under vitamin D deficiency.Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to control or vitamin D-deficient diet prior to the osteotomy surgery in the femur bone and the placement of T-shaped Ti4Al6V implant. Two weeks after the osteotomy and implant placement, tissue formed at the osteotomy site or in the hollow chamber of T-shaped implant was harvested and total RNA was evaluated by whole genome microarray analyses.Two-way ANOVA of microarray data identified 103 genes that were significantly (>2 fold) modulated by the implant placement and vitamin D deficiency. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses assigned the highest z-score to the circadian rhythm pathway including neuronal PAS domain 2 (NPAS2), and period homolog 2 (Per2). NPAS2 and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL/Bmal 1) were upregulated around implant and diminished by vitamin D deficiency, whereas the expression pattern of Per2 was complementary. Hierarchical cluster analysis further revealed that NPAS2 was in a group predominantly composed of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. Whereas the expression of bone ECM genes around implant was not significantly affected by vitamin D deficiency, cartilage ECM genes were modulated by the presence of the implant and vitamin D status. In a proof-of-concept in vitro study, the expression of cartilage type II and X collagens was found upregulated when mouse mesenchymal stem cells were cultured on implant disk with 1,25D supplementation.This study suggests that the circadian rhythm system and cartilage extracellular matrix may be involved in the establishment of osseointegration under vitamin D regulation."

Herein we used mice with gene disruption or transgenic overexpression of sPLA2-X to clarify the homeostatic functions of this enzyme at these locations. Our results suggest that sPLA2-X regulates 1) the fertility of spermatozoa, not oocytes, beyond the step of flagellar motility, 2) gastrointestinal phospholipid digestion, perturbation of which is eventually linked to delayed onset of a lean phenotype with reduced adiposity, decreased plasma leptin, and improved muscle insulin tolerance, and 3) neuritogenesis of dorsal root ganglia and the duration of peripheral pain nociception.

Deletion of its gene in mice (Pla2g1b−/−) reduces the intestinal digestion of PC and thereby absorption of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), resulting in protection from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (3Huggins K.W.

Because of this potent in vitro action, most investigators in this area of research have focused on the proinflammatory role of sPLA2-X through production of lipid mediators. Indeed, studies using mice with targeted disruption of its gene (Pla2g10−/−) have highlighted the roles of sPLA2-X in asthma and ischemic myocardial injury, where the enzyme appears to regulate disease-associated eicosanoid synthesis (21Henderson Jr., W.R.

Hydrolysis of lipoprotein-bound PC by sPLA2-X allows the production of more atherogenic small-dense lipoprotein particles that facilitate the formation of foam cells from macrophages (19Hanasaki K.

In line with its proinflammatory and proatherogenic potential, deficiency of sPLA2-X reduces the incidence of angiotensin-II-induced atherosclerosis and aneurysm in apoE−/− mice (20Zack M. Boyanovsky B.B. Shridas P. Bailey W. Forrest K. Howatt D.A. Gelb M.H. de Beer F.C. Daugherty A. Webb N.R.

It is notable that under physiological conditions, sPLA2-X is expressed in the testis and gastrointestinal tract at much higher levels than in other tissues (23Hamaguchi K. Kuwata H. Yoshihara K.

However, the physiological functions of sPLA2-X at these locations in vivo have remained unresolved. Our recent finding that spermatozoa from Pla2g10−/− mice display reduced fertility has provided new insight into the unexplored physiological function of sPLA2-X as a regulator of male reproduction (27Escoffier J.

Invest. 2010; 120: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, by utilizing mice with knock-out or transgenic overexpression of sPLA2-X, we have obtained evidence that sPLA2-X does exert physiological roles at these sites. First, although sPLA2-X is expressed in both gametes, it participates in fertility only in spermatozoa, acting beyond the step of flagellar motility. Second, Pla2g10−/− mice maintained on a chow diet were found to display a lean phenotype as they aged, likely because phospholipid digestion in the gut was reduced in these mice. Third, neuritogenesis of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants ex vivo and peripheral pain nociception in vivo were reduced in Pla2g10−/− mice and conversely augmented in Pla2g10tg/+ mice relative to those in control mice, suggesting a neuronal function of sPLA2-X. All mice were housed in climate-controlled (23 °C) specific pathogen-free facilities with a 12-h light-dark cycle, with free access to standard laboratory food (CE2; Laboratory Diet) (CLEA Japan) and water.

All procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science and Showa University in accordance with the Standards Relating to the Care and Management of Experimental Animals in Japan. Approximately 0.1 μg of genomic DNA were obtained from tail biopsy of mice. For genotyping of Pla2g10tg/+ mice, the genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with the GeneAmp Fast PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and a set of primers 5′-ggcctccaggatattacgtgtgc-3′ and 5′-tcagtcacacttgggcgagtcc-3′ obtained from Sigma Genosys (Japan).

For quantitative RT-PCR, PCR reactions were performed on the ABI7700 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Gene Expression System with Pla2g10 and Gapdh TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA from DRG of fetal Pla2g10−/− and Pla2g10+/+ mice (E12.5) was purified using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cRNA targets were synthesized and hybridized with Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent). The array slides were scanned with a Laser Scanner GenePix 4000B (Molecular Devices) using appropriate gains on the photomultiplier to obtain the highest intensity without saturation. Gene expression values were background-corrected and normalized using the GenePix software (Molecular Devices). Mouse DRG explants were prepared from E12.5 of C57BL/6 mice as described previously (25Masuda S. Murakami M. Takanezawa Y. Aoki J. Arai H. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Arioka M. Kudo I. J. Biol.

In brief, mouse fetuses were incised longitudinally from the upper cervical vertebrae to the tail along the spinal cord. The spinal cord sections were separated and removed, and DRG neurons attached to the spinal cord were picked up and harvested. DRG explants were then cultured for up to 36 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) supplemented with appropriate concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) in poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) precoated with 20 μg/ml laminin (Biochemical Technologies). Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations of water. The tissue sections (4 μm thick) were incubated with Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO) as required, incubated for 10 min with 3% (v/v) H2O2, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min each, incubated with 5% (w/v) skim milk in PBS for 30 min, washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min each, and incubated with rabbit antiserum for human or mouse sPLA2-V and -X (30Masuda S.

The sections were then treated with a CSA (catalyzed signal-amplified) system staining kit (DAKO) with diaminobenzidine substrate followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin and eosin. The cell type was identified from conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining of serial sections adjacent to the specimen used for immunohistochemistry. Human tissue sections were obtained by surgery at Toho University (Tokyo, Japan) after approval by the ethical committee of the Faculty and informed consent from the patient. Paraffin-embedded mouse DRG sections were sequentially treated with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature, with rabbit anti-mouse sPLA2-X antibody (30Masuda S.

For double immunostaining of DRG explants for sPLA2-X and βIII tubulin, DRG explants on laminin-coated dishes were fixed with blocking solution for 1 h, treated with rabbit anti-mouse sPLA2-X antibody and mouse anti-βIII tubulin antibody (Chemicon) at 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h, and then with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes) at a 1:200 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h with 3 washes in each interval. After 6 washes with PBS, the fluorescent signal was visualized with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). We ensured lack of cross-reactivity of fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies with primary antibodies from species to which they were not raised. Female mice (10 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 7.5 IU or pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Asuka Pharmacy) followed 48 h later with 7.5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (Asuka Pharmacy). Oviducts were collected 13 h later, and the oocyte cumulus complexes were placed in 100 μl of HTF medium (ARK Resource) in a 60-mm culture dish (Iwaki), and droplets were covered by embryo-tested mineral oil (Nakarai Tesque). Spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymidis were allowed to swim into 50 μl of HTF medium, aspirated, incubated in 200 μl of HTF medium for 60 min at 37 °C to permit capacitation, diluted, and added to oocyte droplets to achieve a concentration of 200 spermatozoa/μl. After the spermatozoa and oocytes were preincubated for 6 h at 37 °C, the oocytes were washed and cultured for 24 h before examination of oocyte fertilization, as demonstrated by the presence of a second polar body and two pronuclei, one near a sperm tail. Male mice (8 weeks old) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and a tubule segment was dissected from the cauda epididymidis. The luminal sperm were allowed to disperse in 200 μl of HTF medium (ARK Resource) for 10 min. After the tissue had been removed, the sperm were allowed to capacitate for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. A 5-μl aliquot of the sperm suspension was then placed in a counting chamber (Standard Count; Laje) for assessment of motility by computer-assisted analysis using a Sperm Motility Analysis System (KAGA Electronics). The parameters measured were the percentage of motile sperm cells, vigor of movement (curvilinear velocity), speed of forward progression (straight-line velocity), amplitude of lateral head displacement, beat cross-frequency, and linearity of swim path. With or without an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized, and blood samples were immediately collected by cardiac puncture. Sera were applied to the clinical chemistry analyzer VetScan with V-DPP rotors (Abaxis). Serum concentrations of insulin, adiponectin, leptin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and corticosterone were quantified using ultrasensitive mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Mercodia), Quantikine mouse adiponectin/Acrp30 and leptin immunoassay kits (R&D Systems), mouse IGF-I ELISA kit (R&D Systems) and corticosterone ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical), respectively. Tissues (100 μg) were soaked in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1 mm Na2MoO4 and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates (20 μg of protein equivalents) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels under reducing conditions with 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations in the samples were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) with a semidry blotter (Transblot SD) (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membranes were probed with rabbit antibody against Akt or phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473; Cell Signaling Technology) at a 1:1000 dilution in TBS-T for 2 h followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a 1:5000 dilution in TBS-T for 2 h and then visualized using the ECL Western blot system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Lipids were extracted from samples with the addition of PC28:0 as an internal standard (1 nmol of internal standard per 1 mg of protein equivalents). The ESI-MS of phospholipids were performed using a 4000Q TRAP, quadrupole-linear ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex; Applied Biosystems) with a UltiMate 3000 nano/cap/micro-liquid chromatography (LC) system (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) combined with HTS PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland). Phospholipids were subjected directly to ESI-MS analysis by flow injection; typically, 3 μl (3 nmol of phosphorus equivalent) of sample was applied. The mobile phase composition was acetonitrile/methanol/water (6:7:2) (plus 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.8)) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The scan range of the instrument was set at m/z 200–1000 at a scan speed of 1000 Da/s. The trap fill-time was set at 1 ms in the positive ion mode and at 5 ms in the negative ion mode. The ion spray voltage was set at 5500 V in the positive ion mode and at −4500 V in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as curtain gas (setting of 10, arbitrary units) and as collision gas (set to “high”). Detailed procedure for ESI-MS was described previously (14Sato H. Taketomi Y. Isogai Y. Miki Y.

https://openalex.org/W2134188261,"Background Chinese herbal products (CHPs) containing Radix bupleuri are often prescribed for chronic hepatitis. There have been no epidemiological studies in populations with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Our study was conducted to determine the association between the use of CHPs containing Radix bupleuri and the risk of hospitalisation related to liver injury among HBV-infected patients in Taiwan. Methods From a total of 639,779 patients with diagnoses related to HBV infection, we included hospitalised adult cases with a primary diagnosis of liver injury in the database of Taiwan's national health insurance during the period 1997–2004. Case-control and case-crossover designs were used to assess the risk of hospitalisation with conditional logistic regression models constructed and adjusted for 270 conventionally hepatotoxic drugs. Cumulative doses of these CHPs and Radix bupleuri were assessed for any dose-response relationship. Findings In total, we collected 1,080 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In the case-control design, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 2.77). The risks from prescribing the CHPs Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang and Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tang were significantly high, and dose-response relationships were found. The risk of adding each 19 gm dose of Radix bupleuri was 2.19 (95% CI: 1.66 to 2.89). The results using the case-crossover design remained similar. Conclusions Prescribing Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang, Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tang, or CHPs containing more than 19 gram of Radix bupleuri in HBV-infected patients might increase their risks of liver injury. Further studies are indicated to corroborate the above findings."

Most interactions of APP with cytosolic partners involve the YENPTY sequence of APP, which is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammalian APP/APLPs. Phosphorylation of Tyr682 is consequential. Some proteins interact with APP only when Tyr682 is phosphorylated (13Zhou D. Noviello C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

These data suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on Tyr682 modulates APP interactions and function.The evidence points to an important role for Tyr682 and its potential functional regulation by phosphorylation. The early postnatal lethality and the diffused synaptic distribution of the NMJ present in the APP/APLP2 double knock-out animals provide sensitive and specific readouts for us to definitely determine the role of this amino acid in vivo. We have created APP knock-in (ki) mice in which Tyr682 is replaced by a glycine (we will refer to these mice as APPYG). The Y682G mutation was chosen to destroy interactions mediated by those involving both phospho-Tyr682 and non-phospho-Tyr682. The evidence that the APPYG mutant protein is still phosphorylated in vivo on Thr668 (18Barbagallo A.P. Weldon R. Tamayev R. Zhou D. Giliberto L. Foreman O. D'Adamio L. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) indicates that the structure of the AID is not grossly altered by the mutation. We report that APPYG/YG/APLP2−/− mice present NMJ deficits and early lethality similar to APP/APLP2 double KO mice, demonstrating that Tyr682 is indispensable for the essential function of APP in developmental regulation.DISCUSSIONWe report here that expression of an APP moiety bearing a mutation on Tyr682 fails to rescue the early postnatal lethality and neuromuscular synapse defects of the APP/APLP2-null mice. These data indicate that Tyr682 of the highly conserved APP intracellular region is required for APP-mediated survival and neuromuscular synapse assembly in vivo. Genetic studies in C. elegans and mammals have suggested that the ectodomain of APP is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate essential functions of APP in development and have argued for a dispensable role of the APP intracellular domain. The APL-1 extracellular domain rescues the apl-1-null lethality (25Hornsten A. Lieberthal J. Fadia S. Malins R. Ha L. Xu X. Daigle I. Markowitz M. O'Connor G. Plasterk R. Li C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the α-secretase-cleaved APP ectodomain complements the anatomical and behavioral abnormalities of the APP-deficient mice (26Ring S. Weyer S.W. Kilian S.B. Waldron E. Pietrzik C.U. Filippov M.A. Herms J. Buchholz C. Eckman C.B. Korte M. Wolfer D.P. Müller U.C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7817-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies present contrasting results. Analysis of mutant mice expressing either the sAPPβ (27Li H. Wang B. Wang Z. Guo Q. Tabuchi K. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Zheng H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17362-17367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or an APP mutant lacking the intracellular domain (11Li H. Wang Z. Wang B. Guo Q. Dolios G. Tabuchi K. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Wang R. Zheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 30598-30605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggests that APP intracellular sequences are required to rescue the early postnatal lethality and neuromuscular synapse defects of the APP/APLP2-null mice. It needs to be pointed out that in the latter study, the human Aβ sequence with familial AD mutations and the C-terminal mutation were simultaneously introduced in mice. Therefore, it is conceivable that changes in the Aβ region contribute to the lethality and NMJ defects.Given these opposing results, we have made use of an APP knock-in mutant that bears a single amino acid mutation in Tyr682 of the intracellular domain (18Barbagallo A.P. Weldon R. Tamayev R. Zhou D. Giliberto L. Foreman O. D'Adamio L. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The specific nature of this mutation allows for a direct and precise analysis of the functional requirements of APP. Our data not only clearly show a role for the intracellular region of APP but also point to an essential role for a functional domain that contains Tyr682.Tyr682 is included in a motif (682YENPTY687) that is a canonical endocytic signal for membrane-associated receptors (28Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and regulates APP internalization and Aβ formation in vitro (29Perez R.G. Soriano S.

This motif is conserved among APP family members and during evolution of APP. This evolutionary pressure suggests the importance of these sequences for APP functions. This motif is also important for protein-protein interactions that regulate APP metabolism and signaling in vitro (12King G.D. Scott Turner R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this Tyr682 represents a “biochemical switch” that drastically changes the APP “interactome,” abolishing binding of some interactors (Fe65, Fe65L1, and Fe65L2) and creating docking sites for others (Pin1, ShcA, ShcB, ShcC, Grb2, Grb7, Nck, Abl, Lyn, and Src) (16Tamayev R. Zhou D. D'Adamio L. Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TrkA is a potential mediator of Tyr682 phosphorylation (30Tarr P.E. Contursi C. Roncarati R. Noviello C. Ghersi E. Scheinfeld M.H. Zambrano N. Russo T. D'Adamio L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The APP Y682G mutation in mice results in a large redistribution of APP toward the α-secretase pathway; sAPPα and C83 are increased because sAPPβ and Aβ are decreased (18Barbagallo A.P. Weldon R. Tamayev R. Zhou D. Giliberto L. Foreman O. D'Adamio L. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is reported that sAPPα increases synaptic density and improves memory retention (31Meziane H. Dodart J.C. Mathis C. Little S. Clemens J. Paul S.M. Ungerer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Buchholz C. Eckman C.B. Korte M. Wolfer D.P. Müller U.C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7817-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Our finding that the APPYG mutation simultaneously increases sAPPα and fails to rescue NMJ and lethality of APP/APLP2-deficient mice argues against an essential function of sAPPα, unless ablating or increasing sAPPα has similar negative effects.Although APP localization in the NMJ of APPYG mutant seems unchanged, we cannot exclude that defective APP trafficking causes the neuromuscular synapse defect seen in APPYG/YGAPLP2−/− mice. The finding that a knock-in mutant APP missing the intracellular domain did not rescue the survival and synaptic deficits of dKO mice and did not overtly affect Aβ and sAPPα/β levels suggests that none of these APP metabolites are sufficient to recapitulate essential functions of APP and that APP metabolites containing the intracellular Tyr682 (such as full-length APP, C83, C99, AID/APP intracellular domain, and C31) are functionally necessary.APP intracellular sequences mediate additional activities, including interactions with multiple proteins, apoptosis (35Giliberto L. Zhou D. Weldon R. Tamagno E. De Luca P. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. Mol. Neurodegener. 2008; 3: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G. Bachmann M. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2000; 2: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and transcriptional regulation via binding to Fe65 (37Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) and JIP1 (38Scheinfeld M.H. Matsuda S. D'Adamio L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); it is conceivable that defective adaptor protein interactions and the intracellular signaling pathway may contribute to the developmental phenotypes seen in the APPYG/YG/APLP2−/− mice. A potential adaptor protein candidate is Mint1. In fact, the synaptic promoting property of APP may involve the formation of the APP-Mint1-Cask complex in presynaptic termini. The finding that Mint1 binds wild-type APP but not APPYG backs this hypothesis. We are aware that understanding the in-depth mechanisms by which APP (and Tyr682) regulates survival and NMJ development is important and not fully addressed in this study. In fact, that topic is very complex and will require an extensive array of studies. However, the studies presented here exhaustively and conclusively prove that Tyr682 is essential for these functions of APP.Mounting evidence supports a role for synaptic dysfunction in AD. Our finding that Tyr682 of APP plays a role in synaptogenesis makes it a legitimate possibility that the APP intracellular domain and the functional motif including this tyrosine may contribute to AD pathogenesis. In this perspective, it will be important to unveil the biological mechanisms that regulate phosphorylation of APP on Tyr682 and the signaling pathways that are controlled by this functional domain of APP.

However, it cannot be excluded that alterations of normal APP functions contribute to AD pathogenesis, and it is therefore important to understand the role of APP in vivo. Mice deficient in APP exhibit subtle phenotypes (2Zheng H. Jiang M. Trumbauer M.E. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Hopkins R. Smith D.W. Heavens R.P. Dawson G.R. Boyce S. Conner M.W. Stevens K.A. Slunt H.H.

APP is a member of a gene family that includes APP-like protein 1 and 2 (APLP1 and ALPL2); functional redundancy compensates for the loss of essential gene functions in APP knock-out mice as documented by the evidence that APLP1−/−, APLP2−/−, and APP−/− mice are viable, whereas combined APP−/−APLP2−/− double KO (dKO) mice (6von Koch C.S.

Analysis of APP/APLP2 dKO mice identified an essential role for the APP family of proteins and for the highly conserved APP intracellular domain in the patterning of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (8Wang P.

Scott Turner R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Most interactions of APP with cytosolic partners involve the YENPTY sequence of APP, which is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammalian APP/APLPs. Phosphorylation of Tyr682 is consequential. Some proteins interact with APP only when Tyr682 is phosphorylated (13Zhou D. Noviello C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

These data suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on Tyr682 modulates APP interactions and function.The evidence points to an important role for Tyr682 and its potential functional regulation by phosphorylation. The early postnatal lethality and the diffused synaptic distribution of the NMJ present in the APP/APLP2 double knock-out animals provide sensitive and specific readouts for us to definitely determine the role of this amino acid in vivo. We have created APP knock-in (ki) mice in which Tyr682 is replaced by a glycine (we will refer to these mice as APPYG). The Y682G mutation was chosen to destroy interactions mediated by those involving both phospho-Tyr682 and non-phospho-Tyr682.

https://openalex.org/W2055756355,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major global health problem, despite the widespread use of the M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and the availability of drug therapies. In recent years, the high incidence of coinfection of M. tuberculosis and HIV, as well as escalating problems associated with drug resistance, has raised ominous concerns with regard to TB control. Vaccination with BCG has not proven highly effective in controlling TB, and also has been associated with increasing concerns about the potential for the vaccine to cause disseminated mycobacterial infection in HIV infected hosts. Thus, the development of an efficacious and safe TB vaccine is generally viewed as a critical to achieving control of the ongoing global TB pandemic. In the current study, we have analyzed the vaccine efficacy of an attenuated M. tuberculosis strain that combines a mutation that enhances T cell priming (ΔsecA2) with a strongly attenuating lysine auxotrophy mutation (ΔlysA). The ΔsecA2 mutant was previously shown to be defective in the inhibition of apoptosis and markedly increased priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo. Similarly, the ΔsecA2ΔlysA strain retained enhanced apoptosis and augmented CD8+ T cell stimulatory effects, but with a noticeably improved safety profile in immunosuppressed mice. Thus, the M. tuberculosis ΔsecA2ΔlysA mutant represents a live attenuated TB vaccine strain with the potential to deliver increased protection and safety compared to standard BCG vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2102508920,"With the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, increasingly ambitious applications are becoming feasible. A particularly powerful one is the sequencing of polymorphic, pooled samples. The pool can be naturally occurring, as in the case of multiple pathogen strains in a blood sample, multiple types of cells in a cancerous tissue sample, or multiple isoforms of mRNA in a cell. In these cases, it's difficult or impossible to partition the subtypes experimentally before sequencing, and those subtype frequencies must hence be inferred. In addition, investigators may occasionally want to artificially pool the sample of a large number of individuals for reasons of cost-efficiency, e.g., when carrying out genetic mapping using bulked segregant analysis. Here we describe PoolHap, a computational tool for inferring haplotype frequencies from pooled samples when haplotypes are known. The key insight into why PoolHap works is that the large number of SNPs that come with genome-wide coverage can compensate for the uneven coverage across the genome. The performance of PoolHap is illustrated and discussed using simulated and real data. We show that PoolHap is able to accurately estimate the proportions of haplotypes with less than 2% error for 34-strain mixtures with 2X total coverage Arabidopsis thaliana whole genome polymorphism data. This method should facilitate greater biological insight into heterogeneous samples that are difficult or impossible to isolate experimentally.

https://openalex.org/W2051640170,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is expressed as two isozymes α and β. They share high similarity in their catalytic domains but differ in their N- and C-terminal regions, with GSK-3α having an extended glycine-rich N terminus. Here, we undertook live cell imaging combined with molecular and bioinformatic studies to understand the distinct functions of the GSK-3 isozymes focusing on GSK-3α N-terminal region. We found that unlike GSK-3β, which shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, GSK-3α was excluded from the nucleus. Deletion of the N-terminal region of GSK-3α resulted in nuclear localization, and treatment with leptomycin B resulted in GSK-3α accumulation in the nucleus. GSK-3α rapidly accumulated in the nucleus in response to calcium or serum deprivation, and accumulation was strongly inhibited by the calpain inhibitor calpeptin. This nuclear accumulation was not mediated by cleavage of the N-terminal region or phosphorylation of GSK-3α. Rather, we show that calcium-induced GSK-3α nuclear accumulation was governed by GSK-3α binding with as yet unknown calpain-sensitive protein or proteins; this binding was mediated by the N-terminal region. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses indicated that nuclear exclusion of GSK-3α was likely an exclusive characteristic of mammalian GSK-3α. Finally, we show that nuclear localization of GSK-3α reduced the nuclear pool of β-catenin and its target cyclin D1. Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal region of GSK-3α is responsible for its nuclear exclusion and that binding with a calcium/calpain-sensitive product enables GSK-3α nuclear retention. We further uncovered a novel link between calcium and nuclear GSK-3α-mediated inhibition of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

We have identified an ortholog of the yeast Ddi1 protein as the only member of the aspartic proteinase family in Leishmania parasites, and in this study we investigate this protein as a potential target for the drugs. To date, no enzyme assay has been developed for the Ddi1 proteins, but Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the DDI1 gene secrete high levels of protein into the medium. We developed an assay in which these knockout yeast were functionally complemented to low secretion by introduction of genes encoding Ddi1 orthologs from Leishmania major or humans. Plasmid alone controls gave no complementation. Treatment of the Ddi1 transformants with HIV proteinase inhibitors showed differential effects dependent on the origin of the Ddi1. Dose responses allowed calculation of IC50 values; e.g., for nelfinavir, of 3.4 µM (human Ddi1) and 0.44 µM (Leishmania Ddi1). IC50 values with Leishmania constructs mirror the potency of inhibitors against parasites.

https://openalex.org/W1986951724,"Recently, many studies have reported that polyamines play a role in bacterial cell-to-cell signaling processes. The present study describes a novel putrescine importer required for induction of type 1 pili-driven surface motility. The surface motility of the Escherichia coli ΔspeAB ΔspeC ΔpotABCD strain, which cannot produce putrescine and cannot import spermidine from the medium, was induced by extracellular putrescine. Introduction of the gene deletions for known polyamine importers (ΔpotE, ΔpotFGHI, and ΔpuuP) or a putative polyamine importer (ΔydcSTUV) into the ΔspeAB ΔspeC ΔpotABCD strain did not affect putrescine-induced surface motility. The deletion of yeeF, an annotated putative putrescine importer, in the ΔspeAB ΔspeC ΔpotABCD ΔydcSTUV strain abolished surface motility in putrescine-supplemented medium. Complementation of yeeF by a plasmid vector restored surface motility. The surface motility observed in the present study was abolished by the deletion of fimA, suggesting that the surface motility is type 1 pili-driven. A transport assay using the yeeF(+) or ΔyeeF strains revealed that YeeF is a novel putrescine importer. The K(m) of YeeF (155 μM) is 40 to 300 times higher than that of other importers reported previously. On the other hand, the V(max) of YeeF (9.3 nmol/min/mg) is comparable to that of PotABCD, PotFGHI, and PuuP. The low affinity of YeeF for putrescine may allow E. coli to sense the cell density depending on the concentration of extracellular putrescine."
https://openalex.org/W2074424295,"We identified three S. cerevisiae lipid elongase null mutants (elo1Δ, elo2Δ, and elo3Δ) that enhance the toxicity of alpha-synuclein (α-syn). These elongases function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to catalyze the elongation of medium chain fatty acids to very long chain fatty acids, which is a component of sphingolipids. Without α-syn expression, the various elo mutants showed no growth defects, no reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and a modest decrease in survival of aged cells compared to wild-type cells. With (WT, A53T or E46K) α-syn expression, the various elo mutants exhibited severe growth defects (although A30P had a negligible effect on growth), ROS accumulation, aberrant protein trafficking, and a dramatic decrease in survival of aged cells compared to wild-type cells. Inhibitors of ceramide synthesis, myriocin and FB1, were extremely toxic to wild-type yeast cells expressing (WT, A53T, or E46K) α-syn but much less toxic to cells expressing A30P. The elongase mutants and ceramide synthesis inhibitors enhance the toxicity of WT α-syn, A53T and E46K, which transit through the ER, but have a negligible effect on A30P, which does not transit through the ER. Disruption of ceramide-sphingolipid homeostasis in the ER dramatically enhances the toxicity of α-syn (WT, A53T, and E46K)."
https://openalex.org/W2045442386,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate mRNA translation and stability by binding to complementary sequences usually within the 3' un-translated region (UTR). We have previously shown that the hepatic toxicity caused by wild-type Adenovirus 5 (Ad5WT) in mice can be prevented by incorporating 4 binding sites for the liver-specific microRNA, mir122, into the 3' UTR of E1A mRNA. This virus, termed Ad5mir122, is a promising virotherapy candidate and causes no obvious liver pathology. Herein we show that Ad5mir122 maintains wild-type lytic activity in cancer cells not expressing mir122 and assess any effects of possible mir122 depletion in host cells. Repeat administration of 2×10(10) viral particles of Admir122 to HepG2 tumour bearing mice showed significant anti-cancer efficacy. RT-QPCR showed that E1A mRNA was down-regulated 29-fold in liver when compared to Ad5WT. Western blot for E1A confirmed that all protein variants were knocked down. RT-QPCR for mature mir122 in infected livers showed that quantity of mir122 remained unaffected. Genome wide mRNA microarray profiling of infected livers showed that although the transcript level of >3900 different mRNAs changed more than 2-fold following Ad5WT infection, less than 600 were changed by Ad5mir122. These were then filtered to select mRNAs that were only altered by Ad5mir122 and the remaining 21 mRNAs were compared to predicted mir122 targets. No mir122 target mRNAs were affected by Ad5 mir122. These results demonstrate that the exploitation of microRNA regulation to control virus replication does not necessarily affect the level of the microRNA or the endogenous mRNA targets."
https://openalex.org/W2082709913,"Hypertension is a typical modern lifestyle-related disease that is closely associated with the development of cardiovascular disorders. Elevation of angiotensin II (ANG II) is one of several critical factors for hypertension and heart failure; however, the mechanisms underlying the ANG II-mediated pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Here, we show that ANG II-mediated cardiac fibrosis, but not hypertrophy, is regulated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which until now has been exclusively studied in the innate immune system. In a ANG II-infusion mouse model (3.0 mg/kg/d), we compared IRF3-deficient mice (Irf3(-/-)/Bcl2l12(-/-)) with matched wild-type (WT) controls. The development of cardiac fibrosis [3.95 ± 0.62% (WT) vs. 1.41 ± 0.46% (Irf3(-/-)/Bcl2l12(-/-)); P<0.01] and accompanied reduction in left ventricle end-diastolic dimension [2.89 ± 0.10 mm (WT) vs. 3.51 ± 0.15 mm (Irf3(-/-)/Bcl2l12(-/-)); P=0.012] are strongly suppressed in Irf3(-/-)/Bcl2l12(-/-) mice, whereas hypertrophy still develops. Further, we provide evidence for the activation of IRF3 by ANG II signaling in mouse cardiac fibroblasts. Unlike the activation of IRF3 by innate immune receptors, IRF3 activation by ANG II is unique in that it is activated through the canonical ERK signaling pathway. Thus, our present study reveals a hitherto unrecognized function of IRF3 in cardiac remodeling, providing new insight into the progression of hypertension-induced cardiac pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2157734222,"The ARV1-encoded protein mediates sterol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. Yeast ARV1 mutants accumulate multiple lipids in the ER and are sensitive to pharmacological modulators of both sterol and sphingolipid metabolism. Using fluorescent and electron microscopy, we demonstrate sterol accumulation, subcellular membrane expansion, elevated lipid droplet formation, and vacuolar fragmentation in ARV1 mutants. Motif-based regression analysis of ARV1 deletion transcription profiles indicates activation of Hac1p, an integral component of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Accordingly, we show constitutive splicing of HAC1 transcripts, induction of a UPR reporter, and elevated expression of UPR targets in ARV1 mutants. IRE1, encoding the unfolded protein sensor in the ER lumen, exhibits a lethal genetic interaction with ARV1, indicating a viability requirement for the UPR in cells lacking ARV1. Surprisingly, ARV1 mutants expressing a variant of Ire1p defective in sensing unfolded proteins are viable. Moreover, these strains also exhibit constitutive HAC1 splicing that interacts with DTT-mediated perturbation of protein folding. These data suggest that a component of UPR induction in arv1Δ strains is distinct from protein misfolding. Decreased ARV1 expression in murine macrophages also results in UPR induction, particularly up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4, CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and apoptosis. Cholesterol loading or inhibition of cholesterol esterification further elevated CHOP expression in ARV1 knockdown cells. Thus, loss or down-regulation of ARV1 disturbs membrane and lipid homeostasis, resulting in a disruption of ER integrity, one consequence of which is induction of the UPR."

In the present study we found that group X-secreted PLA2 (sPLA2-X) was expressed in the outermost epithelium of hair follicles in synchrony with the anagen phase of hair cycling. Transgenic mice overexpressing sPLA2-X (PLA2G10-Tg) displayed alopecia, which was accompanied by hair follicle distortion with reduced expression of genes related to hair development, during a postnatal hair cycle. Additionally, the epidermis and sebaceous glands of PLA2G10-Tg skin were hyperplasic. Proteolytic activation of sPLA2-X in PLA2G10-Tg skin was accompanied by preferential hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine species with polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as elevated production of some if not all eicosanoids. Importantly, the skin of Pla2g10-deficient mice had abnormal hair follicles with noticeable reduction in a subset of hair genes, a hypoplasic outer root sheath, a reduced number of melanin granules, and unexpected up-regulation of prostanoid synthesis. Collectively, our study highlights the spatiotemporal expression of sPLA2-X in hair follicles, the presence of skin-specific machinery leading to sPLA2-X activation, a functional link of sPLA2-X with hair follicle homeostasis, and compartmentalization of the prostanoid pathway in hair follicles and epidermis.

Hair follicle morphogenesis is regulated by interactions between epidermal keratinocytes committed to hair follicle differentiation and dermal fibroblasts committed to form the dermal papilla of the developing hair follicles (1Alonso L.

Hair follicles undergo repeated cycles of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) during their life span. Distinct signaling pathways and transcription factors control hair follicle morphogenesis, postnatal hair growth, and hair cycling in a coordinated manner. Accordingly, disturbance in the expression or function of these genes by point mutations, transgenic (Tg) overexpression, or targeted disruption often culminates in a hairless phenotype.

Autosomal recessive wooly hair with hypotrichosis, a type of nonsyndromic human alopecia, is caused by mutations of either LIPH, which encodes a phospholipase A1 that produces lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from phosphatidic acid, or P2Y5, which encodes the LPA6 receptor (7Pasternack S.M. von Kügelgen I.

In addition, hair abnormalities have often been associated with mutations or altered expression of genes for lipid synthesis, degradation, signaling, or transport (13Westerberg R. Tvrdik P.

Because phospholipase A2 (PLA2) regulates the first step of enzymatic cascades, leading to biosynthesis of lipid mediators, and also plays an important role in membrane homeostasis, it is tempting to speculate that certain PLA2 enzymes would participate in the regulation of hair development. PLA2s have been classified into several groups, including secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s), Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2s, Ca2+-independent PLA2s, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases, and lysosomal PLA2s (17Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although recent studies employing mice with gene targeting of intracellular and extracellular PLA2s have delineated their non-redundant functions in various biological events (17Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 18Murakami M. Taketomi Y. Girard C. Yamamoto K. Lambeau G. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 561-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), none of these knock-out mice have developed skin abnormalities. The notion that sPLA2 may play a role in skin biology originally arose from studies employing Tg mice overexpressing group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA), which develop permanent alopecia and epidermal hyperplasia (19Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennett C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the fact that the mouse strain used so far (C57BL/6) intrinsically lacks sPLA2-IIA because of a frameshift mutation in its gene (20MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) has raised a question as to the physiological relevance of the hairless phenotype in PLA2G2A-Tg mice. Although mammalian genomes encode genes for 10 catalytically active sPLA2 isoforms that exhibit unique tissue and cellular localizations and enzymatic properties (17Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 18Murakami M. Taketomi Y. Girard C. Yamamoto K. Lambeau G. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 561-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it remains uncertain whether other sPLA2 isoforms are expressed and play roles within a skin niche. Group X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) is the most active sPLA2 isoform that can hydrolyze phospholipids in the mammalian cell membrane (21Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H.

In the present study, we found that Tg overexpression of sPLA2-X in mice resulted in skin abnormalities characterized by alopecia, unusual hair cycling, and epidermal and sebaceous gland hyperplasia, accompanied by aberrant hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and increased synthesis of some eicosanoids. More importantly, endogenous sPLA2-X was spatiotemporally expressed in the anagen hair follicles of mouse skin, and the skin of Pla2g10-deficient mice had abnormal hair follicles with reduced hair growth and hypoplasic ORS. Thus, our results highlight a novel role of sPLA2-X in hair homeostasis within a highly restricted and specialized skin compartment, the hair follicle. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science and of Showa University in accordance with the Standards Relating to the Care and Management of Experimental Animals in Japan. The strategy for the generation and maintenance of Tg mice overexpressing PLA2G10 under the β-actin promoter was reported previously (29Ohtsuki M. Taketomi Y. Arata S. Masuda S. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T.

Synthesis of cDNAs was performed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR reactions were carried out using GeneAmp Fast PCR system (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI9800 Fast Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) with a primer pair that could amplify both mouse Pla2g10 and human PLA2G10 mRNAs (5′-GACGCCATTGACTGGTGCTGC-3′ and 5′-AGTTCTTGGCATTTGTTCTCTGC-3′). For quantitative RT-PCR, PCR reactions were carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or TaqMan Gene Expression System (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI7700 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative abundance of transcripts was normalized with constitutive expression of 18 S ribosomal RNA or β-actin mRNA. The oligonucleotide primers and probes (Roche Applied Science) used for quantitative RT-PCR are listed in supplemental Table S1. Tissues were soaked in 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. PLA2 activities in the supernatant were assayed by measuring the amounts of radiolabeled linoleic acid released from the substrate 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The substrate in ethanol was dried under a stream of N2 and dispersed in water by sonication. Each reaction mixture (total volume 250 μl) consisted of appropriate amounts of the required samples, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, [14C]linoleic acid was extracted, and the radioactivity was quantified with a liquid scintillation counter as described previously (31Murakami M. Koduri R.S.

Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-human sPLA2-X antibodies were gifted from Dr. Michael Gelb (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and Dr. Shinji Hatakeyama (Novartis Pharma, Tsukuba, Japan), respectively. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed using these antibodies as described previously (32Sato H. Kato R. Isogai Y. Saka G. Ohtsuki M. Taketomi Y. Yamamoto K. Tsutsumi K. Yamada J.

In brief, a monoclonal antibody for human sPLA2-X (7E2F11) or control mouse IgG1 (2 mg) was conjugated with 0.5 ml of formyl cellurofine (Seikagaku Kogyo). The beads (20 μl) were incubated with 250 μl of skin homogenates obtained from PLA2G10-Tg or control mice at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, the beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of PBS and boiled for 5 min in 20 μl of sodium SDS-PAGE sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol. Then the resulting supernatants were applied to 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were subjected to immunoblotting with rabbit anti-human sPLA2-X polyclonal antibody as described previously. Immunohistochemistry of mouse tissue sections was performed as described previously (33Murakami M. Masuda S. Shimbara S. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24987-24998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, skin samples were fixed with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, sectioned, mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations of water. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on 5-μm thick cryosections. For immunofluorescence, the tissue sections (5 μm) were incubated with 1× Blockace (DS Pharma BioMedical) in PBS for 30 min, washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min each, and incubated with rabbit antibody to mouse loricrin, filaggrin, cytokeratin 1, or cytokeratin 5 (Covance) at 1:1000–2000 dilution in 10× dilution of Blockace overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min each and incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted to 1:1000 at 20 °C for 1 h. Counterstaining was performed with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector). Stained sections were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss). Tissues were soaked in 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. Lipids were extracted from the homogenates by the method of Bligh and Dyer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42656) Google Scholar). The analysis was performed using a 4000Q-TRAP quadrupole-linear ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) with an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (DIONEX Company) combined with an HTC PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics). The extracted lipids were subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis by flow injection (typically 3 nmol of phosphorus equivalent in the positive ion mode and 0.6 nmol of phosphorus equivalent in the negative ion mode) without liquid chromatography separation. The mobile phase composition was acetonitrile/methanol/water (6:7:2, v/v/v) (plus 0.1% ammonium formate (pH 6.8)) at a flow-rate of 10 μl/min. The scan range of the instrument was set at m/z 200–1000 at a scan speed of 1000 Da/s. The trap fill-time was set at 1 ms in the positive ion mode and at 20 ms in the negative ion mode. The ion spray voltage was set at 5500 V in the positive ion mode and at −4500 V in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as curtain gas (setting of 10, arbitrary units) and as collision gas (set to “high”). The declustering potential was set at 100 V in the positive ion mode and at −100V in the negative ion mode. The collision energy in ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses were optimized according to the desired experiments. The method to detect the proper precursor ions and neutral losses derived from phospholipids in ESI-MS/MS analysis was described previously (35Houjou T. Yamatani K. Nakanishi H. Imagawa M. Shimizu T.

For the assay of oxygenated lipids using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, tissues were soaked in ten volumes of methanol and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. After overnight incubation at −20 °C, H2O was added to the mixture to give a final methanol concentration of 10% (v/v). d8-Labeled arachidonic acid (AA) (Cayman Chemicals) was added as an internal standard. The oxygenated lipids in the supernatant were extracted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters). The LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed using a 4000Q-TRAP quadrupole linear ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) with ACQUITY Ultra Performance LC® (Waters). The sample was applied to the ACQUITY UPLCTM BEH C18 column (1 × 150-mm inner diameter, 0.17-μm particle) and then to ESI-MS/MS analysis. The samples injected by the autosampler (10 μl) were directly introduced and separated by a step gradient with mobile phase A (water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile:methanol = 4:1 v/v) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min and a column temperature of 30 °C. The specific detection of individual lipids was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (37Sato H. Taketomi Y. Isogai Y. Miki Y. Yamamoto K. Masuda S. Hosono T. Arata S. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T.

Tissues were soaked in 10 volumes of methanol and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. After the homogenates were kept on −20 °C overnight, H2O was added to the reaction mix (final concentration, 10% (v/v) methanol). The lipids were extracted by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges using [3H]AA (GE Healthcare) as a calibrator of the sample recovery. After the columns were equilibrated with H2O and methanol, the methanol extracts were applied to Sep-Pac C18 columns. The columns were sequentially washed with H2O and then with hexane followed by elution of the bound lipids with methyl formate. The contents of PGE2 in skin were quantified with a PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical). Total RNAs were isolated from the skin of PLA2G10-Tg and control mice (n = 4) or Pla2g10+/+ and Pla2g10−/− mice (n = 4) at P25 by use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cRNA targets were synthesized and hybridized with Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent). The array slides were scanned with a Laser Scanner GenePix 4000B (Molecular Devices) using appropriate gains on the photomultiplier to obtain the highest intensity without saturation. Gene expression values were background corrected and normalized using the GenePix software (Molecular Devices). Mouse skin samples (P8) were embedded in OCT compound, sectioned (10-μm thick), mounted on a DIRECTOR LMD slide (AMR Inc.), fixed with cold ethanol/acetic acid (19:1, v/v) for 5 min, and stained with toluidine blue. Laser-capture microdissection was performed on cryosections using Leica LMD6000 system (Leica). mRNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) from the isolated hair follicle or epidermis fraction. Quantitative RT-PCR reactions were carried out using TaqMan Gene Expression system as described above. For lipid analyses, lipids were extracted from the hair follicle or epidermis fraction microdissected from replicate skin sections without fixation with ethanol/acetic acid solution. An aliquot of the extracted lipids was subjected to PGE2 enzyme immunoassay or to ESI-MS for quantification of phospholipids. The contents of PGE2 in the microdissected samples were normalized with those of phospholipids as described previously (38Ikeda K. Taguchi R. Rapid Commun.

After a brief wash with PBS, post-fixation with 2% OsO4− in PBS was carried out for 1 h followed by gradual dehydration with ethanol. The skin was embedded in Poly/Bed812 EPON (Polyscience). Thin serial sections (100-nm thick) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead acetate. Ultrastructures of the samples were examined at 80 kV with a JEM-1010 (Jeol Ltd.). Data were statistically evaluated by unpaired Student's t test at a significance level of p < 0.05. We previously established PLA2G10-Tg mice, in which the majority of overexpressed sPLA2-X protein existed as an inactive zymogen in most tissues (29Ohtsuki M. Taketomi Y. Arata S. Masuda S.

RT-PCR of dorsal skin from control and Tg mice at postnatal day 25 (P25) revealed that mRNA for sPLA2-X was endogenously expressed in control skin at a trace level (for details, see below), and it was markedly increased in Tg skin (Fig. 1A). Although PLA2G10-Tg mice appeared normal up to postnatal day 10 (Fig. 1B (P10)), complete loss of coat hairs was observed at 20–30 days (Fig. 1B (P20-P30)). Most Tg pups also had no or few whiskers (Fig. 1C), and their bald skin was wrinkled (Fig. 1, B (P20-P30) and D). After this hairless period, new pelage hairs appeared by P42 and were sustained for more than 1 year. After 18 weeks of age, however, the fur of PLA2G10-Tg mice appeared matted, lusterless, coarse, and ungroomed (Fig. 1B (18W)). Some older mice began to show thinning fur and small patchy areas of hair loss, particularly between the ears and on the back, where epidermal thickening was histologically obvious (data not shown). No apparent histological abnormality was found in various tissues of PLA2G10-Tg mice as they aged, including lung, liver, kidney, heart, small intestine, and colon (supplemental Fig. S1). Nevertheless, because the severe skin abnormalities in PLA2G10-Tg mice were particularly evident during P15-P30, in subsequent studies we focused on detailed phenotypic analyses of Tg mouse skin at this early stage. The remarkable skin-specific phenotype of PLA2G10-Tg mice during the early period of life suggests that the proteolytic activation of sPLA2-X should have temporally occurred in the skin. In fact, a PLA2 enzymatic assay conducted using 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-PE as a substrate demonstrated that the activity in PLA2G10-Tg skin was increased 3- and 6-fold relative to that in control skin (reflecting the combined activities of various intrinsically present PLA2 enzymes) at P0 and P10, respectively (Fig. 1E). After reaching a peak value around P10, the PLA2 activity in Tg skin declined gradually to a level only <2-fold higher than that in control skin by 16 weeks. When skin homogenates were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-human sPLA2-X monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-human sPLA2-X polyclonal antibody, three major bands with molecular masses of 11, 14, and 20 kDa as well as broad 21∼29-kDa bands were detected in PLA2G10-Tg skin, whereas they were undetectable in control skin (because mouse monoclonal anti-human sPLA2-X antibody failed to pull down endogenous mouse sPLA2-X) (Fig. 1F). Overall, the expression of immunoreactive sPLA2-X proteins in Tg skin was higher during P0–P10 than during P25–42 (Fig. 1F). As evaluated from the molecular sizes of authentic mature, zymogen and glycosylated forms of sPLA2-X (sPLA2-X overexpressed in PC12 cells (22Masuda S. Murakami M. Takanezawa Y. Aoki J. Arai H.

https://openalex.org/W2124405153,"Cells localize (polarize) internal components to specific locations in response to external signals such as spatial gradients. For example, yeast cells form a mating projection toward the source of mating pheromone. There are specific challenges associated with cell polarization including amplification of shallow external gradients of ligand to produce steep internal gradients of protein components (e.g. localized distribution), response over a broad range of ligand concentrations, and tracking of moving signal sources. In this work, we investigated the tradeoffs among these performance objectives using a generic model that captures the basic spatial dynamics of polarization in yeast cells, which are small. We varied the positive feedback, cooperativity, and diffusion coefficients in the model to explore the nature of this tradeoff. Increasing the positive feedback gain resulted in better amplification, but also produced multiple steady-states and hysteresis that prevented the tracking of directional changes of the gradient. Feedforward/feedback coincidence detection in the positive feedback loop and multi-stage amplification both improved tracking with only a modest loss of amplification. Surprisingly, we found that introducing lateral surface diffusion increased the robustness of polarization and collapsed the multiple steady-states to a single steady-state at the cost of a reduction in polarization. Finally, in a more mechanistic model of yeast cell polarization, a surface diffusion coefficient between 0.01 and 0.001 µm2/s produced the best polarization performance, and this range is close to the measured value. The model also showed good gradient-sensitivity and dynamic range. This research is significant because it provides an in-depth analysis of the performance tradeoffs that confront biological systems that sense and respond to chemical spatial gradients, proposes strategies for balancing this tradeoff, highlights the critical role of lateral diffusion of proteins in the membrane on the robustness of polarization, and furnishes a framework for future spatial models of yeast cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2016050551,"This work shows that the recently described Escherichia coli BtuE peroxidase protects the bacterium against oxidative stress that is generated by tellurite and by other reactive oxygen species elicitors (ROS). Cells lacking btuE (ΔbtuE) displayed higher sensitivity to K2TeO3 and other oxidative stress-generating agents than did the isogenic, parental, wild-type strain. They also exhibited increased levels of cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species, oxidized proteins, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and lipoperoxides. E. coli ΔbtuE that was exposed to tellurite or H2O2 did not show growth changes relative to wild type cells either in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Nevertheless, the elimination of btuE from cells deficient in catalases/peroxidases (Hpx−) resulted in impaired growth and resistance to these toxicants only in aerobic conditions, suggesting that BtuE is involved in the defense against oxidative damage. Genetic complementation of E. coli ΔbtuE restored toxicant resistance to levels exhibited by the wild type strain. As expected, btuE overexpression resulted in decreased amounts of oxidative damage products as well as in lower transcriptional levels of the oxidative stress-induced genes ibpA, soxS and katG."

Although it has been established that the lateral amygdala is a key site for encoding associative fear memory, it is currently unclear whether the spatial distribution of neurons encoding a given memory is random or stable. Here we used spatial principal components analysis to quantify the topography of activated neurons, in a select region of the lateral amygdala, from rat brains encoding a Pavlovian conditioned fear memory. Our results demonstrate a stable, spatially patterned organization of amygdala neurons are activated during the formation of a Pavlovian conditioned fear memory. We suggest that this stable neuronal assembly constitutes a spatial dimension of the engram."
https://openalex.org/W2010499596,"Background Infection with multiple CMV strains is common in immunocompromised hosts, but its occurrence in normal hosts has not been well-studied. Methods We analyzed CMV strains longitudinally in women who acquired CMV while enrolled in a CMV glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine trial. Sequencing of four variable genes was performed in samples collected from seroconversion and up to 34 months thereafter. Results 199 cultured isolates from 53 women and 65 original fluids from a subset of 19 women were sequenced. 51 women were infected with one strain each without evidence for genetic drift; only two women shed multiple strains. Genetic variability among strains increased with the number of sequenced genetic loci. Nevertheless, 13 of 53 women proved to be infected with an identical CMV strain based on sequencing at all four variable genes. CMV vaccine did not alter the degree of genetic diversity amongst strains. Conclusions Primary CMV infection in healthy women nearly always involves shedding of one strain that remains stable over time. Immunization with CMVgB-1 vaccine strain is not selective against specific strains. Although 75% of women harbored their unique strain, or a strain shared with only one other woman, 25% shared a single common strain, suggesting that this predominant strain with a particular combination of genetic loci is advantageous in this large urban area."
https://openalex.org/W2038507974,"The Père David's deer is a highly inbred, but recovered, species, making it interesting to consider their adaptive molecular evolution from an immunological perspective. Prior to this study, genomic sequencing was the only method for isolating all functional MHC genes within a certain species. Here, we report a novel protocol for isolating MHC class II loci from a species, and its use to investigate the adaptive evolution of this endangered deer at the level of multi-locus haplotypes. This protocol was designated “HURRAH” based on its various steps and used to estimate the total number of MHC class II loci. We confirmed the validity of this novel protocol in the giant panda and then used it to examine the Père David's deer. Our results revealed that the Père David's deer possesses nine MHC class II loci and therefore has more functional MHC class II loci than the eight genome-sequenced mammals for which full MHC data are currently available. This could potentially account at least in part for the strong survival ability of this species in the face of severe bottlenecking. The results from the HURRAH protocol also revealed that: (1) All of the identified MHC class II loci were monomorphic at their antigen-binding regions, although DRA was dimorphic at its cytoplasmic tail; and (2) these genes constituted two asymmetric functional MHC class II multi-locus haplotypes: DRA1*01 ∼ DRB1 ∼ DRB3 ∼ DQA1 ∼ DQB2 (H1) and DRA1*02 ∼ DRB2 ∼ DRB4 ∼ DQA2 ∼ DQB1 (H2). The latter finding indicates that the current members of the deer species have lost the powerful ancestral MHC class II haplotypes of nine or more loci, and have instead fixed two relatively weak haplotypes containing five genes. As a result, the Père David's deer are currently at risk for increased susceptibility to infectious pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2046289018,"Background MAP4K3 is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that has being found in connection with several signalling pathways, including the Imd, EGFR, TORC1 and JNK modules, in different organisms and experimental assays. We have analyzed the consequences of changing the levels of MAP4K3 expression in the development of the Drosophila wing, a convenient model system to characterize gene function during epithelial development. Methodology and Principal Findings Using loss-of-function mutants and over-expression conditions we find that MAP4K3 activity affects cell growth and viability in the Drosophila wing. These requirements are related to the modulation of the TORC1 and JNK signalling pathways, and are best detected when the larvae grow in a medium with low protein concentration (TORC1) or are exposed to irradiation (JNK). We also show that MAP4K3 display strong genetic interactions with different components of the InR/Tor signalling pathway, and can interact directly with the GTPases RagA and RagC and with the multi-domain kinase Tor. Conclusions and Significance We suggest that MAP4K3 has two independent functions during wing development, one related to the activation of the JNK pathway in response to stress and other in the assembling or activation of the TORC1 complex, being critical to modulate cellular responses to changes in nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W2090116519,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are important regulators of cell proliferation. Here we identified a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, ovarian tumor domain-containing 6B (OTUD-6B). Mutation of the conserved Cys residue abolished its deubiquitinating activity in vitro. Otud-6b expression was induced with cytokine stimulation in both mouse Ba/F3 cells and primary B lymphocytes followed a rapid decrease. This rapid decrease was partially facilitated by tristetraprolin (TTP) destabilization of Otud-6b mRNA through AU-rich motifs. Enforced expression of OTUD-6B in Ba/F3 cells could block cell proliferation by arresting cells in G1 phase. In addition, cyclin D2 level was down-regulated when OTUD-6B WT was overexpressed. Therefore, down-regulation of Otud-6b expression after prolonged cytokine stimulation may be required for cell proliferation in B lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2029273827,"The visualization of large volumes of data is a computationally challenging task that often promises rewarding new insights. There is great potential in the application of new algorithms and models from combinatorial optimisation. Datasets often contain ""hidden regularities"" and a combined identification and visualization method should reveal these structures and present them in a way that helps analysis. While several methodologies exist, including those that use non-linear optimization algorithms, severe limitations exist even when working with only a few hundred objects.We present a new data visualization approach (QAPgrid) that reveals patterns of similarities and differences in large datasets of objects for which a similarity measure can be computed. Objects are assigned to positions on an underlying square grid in a two-dimensional space. We use the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) as a mathematical model to provide an objective function for assignment of objects to positions on the grid. We employ a Memetic Algorithm (a powerful metaheuristic) to tackle the large instances of this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, and we show its performance on the visualization of real data sets.Overall, the results show that QAPgrid algorithm is able to produce a layout that represents the relationships between objects in the data set. Furthermore, it also represents the relationships between clusters that are feed into the algorithm. We apply the QAPgrid on the 84 Indo-European languages instance, producing a near-optimal layout. Next, we produce a layout of 470 world universities with an observed high degree of correlation with the score used by the Academic Ranking of World Universities compiled in the The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Academic Ranking of World Universities without the need of an ad hoc weighting of attributes. Finally, our Gene Ontology-based study on Saccharomyces cerevisiae fully demonstrates the scalability and precision of our method as a novel alternative tool for functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2006599744,"CD8(+) T cells provide broad immunity to viruses, because they are able to recognize all types of viral proteins. Therefore, the development of vaccines capable of inducing long-lived memory CD8(+) T cells is desired to prevent diseases, especially those for which no vaccines currently exist. However, in designing CD8(+) T cell vaccines, the role of CD4(+) T cells in the induction and maintenance of memory CD8(+) T cells remains uncertain. In the present study, the necessity or not of CD4(+) T cells in the induction and maintenance of memory CD8(+) T cells was investigated in mice immunized with liposome-coupled CTL epitope peptides. When OVA-derived CTL epitope peptides were chemically coupled to the surfaces of liposomes and inoculated into mice, both primary and secondary CTL responses were successfully induced. The results were further confirmed in CD4(+) T cell-eliminated mice, suggesting that CD4(+) T cells were not required for the generation of memory CD8(+) T cells in the case of immunization with liposome-coupled peptides. Thus, surface-linked liposomal antigens, capable of inducing long-lived memory CD8(+) T cells without the contribution of CD4(+) T cells, might be applicable for the development of vaccines to prevent viral infection, especially for those viruses that evade humoral immunity by varying their surface proteins, such as influenza viruses, HIV, HCV, SARS coronaviruses, and Ebola viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2060066670,"Cell migration is associated with the dynamic protrusion of a thin actin-based cytoskeletal extension at the cell front, which has been shown to consist of two different substructures, the leading lamellipodium and the subsequent lamellum. While the formation of the lamellipodium is increasingly well understood, organizational principles underlying the emergence of the lamellum are just beginning to be unraveled. We report here on a 1D mathematical model which describes the reaction-diffusion processes of a polarized actin network in steady state, and reproduces essential characteristics of the lamellipodium-lamellum system. We observe a steep gradient in filament lengths at the protruding edge, a local depolymerization maximum a few microns behind the edge, as well as a differential dominance of the network destabilizer ADF/cofilin and the stabilizer tropomyosin. We identify simple and robust organizational principles giving rise to the derived network characteristics, uncoupled from the specifics of any molecular implementation, and thus plausibly valid across cell types. An analysis of network length dependence on physico-chemical system parameters implies that to limit array treadmilling to cellular dimensions, network growth has to be truncated by mechanisms other than aging-induced depolymerization, e.g., by myosin-associated network dissociation at the transition to the cell body. Our work contributes to the analytical understanding of the cytoskeletal extension's bisection into lamellipodium and lamellum and sheds light on how cells organize their molecular machinery to achieve motility."
https://openalex.org/W1997689884,"Background While the pneumococcal protein conjugate vaccines reduce the incidence in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), serotype replacement remains a major concern. Thus, serotype-independent protection with vaccines targeting virulence genes, such as PspA, have been pursued. PspA is comprised of diverse clades that arose through recombination. Therefore, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)-defined clones could conceivably include strains from multiple PspA clades. As a result, a method is needed which can both monitor the long-term epidemiology of the pneumococcus among a large number of isolates, and analyze vaccine-candidate genes, such as pspA, for mutations and recombination events that could result in ‘vaccine escape’ strains. Methodology We developed a resequencing array consisting of five conserved and six variable genes to characterize 72 pneumococcal strains. The phylogenetic analysis of the 11 concatenated genes was performed with the MrBayes program, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis with the DNA Sequence Polymorphism program (DnaSP), and the recombination event analysis with the recombination detection package (RDP). Results The phylogenetic analysis correlated with MLST, and identified clonal strains with unique PspA clades. The DnaSP analysis correlated with the serotype-specific diversity detected using MLST. Serotypes associated with more than one ST complex had a larger degree of sequence polymorphism than a serotype associated with one ST complex. The RDP analysis confirmed the high frequency of recombination events in the pspA gene. Conclusions The phylogenetic tree correlated with MLST, and detected multiple PspA clades among clonal strains. The genetic diversity of the strains and the frequency of recombination events in the mosaic gene, pspA were accurately assessed using the DnaSP and RDP programs, respectively. These data provide proof-of-concept that resequencing arrays could play an important role within research and clinical laboratories in both monitoring the molecular epidemiology of the pneumococcus and detecting ‘vaccine escape’ strains among vaccine-candidate genes."
